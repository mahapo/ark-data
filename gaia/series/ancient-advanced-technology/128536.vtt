00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.486 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.486 --> 00:01:09.310 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>The idea that some
ancient civilizations

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.460 align:middle line:84%
had high technology
and engineering, much

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.280 align:middle line:90%
as we do today, fascinated me.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.220 align:middle line:84%
So I enlisted the help of
British Engineer Christopher

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.230 align:middle line:90%
Dodd.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.990 align:middle line:84%
But before we met in
Egypt, I visited him

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.800 align:middle line:84%
at the Danville
Metal Stamping plant.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:35.230 align:middle line:90%


00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.670 align:middle line:10%
We've moved beyond
now what it takes

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.830 align:middle line:10%
to actually cut something.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.042 align:middle line:10%
How were they checking it, how
were they guiding that tool?

00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:47.740 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously,
they had to have

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.430 align:middle line:90%
had some metrology instruments.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.340 align:middle line:84%
They have to engage
metrology instruments

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.170 align:middle line:84%
to be able to verify that they
were maintaining parallelism

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.300 align:middle line:84%
between this surface and the
opposing surface like that.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.729 align:middle line:84%
And you just don't get that
by line of sight or saying,

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.500 align:middle line:84%
oh, we'll get Joe
on the job today

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.060 align:middle line:84%
because he's got
really good eyesight.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, see, I'd
be good with some

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.850 align:middle line:84%
of that in small grooves and
stuff like you're saying there.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.800 align:middle line:90%
But that one--

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean and so basically,
the conclusion

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.290 align:middle line:84%
on these artifacts and a
lot of the other artifacts

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.920 align:middle line:84%
that we're looking
at is they were using

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.270 align:middle line:90%
tools that no longer exist.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.050 align:middle line:84%
They're not in the
archaeological record anymore,

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.120 align:middle line:90%
they do not exist anywhere.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And so then the
question, is, OK what

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.720 align:middle line:84%
are the minimum requirements,
what's the minimum tooling

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.780 align:middle line:84%
level or technology, if you
were, to be able to do this?

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is the most striking
example, where people just go,

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.110 align:middle line:90%
whoa.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Because for you as an engineer
and also an expert machinist,

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.560 align:middle line:84%
inside corners mean
something to you, right?

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>>Sure.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.900 align:middle line:90%


00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.300 align:middle line:84%
5/32 of an inch inside corner
on those boxes, top to bottom.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, that photograph
is a little blurred.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, that's not two
pieces coming together?

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>>That's just a square
granite fill, solid block,

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.736 align:middle line:90%
consistent all the way down.

00:03:33.736 --> 00:03:34.536 align:middle line:90%
>>Mm-hm.

00:03:34.536 --> 00:03:39.080 align:middle line:90%


00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>>And why would they
really have to be so

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.160 align:middle line:90%
precise is what blows my mind.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>>Now, this is how they would--

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.990 align:middle line:84%
conventionally, they
would say this is how

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.110 align:middle line:90%
they built something like that.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.590 align:middle line:10%
And then for squaring
something off,

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.170 align:middle line:10%
of course, the way
a carpenter will

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.880 align:middle line:10%
swear to frame, obviously
measure from corner to corner,

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:06.478 align:middle line:10%
which is low tech compared
to what we have here.

00:04:06.478 --> 00:04:09.900 align:middle line:90%


00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And you verify that
with a piece of string.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.194 align:middle line:84%
I mean that kind of
precision you can't

00:04:15.194 --> 00:04:17.647 align:middle line:90%
verify with a piece of string.

00:04:17.647 --> 00:04:18.980 align:middle line:90%
So that's what we're faced with.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.560 align:middle line:90%
And there's not just one there.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not like they
got lucky on one box.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.690 align:middle line:84%
There's over 20 of
them in this facility

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.290 align:middle line:84%
down in the rock tunnels
near Saqqara in Egypt.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.950 align:middle line:90%


00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.280 align:middle line:84%
>>So I'm back to they had, like
you mentioned earlier, they

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.250 align:middle line:84%
had hundreds and hundreds of
people spending hours and days

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.040 align:middle line:84%
and months and years
doing this stuff.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.430 align:middle line:84%
>>But let me take you back
to the historical information

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.770 align:middle line:90%
on the serapeum, OK?

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.800 align:middle line:84%
You know what they were supposed
to be using for those boxes?

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.690 align:middle line:84%
They were burying the apis bull,
which was a revered animal, OK?

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.020 align:middle line:84%
The apis bull's lifespan
was supposed to be 20 years

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and they say that when an
apis bull was selected,

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.340 align:middle line:84%
they would stop
building his burial

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.580 align:middle line:90%
tomb-- this is Egyptologists.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>>Is that what they're saying?

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>So 28 years.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:21.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, they've also
done some time studies

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.630 align:middle line:84%
on how fast they can
remove granite using

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.850 align:middle line:90%
the ancient Egyptian tools, OK?

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.480 align:middle line:84%
Now you use the
material removal rate

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:39.300 align:middle line:84%
of the old methods and the
bull's long gone by the time,

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.450 align:middle line:84%
using the maximum
number of workers

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.950 align:middle line:84%
that you can actually
get in the work site.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And you're not talking 28 years,
you're talking 50 plus years.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's just roughing
the bloody thing out,

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.950 align:middle line:84%
that's not even
[INAUDIBLE] it finished.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.310 align:middle line:84%
>>So now we're talking
power tools, right?

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>>OK, right.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.150 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>From what I'm seeing there,
I'm looking at that picture

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.400 align:middle line:90%
and there's tool marks on it.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.530 align:middle line:84%
Anything we machine,
though most of what

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.450 align:middle line:84%
we machine there are
tool marks, you just

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.500 align:middle line:84%
don't see them because
they're so minute.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.990 align:middle line:84%
But also because
the feed of the tool

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.270 align:middle line:90%
controls that surface finish.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.870 align:middle line:84%
If you plow down through a
piece of any kind of material,

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.550 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
a rougher surface.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.790 align:middle line:84%
If you go slower, the
feed rate's slower,

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.960 align:middle line:84%
the RPMs are
faster, you're going

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.400 align:middle line:84%
to have a nicer,
smoother finish.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.650 align:middle line:84%
So this blows me out of
the water a little bit.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Because of those tool
marks, that's telling me

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.590 align:middle line:84%
they wasted no time
cutting through this thing.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:47.390 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>>Now I've been talking
lapping and all this.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>>That's a fade rate of
100,000 per revolution, which

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.890 align:middle line:84%
it would be difficult to
achieve that in aluminum

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.790 align:middle line:84%
using carbide tools,
let alone in granite.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:00.930 align:middle line:90%
And

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>>So basically, what
you're looking at

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.970 align:middle line:84%
is something that
is only explained

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:13.110 align:middle line:84%
if you consider non-conventional
types of machining.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.520 align:middle line:84%
>>My first impression
was with very little

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.230 align:middle line:84%
historical background that
all this was done by hand.

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:26.810 align:middle line:84%
It was lapping and chiseling and
took many hours, days, weeks.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.430 align:middle line:90%
It took a large amount of time.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:36.300 align:middle line:84%
But after looking at some of
the granite that I've seen,

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.870 align:middle line:84%
I question if it was even
feasible to do by hand.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of leads
me into directions

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.790 align:middle line:84%
of thinking about the
application of machine tools,

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.430 align:middle line:84%
for lack of a better,
some time ago.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:58.660 align:middle line:90%


00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>>I think all the evidence
in Egypt indicators

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:07.910 align:middle line:84%
that there was a high
civilization in pre-history.

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we look at the
tools and the technology

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.160 align:middle line:84%
available to the
ancient Egypt, we

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.030 align:middle line:84%
have to consider
that the culture that

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.040 align:middle line:84%
built the pyramids, that built
all these other monuments

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.800 align:middle line:84%
was far older because
the tools do not exist

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.940 align:middle line:90%
for that particular epoch.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.270 align:middle line:90%


00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.550 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what
site you go to in Egypt--

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.755 align:middle line:84%
whether it's Abu
Gorab, Abu Rawash,

00:08:32.755 --> 00:08:37.049 align:middle line:84%
whether you go into the
temples in Upper Egypt--

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:42.159 align:middle line:84%
there is always some
signature of technology.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And that signature is
actually the machine tools

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.980 align:middle line:84%
that were used and the marks
that they left in the stone.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And those marks and not
just the cutting marks,

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:56.290 align:middle line:90%
but the geometry of the stone.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:59.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
an exaggeration

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:04.870 align:middle line:84%
to assert that a culture
that has the genius

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:12.640 align:middle line:84%
to devise these wonderful
miracles of engineering

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.400 align:middle line:84%
limited that expertise
and genius with just

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.230 align:middle line:90%
the design of the product.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:22.140 align:middle line:84%
They have had to have had
the tools to match the job.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:49.880 align:middle line:90%


00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.630 align:middle line:84%
>>According to Chris'
theory, the ancients not only

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:56.121 align:middle line:84%
had electricity, but they
had power tools as well.

00:09:56.121 --> 00:10:01.950 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Chris shares my interest
in ancient technology,

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:07.460 align:middle line:84%
so I had him take me
around Giza for a day

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.640 align:middle line:84%
to look at things from an
engineer's perspective.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:22.390 align:middle line:90%


00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:24.380 align:middle line:84%
One of the great
mysteries of the past

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:28.090 align:middle line:84%
is the enigma of the colossal
cities of the ancients.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:32.020 align:middle line:84%
How were they able to quarry
and move these giant granite

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:32.820 align:middle line:90%
blocks?

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:38.420 align:middle line:90%


00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Many of the stones are extremely
hard and difficult to cut,

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:44.610 align:middle line:90%
such as basalt and granite.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:48.350 align:middle line:84%
How did the Egyptians build
these complex geometric

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:49.820 align:middle line:90%
wonders?

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Did they use brute force or
some kind of high technology?

00:10:54.190 --> 00:11:01.020 align:middle line:90%


00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.670 align:middle line:84%
So what we've found
here on the Giza Plateau

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:10.430 align:middle line:84%
is one of these granites
blocks that's been contoured.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:16.410 align:middle line:84%
Chris is going to check it
with his precision tools

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:23.370 align:middle line:84%
to see if there's some
indication of modern machining

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.650 align:middle line:90%
techniques here on the granite.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>>What we have here is a prime
example of modern machining.

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:39.660 align:middle line:84%
We have a contour, not a true
radius, but it's a contour.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.800 align:middle line:90%
And the contour is precise.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:49.410 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
the surface gauge,

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.040 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that
there's very little

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:56.130 align:middle line:84%
light that's showing between
the interface and the granite.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:12:02.000 align:middle line:84%
The gauge is accurate
to within 1/10000

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.860 align:middle line:84%
of an inch, which 1/20 the
thickness of a human hair.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>>Wow.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.960 align:middle line:90%


00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>>It's very uniform.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>>It's very uniform.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:17.940 align:middle line:84%
There's some
imperfections, but probably

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:25.470 align:middle line:84%
if I was to estimate
how precise it was,

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:31.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean I would say from
5/1000 of an inch, which

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.790 align:middle line:90%
is quite remarkable really.

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:34.390 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.950 align:middle line:90%
Over that entire contour.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:44.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, the features of this
stone, you have this radius

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:48.180 align:middle line:90%
here that the blends into--

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:52.350 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like it goes
straight into the blend radius

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:53.460 align:middle line:90%
at the face.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:55.900 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:59.620 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, I mean
you look at this

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.870 align:middle line:84%
and you can say there's no way
you could turn it on a lathe

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.260 align:middle line:90%
to achieve a true radius.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:10.080 align:middle line:84%
So they had to have had
a means of replicating

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:15.900 align:middle line:84%
that contour with precision over
the entire length of the block.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:16.700 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.050 align:middle line:90%
And how would you do that?

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:22.150 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, today we would do
it with like a CNC machine

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:26.860 align:middle line:84%
or in the old days in
machine shops we'd do it

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.550 align:middle line:84%
with a profiler, where
you would actually

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:33.120 align:middle line:84%
follow a template
with a rotating

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.540 align:middle line:90%
tool or a vibrating tool.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>And continue
that, step it over

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:47.280 align:middle line:84%
and continue that contour with
precision right to the end.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is where it
becomes interesting

00:13:52.100 --> 00:14:00.050 align:middle line:84%
because you need to get a
really good shot of this corner.

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:00.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:07.840 align:middle line:84%
So now what we have here
is what we recognize

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.185 align:middle line:90%
in modern manufacturing--

00:14:11.185 --> 00:14:14.710 align:middle line:84%
and actually, it's an
engineered or design feature--

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:21.660 align:middle line:84%
if you want to marry or fit
an object with a sharp corner

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:29.460 align:middle line:84%
with a face and also be able
to use a tool to create this

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.690 align:middle line:84%
that has a greater
rigidity and stability.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:36.960 align:middle line:84%
So you would use a larger
tool, and this is done with

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:41.250 align:middle line:84%
like a ball radius
tool, endmill.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:45.870 align:middle line:84%
So this radius would have
been done with a ball endmill,

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:51.450 align:middle line:84%
or what we call a ball endmill,
where the bottom of the tool

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:58.780 align:middle line:84%
is actually shaped like
a ball, half a ball.

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.580 align:middle line:84%
But the really
interesting part of that

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:05.060 align:middle line:84%
is this relief, the
way it comes down.

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>>The undercutting and
this groove right here.

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:08.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>>And as you can see, you
have the larger radius here

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:15.540 align:middle line:84%
but anything that
would fit up against it

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.200 align:middle line:90%
could have a smaller radius.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:22.620 align:middle line:90%
So that is a unique feature.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:28.595 align:middle line:84%
Now, the other thing is
the size of the radius.

00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:33.000 align:middle line:84%
So that is going to
require another tool.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>So if you were just bashing
this out with a dolorite ball,

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:42.640 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't have this
undercutting like that.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.080 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, actually, they
wouldn't have bashed this out

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.004 align:middle line:90%
and achieved this.

00:15:46.004 --> 00:15:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>>They could never have bashed
this out and achieved this.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:49.220 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:54.490 align:middle line:90%


00:15:54.490 --> 00:16:00.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to melt
this forming wax

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:02.300 align:middle line:90%
and press it into the corner.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:12.560 align:middle line:90%


00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:18.710 align:middle line:90%
And actually, that looks good.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:23.360 align:middle line:84%
I'd actually done that
previously so that I already

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.550 align:middle line:90%
had the shape of the radius.

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:25.480 align:middle line:90%
>>So OK.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Now you've got a wax
form of the radius

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.810 align:middle line:84%
and you can use that to check
the consistency of the radius.

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>>Correct.

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And so if you check this
radius, even in this corner,

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:47.210 align:middle line:84%
OK, where you have one,
two, three surfaces actually

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:58.750 align:middle line:84%
meeting, and if I slide
it along that radius,

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:02.970 align:middle line:84%
we get pretty much
the same radius

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:09.369 align:middle line:84%
except for this flat part
because evidently, it came out.

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:12.200 align:middle line:84%
There's a-- I think it must
be a larger radius there.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:18.360 align:middle line:84%
But when you get down into
here, let me look at that.

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:23.329 align:middle line:90%


00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:24.730 align:middle line:90%
So you have a consistent radius.

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And the question is,
for something like this

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:36.640 align:middle line:84%
to get something even remotely
close to a perfect radius,

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:42.595 align:middle line:84%
it would take a tremendous
amount of time by hand.

00:17:42.595 --> 00:17:46.850 align:middle line:84%
But then to replicate that
along the length of the block.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:51.980 align:middle line:84%
>>Right, to keep it so
uniform is just so much effort

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:52.780 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>>But if you're using some
kind of machining tool,

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:57.710 align:middle line:90%
it would happen naturally.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:59.110 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't do
it any other way.

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>>That is correct.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:01.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:02.720 align:middle line:90%
That is correct.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.000 align:middle line:84%
We have the other
half-- or not a half,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.010 align:middle line:84%
but the portion of the block
that has been broken off.

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:13.359 align:middle line:84%
Evidently, they took
the end off and it

00:18:13.359 --> 00:18:14.650 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have the same features.

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:22.330 align:middle line:84%
But the basic geometry is the
same and as you slide it down,

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:29.940 align:middle line:90%
the radius is fairly close.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, there's going
to be some imperfections,

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:49.440 align:middle line:84%
but that's a precision
radius gauge, 15/32 radius.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:19:01.800 align:middle line:90%


00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.750 align:middle line:90%
See, that's incredible.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:08.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean that speaks volumes,
to find something like that

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.640 align:middle line:90%
on something so ancient.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:16.190 align:middle line:84%
I would have to use a modern
instrument or a modern gauge

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:20.290 align:middle line:90%
gauge to check its precision.

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, and would a
millimeter gauge--

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:25.071 align:middle line:84%
I mean it doesn't matter whether
it's inches or millimeters.

00:19:25.071 --> 00:19:25.870 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.410 align:middle line:84%
A radius is a
radius is a radius.

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.829 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:19:29.829 --> 00:19:30.870 align:middle line:90%
>>No, it wouldn't matter.

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:33.520 align:middle line:84%
>>When you have the whole
thing of the pyramid inch

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.850 align:middle line:84%
and them using
those measurements,

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:37.740 align:middle line:84%
but that's not what
you're looking at.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:38.540 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:42.220 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter whether it's
in inches, millimeters, cubits,

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.730 align:middle line:90%
whatever, pyramid inches.

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>The length is the length,
the radius is the radius.

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:49.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's the
consistency and accuracy.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:53.160 align:middle line:84%
This is not quantatative
by any means,

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.520 align:middle line:84%
because for that
you'd really need

00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:00.290 align:middle line:84%
to have some measuring
instruments to check

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:03.600 align:middle line:90%
coordinates on it.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Today we would use a CMM
machine, a coordinate measuring

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:13.866 align:middle line:90%
machine, and check it that way.

00:20:13.866 --> 00:20:16.740 align:middle line:90%


00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, the
other part of it

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:25.790 align:middle line:84%
is that if you had
a precise template

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:29.590 align:middle line:84%
and you fit it to
the template, then

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:33.520 align:middle line:90%
you could create that contour.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.420 align:middle line:84%
But the evidence of machine
work is his in this block,

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.780 align:middle line:90%
it's in other blocks.

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:42.830 align:middle line:84%
The mountain of evidence that
we find is in the serapeum,

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:44.910 align:middle line:90%
in those giant granite boxes.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>And it's kind of
these inside corners

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:52.650 align:middle line:84%
that are so difficult to make
without machine tools, right?

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:53.910 align:middle line:90%
Is that kind of what--

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:54.710 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:59.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is not done
with a dolorite pounder.

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>>Or a chisel, for that matter.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>>You wouldn't.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.240 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.445 align:middle line:90%
No, not a chisel.

00:21:05.445 --> 00:21:06.944 align:middle line:90%
Not a chisel.

00:21:06.944 --> 00:21:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>>So you have to
ask yourself, why

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:14.760 align:middle line:84%
would they even want some curved
piece of granite like this

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:20.380 align:middle line:84%
and then go through the
effort to actually create it?

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, that's a question
that I've asked myself.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And the obvious question
is, why would they do that?

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:32.430 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't
resemble anything

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:37.650 align:middle line:90%
that would fit with a statue.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.860 align:middle line:90%
It's obviously for construction.

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:45.490 align:middle line:84%
But in construction,
we don't work

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:47.040 align:middle line:90%
with this kind of precision.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:48.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:49.190 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>>And there's another
piece of evidence

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:54.540 align:middle line:84%
that we'll look at down
in the Valley Temple,

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.230 align:middle line:84%
on the south side of
the Valley Temple.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:22:18.230 align:middle line:90%


00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>>Of the Seven Wonders of the
Ancient World, there's only one

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:27.230 align:middle line:84%
left, and that's the
Great Pyramids of Giza.

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:28.850 align:middle line:90%
What secrets do they hold?

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:35.370 align:middle line:90%


00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And what we see here
are basalt paving blocks

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.940 align:middle line:84%
on the southern
side of the pyramid.

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:45.850 align:middle line:84%
But here we find
something curious.

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:51.580 align:middle line:84%
We see actually saw
marks here in the basalt.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, this
big saw mark here

00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:01.760 align:middle line:84%
is going far behind
inside this block.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And it would appear to
be all modern sawing,

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:10.900 align:middle line:84%
however apparently this was
done not in modern times,

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.520 align:middle line:90%
but in ancient times.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Yet looking at this
cut, it must have

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:24.949 align:middle line:84%
been made by something like a
machine tool and a diamond saw.

00:23:24.949 --> 00:23:26.490 align:middle line:84%
This is not something
that could have

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:31.280 align:middle line:84%
been made with crude tools
like a copper chisel.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.700 align:middle line:90%
Here we also see saw cuts.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:37.850 align:middle line:84%
We can see a saw cut
right here along the edge

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:41.290 align:middle line:90%
of this basalt block.

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:43.480 align:middle line:84%
This, too, appears to
be done with some kind

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.554 align:middle line:84%
of a modern tool, yet
this cut was apparently

00:23:47.554 --> 00:23:48.470 align:middle line:90%
done in ancient times.

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:52.270 align:middle line:90%


00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Were modern
construction techniques

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:56.575 align:middle line:84%
used in the building
of the pyramids

00:23:56.575 --> 00:24:02.250 align:middle line:84%
or were they built with stone
balls and copper chisels?

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, we know that there's
been cataclysms in prehistory.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.760 align:middle line:90%


00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.679 align:middle line:90%
Nobody can argue that.

00:24:11.679 --> 00:24:13.220 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
argues against it

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:18.480 align:middle line:84%
is some of the
conventional evidence,

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:22.610 align:middle line:84%
archaeological evidence, for
the time period of the pyramids.

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:27.120 align:middle line:84%
But if you look into
that time period that's

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.400 align:middle line:84%
ascribed to the building
of the pyramids,

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.410 align:middle line:90%
you don't find the tools.

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:34.920 align:middle line:90%
They're nowhere to be found.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And I believe you have
to go back earlier.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.160 align:middle line:84%
There has to be an
earlier civilization that

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:43.940 align:middle line:84%
suffered a huge cataclysm,
was totally wiped off

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:44.996 align:middle line:90%
the face of the planet.

00:24:44.996 --> 00:25:01.340 align:middle line:90%


00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>And here, this whole
is kind of like the doors

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:04.536 align:middle line:90%
at Machu Picchu.

00:25:04.536 --> 00:25:34.950 align:middle line:90%


00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:37.150 align:middle line:84%
So we're here at the
pyramid Abu Rawash.

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Not many tourists
come to this one.

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:42.670 align:middle line:84%
It's on top of a
mountain and appears

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:47.460 align:middle line:84%
to be have been buried in some
kind of landslide or something.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:26:14.130 align:middle line:90%


00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:14.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:25.140 align:middle line:84%
This is like a rock-cut ramp
right through a solid mountain

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:28.340 align:middle line:84%
and then they've lined it
with large limestone blocks.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:30.837 align:middle line:90%


00:26:30.837 --> 00:26:32.670 align:middle line:84%
It's like the entrance
here to the pyramids.

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:35.890 align:middle line:90%


00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:39.010 align:middle line:84%
One of the alternative
theories on building

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:41.860 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids, one
that's been proposed

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:45.255 align:middle line:84%
by a French chemist
named Joseph Davidovits,

00:26:45.255 --> 00:26:46.860 align:middle line:84%
is that the pyramids
were actually

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:50.480 align:middle line:84%
poured into place
and the blocks are

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:54.760 align:middle line:90%
a form of molecular concrete.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:58.310 align:middle line:84%
We know that the Egyptians
used a form of concrete,

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:00.330 align:middle line:84%
the Romans used a
form of concrete,

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:04.010 align:middle line:84%
the Mayans used a
form of concrete.

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And here at Abu Rawash,
just outside of Giza,

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:11.826 align:middle line:84%
we're also seeing the
extensive use of concrete.

00:27:11.826 --> 00:27:20.230 align:middle line:90%


00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:22.760 align:middle line:84%
There is extensive
granite down here

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:27.820 align:middle line:84%
inside the pit of the
pyramid of Abu Rawash.

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And granite is not
found here at Giza,

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.630 align:middle line:84%
so any granite is coming from
the Aswan quarries, which

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:38.010 align:middle line:90%
are 500 miles to the south.

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Chris is saying
that there must have

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:44.040 align:middle line:84%
been a roof over this
giant pit at one time.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.260 align:middle line:90%
You can see part of it.

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:51.325 align:middle line:84%
But there would have been
apparently massive stones,

00:27:51.325 --> 00:27:54.342 align:middle line:90%
lintels, spanning this roof.

00:27:54.342 --> 00:27:55.300 align:middle line:90%
It must have been huge.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:28:24.010 align:middle line:90%


00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Here's a very
interesting granite slab

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:31.030 align:middle line:90%
here at Abu Rawash.

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:33.890 align:middle line:84%
It shows all the
indications of having

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:37.660 align:middle line:90%
been cut with a modern saw.

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:42.600 align:middle line:84%
It's been smoothed and
you can see, in fact,

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.947 align:middle line:90%
the saw marks on the block.

00:28:44.947 --> 00:28:50.130 align:middle line:90%


00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:52.760 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, you know what, David?

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.350 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
features to this

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:59.650 align:middle line:84%
that really don't lend to
the theory that it was sawed.

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:00.450 align:middle line:90%
>>Really?

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>You see this cut right
here where the cut ends?

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:06.930 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:11.030 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's on a radius.

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:13.140 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:16.200 align:middle line:90%
And it goes this way.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.610 align:middle line:90%
A very large radius.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:19.566 align:middle line:90%
It's marking--

00:29:19.566 --> 00:29:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>>It's like that.

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:21.350 align:middle line:90%
Yea.

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:24.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're going to be
using a saw, you won't get that.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:25.939 align:middle line:90%
It would be impossible.

00:29:25.939 --> 00:29:26.980 align:middle line:90%
>>It would be impossible.

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:30.190 align:middle line:84%
>>If you're sawing
from here to here,

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:34.010 align:middle line:84%
regardless of what you use,
it would be impossible.

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:38.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean you whatever cut
that had a radius to it.

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:42.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, the question is, is it a
true radius, what size is it?

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, it's quite
huge because it probably

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.820 align:middle line:90%
goes out to there, the radius.

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:51.590 align:middle line:84%
>>So what kind of
a tool would you

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:56.080 align:middle line:84%
say is would be used
to cut that, then?

00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I mean I've seen similar
features in a machine shop, OK?

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>>All right.

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's another
feature on this.

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:15.150 align:middle line:84%
If you have like a milling
cutter, a very large milling

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:18.920 align:middle line:84%
cutter, and it's
tilted on an angle,

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:23.983 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to cut a
large radius on the surface.

00:30:23.983 --> 00:30:24.783 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:30:24.783 --> 00:30:27.977 align:middle line:90%


00:30:27.977 --> 00:30:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Actually, you're cutting
more of an ellipse.

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:34.020 align:middle line:84%
But if you are covering
the area enough,

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.910 align:middle line:84%
then it's going to
appear like a radius.

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:44.270 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there are calculations
used in tool and die-making

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:48.770 align:middle line:84%
that give you the
angle, the tilt,

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:55.070 align:middle line:84%
of your tool associated with the
diameter of the tool that will

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:56.600 align:middle line:90%
give you a specific radius.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.200 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is
remarkable because it

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.230 align:middle line:90%
has all those features.

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, OK, forgetting
that, if we come back

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:15.631 align:middle line:84%
to this particular object, what
tool actually created this?

00:31:15.631 --> 00:31:18.860 align:middle line:90%


00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:20.200 align:middle line:90%
That, to me, is--

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.280 align:middle line:90%


00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:26.676 align:middle line:84%
I don't know of any primitive
method that would create that.

00:31:26.676 --> 00:31:30.900 align:middle line:90%


00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:34.590 align:middle line:84%
We have a feature
right here where

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:40.220 align:middle line:84%
evidently, it came
into a particular area

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:44.130 align:middle line:90%
and then it went off track.

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:48.430 align:middle line:84%
So they lifted it up and
proceeded on because you've

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:50.190 align:middle line:90%
got a ridge there.

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:50.990 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>>Right?

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:52.650 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:53.863 align:middle line:90%
You can see it.

00:31:53.863 --> 00:31:54.710 align:middle line:90%
I feel it.

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:55.670 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:58.030 align:middle line:90%
>>So they're starting to cut--

00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>>But the interesting
thing is when

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:03.830 align:middle line:84%
you look at the
striations on the block,

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:08.210 align:middle line:84%
because you can see
them right here,

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:15.510 align:middle line:84%
it does appear that it was
a tool that was radiused.

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:23.050 align:middle line:84%
Of course, one could
argue that they

00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:25.950 align:middle line:84%
used a saw that
was somehow curved

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:28.810 align:middle line:84%
and had one fellow on one side
and another fellow on the other

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:30.435 align:middle line:84%
and they were just
doing this business.

00:32:30.435 --> 00:32:33.260 align:middle line:90%


00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:40.570 align:middle line:84%
But the problem with that is how
did it create this curve here?

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And so if we take
this straight edge,

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:49.510 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that there's
a light in the center.

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:51.090 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:53.300 align:middle line:90%
So it's slightly dished out.

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:54.440 align:middle line:90%
>>It's slightly dished out.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And as you track
across the surface,

00:32:58.010 --> 00:33:01.098 align:middle line:84%
that light does not go away,
nor does it change much.

00:33:01.098 --> 00:33:09.050 align:middle line:90%


00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:10.820 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>>So I mean in the mainstream
Egyptology explanations

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:23.350 align:middle line:84%
of bashing this out
with a stone using

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:27.440 align:middle line:84%
copper chisels, that would
be impossible in your mind

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.909 align:middle line:90%
to create this?

00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, you wouldn't
create something

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:34.020 align:middle line:90%
like that bashing it out.

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:36.850 align:middle line:84%
There have been some
experimental tests.

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:39.030 align:middle line:84%
There has been
experimental work done

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:45.660 align:middle line:84%
where they have cut granite
using a copper saw and hand.

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:50.260 align:middle line:84%
But to the extent that they
would actually create something

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:52.970 align:middle line:90%
like this is quite remarkable.

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, look
at the size of it.

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:57.420 align:middle line:90%
That's quite a large saw.

00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>>This is a very
interesting block.

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:04.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean so in your
mind, this is evidence

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:10.630 align:middle line:84%
of modern type of machining,
advanced machining,

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:14.409 align:middle line:90%
but done in ancient times?

00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>>I would say that
if we were looking

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:29.360 align:middle line:84%
for evidence of ancient methods,
I won't expect to see this.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:32.620 align:middle line:84%
If I was in a
modern machine shop,

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:36.050 align:middle line:90%
this would not surprise me.

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:41.719 align:middle line:84%
>>With this fascinating
block of granite

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:46.380 align:middle line:84%
that appears to be sliced
by a giant diamond saw,

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:48.130 align:middle line:84%
this is the kind
of thing that I'm

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:53.440 align:middle line:84%
hoping we're going to find
in the Altiplano of the Andes

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:57.960 align:middle line:84%
in Peru and Bolivia at
Pumapunku and other sites there.

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:13.580 align:middle line:90%


00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:17.770 align:middle line:84%
This is the ancient
sun temple of Abu Garab

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:22.310 align:middle line:84%
on the edge of the
western desert of Saqqara.

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:28.860 align:middle line:84%
This ruined pyramid area once
contained an obelisk at the top

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:31.890 align:middle line:84%
and all around it
are scattered blocks

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:33.456 align:middle line:90%
of granite and alabaster.

00:35:33.456 --> 00:35:36.720 align:middle line:90%


00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Here at Abu Garab, there is
evidence of ancient machining.

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Chris, what do you think about
this block here of granite?

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, as you can
see, David, there

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:54.220 align:middle line:84%
is a hole that's actually
been core drilled.

00:35:54.220 --> 00:36:00.945 align:middle line:84%
And it has similar features
to the hole and core

00:36:00.945 --> 00:36:04.000 align:middle line:84%
that Petri described
in his book, "Pyramids

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.310 align:middle line:84%
and Temples of Giza" and
which I wrote in my book.

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And the striations
are visible there.

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:16.150 align:middle line:84%
It would be difficult to find
out if it's actually a spiral,

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:19.360 align:middle line:84%
but if it's anything like the
core that is found in the Petri

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:23.270 align:middle line:84%
Museum, then those
striations do form a spiral

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:25.590 align:middle line:90%
down the entire length of it.

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>>And that would be only done
with some modern machining type

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:30.620 align:middle line:90%
tool.

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>That's what I concluded, that
it was some kind of sonic core

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:34.810 align:middle line:90%
drill.

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>>A sonic core drill doing that.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:37.840 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>>And what is the
mainstream explanation

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:42.740 align:middle line:90%
for a hole like that?

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, the mainstream explanation
for doing this kind of work

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:51.430 align:middle line:84%
is to use copper and
sand and essentially

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:54.270 align:middle line:84%
rotate the copper
in two directions,

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:56.540 align:middle line:90%
OK, with a bow drill.

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>>And is it a hollow
copper tube then?

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>>A hollow copper to
attached to a piece of wood

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:09.650 align:middle line:84%
where you rotate the
wood and the copper

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:13.930 align:middle line:84%
by wrapping the string
around it and attaching

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:15.490 align:middle line:90%
the ends to a piece of wood.

00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>>Like a bow and a drill?

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And then you just
rotate it that way.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:24.590 align:middle line:84%
But the problem with
that method, though,

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:30.840 align:middle line:84%
is that the core in the Petri
Museum shows that the spiral is

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:38.640 align:middle line:84%
only in one direction and also
the feed lines or the feet

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:42.650 align:middle line:84%
rate-- that's the distance
each striation has,

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:47.060 align:middle line:84%
the distance the drill goes
in a 360 degree rotation--

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:52.660 align:middle line:84%
is almost 1/8 of an inch, which
is an incredible feed rate.

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:54.810 align:middle line:90%
And we see striations here.

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And like I said,
it's very difficult

00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:02.450 align:middle line:84%
to really tell whether they
are a continuous spiral down

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:04.820 align:middle line:90%
the length of it.

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:07.290 align:middle line:84%
But still it's
quite interesting.

00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:22.260 align:middle line:90%


00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:25.310 align:middle line:84%
This is what they call
the alabaster altar

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:27.270 align:middle line:90%
here at Abu Garab.

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:33.780 align:middle line:84%
It's a curious star shape made
with about four giant slabs

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:35.820 align:middle line:90%
of alabaster.

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And it also shows some
evidence of ancient machining.

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:42.990 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, what we have here
is a perfect circle

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:49.880 align:middle line:90%
cut into the stone.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And essentially,
it looks like what

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:58.130 align:middle line:84%
they did is they came down with
a core drill in this corner

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:03.890 align:middle line:84%
right here because you have
that machined as a depression.

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:06.170 align:middle line:84%
That would have
left a central core.

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:09.400 align:middle line:84%
But then what they
would have done

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:20.940 align:middle line:84%
is machined this surface in to
meet this feature right here.

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:25.140 align:middle line:84%
So they started out with a
hole and then machined that.

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:27.555 align:middle line:84%
You see the difference
in tool marks

00:39:27.555 --> 00:39:29.970 align:middle line:84%
or the difference
in geometry here.

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:35.160 align:middle line:84%
You have the geometry
of this tool, which

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:38.790 align:middle line:84%
has a larger radius
here, and then you

00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:41.480 align:middle line:90%
have the geometry of the drill.

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.070 align:middle line:90%


00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And so they drill that
out, knocked the core out,

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:53.420 align:middle line:84%
and brought this in, and
then cut this onto a radius.

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And there are one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,

00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:01.790 align:middle line:84%
eight of these features
around the block.

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:05.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, what they were intended
for, it's a mystery.

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:06.700 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:09.820 align:middle line:84%
What is the purpose of all
this and even why they would

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.030 align:middle line:90%
cut this out like this is--

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>>And there's another
of these features

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:20.760 align:middle line:84%
over on that other corner except
that it's not a full circle,

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:24.702 align:middle line:90%
it's just like a half a circle.

00:40:24.702 --> 00:40:26.160 align:middle line:84%
>>And so if you
were actually doing

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:32.530 align:middle line:84%
this with very slow,
laborious hand drilling thing,

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:36.750 align:middle line:84%
you probably wouldn't have
overcut it like this, right?

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I mean I'm not saying
that that's necessarily

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.520 align:middle line:90%
the case.

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:45.660 align:middle line:84%
But the problem that we have
with the conventional theory

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:53.070 align:middle line:84%
of cutting stone, such as
bashing with stone chisels

00:40:53.070 --> 00:41:03.560 align:middle line:84%
or just grinding it
while lapping it is why--

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:08.610 align:middle line:84%
these surfaces are very
smooth, OK, but you'll notice--

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:10.700 align:middle line:84%
some of the surfaces
are smooth, but you'll

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:16.040 align:middle line:84%
notice that the alabaster
is very brittle.

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.420 align:middle line:90%
>>And has crystals in it.

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:17.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And so this is not a stone
that you would actually

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:30.050 align:middle line:84%
bash with another stone
to achieve this kind

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:34.121 align:middle line:90%
of smoothness and flat surface.

00:41:34.121 --> 00:41:38.130 align:middle line:84%
So they created this
creature as a relief

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:41.060 align:middle line:84%
so that a mating
part or a mating

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:45.890 align:middle line:84%
object, something that would
fit snugly over the top of it--

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>>Because if you follow
this surface here,

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:56.720 align:middle line:84%
it goes right into this area
here, where this radius starts.

00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:58.470 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:01.860 align:middle line:84%
So that's the only
explanation I have

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:05.290 align:middle line:84%
for that, that
this is meaningless

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:07.400 align:middle line:90%
except for clearance.

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>>Clearance.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:09.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.690 align:middle line:84%
Other stone blocks, then,
were fitted down in here.

00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>>Or whatever it was.

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.190 align:middle line:90%
>>Whatever it was.

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:14.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:18.120 align:middle line:84%
Out of stone or even
possibly metal parts.

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, whatever material that
was available in prehistory.

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:26.260 align:middle line:90%
So this is another example--

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:30.334 align:middle line:84%
and there are many of
them throughout Egypt--

00:42:30.334 --> 00:42:36.670 align:middle line:84%
of very, very high
proficiency in cutting stone.

00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And in my opinion, they had to
have had advanced technology.

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And here is the other
feature right here

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:51.080 align:middle line:84%
where you have that circle,
which is actually a half.

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:51.990 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And the same kind of features,
the same radius here coming

00:42:57.110 --> 00:42:58.450 align:middle line:90%
into the corner.

00:42:58.450 --> 00:43:01.520 align:middle line:84%
But this is a sharper
radius right here.

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:04.199 align:middle line:84%
So you have a
sharp radius there.

00:43:04.199 --> 00:43:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And to the life of
me, I can't understand

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:09.530 align:middle line:90%
why they found these necessary.

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:11.285 align:middle line:90%
But obviously they had a need.

00:43:11.285 --> 00:43:14.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean today in manufacturing
we have lots of weird shapes.

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:16.837 align:middle line:90%


00:43:16.837 --> 00:43:17.795 align:middle line:90%
And here's another one.

00:43:17.795 --> 00:43:18.170 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:23.130 align:middle line:84%
>>But this is further
away from the corner.

00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>>From the corner.

00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:25.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, right.

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:27.950 align:middle line:90%
>>So it's quite fascinating.

00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:31.900 align:middle line:84%
>>So it's clear that they
started each of these niches

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:35.560 align:middle line:84%
by first coring down here and
then cutting away the rest.

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:37.690 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:39.660 align:middle line:84%
So evidently, what
I would suggest

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:45.780 align:middle line:84%
is that something fit
on top of this thing

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:48.800 align:middle line:84%
and these surface
are on an angle.

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And so whatever
fits slipped on here

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:56.680 align:middle line:84%
and they cut this
out as a relief.

00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And so whatever fit on it came
into this surface right here.

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And so what you have
is a relief like that.

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:06.710 align:middle line:90%
>>That's great.

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And now-- wow, look
at this, you guys.

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Here's a saw mark on this
circular piece look at that.

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:15.580 align:middle line:90%
It's been cut in.

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:17.740 align:middle line:90%
Now, how did they do that?

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>>I think we need to
get up on top so that we

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:22.047 align:middle line:90%
can examine it more closely.

00:44:22.047 --> 00:44:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Basically, you're
going to start here,

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:28.860 align:middle line:84%
you're going to reach
the top of the radius,

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:32.350 align:middle line:84%
the maximum distance,
and then taper out.

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:38.422 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to insert this
room key and we'll check it out.

00:44:38.422 --> 00:44:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>>It gets deeper there
and then it gets shallower

00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:43.020 align:middle line:90%
and comes back out again.

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:43.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:45.155 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:44:45.155 --> 00:44:45.955 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:44:45.955 --> 00:44:50.190 align:middle line:90%


00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:53.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, with this feature
and all the other features

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:59.230 align:middle line:84%
that surround us, I am totally
convinced that this platform

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:01.840 align:middle line:84%
was designed to
hold something else

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:05.740 align:middle line:90%
and then lock it into position.

00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Because tightening
just this feature

00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:19.160 align:middle line:84%
alone indicates that they were
placing something on there.

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:23.310 align:middle line:90%
Because otherwise, why have it?

00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>>I mean this is a pretty
sophisticated and modern

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:31.030 align:middle line:84%
engineering way to fit
giant blocks or even

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:32.850 align:middle line:84%
some kind of machinery
or something, right?

00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, it's not
sophisticated or even modern--

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:41.120 align:middle line:90%
modern by our terms.

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Ever manufacturing first
started, it's a common feature.

00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:51.010 align:middle line:84%
They use it to attach
objects to shafts,

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:53.830 align:middle line:84%
they will cut something like
that and then drive a screw

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:56.130 align:middle line:90%
and hold it together.

00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>>And of course, there
would be like, say,

00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:03.310 align:middle line:84%
four of these around this
circular thing, yeah,

00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:05.230 align:middle line:90%
to attach things.

00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>>But then with
the other features

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.430 align:middle line:84%
that indicate that something
actually was dropped on here,

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:17.389 align:middle line:84%
it all begins to
make more sense now.

00:46:17.389 --> 00:46:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>And do you think
that this was also

00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:23.500 align:middle line:84%
probably cut with like a
circular saw, some machine

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:24.300 align:middle line:90%
tool?

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, yeah.

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:28.434 align:middle line:84%
I mean this I would say
with the weight of evidence

00:46:28.434 --> 00:46:30.850 align:middle line:84%
throughout Egypt, obviously
they were using machine tools.

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:34.530 align:middle line:84%
But this could have
been cut with anything.

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:36.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very
simple features

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:38.170 align:middle line:90%
and there's not much material--

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:39.290 align:middle line:90%
>>To remove there.

00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:39.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:40.420 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:43.660 align:middle line:90%


00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:45.095 align:middle line:90%
>>Look at this one here, David.

00:46:45.095 --> 00:46:47.770 align:middle line:90%


00:46:47.770 --> 00:46:49.010 align:middle line:90%
How did it get here?

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:55.470 align:middle line:84%
It's suspended like a dolman,
but it's actually on the corner

00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:56.270 align:middle line:90%
right there.

00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:58.520 align:middle line:84%
It's touching on, like,
three points here.

00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:00.720 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge blob of limestone.

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:01.688 align:middle line:90%
That's huge.

00:47:01.688 --> 00:47:09.243 align:middle line:90%


00:47:09.243 --> 00:47:10.043 align:middle line:90%
These are weird.

00:47:10.043 --> 00:47:12.395 align:middle line:90%


00:47:12.395 --> 00:47:13.195 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:47:13.195 --> 00:47:17.160 align:middle line:90%


00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:20.910 align:middle line:84%
So here we have a
very curious series

00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:24.186 align:middle line:90%
of megalithic alabaster bowls.

00:47:24.186 --> 00:47:27.472 align:middle line:90%


00:47:27.472 --> 00:47:32.490 align:middle line:84%
They're scooped out,
there's a hole on one side

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:35.150 align:middle line:90%
to let some liquid out.

00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Each one has these curious
cogged features on it.

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:47.480 align:middle line:84%
The cogged features also have
small uniform drill marks

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:48.870 align:middle line:90%
going on them.

00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:52.420 align:middle line:84%
It almost seems like they're
a form for something else

00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:53.360 align:middle line:90%
to fit over.

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:56.160 align:middle line:90%
What do you think, Chris?

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, I think so.

00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Looking at these, I would say--
and we will take a different

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:05.940 align:middle line:90%
view of them--

00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:09.400 align:middle line:84%
but what I would
suggest is that these

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:18.330 align:middle line:84%
were the bases for a column
that fit down into here.

00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And then perhaps the
column itself had a hole--

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>>A hollow going
all the way down.

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:27.770 align:middle line:90%
>>All the way through it.

00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And then probably it collected
water from a gutter above.

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:36.220 align:middle line:90%
>>OK?

00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>>And then the water drained
into these bowls and out

00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:41.340 align:middle line:90%
of that hole.

00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:43.390 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are some of
these on the other side

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:48.440 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramid that
are in situ so we

00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:49.575 align:middle line:90%
could take a look at those.

00:48:49.575 --> 00:48:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And you think these
have actually then

00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:52.444 align:middle line:90%
been moved here by--

00:48:52.444 --> 00:48:53.243 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:48:53.243 --> 00:48:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, these have
been moved here.

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:55.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And you will see that
clearly when you look

00:48:58.510 --> 00:49:00.080 align:middle line:90%
at the ones that are in situ.

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:00.880 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:10.925 align:middle line:90%


00:49:10.925 --> 00:49:14.895 align:middle line:84%
Looking at the west
side of the pyramid

00:49:14.895 --> 00:49:20.510 align:middle line:84%
here at Abu Garab, which once
had an obelisk on the top,

00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:24.590 align:middle line:84%
it appears that this
whole pyramid was just

00:49:24.590 --> 00:49:30.220 align:middle line:84%
destroyed in some giant
cataclysm, some big earthquake

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:32.742 align:middle line:84%
that just destroyed it and
scattered these blocks around.

00:49:32.742 --> 00:49:33.700 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you think?

00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:34.900 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Essentially what I described
earlier in that there

00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:43.130 align:middle line:90%
was a huge cataclysm.

00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:46.000 align:middle line:84%
All these m which
were finely tuned

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000 align:middle line:84%
to the resonance of the
planet, and the planet

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.830 align:middle line:84%
was overloaded with energy
and they just vibrated apart.

00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And you can see some of
the blocks are cracked.

00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:00.580 align:middle line:84%
If we walk around
this side right here,

00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:04.910 align:middle line:84%
there's one actually
towards the center

00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:08.760 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramid, a huge
block of limestone

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:11.870 align:middle line:84%
this appears to have been just
thrown up and then dropped

00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:12.720 align:middle line:90%
down and cracked.

00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>>And split apart.

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:14.860 align:middle line:90%
It cracked.

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:15.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:19.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean so the idea that it
would have been just somebody

00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:21.350 align:middle line:84%
came here and decided
to tear it down,

00:50:21.350 --> 00:50:23.590 align:middle line:84%
that would have been
extremely difficult, right?

00:50:23.590 --> 00:50:25.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean to just bring
these blocks down.

00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:31.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean they possibly could
have tumbled these down.

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:38.326 align:middle line:84%
But why pick a block, tumble
it down, and then not use it

00:50:38.326 --> 00:50:39.130 align:middle line:90%
and leave it here?

00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, right.

00:50:39.930 --> 00:50:43.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean if they wanted to quarry
and wanted building material,

00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:45.650 align:middle line:84%
why not take these
stones with them?

00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>>Why not use the one that
you've already tumbled?

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>>And what we have
here are hundreds

00:50:51.690 --> 00:50:54.030 align:middle line:84%
of blocks that have just
been thrown off the pyramid.

00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>>Thrown away.

00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:57.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's more like a natural
disaster, rather than

00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:59.380 align:middle line:90%
a man-made destruction.

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:00.180 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:51:00.180 --> 00:52:11.700 align:middle line:90%


00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:15.681 align:middle line:84%
this is all just cut into solid
rock here, these chambers.

00:52:15.681 --> 00:52:16.481 align:middle line:90%
Man.

00:52:16.481 --> 00:52:32.800 align:middle line:90%


00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:36.644 align:middle line:90%
So these are the--

00:52:36.644 --> 00:52:37.572 align:middle line:90%
>>Coffins here.

00:52:37.572 --> 00:52:39.428 align:middle line:84%
The coffin and
the cover and they

00:52:39.428 --> 00:52:42.130 align:middle line:84%
covered it with wood
to make protection.

00:52:42.130 --> 00:52:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>>Protection for it.

00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:48.930 align:middle line:84%
But here it is-- here
are the giant sarcophagi

00:52:48.930 --> 00:52:49.740 align:middle line:90%
without a cover.

00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:51.520 align:middle line:90%
And that's the lid.

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:53.910 align:middle line:90%
So it's weighing 85 tons.

00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And how much is
this lid weighing?

00:52:56.230 --> 00:53:00.081 align:middle line:84%
>>I think all covered and the
coffin it weighed 85 tons.

00:53:00.081 --> 00:53:03.470 align:middle line:90%
You have to go down [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:07.350 align:middle line:90%
>>It's a really strange place.

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:15.160 align:middle line:84%
We're deep underground here and
on either side are these bays.

00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And in these bays are these
giant, huge basalt sarcophagi.

00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:27.900 align:middle line:84%
They're incredible with
these huge lids and then--

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:30.170 align:middle line:84%
man, these things,
they weigh 85 tons,

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:34.520 align:middle line:90%
the lids weigh like 50 tons.

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:38.720 align:middle line:84%
It's extremely
hard basalt. I mean

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:44.040 align:middle line:84%
how they could move
these inside here,

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:48.450 align:middle line:90%
it defies explanation really.

00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a
cramped, tight area

00:53:52.070 --> 00:53:56.290 align:middle line:84%
that you can't get a lot of
workers in here to do things.

00:53:56.290 --> 00:53:57.960 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:59.060 align:middle line:90%
Man.

00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:00.920 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:03.470 align:middle line:90%
Look how this is cut here, too.

00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:06.310 align:middle line:84%
You can see how it's suddenly
sloping down like that.

00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:07.110 align:middle line:90%
Man.

00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:09.755 align:middle line:84%
>>They tried to make
it [INAUDIBLE] here.

00:54:09.755 --> 00:54:14.705 align:middle line:90%


00:54:14.705 --> 00:54:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>>Wow.

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:19.070 align:middle line:84%
How did they make it
so smooth and polished?

00:54:19.070 --> 00:54:21.505 align:middle line:84%
>>I think they are very
technical workers at this time

00:54:21.505 --> 00:54:24.270 align:middle line:84%
to make it very, very,
very soft to touch.

00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:26.470 align:middle line:90%
>>Wow.

00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:30.950 align:middle line:84%
Boy, these edges are
really square, too.

00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:32.333 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:54:32.333 --> 00:54:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>>This one.

00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Here you can see the lid pushed
back, the sarcophagus is open.

00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:44.260 align:middle line:84%
It's been chipped
away right here,

00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:46.590 align:middle line:90%
probably trying to open it.

00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:49.490 align:middle line:90%


00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:51.540 align:middle line:84%
According to the
traditional Egyptologists,

00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:54.480 align:middle line:84%
these giant boxes
were sarcophagi

00:54:54.480 --> 00:55:00.625 align:middle line:84%
for the mummified bulls of Apis,
sacred bulls of ancient Egypt.

00:55:00.625 --> 00:55:03.920 align:middle line:90%


00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:08.190 align:middle line:84%
Yet the big mystery really
is how they could possibly

00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:16.640 align:middle line:84%
get boxes such
gigantic, 85-ton basalt

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:20.250 align:middle line:90%
sarcophagi like this in here.

00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And in theory just to put
a mummified bull inside.

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:30.360 align:middle line:90%
Here this is very smooth here.

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:35.160 align:middle line:90%
A very uniform radius.

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:39.600 align:middle line:84%
It's these inside
corners of a box

00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:43.770 align:middle line:84%
like this that are
so difficult to make

00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:48.780 align:middle line:84%
without modern machinery,
modern machining tools.

00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:53.050 align:middle line:84%
According to Chris, it's
basically impossible

00:55:53.050 --> 00:55:55.370 align:middle line:90%
to bash something like this out.

00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And you just have to
have modern machining

00:55:59.370 --> 00:56:05.510 align:middle line:84%
tools, modern sonic
drills and saws

00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:07.016 align:middle line:84%
to really make
something like that.

00:56:07.016 --> 00:56:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And even today, this would be
almost impossible to make, even

00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:13.876 align:middle line:90%
with modern machinery.

00:56:13.876 --> 00:56:23.050 align:middle line:90%


00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:23.850 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:56:23.850 --> 00:56:25.826 align:middle line:90%
This is just so amazing.

00:56:25.826 --> 00:56:32.880 align:middle line:84%
It's so smooth along the
sides of this basalt.

00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:36.990 align:middle line:84%
It's so smoothed out and
then it's been etched here.

00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:37.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Here you see the edges here
of the box, the sarcophagi.

00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:49.910 align:middle line:84%
It's all chipped here,
probably from crowbars going in

00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:56.930 align:middle line:84%
to try and lift this
25-ton lid off the top.

00:56:56.930 --> 00:57:03.180 align:middle line:84%
It's all bashed in and
chipped on this corner.

00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:07.200 align:middle line:84%
But otherwise, it's just so
smooth, such a perfect corner

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.000 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.580 align:middle line:90%


00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:11.380 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:14.560 align:middle line:90%
It's really amazing.

00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:16.720 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:21.050 align:middle line:84%
I'll just see if I can lift
this 25-ton lid up a little bit.

00:57:21.050 --> 00:57:22.390 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:24.300 align:middle line:84%
I can just hold it
up for a few seconds.

00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:26.230 align:middle line:90%
There.

00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:27.352 align:middle line:90%
That's about it.

00:57:27.352 --> 00:57:28.152 align:middle line:90%
Whew.

00:57:28.152 --> 00:57:32.710 align:middle line:90%


00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:40.670 align:middle line:84%
This is the 85-ton granite
box that's unfinished.

00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:42.940 align:middle line:90%
It's still rough.

00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:45.570 align:middle line:84%
You can see right
here in the corner.

00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:48.490 align:middle line:84%
But the lid is now
on the other side.

00:57:48.490 --> 00:57:53.040 align:middle line:84%
So apparently, this was being
moved into the serapeum,

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:57.740 align:middle line:84%
but in the end was
just left here.

00:57:57.740 --> 00:57:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Some Egyptologists
think this was probably

00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:05.570 align:middle line:84%
being taken out, although others
say it was being brought in.

00:58:05.570 --> 00:58:08.400 align:middle line:84%
You can see how it barely
fits in these tunnels,

00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:12.840 align:middle line:84%
this giant 85-ton
block, I mean how even

00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:19.700 align:middle line:84%
workers could be moving around
this while they theoretically

00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:22.580 align:middle line:90%
moved it in here.

00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:28.280 align:middle line:90%
It's really an enigma.

00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:29.600 align:middle line:90%
I mean how could they do this?

00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:39.760 align:middle line:90%


00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:42.470 align:middle line:90%
This is amazing.

00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:44.060 align:middle line:90%
It was an incredible day.

00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:46.580 align:middle line:84%
We still had time to
visit the mysterious Red

00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Pyramid, a pyramid with some
sort of chemical residue

00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:50.830 align:middle line:90%
inside.

00:58:50.830 --> 00:59:02.710 align:middle line:90%


00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:03.510 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:07.070 align:middle line:84%
Now we can move into
the main chamber now.

00:59:07.070 --> 00:59:07.870 align:middle line:90%
Watch your head.

00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:15.560 align:middle line:90%


00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:16.360 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Look at this corbeled
ceiling here.

00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:18.936 align:middle line:90%
Oh, man.

00:59:18.936 --> 00:59:21.630 align:middle line:90%
This is cool.

00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:22.502 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:59:22.502 --> 00:59:23.302 align:middle line:90%
That's high.

00:59:23.302 --> 00:59:24.606 align:middle line:84%
>>Let's have a
look through here.

00:59:24.606 --> 00:59:25.320 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:26.120 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it is really
similar, isn't it?

00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:29.974 align:middle line:90%
It's hot down here, too.

00:59:29.974 --> 00:59:33.006 align:middle line:90%


00:59:33.006 --> 00:59:35.480 align:middle line:90%
So do you think we're actually--

00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:38.080 align:middle line:84%
you don't think we're
underground here, are we?

00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:42.720 align:middle line:84%
We're more at the level
of the Giza Plateau.

00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>>We're not underground,
but we're right at the--

00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:47.520 align:middle line:90%
>>Right at ground level.

00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:49.116 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:59:49.116 --> 00:59:52.490 align:middle line:90%
>>You can see [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:57.546 align:middle line:84%
>>Look how perfectly these
blocks are fitted together.

00:59:57.546 --> 01:00:01.090 align:middle line:90%
That's incredible masonry.

01:00:01.090 --> 01:00:02.130 align:middle line:90%
Man.

01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:05.960 align:middle line:84%
There's a huge block right
here, lintel over the door.

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:41.090 align:middle line:90%


01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:44.252 align:middle line:84%
So this is the main
inner chamber here, huh?

01:00:44.252 --> 01:00:52.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's three corbeled chambers
deep inside the pyramid.

01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:54.360 align:middle line:84%
There's a very strong
ammonia smell in here,

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.690 align:middle line:84%
which would be from
perhaps chemicals that

01:00:57.690 --> 01:01:00.810 align:middle line:84%
were used in here at some
time or would it just be

01:01:00.810 --> 01:01:03.520 align:middle line:90%
from bat guano or something?

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>>It smells just like ammonia,
doesn't smell like urine--

01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:09.034 align:middle line:90%
>>Uh-huh.

01:01:09.034 --> 01:01:10.658 align:middle line:84%
>>--which would have
a different smell.

01:01:10.658 --> 01:01:11.650 align:middle line:90%
It's smells like pure--

01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:12.800 align:middle line:90%
>>Like pure ammonia.

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.570 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, or like
phosphate or ammonia.

01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:18.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's a really strong
smell, a very strong chemical

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:21.100 align:middle line:90%
smell in here.

01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:23.260 align:middle line:90%
It's overpowering.

01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:24.735 align:middle line:90%
You almost can't stand it.

01:01:24.735 --> 01:01:27.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean you couldn't stay
down here very long.

01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:37.528 align:middle line:90%


01:01:37.528 --> 01:01:38.328 align:middle line:90%

>>Wow.

01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:53.900 align:middle line:84%
There is certainly a
very strong resonant--

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:56.900 align:middle line:90%


01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:58.330 align:middle line:90%

01:02:01.170 --> 01:02:02.464 align:middle line:90%

>>Yeah.

01:02:09.162 --> 01:02:09.962 align:middle line:90%
[BANG]

01:02:09.962 --> 01:02:10.398 align:middle line:90%

>>And she's two chambers away.

01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:12.616 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, that's right.

01:02:12.616 --> 01:02:13.416 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:02:13.416 --> 01:02:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>>One chamber, down
the passageway--

01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:14.880 align:middle line:90%
>>That's right.

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And then she's down
that other passage.

01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:16.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:02:16.830 --> 01:02:17.630 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And she's just stamping her
foot on a wooden platform.

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:25.115 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's something.

01:02:25.115 --> 01:02:25.915 align:middle line:90%
[BANG]

01:02:25.915 --> 01:02:29.408 align:middle line:90%


01:02:29.408 --> 01:02:33.870 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like
Godzilla is coming.

01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Here inside the pyramid,
too, we can really

01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:40.930 align:middle line:84%
see how perfect the
construction is,

01:02:40.930 --> 01:02:43.870 align:middle line:84%
how these massive
blocks of limestone

01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:48.600 align:middle line:90%
are perfectly fitted together.

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:53.320 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't slip a piece
of paper or a knife in here.

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:58.460 align:middle line:84%
You see how the joints all
come together extremely finely.

01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:04.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is really
precision construction.

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:09.490 align:middle line:84%
This is the finest kind of
megalithic stone masonry

01:03:09.490 --> 01:03:10.640 align:middle line:90%
that we can find anywhere.

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:23.320 align:middle line:90%


01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.291 align:middle line:90%
Back on the surface.

01:03:25.291 --> 01:03:26.195 align:middle line:90%
Daylight again.

01:03:26.195 --> 01:03:31.929 align:middle line:90%


01:03:31.929 --> 01:03:32.845 align:middle line:90%
That was quite a trip.

01:03:32.845 --> 01:03:42.300 align:middle line:90%


01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:45.138 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be crazy
to drive in Cairo, helps.

01:03:45.138 --> 01:04:35.540 align:middle line:90%


01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:37.920 align:middle line:90%
How was the Great Pyramid built?

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Was it built by thousands
of slaves as a monument

01:04:40.930 --> 01:04:44.076 align:middle line:84%
to a pharaoh, or did it
have some other purpose?

01:04:44.076 --> 01:04:57.140 align:middle line:90%


01:04:57.140 --> 01:05:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Today we will explore a
revolutionary new theory

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:05.610 align:middle line:84%
on the purpose of the pyramids
and how they were built.

01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>>Obviously, they
reached the point

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:10.150 align:middle line:84%
where they said, well, we've
got all this energy coming

01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:12.920 align:middle line:84%
through these things,
why don't we harness it?

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So they build the
Great Pyramid and they

01:05:15.330 --> 01:05:17.240 align:middle line:90%
harnessed some of that energy.

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:21.010 align:middle line:84%
>>I wanted to explore the
subject of the Great Pyramid

01:05:21.010 --> 01:05:23.920 align:middle line:84%
being some sort
of giant machine,

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:27.320 align:middle line:84%
so I arranged to meet with
British engineer Christopher

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:29.420 align:middle line:90%
Dunn in Cairo.

01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:31.410 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I
did was take him

01:05:31.410 --> 01:05:35.760 align:middle line:84%
to Giza, where he could explain
to me his theory of the Giza

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:36.580 align:middle line:90%
power plant.

01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:45.020 align:middle line:90%


01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>In "The Giza Power Plant,"
I questioned the theory

01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:51.580 align:middle line:84%
whether the pyramids
were actually tombs.

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And after conducting
considerable research,

01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:56.750 align:middle line:84%
I could not find any
evidence that there

01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:middle line:84%
were any original burials
within the pyramids.

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Of course, that
raises the question,

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:05.510 align:middle line:84%
if they were not tombs,
what were they used for?

01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:08.720 align:middle line:84%
What I did is I examined
the Great Pyramid

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and did a reverse
engineering study of it.

01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:15.060 align:middle line:84%
What I concluded was
that it was actually

01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:20.560 align:middle line:84%
used to generate energy and
generated energy in a way that

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.800 align:middle line:90%
was extremely holistic.

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:27.090 align:middle line:84%
It actually did more than
just generate energy,

01:06:27.090 --> 01:06:30.430 align:middle line:84%
it relieved the stresses
in the Earth's plate

01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:35.560 align:middle line:84%
and it also drove the
plate into harmony.

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.650 align:middle line:84%
That harmony then
possibly could have

01:06:37.650 --> 01:06:40.500 align:middle line:84%
affected the people
in the area, creating

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:46.520 align:middle line:84%
an acoustic environment that
was peaceful and extremely

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:49.540 align:middle line:90%
beneficial to their health.

01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:54.390 align:middle line:84%
However, what leads me to that
conclusion are the details

01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:56.460 align:middle line:90%
within the Great Pyramid.

01:06:56.460 --> 01:07:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And what we have is a series
of passageways and chambers

01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:04.450 align:middle line:90%
and shafts.

01:07:04.450 --> 01:07:09.530 align:middle line:84%
It was a study of the
dimensions and the geometry

01:07:09.530 --> 01:07:16.220 align:middle line:84%
of these shafts and chambers
and the residual materials

01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:18.140 align:middle line:90%
that were left inside.

01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Also, the selection of
materials in particular areas.

01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:27.190 align:middle line:84%
In the Great Pyramid, we
have a descending passage

01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:30.270 align:middle line:84%
that goes down to
a bedrock chamber

01:07:30.270 --> 01:07:33.750 align:middle line:90%
about 350 feet from the opening.

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we could
talk about the precision

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:40.390 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid, and the
precision is considerable.

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:44.350 align:middle line:84%
That passageway itself was
surveyed by William Flinders

01:07:44.350 --> 01:07:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Petri in the 1880s and he
determined through his measures

01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:53.860 align:middle line:84%
that the passageway was straight
in the constructed portion

01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:55.910 align:middle line:84%
to within 20/1000
of inch, that's

01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:57.710 align:middle line:90%
the thickness of a thumbnail.

01:07:57.710 --> 01:08:00.780 align:middle line:84%
Over the entire length of the
chamber, the full 350 feet,

01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:03.577 align:middle line:90%
it only varied 1/4 of an inch.

01:08:03.577 --> 01:08:04.785 align:middle line:90%
That is an amazing precision.

01:08:04.785 --> 01:08:07.500 align:middle line:90%


01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:12.950 align:middle line:84%
The sub chamber itself I
am now coming to realize

01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:19.450 align:middle line:84%
was actually using hydraulics
to cause a pulse generator.

01:08:19.450 --> 01:08:23.090 align:middle line:84%
It actually generated a pulse
that drove the entire pyramid

01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:24.990 align:middle line:90%
into harmony.

01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:27.779 align:middle line:84%
Of course, moving it
up into the pyramid

01:08:27.779 --> 01:08:31.620 align:middle line:84%
we have the ascending passage
and many unusual features that

01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:34.970 align:middle line:84%
are found there, such
as the granite stone

01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:38.350 align:middle line:84%
plugs at the end
of the passageway.

01:08:38.350 --> 01:08:44.050 align:middle line:84%
They don't seem to have any
real construction purpose.

01:08:44.050 --> 01:08:46.779 align:middle line:84%
While the theory
is that they were

01:08:46.779 --> 01:08:50.460 align:middle line:84%
that to prevent tomb
robbers from entering

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:53.189 align:middle line:84%
the center of the
pyramid, really all they

01:08:53.189 --> 01:08:55.510 align:middle line:90%
did was attract attention.

01:08:55.510 --> 01:09:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And al-Ma'mun, when he chiseled
into the Great Pyramid in 812

01:09:01.710 --> 01:09:06.020 align:middle line:84%
AD, did so when he identified
those granite plugs

01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:10.430 align:middle line:84%
and determined that perhaps
something may lie behind them.

01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, what lay
behind them was a shaft.

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:16.939 align:middle line:84%
They chiseled the limestone
around them and a shaft

01:09:16.939 --> 01:09:21.779 align:middle line:84%
straight up into the heart
of the Great Pyramid.

01:09:21.779 --> 01:09:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Coming to the end
of that small shaft

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:27.920 align:middle line:84%
is what they call
the Grand Gallery.

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.710 align:middle line:84%
The Grand Gallery
is considered to be

01:09:29.710 --> 01:09:32.350 align:middle line:90%
an architectural masterpiece.

01:09:32.350 --> 01:09:37.560 align:middle line:84%
It consists of corbeled
layers, seven corbeled layers,

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:43.580 align:middle line:84%
where the gallery actually
gets smaller towards the top.

01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:47.979 align:middle line:84%
Also, along the side
of the Grand Gallery

01:09:47.979 --> 01:09:53.960 align:middle line:84%
we have ramps and into the
ramps are cut these notches.

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:58.670 align:middle line:84%
These notches are cut
vertically into the ramps.

01:09:58.670 --> 01:10:03.650 align:middle line:84%
There are 27 pairs
of these notches,

01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:06.040 align:middle line:84%
and as you go along the
length of the gallery

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:10.470 align:middle line:84%
you come to what has being
called the Great Step.

01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Climbing up the step, you
have a horizontal passage

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:19.810 align:middle line:84%
and then through the horizontal
passage a small antechamber,

01:10:19.810 --> 01:10:25.210 align:middle line:84%
then again another small
passage into the King's Chamber.

01:10:25.210 --> 01:10:29.570 align:middle line:84%
The King's Chamber complex is
the heart of the power plant.

01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:33.560 align:middle line:84%
It is constructed
solely of granite.

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:38.740 align:middle line:84%
It is tuned to a high
degree to resonate at 440.

01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:41.830 align:middle line:84%
It also emits naturally
an F sharp chord,

01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:45.210 align:middle line:84%
and this was detected by
a acoustic engineer named

01:10:45.210 --> 01:10:48.750 align:middle line:90%
Tom Dannelly in 1995.

01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:51.270 align:middle line:84%
The chamber is freestanding
within the heart

01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:52.450 align:middle line:90%
of the pyramid.

01:10:52.450 --> 01:10:55.100 align:middle line:84%
It is not connected
to the core blocks

01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:59.280 align:middle line:84%
and is free to resonate
and vibrate at will.

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Overlaying the King's Chamber
we have five layers of granite

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:04.590 align:middle line:90%
beams.

01:11:04.590 --> 01:11:07.690 align:middle line:84%
These granite beams, I
speculated in my book,

01:11:07.690 --> 01:11:10.290 align:middle line:90%
are actually resonating beams.

01:11:10.290 --> 01:11:13.280 align:middle line:90%
They are unusually cut.

01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:16.230 align:middle line:84%
They're cut square and
flat on three sides,

01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:20.040 align:middle line:90%
but the top side is very rough.

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:23.020 align:middle line:84%
The roughness on the
top side, I believe,

01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:27.690 align:middle line:84%
was done in order
to tune the beams.

01:11:27.690 --> 01:11:31.890 align:middle line:84%
Just like you would
tune a bell, you

01:11:31.890 --> 01:11:35.640 align:middle line:84%
would actually remove material
until you achieved the tone

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:38.300 align:middle line:90%
that you wanted.

01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:43.290 align:middle line:84%
The whole complex is
like a musical instrument

01:11:43.290 --> 01:11:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and each feature lends a
resonance to the other feature.

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:55.670 align:middle line:84%
In the King's Chamber, we
have a box, what I call a box.

01:11:55.670 --> 01:11:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Conventionally, is
called a sarcophagus.

01:11:58.530 --> 01:12:03.250 align:middle line:84%
However, there have been no
mummies, original burials,

01:12:03.250 --> 01:12:04.390 align:middle line:90%
found in any pyramid.

01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And there was nothing
found in the Great Pyramid,

01:12:07.050 --> 01:12:11.250 align:middle line:84%
even al-Ma'mun
entered in 812 AD.

01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:16.380 align:middle line:84%
So the question is,
what were these for?

01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:19.370 align:middle line:84%
Also in the chamber
are two shafts

01:12:19.370 --> 01:12:23.810 align:middle line:84%
that lead to the outside
of the pyramid on angles.

01:12:23.810 --> 01:12:30.960 align:middle line:84%
These shafts and the northern
shaft, they have a 4.8

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:34.470 align:middle line:90%
by 8.4 dimension.

01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:38.060 align:middle line:84%
That is suitable for a
waveguide in the microwave

01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:41.810 align:middle line:90%
region, a hydrogen waveguide.

01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:44.540 align:middle line:84%
In the southern
shaft, the opening

01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:48.520 align:middle line:90%
is shaped like a horn antenna.

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:50.240 align:middle line:90%
This is quite significant.

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:54.190 align:middle line:84%
If you consider that a signal
coming into that chamber,

01:12:54.190 --> 01:12:59.250 align:middle line:84%
if that chamber contained
energized hydrogen,

01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:02.740 align:middle line:84%
that signal could stimulate
the emission of energy,

01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:08.280 align:middle line:84%
collect that energy, and feed
it into the southern shaft.

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:12.484 align:middle line:84%
Other features-- well,
we asked the question,

01:13:12.484 --> 01:13:13.900 align:middle line:84%
if they were using
hydrogen, where

01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:16.230 align:middle line:90%
did they get the hydrogen from?

01:13:16.230 --> 01:13:21.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, for that we go along a
very long horizontal passage

01:13:21.070 --> 01:13:25.060 align:middle line:84%
to what is termed
the Queen's Chamber.

01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:30.390 align:middle line:84%
In the Queen's Chamber, you
have several unusual features.

01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:35.890 align:middle line:84%
You have two shafts, similar
but not quite the same.

01:13:35.890 --> 01:13:39.250 align:middle line:84%
In the Queen's Chamber,
you have a shaft

01:13:39.250 --> 01:13:42.540 align:middle line:84%
leading from the chamber
to the south and one

01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:46.522 align:middle line:84%
leading from the
chamber to the north.

01:13:46.522 --> 01:13:50.890 align:middle line:84%
When early explorers went
into the Great Pyramid,

01:13:50.890 --> 01:13:54.122 align:middle line:84%
they did not detect
these shafts.

01:13:54.122 --> 01:13:59.312 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't have known
that they were there.

01:13:59.312 --> 01:14:01.990 align:middle line:84%
The only reason
they were found is

01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:07.450 align:middle line:84%
because a man in 1872 by
the name of Waynman Dixon

01:14:07.450 --> 01:14:11.130 align:middle line:84%
was in the chamber and
detected a crack in the wall.

01:14:11.130 --> 01:14:14.610 align:middle line:84%
He pushed a rod
through that crack

01:14:14.610 --> 01:14:18.950 align:middle line:84%
and he got no
resistance on the rod.

01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:21.850 align:middle line:84%
So he chiseled away
the limestone and lo

01:14:21.850 --> 01:14:26.170 align:middle line:84%
and behold, behind that
plate was the shaft.

01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:32.150 align:middle line:84%
He did a similar thing on the
northern face of the chamber

01:14:32.150 --> 01:14:36.250 align:middle line:84%
and tapped around and found that
there was another shaft there,

01:14:36.250 --> 01:14:38.170 align:middle line:84%
chiseled out limestone,
there it was.

01:14:38.170 --> 01:14:41.630 align:middle line:90%
These were intentional designs.

01:14:41.630 --> 01:14:44.570 align:middle line:84%
They did not cut
these shafts and then

01:14:44.570 --> 01:14:47.290 align:middle line:84%
just put a plug in them
at the Queen's Chamber,

01:14:47.290 --> 01:14:50.280 align:middle line:84%
they were a part of
the original block.

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:52.570 align:middle line:90%
So the question is, why?

01:14:52.570 --> 01:14:56.490 align:middle line:90%
Why did they do that?

01:14:56.490 --> 01:15:01.220 align:middle line:84%
In 1993, a German
robotics engineer

01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:03.630 align:middle line:84%
by the name of
Rudolf Gantenbrink

01:15:03.630 --> 01:15:07.400 align:middle line:84%
sent a robot up
the southern shaft.

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:09.060 align:middle line:84%
When he got to the
end of the shaft,

01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:14.600 align:middle line:84%
it terminated at what is
called a so-called door.

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:17.960 align:middle line:84%
But the question is,
was it really a door?

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And my answer is no,
it was not a door.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.850 align:middle line:84%
It was just a plate of limestone
and through this limestone

01:15:26.850 --> 01:15:30.080 align:middle line:90%
were two copper fittings.

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:31.920 align:middle line:90%
So these were really mysterious.

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And why would they
put copper fittings

01:15:34.510 --> 01:15:36.220 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the shaft?

01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:38.150 align:middle line:84%
The solution in the
Giza power plant

01:15:38.150 --> 01:15:41.550 align:middle line:84%
is that they were actually
electrodes and determined

01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:45.880 align:middle line:84%
when the shaft was full of
the chemical they were using

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:50.120 align:middle line:84%
and mixing to create
hydrogen. Now,

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:55.880 align:middle line:84%
you might ask, why was the
shaft closed at the end?

01:15:55.880 --> 01:16:01.390 align:middle line:84%
So we have a shaft that's
closed in two places, terminated

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:03.670 align:middle line:84%
five inches away from
the chamber at the bottom

01:16:03.670 --> 01:16:08.250 align:middle line:84%
and with a plate of
limestone at the top.

01:16:08.250 --> 01:16:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, it wasn't for the
passage of air for people

01:16:12.050 --> 01:16:13.710 align:middle line:90%
to breathe.

01:16:13.710 --> 01:16:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And even though you may ask,
why would a mummy or a pharaoh

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:23.540 align:middle line:90%
need to breathe if he was dead?

01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:27.970 align:middle line:84%
So that was another mysterious
question that we had to answer.

01:16:27.970 --> 01:16:30.270 align:middle line:84%
So the Giza power
plan theory actually

01:16:30.270 --> 01:16:32.940 align:middle line:84%
proposes that both
of these shafts

01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:37.490 align:middle line:84%
contained different
chemicals, a hydrated zinc

01:16:37.490 --> 01:16:44.290 align:middle line:84%
solution and a diluted
hydrochloric acid solution.

01:16:44.290 --> 01:16:46.620 align:middle line:84%
These two chemicals, if
mixed, would actually oil

01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:52.390 align:middle line:84%
off hydrogen. The evidence
to support that proposition

01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:55.566 align:middle line:84%
was found actually on
the walls of the shaft

01:16:55.566 --> 01:16:58.380 align:middle line:90%
and inside the southern shaft.

01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:00.220 align:middle line:84%
On the walls of the
shaft, early explorers

01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:04.820 align:middle line:84%
found that they were covered
with salt up to an inch thick.

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:07.420 align:middle line:84%
They have subsequently
cleaned off the salt,

01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:09.830 align:middle line:90%
but the salt was there.

01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And that would be the result
of hydrogen gas boiling off

01:17:15.670 --> 01:17:20.390 align:middle line:84%
and giving up some of
the impurities in the gas

01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:21.192 align:middle line:90%
to the limestone.

01:17:21.192 --> 01:17:24.430 align:middle line:90%


01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:28.940 align:middle line:84%
So the evidence for
hydrogen is there.

01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:34.270 align:middle line:84%
The evidence that a liquid
was contained in those shafts

01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:39.230 align:middle line:84%
is very strong if you consider
that a five-inch plate

01:17:39.230 --> 01:17:43.650 align:middle line:84%
of limestone, liquid will
percolate through it,

01:17:43.650 --> 01:17:47.420 align:middle line:90%
whereas it would not pass air.

01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:50.516 align:middle line:90%
In the east wall is a niche.

01:17:50.516 --> 01:17:52.320 align:middle line:90%
The niche is corbeled.

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:55.320 align:middle line:84%
I propose that it had an
evaporator tower there so

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.865 align:middle line:84%
that the chemicals that
came into the chamber

01:17:57.865 --> 01:18:01.490 align:middle line:84%
were actually wicked up
into this evaporator tower

01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:07.740 align:middle line:84%
and gave off the
hydrogen. So let's

01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:10.820 align:middle line:84%
climb along the
horizontal passage again

01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:15.580 align:middle line:84%
and we'll go to the bottom
of the Grand Gallery.

01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:18.690 align:middle line:84%
The Grand Gallery is 82
inches wide at the bottom

01:18:18.690 --> 01:18:23.020 align:middle line:84%
and 42 inches right at
the top and 28 feet high.

01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:26.420 align:middle line:84%
It's quite an
impressive masterpiece.

01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:30.310 align:middle line:84%
I propose that within the
slots, of 27 pairs of slots

01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:33.710 align:middle line:84%
going along the length
of the Grand Gallery,

01:18:33.710 --> 01:18:39.370 align:middle line:84%
were a series of resonators
that actually coupled

01:18:39.370 --> 01:18:42.190 align:middle line:84%
with the permit
drew the vibration

01:18:42.190 --> 01:18:48.016 align:middle line:84%
and converted it to airborne
sound at different frequencies.

01:18:48.016 --> 01:18:49.390 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
at the bottom you

01:18:49.390 --> 01:18:52.330 align:middle line:84%
would have a larger
resonator and stepping up

01:18:52.330 --> 01:18:57.150 align:middle line:84%
to higher frequency
as you got to the top.

01:18:57.150 --> 01:19:01.890 align:middle line:84%
In 1999, I noticed evidence
that these resonators actually

01:19:01.890 --> 01:19:06.320 align:middle line:84%
were there, and that evidence
is on the walls and the ceiling

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:08.500 align:middle line:90%
of the Grand Gallery.

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:10.950 align:middle line:84%
Because in the past,
in history, there

01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:15.750 align:middle line:90%
was a disaster, a huge disaster.

01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was
I propose that there

01:19:19.690 --> 01:19:24.490 align:middle line:84%
was either a comet strike
or some external force

01:19:24.490 --> 01:19:25.570 align:middle line:90%
struck the planet.

01:19:25.570 --> 01:19:30.570 align:middle line:84%
This caused all this destruction
that we find around us

01:19:30.570 --> 01:19:33.950 align:middle line:84%
and what we have talked about
as we have gone around the Giza

01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:35.650 align:middle line:90%
Plateau--

01:19:35.650 --> 01:19:39.590 align:middle line:84%
the cracked blocks,
things thrown and jumbled

01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:44.270 align:middle line:84%
all over the place are
the signs of a cataclysm

01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:45.720 align:middle line:90%
many thousands of years ago.

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:48.490 align:middle line:90%


01:19:48.490 --> 01:19:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Inside the Great Pyramid, the
evidence of that cataclysm

01:19:52.050 --> 01:19:55.970 align:middle line:84%
is around the King's Chamber
and the Grand Gallery.

01:19:55.970 --> 01:19:59.500 align:middle line:84%
With the use of
hydrogen and also

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:01.820 align:middle line:84%
if you have the
introduction of oxygen

01:20:01.820 --> 01:20:04.010 align:middle line:84%
after the casing stones
were stripped off,

01:20:04.010 --> 01:20:08.510 align:middle line:84%
you would probably have
the right conditions

01:20:08.510 --> 01:20:09.795 align:middle line:90%
for that hydrogen to explode.

01:20:09.795 --> 01:20:13.330 align:middle line:90%


01:20:13.330 --> 01:20:17.200 align:middle line:84%
The evidence is
inside the chamber.

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:22.060 align:middle line:84%
The walls were actually
pushed out over an inch.

01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:28.030 align:middle line:84%
The ceiling beams were pushed
up and they were cracked.

01:20:28.030 --> 01:20:31.890 align:middle line:84%
So what we had was an explosion,
the walls were pushed out,

01:20:31.890 --> 01:20:34.010 align:middle line:84%
the ceiling being
lifted slightly.

01:20:34.010 --> 01:20:40.910 align:middle line:84%
They fell down and cracked
along the south side.

01:20:40.910 --> 01:20:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Also in that chamber, the
sarcophagus or the granite box

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:48.760 align:middle line:84%
is a different color than
the rest of the granite.

01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:52.334 align:middle line:90%
It is a chocolate brown color.

01:20:52.334 --> 01:20:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And I propose that that, too,
was a result of this explosion,

01:20:57.100 --> 01:21:03.790 align:middle line:84%
that the granite box,
originally a pink Aswan granite,

01:21:03.790 --> 01:21:09.000 align:middle line:84%
was subject to tremendous
forces and heat and as a result,

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.570 align:middle line:84%
it literally cooked
like in an oven,

01:21:13.570 --> 01:21:17.130 align:middle line:84%
changing the color
of the granite.

01:21:17.130 --> 01:21:20.900 align:middle line:84%
If we go back out
through the antechamber

01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:22.840 align:middle line:84%
and onto the Great
Step and we look

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:26.080 align:middle line:84%
at the ceiling of
the Grand Gallery,

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:30.890 align:middle line:84%
we will see the evidence
of that explosion.

01:21:30.890 --> 01:21:34.300 align:middle line:84%
The walls of the
Grand Gallery have

01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:39.390 align:middle line:84%
the evidence of a tremendous
force, tremendous heat.

01:21:39.390 --> 01:21:41.421 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not the first
one to notice this.

01:21:41.421 --> 01:21:43.920 align:middle line:84%
There have been architects and
engineers who have been there

01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:47.250 align:middle line:84%
and said that the
walls are vitrifying.

01:21:47.250 --> 01:21:51.740 align:middle line:84%
The evidence is there to support
the Giza power plant theory.

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And also, the design
of the resonators

01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:57.630 align:middle line:84%
because on the ceiling you
have these scorch marks--

01:21:57.630 --> 01:22:00.630 align:middle line:90%
very, very deep scorch marks.

01:22:00.630 --> 01:22:03.350 align:middle line:84%
The scorch marks
weren't very visible

01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:08.070 align:middle line:84%
until the pyramid
was closed for a year

01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:14.010 align:middle line:84%
and they actually cleaned it
and those scorch marks then

01:22:14.010 --> 01:22:15.500 align:middle line:90%
became very, very clear.

01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And what we have are
a pair of scorch marks

01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:25.810 align:middle line:90%
on both sides on the ceiling.

01:22:25.810 --> 01:22:30.300 align:middle line:84%
Also along the wall, there are
scorch marks that form a line.

01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, the blast pattern seems
to perform a line down,

01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:38.750 align:middle line:90%
centered with the slot.

01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:41.610 align:middle line:84%
So all this evidence
comes together.

01:22:41.610 --> 01:22:47.780 align:middle line:84%
But to sum it up, let me explain
everything and how it worked.

01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:50.080 align:middle line:90%
We start out with energy.

01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:52.480 align:middle line:84%
That energy is the
energy of the Earth--

01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:55.680 align:middle line:84%
seismic energy,
vibration-- feeding

01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:58.240 align:middle line:90%
through the Great Pyramid.

01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:01.640 align:middle line:84%
We collect that energy
in the Grand Gallery

01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:04.960 align:middle line:84%
and convert it to
airborne sound.

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:07.070 align:middle line:84%
That sound and
the natural design

01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:09.410 align:middle line:84%
or the design of
the Grand Gallery

01:23:09.410 --> 01:23:14.760 align:middle line:84%
is such that any sound
generated in the Grand Gallery

01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:19.170 align:middle line:84%
will focus through that
small horizontal passage

01:23:19.170 --> 01:23:22.230 align:middle line:90%
into the King's Chamber.

01:23:22.230 --> 01:23:26.130 align:middle line:84%
There the sound actually
builds and accumulates.

01:23:26.130 --> 01:23:29.010 align:middle line:84%
It affects the
hydrogen in the area

01:23:29.010 --> 01:23:32.310 align:middle line:84%
and then you have a
microwave signal coming in

01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:37.142 align:middle line:90%
from the universe.

01:23:37.142 --> 01:23:43.300 align:middle line:84%
The signature of the Big Bang
is actually a hydrogen signature

01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:44.700 align:middle line:90%
at 21 centimeters.

01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:47.340 align:middle line:90%


01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:50.270 align:middle line:84%
So there we have
it, the evidence

01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:56.800 align:middle line:84%
of a sophisticated, intelligent,
and brilliant society

01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:00.110 align:middle line:84%
that creative energy
not in a way that

01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:04.410 align:middle line:84%
is harmful to the Earth or
the people that live on it,

01:24:04.410 --> 01:24:10.530 align:middle line:84%
but energy that resonated, that
was in harmony with the Earth.

01:24:10.530 --> 01:24:14.500 align:middle line:84%
Generating the energy, they did
it with harmony with the Earth

01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:20.780 align:middle line:84%
and drove the
Earth into harmony.

01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:23.100 align:middle line:84%
We've just scratched
the surface, though.

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:25.340 align:middle line:84%
I believe there
is much more that

01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:29.110 align:middle line:84%
needs to be found and discovered
in Egypt about this lost

01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.910 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:32.690 align:middle line:90%


01:24:32.690 --> 01:24:34.890 align:middle line:90%
We'll keep looking.

01:24:34.890 --> 01:24:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>>Chris' theory that
the pyramids were

01:24:37.370 --> 01:24:41.760 align:middle line:84%
some sort of power plant
tied into the resonance

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:44.410 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth fascinated me.

01:24:44.410 --> 01:24:47.220 align:middle line:84%
I then wanted Chris
to show me evidence

01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:51.430 align:middle line:84%
that there had been some sort
of explosion that was associated

01:24:51.430 --> 01:24:54.020 align:middle line:90%
with the pyramids.

01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:58.590 align:middle line:84%
So if the pyramids were
coupled oscillators

01:24:58.590 --> 01:25:04.520 align:middle line:84%
and in this cataclysm,
some disaster,

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:08.270 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids just vibrated
until they shook off

01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:14.170 align:middle line:84%
all this granite, then for the
later people who came here,

01:25:14.170 --> 01:25:20.070 align:middle line:84%
the stones were lying just like
this, just as we see them now.

01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And then people were trying to
quarry and split these stones,

01:25:26.130 --> 01:25:28.950 align:middle line:84%
but they were already
lying here scattered

01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:31.980 align:middle line:84%
and tumbled like we see
them right now, right?

01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:37.020 align:middle line:10%
>>Part of Chris' theory was
that the pyramids on the Giza

01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:41.600 align:middle line:10%
Plateau were driving
the Earth into harmony.

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:45.000 align:middle line:84%
So I mean in your whole theory,
why these small pyramids?

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.890 align:middle line:90%
They're also just mini big ones?

01:25:47.890 --> 01:25:49.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean they do the same thing?

01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:50.220 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Basically resonate at
a higher frequency,

01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:56.220 align:middle line:90%
but still doing the same thing.

01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And the theory is that
what they were doing

01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:04.060 align:middle line:84%
is they were causing,
for want of a better

01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:06.790 align:middle line:90%
term, a mini earthquake.

01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:07.950 align:middle line:90%
And it is--

01:26:07.950 --> 01:26:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>>They were creating
mini earthquakes.

01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:10.590 align:middle line:90%
>>Mini earthquakes.

01:26:10.590 --> 01:26:12.465 align:middle line:84%
>>To sort of relieve
the stress on the Earth.

01:26:12.465 --> 01:26:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>>To relieve the
stress of the Earth.

01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And so even today,
we're now talking

01:26:17.970 --> 01:26:22.930 align:middle line:84%
about say the Cascadia
fault in America,

01:26:22.930 --> 01:26:25.550 align:middle line:84%
where they are speculating
now that if they

01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:29.170 align:middle line:84%
set off mini
earthquakes, then you

01:26:29.170 --> 01:26:33.080 align:middle line:84%
relieve the stress in
the plates as one plate

01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.050 align:middle line:90%
presses against the other.

01:26:35.050 --> 01:26:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Right now, the
friction takes over

01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:41.360 align:middle line:84%
and they build up stress, build
up stress, built up stress,

01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:44.940 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly you've
got a 9.0 earthquake.

01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:45.740 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>>And if you can relieve
that, but with smaller--

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>>If you can relieve
that, then you're

01:26:51.410 --> 01:26:53.260 align:middle line:90%
going click, click, click.

01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:55.650 align:middle line:90%
Mini earthquakes.

01:26:55.650 --> 01:27:00.570 align:middle line:84%
Vibration, which actually allows
the plates to slide smoothly

01:27:00.570 --> 01:27:04.510 align:middle line:84%
over each other, rather
than building up stress.

01:27:04.510 --> 01:27:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>>But in your whole theory
of the Great Pyramid

01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:12.680 align:middle line:84%
having a maze or energy,
but do these also

01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:14.730 align:middle line:84%
have some chemical
that's put in them,

01:27:14.730 --> 01:27:21.010 align:middle line:84%
or they're just a pure
geometric form on the Plateau?

01:27:21.010 --> 01:27:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, the Great
Pyramid is different.

01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And really just the
generation of energy

01:27:27.210 --> 01:27:31.530 align:middle line:84%
is not the prime purpose
for the pyramids.

01:27:31.530 --> 01:27:34.540 align:middle line:84%
The prime purpose for the
pyramids, in my opinion,

01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:40.880 align:middle line:84%
was to actually create
harmony, to drive the planet

01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:45.330 align:middle line:84%
into harmony and to relieve the
stresses of the Earth's plates.

01:27:45.330 --> 01:27:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're able to do
that, if we could do that,

01:27:49.470 --> 01:27:54.520 align:middle line:84%
we can generate power
for decades, right?

01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>>Just from the stress
of the Earth's crust.

01:27:57.510 --> 01:27:58.950 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:27:58.950 --> 01:28:02.760 align:middle line:84%
The point I'm trying to make,
David, is in our society,

01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:05.330 align:middle line:84%
electricity is
king-- power, energy,

01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:09.160 align:middle line:84%
we use it for many,
many purposes.

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And we can sustain a
civilization for so long.

01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:18.370 align:middle line:84%
That whole civilization can
be wiped out by an earthquake,

01:28:18.370 --> 01:28:24.370 align:middle line:84%
by a huge uplift in the Earth's
crust can just totally destroy

01:28:24.370 --> 01:28:26.390 align:middle line:84%
everything, billions
and billions of dollars.

01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:27.190 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:28:27.190 --> 01:28:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, right.

01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:29.280 align:middle line:90%
Just the tectonic plate shift.

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:33.420 align:middle line:84%
We can't control it now,
but if we could control it,

01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:38.390 align:middle line:84%
we could harness power and
these pyramids could do that.

01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:39.190 align:middle line:90%
>>Bingo.

01:28:39.190 --> 01:28:40.010 align:middle line:90%
You've got it.

01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:41.147 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

01:28:41.147 --> 01:28:42.230 align:middle line:90%
That's what they were for.

01:28:42.230 --> 01:28:43.060 align:middle line:90%
>>Fascinating.

01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:45.210 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

01:28:45.210 --> 01:28:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>>And so you not only have the
smaller pyramids and the larger

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:55.570 align:middle line:84%
pyramids, but you have
the different frequencies

01:28:55.570 --> 01:28:58.100 align:middle line:84%
to match with the different
frequencies in the Earth

01:28:58.100 --> 01:29:00.580 align:middle line:84%
because the Earth is a
jumble of frequencies.

01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:05.070 align:middle line:84%
They detected the hum
of the earth in 1998

01:29:05.070 --> 01:29:11.420 align:middle line:84%
and the hum is very,
very sub, sub frequencies

01:29:11.420 --> 01:29:17.350 align:middle line:84%
with a whole jumble of
different frequencies.

01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:21.180 align:middle line:84%
So the Great Pyramid
resonates still

01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:24.400 align:middle line:90%
in the King's Chamber to 440.

01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:27.000 align:middle line:84%
It resonates to
an F sharp chord,

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.060 align:middle line:84%
as Tom Dannelly
detected in 1995.

01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:31.686 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:29:31.686 --> 01:29:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>>And my theory is that
that energy is still being

01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:38.760 align:middle line:90%
channeled through the pyramid.

01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:39.990 align:middle line:90%
>>Through the pyramid, right.

01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>>And of course,
the King's Chamber

01:29:43.070 --> 01:29:47.190 align:middle line:84%
is a structure that's
freestanding within the center

01:29:47.190 --> 01:29:48.350 align:middle line:90%
of the pyramid.

01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:50.620 align:middle line:84%
It's not dampened by
the walls, it's not

01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:53.150 align:middle line:90%
connected to the core masonry.

01:29:53.150 --> 01:29:57.110 align:middle line:84%
The floor is not
dampened because it's

01:29:57.110 --> 01:30:00.470 align:middle line:90%
suspended on those.

01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:04.512 align:middle line:84%
The upper relieving chambers,
there are five layers of them.

01:30:04.512 --> 01:30:05.312 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:30:05.312 --> 01:30:05.870 align:middle line:90%
>>Why?

01:30:05.870 --> 01:30:06.670 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:30:06.670 --> 01:30:12.650 align:middle line:84%
>>And the whole purpose is
harmonics and resonance.

01:30:12.650 --> 01:30:14.040 align:middle line:84%
So what we have
is a progression.

01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And these were important
for the relieving

01:30:17.130 --> 01:30:18.690 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth's stress.

01:30:18.690 --> 01:30:22.170 align:middle line:90%
And so was the Great Pyramid.

01:30:22.170 --> 01:30:26.260 align:middle line:84%
However, obviously they reached
a point where they said, well,

01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:29.060 align:middle line:84%
we've got all this energy
coming through these things,

01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:30.720 align:middle line:90%
why don't we harness it?

01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:33.150 align:middle line:84%
So they build the
Great Pyramid and they

01:30:33.150 --> 01:30:34.418 align:middle line:90%
harnessed some of that energy.

01:30:34.418 --> 01:30:46.380 align:middle line:90%


01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>>Join us on our
next episode, where

01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:51.790 align:middle line:84%
we go to Peru to search
for ancient technology.
