These ruins in northern
Arizona are called Wutpaki.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.170 align:middle line:90%
It's near the Grand Canyon.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And what we see here
is a ball court.

northern ball courts

in all of the Americas.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.510 align:middle line:84%
But ball courts are found
in Mexico and Guatemala

as far south as
Nicaragua and Costa Rica.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.640 align:middle line:84%

Wutpaki National Monument.

continent.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:03.790 align:middle line:10%
And the Hopi had a huge
trade network with the Maya.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.480 align:middle line:84%
So the ball court
tradition stretches down

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.990 align:middle line:84%
into the Maya territory
thousands of miles away.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
big trade network

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.590 align:middle line:90%
between the Hopi and the Maya.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there have been found
many parrots and macaws buried

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.720 align:middle line:84%
in northern Arizona, which
proves that the trade network

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.250 align:middle line:90%
was very strong around 1100 AD.

northern Arizona and
central Arizona with Mexico.

What contact did they have
with the Toltecs, the Aztecs,

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.840 align:middle line:90%
and the Mayans?

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Did some of the turquoise

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.040 align:middle line:84%
that the Aztecs and
Mayans and Toltecs use

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.120 align:middle line:84%
come from the
American southwest?

There are a lot of
linguistic correspondences.

For instance, the
word for "star"

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.940 align:middle line:84%
is "sohu" in the Hopi language,
and the word for the Orion

constellation is "Sahu."

in the Little
Colorado River Gorge

near the Sacred Salt Mound.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And I find it very
intriguing that this is also

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:20.750 align:middle line:84%
the location, the
supposed location, where

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:25.170 align:middle line:84%
a cavern of probably the immense
value of Egyptian artifacts

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:29.860 align:middle line:84%
was allegedly found and
cleaned out by the Smithsonian

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.570 align:middle line:84%
over a matter of
months back in 1909.

Smithsonian has denied

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.559 align:middle line:84%
that they ever were there, that
they had an explorer there.

I guess guy's name was Jordan.

00:08:41.024 --> 00:08:42.690 align:middle line:84%
So I find it very
interesting that there

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:49.350 align:middle line:84%
should be a very close proximity
connection between the Hopis'

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:53.080 align:middle line:84%
place of emergence and
this particular alleged

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.800 align:middle line:84%

>>A lot of spiritual elders
believe that the Sipapuni ,

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:05.010 align:middle line:84%
the place of emergence, was
somewhere in the Middle East.

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.390 align:middle line:84%
They're not real sure

may have been part of the
network of trading citadels

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:35.140 align:middle line:84%
and trading centers that had
to do with the early Chinese

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:39.340 align:middle line:84%
and Egyptian, Hindu, and
Buddhist explorers that

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:43.430 align:middle line:84%
were coming into the Southwest

>>There is an artifact
that the Hopi use.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.910 align:middle line:90%
It's called a mongko.

And it's very similar to the
Waynman Dixon relics found

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.800 align:middle line:84%
are from the Egyptian
caves in the Grand Canyon,

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:31.630 align:middle line:84%
mentioned in the 1909
"Phoenix Gazette" article?

00:12:37.462 --> 00:12:41.370 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.100 align:middle line:84%
This is the Little
Colorado River Gorge.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.700 align:middle line:10%
It was here that the
Mormon pioneer Seth

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.420 align:middle line:10%
Tanner would prospect.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:54.320 align:middle line:10%
He would come up from Cameron
in the Navajo Nation area

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.280 align:middle line:10%
and move up through the Little
Colorado River and its gorge,

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:04.070 align:middle line:10%
prospecting, looking for
gold, panning in the river.

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:08.370 align:middle line:84%
As he went farther west,
he came to the junction

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:13.940 align:middle line:84%
of the Little Colorado River
Gorge and the Grand Canyon.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.680 align:middle line:84%
There at the junction of
the Little Colorado River

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Gorge and the Grand Canyon are
the sacred Hopi salt mines.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Today, this area is reserved
only for the Hopi Indians,

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and tourists are not allowed
to go into this area.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:34.640 align:middle line:84%
But this is the area that
the mysterious Seth Tanner

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:40.840 align:middle line:84%
was exploring when he discovered
a secret cave of the Hopis.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.860 align:middle line:84%
Inside this cave were objects,
possibly statues, artifacts,

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:50.050 align:middle line:84%
and mummies, that the Hopis
didn't want anyone to see.

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:56.250 align:middle line:84%
But Seth Tanner saw these things
inside this secret cavern.

00:13:56.250 --> 00:14:00.910 align:middle line:10%
Because Seth Tanner had seen
what was inside the sacred Hopi

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:05.150 align:middle line:10%
caverns, they blinded
him and kept him captive

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:08.140 align:middle line:10%
in a cave for many years.

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:13.550 align:middle line:84%
A photo still exists of Seth
Tanner as a blinded old man.

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:17.450 align:middle line:84%
But what he saw in those
caves has never been divulged

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:19.180 align:middle line:90%
and is still a secret today.

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.790 align:middle line:90%


00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>>The area where this cavern
system is said to exist

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.870 align:middle line:90%
is right before the river.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.920 align:middle line:10%
I think the river curves
around from the North Rim,

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.530 align:middle line:10%
curves around, and
then does a jog back

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:36.980 align:middle line:10%
to the south down towards
the main body of the canyon.

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:41.474 align:middle line:10%
It's in that area that, at least
from my research that I've--

00:14:41.474 --> 00:14:43.390 align:middle line:10%
that's where I would
suspect that it would be.

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:44.950 align:middle line:90%
And it's very inaccessible.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.410 align:middle line:90%
It's extremely hard to get to.

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:49.380 align:middle line:84%
There's quite a number
of good websites

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.440 align:middle line:84%
that actually people have
taken expeditions and mounted

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.510 align:middle line:84%
expeditions and
gone to this area.

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:58.510 align:middle line:84%
It takes several days to
get to if you're hiking.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:01.550 align:middle line:84%
But it is on the eastern
side of the canyon

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.100 align:middle line:90%
on the north side of the river.

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>>I think the
desolation of the area

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:11.720 align:middle line:84%
has prevented any hard
finding of this, rediscovery

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.930 align:middle line:84%
of this place, because it
is a very dangerous place

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:16.330 align:middle line:90%
to go hiking.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Experienced hikers
have been swept away

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.350 align:middle line:84%
to their deaths and their
bodies never found in this area.

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:28.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's a real hard place to
be to make your way around.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:39.070 align:middle line:84%
The Hopi Indians have a number
of prophecies concerning

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:43.640 align:middle line:84%
the end of the fourth world,
the end of today's world

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.250 align:middle line:90%
as we know it.

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:49.420 align:middle line:84%
One of these prophecies
claims that spiderwebs

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.280 align:middle line:90%
will run across their land.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And we can see that today
with the power lines that

00:15:55.940 --> 00:16:00.980 align:middle line:84%
are running all across the Hopi
Indian reservation and Navajo

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.995 align:middle line:84%
Indian reservation here
in Northeast Arizona.

00:16:03.995 --> 00:16:07.900 align:middle line:90%


00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>>Two of these cycles have
occurred in this current world

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:14.170 align:middle line:90%
that we're in.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:17.530 align:middle line:84%
The Maya, similar to the Hopi
and other Southwestern Indians,

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:23.060 align:middle line:84%
have a tradition that we are in
the end of a cycle of worlds.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:28.850 align:middle line:84%
According to the Hopi, the world
was destroyed by fire, by ice,

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:33.100 align:middle line:84%
and we're at the end of
the fourth world right now.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.890 align:middle line:90%
I think fire, wind and ice.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And this particular world,
according to the Hopi,

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.770 align:middle line:84%
is going to be destroyed
by the earth shaking.

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:42.870 align:middle line:84%
The Warrior Twins
are in the ground

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:44.610 align:middle line:84%
right now, holding
Paluliikon, who

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:48.740 align:middle line:84%
is the primordial serpent that
keeps the world in balance.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And because the
people have decided

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:53.500 align:middle line:84%
to turn their back on tradition,
on ceremony, the Warrior Twins

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.070 align:middle line:84%
are going to abdicate
responsibility

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.230 align:middle line:84%
for keeping
Paluliikon, in check,

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:58.500 align:middle line:90%
and they're going to let go.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.180 align:middle line:84%
He will spasm four
times, and the Earth

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.110 align:middle line:90%
will flip over four times.

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:03.990 align:middle line:90%
That is the Hopi version.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:07.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Maya have a very
similar interpretation

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.630 align:middle line:90%
of this particular time cycle.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:12.599 align:middle line:84%
And two of these calendars
have clicked over

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:15.790 align:middle line:84%
like this in the
last 3,200 years.

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:19.859 align:middle line:84%
And whenever this particular
conjunction or turning over,

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:22.359 align:middle line:84%
clicking over from one
cycle to another occurs,

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:25.720 align:middle line:84%
there are cataclysmic changes
that occur in the world.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And so that is where the
interpretation that the world

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.580 align:middle line:84%
is going to end in the pop
culture version has come from,

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.540 align:middle line:84%
because the two cycles prior
to this that this has happened,

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.470 align:middle line:84%
there has been
cataclysmic change.

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:41.520 align:middle line:84%
There appears to be a connection
between Hopi end-of-the-world,

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.770 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, or end-of-cycle
myths and the Mayan

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.690 align:middle line:90%
end-of-cycle myths.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Martin Gashweseoma, who is
the last traditional elder,

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:50.710 align:middle line:84%
considered the last
traditional Hopi elder--

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:53.410 align:middle line:84%
there are some who
are not well known,

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:56.600 align:middle line:84%
but Martin is the most well
known of these traditionals.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:00.740 align:middle line:84%
He has a very interesting,
folded-up Mayan codices,

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:01.940 align:middle line:90%
or it's a piece of paper.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:02.740 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty long.

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:04.460 align:middle line:90%
It's about 4 or 5 feet long.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.480 align:middle line:84%
It has a series of
Mayan glyphs on it.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.220 align:middle line:90%


00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And he says that this Mayan
glyph is the pictorialization

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.820 align:middle line:90%
of the Hopi prophecy.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And he sat down on
several occasions

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:23.430 align:middle line:90%
and explained the progression.

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And you see that
humans at the beginning

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:29.959 align:middle line:84%
have roots going out of their
backsides into the ground

00:18:29.959 --> 00:18:32.250 align:middle line:84%
when they're sitting on the
ground or out of their feet

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.460 align:middle line:84%
into the ground when
they're on their feet.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And as time progresses,
the roots get smaller.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And we are now at a time where
actually not only do we not

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:42.860 align:middle line:84%
have roots that tie
us to Mother Earth,

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.890 align:middle line:84%
but we're actually
floating above the Earth.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And we're at the
last two figures

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and glyphs on this
long strip that he has,

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:54.980 align:middle line:84%
where sergeant-at-arms is
standing behind mankind

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:58.070 align:middle line:84%
with a club and is
about ready to clock us

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:01.380 align:middle line:84%
on the head with this
club and punish us.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And he equates this with the
return of True White Brother,

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:09.690 align:middle line:84%
who has the last missing tablet
that the Hopi are waiting

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:12.640 align:middle line:90%
to have returned to Hopi land.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a similar
version in the Mayan

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.550 align:middle line:84%
prophecy of the cycles ending
at this particular time period.

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And the Hopis have been waiting
for the fulfillment of a number

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:28.130 align:middle line:84%
of prophecies that have been
foretold for 1,000-plus years,

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:29.840 align:middle line:90%
probably thousands of years.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And they are contained
on a series of tablets

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:34.310 align:middle line:84%
that Grandfather Martin
was a custodian of.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:37.560 align:middle line:84%
They're called the Fire
Clan Prophecy Tablets.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:41.550 align:middle line:84%
He observed one of the last
prophecies being fulfilled

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:45.420 align:middle line:84%
in 1989 when during a snowstorm
the sacred purple flower

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.970 align:middle line:84%
of the Hopi came up through
a snowbank and blossomed.

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And then at the same time
during the same storm,

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:54.460 align:middle line:84%
this pear tree bloomed
outside of his house.

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And he took this as fulfillment
of this very important

00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:58.980 align:middle line:90%
prophecy.

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:02.160 align:middle line:84%
He immediately went and
called Governor Bruce King

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.270 align:middle line:84%
of New Mexico and arranged
a press conference

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:07.460 align:middle line:84%
in Santa Fe for
reporters and brought

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.090 align:middle line:84%
out the prophecy tablets
and really got in trouble

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:12.000 align:middle line:90%
back on the res for doing this.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.770 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they stripped him
of the tablets eventually.

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:17.610 align:middle line:84%
But he warned the world,
and he said that when

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:19.270 align:middle line:84%
the War of the Gourd
of Ashes, which

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:21.232 align:middle line:84%
is the major
conflict that's going

00:20:21.232 --> 00:20:23.690 align:middle line:84%
to occur at the end of this
world before True White Brother

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:26.430 align:middle line:84%
comes back and lops
off a bunch of heads--

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:27.820 align:middle line:84%
but this conflict,
he warned, was

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.600 align:middle line:90%
going to start within the year.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough, I
think 9 or 10 months later

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:34.030 align:middle line:90%
is when we invaded--

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:38.322 align:middle line:84%
or kicked Saddam Hussein out
of Kuwait for invading Kuwait.

00:20:38.322 --> 00:20:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And he said that
that was the start

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.420 align:middle line:84%
of this final
conflagration that's going

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.868 align:middle line:90%
to be the end of this world.

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:47.974 align:middle line:90%

and other peoples
here in Arizona.

soccer and basketball.

Down in Mexico, the
game was typically

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:48.870 align:middle line:10%
played with a rubber ball,

Like the Hohokam
cities, it, too,

00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:01.310 align:middle line:84%
is built out of a kind

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Tuzigoot is build by the
Sinagua people, the people

we don't know who they were.

00:26:07.885 --> 00:26:09.160 align:middle line:90%
They disappeared.

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.010 align:middle line:84%
But we believe that they
were related to the Hohokam

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:15.890 align:middle line:84%
and also to the Hopis
of Northern Arizona.

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:18.680 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons that
Tuzigoot might have been here

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:23.630 align:middle line:84%
is that nearby in Jerome,
Arizona, on a mountain

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:28.340 align:middle line:84%
is the ancient mines
used by the Aztecs

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.770 align:middle line:84%
that were then
rediscovered in the 1800s

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:36.780 align:middle line:84%
and then mined as the
modern Jerome copper mines.

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:41.880 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the ancient Hopi trail
coming from the Hopi mesas

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:45.560 align:middle line:84%
came down into this
area right here

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.800 align:middle line:84%
to Tuzigoot and to
the Blue Mountain,

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:53.260 align:middle line:90%
where Jerome sits today.

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.980 align:middle line:84%
So here we have evidence of
ancient mining by the Hohokam

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:02.450 align:middle line:84%
and of the same kind
of building techniques.

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:06.480 align:middle line:84%
So it seems possible that
the Hohokam had spread

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:11.080 align:middle line:84%
far into Northern Arizona,
bringing their ball courts

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:15.070 align:middle line:84%
and other technology, such
as concrete, with them.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:05.102 align:middle line:84%
was a huge metallurgical area,
washing oars out and making

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:59.330 align:middle line:84%

although there is evidence

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:01.840 align:middle line:84%
that these pyramids are
much older than that

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:11.010 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid of
the Sun at Teotihuacan

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:15.610 align:middle line:84%
was actually built
over a natural cave.

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And this cave was in
a cloverleaf shape.

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And some archaeologists believe
that a natural spring emanated

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:28.550 align:middle line:84%
out of this cave
and water flowed out

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:32.550 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid of the
Sun and into the streets

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:34.910 align:middle line:90%
of Teotihuacan.

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:39.480 align:middle line:84%
In this theory, Teotihuacan
was a water city,

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.220 align:middle line:90%
and water was all over the city.

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:46.030 align:middle line:84%

building to building in a boat.

One reason why
Teotihuacan might have

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:58.130 align:middle line:84%
been a giant hydrological
works was that this

00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:01.150 align:middle line:90%
was an ore processing area.

into certain areas

or was washed by the water.

And then copper and silver
and gold and other metals

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:16.750 align:middle line:84%

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:54.910 align:middle line:84%
when they were building
an insane asylum here.

00:33:54.910 --> 00:34:01.540 align:middle line:84%
Up until that time, they thought
that this giant pyramid was

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:03.510 align:middle line:90%
just a hill covered with dirt.

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:04.310 align:middle line:90%
In fact.

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:06.730 align:middle line:84%
They built a church
on top of it.

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:10.820 align:middle line:84%
But today, we know that the
Great Pyramid of Cholula

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:16.199 align:middle line:84%
is the largest pyramid in Mexico
and the second largest pyramid

00:34:16.199 --> 00:34:21.100 align:middle line:84%
in the world after the
Great Pyramid of Egypt.

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:24.856 align:middle line:84%
This pyramid is dedicated
to Quetzalcoatl.

00:34:24.856 --> 00:34:28.969 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, exactly
how this pyramid came

00:34:28.969 --> 00:34:33.850 align:middle line:84%
to be covered completely
in dirt to look like a hill

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:35.389 align:middle line:90%
is still a mystery.

00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:38.820 align:middle line:84%
One of the explanations
is that this pyramid was

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:41.750 align:middle line:84%
so sacred to the
ancient Mexicans

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:44.690 align:middle line:84%
that when the
Spanish invaded, they

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:47.460 align:middle line:84%
didn't want this
pyramid destroyed,

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and so in a few weeks, they
went through tremendous effort

00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:55.219 align:middle line:90%
to bury the pyramid.

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:58.000 align:middle line:84%
We can see from this
section of the pyramid

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.190 align:middle line:84%
where Mexican archaeologists
have restored it,

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:04.500 align:middle line:84%
we get a good idea of what
the pyramid originally looked

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:07.080 align:middle line:90%
like when it was being used.

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it not only
was gigantically huge,

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:14.656 align:middle line:84%
but beautifully
spectacular as well.

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:30.510 align:middle line:84%
One of the things about the
Great Pyramid here of Cholula

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:33.110 align:middle line:84%
is that archaeologists say
that it was constructed

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:36.370 align:middle line:84%
over an ancient spring
and that water poured out

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:37.780 align:middle line:90%
of the pyramid.

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:40.080 align:middle line:84%
This is also what
we are theorizing

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:44.540 align:middle line:84%
happened with the pyramids at
Teotihuacan, that water also

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:48.991 align:middle line:84%
was coming out of the pyramid
and flooding that ancient city.

00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:52.680 align:middle line:90%


00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:56.630 align:middle line:84%
So follow me as we go deep
inside the Great Pyramid

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:58.380 align:middle line:90%
of Cholula.

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Mexican archaeologists
have actually

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:04.470 align:middle line:84%
cut these tunnels
inside of the pyramid

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:07.630 align:middle line:84%
so that they could
go deep into the core

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:12.210 align:middle line:84%
and see if there were any
tombs or natural caverns.

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:16.080 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to see how the
pyramid was constructed.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And as we get
deeper inside, we'll

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:22.900 align:middle line:84%
see many side passages, some
going up, some going down.

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And even we'll find some

One of the tunnels is going
deep down inside the pyramid.

This is probably to
the natural cave,

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:20.210 align:middle line:84%
where there was originally a
spring and water came out of.

Cortez was a light-skinned

It's thought to be one of the

archaeologists often date this

However, it is covered
partially by a lava flow.

00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And back in the
1920s, geologists

00:47:07.690 --> 00:47:13.630 align:middle line:84%
speculated that this lava
flow was over 8,000 years old.

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Since the pyramid had to be
built before it was covered

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:19.270 align:middle line:84%
by a lava flow,
this would indicate

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:23.910 align:middle line:84%
that this pyramid is not 2,000
years old, but over 8,000 years

old.

to.

It's actually so old

have been built by the Olmecs.

Recent excavations

the Olmecs were indeed

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:49.520 align:middle line:84%
in the area of Mexico City
and in the area of Cuicuilco.

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:53.684 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that the ancient
Olmecs built this pyramid?
