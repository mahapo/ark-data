chose to identify not

identification to my soul.

soul didn't have a stroke, just

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.485 align:middle line:90%

with the soul,

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:44.820 align:middle line:84%
I found out the soul
merely witnesses the drama,

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.665 align:middle line:90%

rather than suffer with it.

as I'm concerned,

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:25.490 align:middle line:84%
I used mushrooms, my
psychedelic mushrooms.

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:30.780 align:middle line:90%


00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:34.450 align:middle line:90%
They were grace for us.

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:41.520 align:middle line:90%


00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:47.520 align:middle line:84%
The psychedelic
mushrooms and the LSD

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:56.280 align:middle line:84%
showed me three inside
myself and showed me

00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:00.890 align:middle line:90%
that three was connected to God.

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:07.860 align:middle line:90%


00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.790 align:middle line:90%
The mushrooms.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:13.730 align:middle line:90%
I was in Tim's living room.

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:17.600 align:middle line:90%


00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:24.410 align:middle line:90%
And I was alone in there.

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And I suddenly
realized there was

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:28.730 align:middle line:90%
somebody in the room with me.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.510 align:middle line:90%


00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:34.450 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at the shadows.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:37.380 align:middle line:90%
Somebody there.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.155 align:middle line:90%
And it was me.

00:18:38.155 --> 00:18:41.020 align:middle line:90%


00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:46.660 align:middle line:84%
It was me by all the
ways to know myself.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.700 align:middle line:90%
All my roles.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.145 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three, four.

00:18:52.145 --> 00:18:56.450 align:middle line:90%


00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:58.690 align:middle line:90%
My role as a professor.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:01.400 align:middle line:90%
My role as a pilot.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.920 align:middle line:90%
My role as my parent's child.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:13.690 align:middle line:90%


00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:21.815 align:middle line:84%
And then I said, well, I'm
getting rid of all my roles.

00:19:21.815 --> 00:19:27.650 align:middle line:90%


00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:33.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's sort of like amnesia.

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:36.230 align:middle line:84%
That's what this drug
is going to do to me.

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:37.660 align:middle line:90%
This wicked Tim Leary.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:40.090 align:middle line:90%
[LIGHT LAUGHTER]

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:43.500 align:middle line:90%


00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.665 align:middle line:90%
See, I was a good guy.

00:19:44.665 --> 00:19:48.650 align:middle line:90%


00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:50.802 align:middle line:90%
He was the bad guy.

00:19:50.802 --> 00:19:53.778 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:53.778 --> 00:19:59.240 align:middle line:90%


00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:03.260 align:middle line:90%
And then I looked down.

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:07.100 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, at
least I have my body.

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And I looked down with my eyes
open and looked at the couch.

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.704 align:middle line:90%
And there was no body on it.

00:20:14.704 --> 00:20:17.656 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:17.656 --> 00:20:21.600 align:middle line:90%


00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that I was on
another plane of consciousness

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:39.055 align:middle line:90%
than the one my body was on.

00:20:39.055 --> 00:20:51.130 align:middle line:90%


00:20:51.130 --> 00:21:08.750 align:middle line:84%
After that mushroom session,
after that I couldn't-- Tim

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:17.670 align:middle line:84%
and Ralph and me and the group
was working with the "Tibetan

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:20.670 align:middle line:90%
Book of the Dead."

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And here in this book used to
initiate monks for their death,

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:57.135 align:middle line:84%
I was reading descriptions of
my psychedelic experiences.

00:21:57.135 --> 00:21:59.870 align:middle line:90%


00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And I thought those easterners--
I was a psychologist here

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.540 align:middle line:90%
in the West.

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:15.090 align:middle line:84%
But nothing I did in
my psychological work

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:22.460 align:middle line:84%
in research or teaching
gave me the feeling

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:32.900 align:middle line:84%
or opened the feeling that I was
getting that mushroom session.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:36.980 align:middle line:84%
I was getting a
feeling of at homeness.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:37.510 align:middle line:90%
At homeness.

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:40.280 align:middle line:90%


00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:45.490 align:middle line:90%
I was at home in the universe.

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:46.780 align:middle line:90%
I was not worried.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:23:04.590 align:middle line:84%
I was just-- So
I read this book,

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:09.030 align:middle line:84%
"The Tibetan Book of the
Dead," and "The Bhagavad Gita,"

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:11.360 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And I said, these
easterners know something

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:22.860 align:middle line:90%
about what I'm going through.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:25.710 align:middle line:84%
They've written maps
of consciousness.

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:28.430 align:middle line:90%


00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And my friends were
going to India.

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:40.040 align:middle line:90%
Allen Ginsberg, Tim, Ralph.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:44.720 align:middle line:90%


00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.780 align:middle line:90%
So I figured I'm going to India.

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:57.114 align:middle line:90%


00:23:57.114 --> 00:23:58.113 align:middle line:90%
Planes of consciousness.

00:23:58.113 --> 00:24:01.070 align:middle line:90%


00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:11.440 align:middle line:84%
If you look at India from
this plane of consciousness,

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.510 align:middle line:90%
so many people.

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:17.110 align:middle line:90%


00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:24.330 align:middle line:84%
When I came into India, I
came in a friend's Land Rover.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:27.440 align:middle line:90%


00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And I was appalled at how much
the population was putting up

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:35.550 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:47.580 align:middle line:90%


00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:56.640 align:middle line:84%
But three months
later, I had seen

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:03.930 align:middle line:84%
something I had realized
that they were living

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:11.780 align:middle line:84%
on a different plane
than I was having landed

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:13.885 align:middle line:90%
in the plane from New York.

00:25:13.885 --> 00:25:23.830 align:middle line:90%


00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:27.415 align:middle line:84%
The place where
Hindus go to die.

00:25:27.415 --> 00:25:35.480 align:middle line:90%


00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.605 align:middle line:90%
The city.

00:25:36.605 --> 00:25:39.225 align:middle line:90%


00:25:39.225 --> 00:25:44.355 align:middle line:84%
And they burned at the
side of the Ganges River.

00:25:44.355 --> 00:25:53.130 align:middle line:90%


00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And I was appalled
to see the scene.

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:02.320 align:middle line:90%


00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:06.340 align:middle line:84%
There were people with cancer,
and there were people with--

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:10.705 align:middle line:90%


00:26:10.705 --> 00:26:11.675 align:middle line:90%
>>Leprosy.

00:26:11.675 --> 00:26:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>>What?

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>>Leprosy.

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:14.100 align:middle line:90%
Leprosy.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.766 align:middle line:90%
>>Leprosy.

00:26:15.766 --> 00:26:16.266 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:16.266 --> 00:26:17.970 align:middle line:90%
Leprosy.

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:20.690 align:middle line:90%
They were walking around.

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:27.860 align:middle line:84%
They were each
wearing a little pouch

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:34.740 align:middle line:84%
on the side on
their lungi, a pouch

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:43.500 align:middle line:84%
containing money, which they
were buying their funeral pyre.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:54.410 align:middle line:90%


00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And then I went and
stayed in a temple.

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:00.525 align:middle line:90%
Many temples.

00:27:00.525 --> 00:27:04.010 align:middle line:90%


00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And I got a sense that
I had shifted planes.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:15.660 align:middle line:90%


00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And then I came
back to the city--

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:43.100 align:middle line:84%
the dying city-- and the
people on the streets,

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:48.850 align:middle line:84%
they were looking
at me with pity.

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:50.980 align:middle line:90%
These people on the streets.

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:53.490 align:middle line:90%


00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:55.420 align:middle line:90%
Their legs were like this.

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:58.300 align:middle line:90%


00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:03.170 align:middle line:84%
They were looking
at me with pity

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:09.740 align:middle line:84%
because I was like
a hungry ghost.

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:19.510 align:middle line:84%
They knew they were in the
right place at the right time

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:21.730 align:middle line:90%
from their spiritual trip.

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:24.300 align:middle line:90%


00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And they were
looking at me, even

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:32.060 align:middle line:84%
though I had traveler's
checks and everything,

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:34.552 align:middle line:84%
they were looking
at me with pity.

00:28:34.552 --> 00:28:38.070 align:middle line:90%


00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And I could see it the next time
after I'd been in those temples

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:59.190 align:middle line:84%
because I wasn't so frozen
in material reality.

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:07.660 align:middle line:90%


00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:11.570 align:middle line:90%
This is for this audience.

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:32.880 align:middle line:84%
I was at John Lilly's house and
Richard Feynman, the physicist,

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.370 align:middle line:90%
came by.

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:44.105 align:middle line:84%
And I was telling him about my
guru because I was a rascal.

00:29:44.105 --> 00:29:47.400 align:middle line:90%


00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And so one story
I told, Maharaji

00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:01.300 align:middle line:84%
had appeared in
two places at once.

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:04.680 align:middle line:90%


00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:08.144 align:middle line:84%
And Richard really
couldn't accept that.

00:30:08.144 --> 00:30:09.840 align:middle line:90%
[LIGHT LAUGHTER]

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:17.240 align:middle line:84%
He said the foundation
of my science

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:27.505 align:middle line:84%
is that a thing can not
appear in two places.

00:30:27.505 --> 00:30:30.700 align:middle line:90%


00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:34.243 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, you
got a problem--

00:30:34.243 --> 00:30:36.410 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:38.350 align:middle line:90%
--because Maharaji did.

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:55.720 align:middle line:90%


00:30:55.720 --> 00:31:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Maharaji, he gave me-- he gave
me freedom from my method.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:22.675 align:middle line:90%
Method of psychedelics.

00:31:22.675 --> 00:31:25.800 align:middle line:90%


00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.950 align:middle line:90%
There's two methods.

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:32.250 align:middle line:90%
One method-- guru.

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:36.050 align:middle line:90%
Method-- mushrooms.

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:46.890 align:middle line:84%
So in the first
time I went there,

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:50.850 align:middle line:84%
after he started to get
to know me, he said,

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:56.008 align:middle line:84%
do you have those
vitamins for the mind?

00:31:56.008 --> 00:31:59.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:01.813 align:middle line:90%
I guess he had my reputation.

00:32:01.813 --> 00:32:04.560 align:middle line:90%


00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:19.387 align:middle line:84%
So I had three pills
300 micrograms each--

00:32:19.387 --> 00:32:22.310 align:middle line:90%
[EXCLAMATIONS]

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:25.985 align:middle line:84%
--which each one is
a good sizable dose.

00:32:25.985 --> 00:32:30.080 align:middle line:90%


00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And he took them off my
hand-- three of them.

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:47.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm saying to myself,
this guy knows everything,

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:52.490 align:middle line:84%
so I don't have to caution
him about the drugs.

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:55.850 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:57.780 align:middle line:90%


00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:00.990 align:middle line:90%
So he put the drugs like that.

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:05.730 align:middle line:90%


00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:11.820 align:middle line:84%
When I got home
in America, I kept

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:17.420 align:middle line:84%
wondering-- first of all,
nothing happened to him at all.

00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:12.180 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't imagine
getting stroked when

00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:18.150 align:middle line:90%
my Guru was looking after me.

00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:21.920 align:middle line:90%


00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:25.010 align:middle line:90%
He was looking the other way.

00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:35.930 align:middle line:90%


00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:41.520 align:middle line:84%
I was checking out
in the hospital.

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:57.960 align:middle line:90%


00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Because all the consciousness
is around me were--

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:09.180 align:middle line:90%
[CLICKING TONGUE]

00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:12.760 align:middle line:90%
--too bad, too bad the stroke.

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:14.550 align:middle line:90%
Too bad.

00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:15.180 align:middle line:90%
Too bad.

00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:17.690 align:middle line:90%


00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And I began to feel
it was too bad.

00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:28.300 align:middle line:90%


00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And then it started to creep in
that the stroke was introducing

00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:45.470 align:middle line:90%
me to silence.

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:51.180 align:middle line:90%


00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:53.065 align:middle line:90%
At the time I couldn't talk.

00:52:53.065 --> 00:52:59.240 align:middle line:90%


00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:02.996 align:middle line:84%
Then I began to realize this
was another incarnation.

00:53:02.996 --> 00:53:08.370 align:middle line:90%


00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:19.310 align:middle line:84%
Because in the last
incarnation, Paul Gorman and I

00:53:19.310 --> 00:53:27.890 align:middle line:84%
wrote a book called
"How Can I Help?"

00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:31.130 align:middle line:84%
But now I write a book,
"How Can You Help Me?"

00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:33.845 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:33.845 --> 00:53:37.150 align:middle line:90%


00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Because the "How Can I Help?"
is a power play in the society.

00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:47.170 align:middle line:90%


00:53:47.170 --> 00:54:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And "How Can You Help Me?"
is dependency, lack of power.

00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:06.400 align:middle line:90%


00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And I saw these
roles, and these roles

00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:27.870 align:middle line:84%
I never expected to play
in this incarnation.

00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:37.960 align:middle line:90%


00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:42.640 align:middle line:84%
The stroke pushed
me over the edge.

00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:46.310 align:middle line:90%


00:54:46.310 --> 00:54:56.960 align:middle line:84%
How far over the edge
remains-- The doctors

00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:03.960 align:middle line:84%
had a case conference
with me as the case.

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:05.670 align:middle line:90%
And they were very, very nice.

00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:10.042 align:middle line:90%
They invited me to come in.

00:55:10.042 --> 00:55:12.886 align:middle line:90%
[LIGHT LAUGHTER]

00:55:12.886 --> 00:55:14.790 align:middle line:90%


00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And I said are you
equating me with my brain?

00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:30.110 align:middle line:90%


00:55:30.110 --> 00:55:35.120 align:middle line:84%
I said, you know,
I am not a thing.

00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:40.230 align:middle line:90%


00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:42.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a material thing.

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:48.020 align:middle line:90%


00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:50.784 align:middle line:90%
And they all sat round to--

00:55:50.784 --> 00:55:52.200 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:54.180 align:middle line:90%
--I love those things.

00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:55.830 align:middle line:90%
They looked at each other.

00:55:55.830 --> 00:55:58.340 align:middle line:90%


00:55:58.340 --> 00:56:01.921 align:middle line:84%
It's too bad this
man got a stroke.

00:56:01.921 --> 00:56:05.358 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:05.358 --> 00:56:07.820 align:middle line:90%


00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:09.990 align:middle line:90%
Oh, dear.

00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:16.290 align:middle line:90%
One nurse I got to come clean.

00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:21.274 align:middle line:84%
She didn't feel she
was a thing either.

00:56:21.274 --> 00:56:24.662 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:24.662 --> 00:56:43.220 align:middle line:90%


00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:48.180 align:middle line:84%
I was reading
Romana Maharshi, who

00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:58.540 align:middle line:84%
is one of the outstanding
saints in the 20th century.

00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:02.340 align:middle line:90%


00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:04.430 align:middle line:90%
And he was quoting Shankara.

00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:08.350 align:middle line:90%


00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And this quote really
covers number three.

00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:21.060 align:middle line:90%
Number three.

00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:23.600 align:middle line:90%
You also are.

00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:28.400 align:middle line:90%


00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:37.800 align:middle line:84%
The Johnny, a sage,
self-realized being,

00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:46.110 align:middle line:84%
who through experience has
realized his Self-- capital S,

00:57:46.110 --> 00:57:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Self-- and the Atman
to be the Brahman

00:57:52.400 --> 00:58:05.680 align:middle line:84%
means the spark in you--
number three-- is one with God.

00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:06.180 align:middle line:90%
Brahman.

00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:10.270 align:middle line:90%


00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:22.570 align:middle line:84%
As truth, as knowledge,
as endless bliss,

00:58:22.570 --> 00:58:27.700 align:middle line:90%
the single essence eternality.

00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:33.130 align:middle line:90%


00:58:33.130 --> 00:58:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Boy, when you're
rushing these streets,

00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:43.195 align:middle line:90%
think of I that is eternal.

00:58:43.195 --> 00:58:49.400 align:middle line:90%


00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:52.190 align:middle line:90%
Your three is eternal.

00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:53.292 align:middle line:90%
It's part of God.

00:58:53.292 --> 00:58:57.230 align:middle line:90%


00:58:57.230 --> 00:59:04.180 align:middle line:84%
For him who aspires
after liberation, moksha,

00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:13.990 align:middle line:84%
there is no other way
of release from bondage

00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:22.780 align:middle line:84%
but knowledge of the identity
of Brahman and the self,

00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:32.750 align:middle line:84%
meaning number three in
you and us will become

00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:36.430 align:middle line:90%
it is identical with God.

00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:42.060 align:middle line:90%


00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:47.440 align:middle line:84%
But you don't talk
when you're like three.

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:49.165 align:middle line:90%
Maharaji was three.

00:59:49.165 --> 00:59:54.200 align:middle line:90%


00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:57.090 align:middle line:90%
He was identity with three.

00:59:57.090 --> 00:59:59.730 align:middle line:90%


00:59:59.730 --> 01:00:05.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm climbing up to one to two.

01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:13.890 align:middle line:90%


01:00:13.890 --> 01:00:20.460 align:middle line:84%
One you've got to clean it
up so it doesn't draw you.

01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:24.020 align:middle line:90%


01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.686 align:middle line:90%
Clean up of its attachments.

01:00:25.686 --> 01:00:29.130 align:middle line:90%


01:00:29.130 --> 01:00:34.885 align:middle line:84%
See number two has
only one motivation.

01:00:34.885 --> 01:00:44.120 align:middle line:90%


01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:48.870 align:middle line:84%
It wants only to merge
with the beloved.

01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:51.820 align:middle line:90%


01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:54.530 align:middle line:90%
With the One.

01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:57.030 align:middle line:90%
That's in you.

01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:58.610 align:middle line:90%
That's in you.

01:00:58.610 --> 01:01:15.070 align:middle line:84%
You are a soul having one
motivation to that ecstatic

01:01:15.070 --> 01:01:20.300 align:middle line:90%
merging with it all.

01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:30.690 align:middle line:90%


01:01:30.690 --> 01:01:40.365 align:middle line:84%
I've been studying Dzogchen,
Tibetan Buddhist meditation.

01:01:40.365 --> 01:01:45.960 align:middle line:90%


01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:53.345 align:middle line:84%
In that meditation you
identify with your awareness.

01:01:53.345 --> 01:01:56.460 align:middle line:90%


01:01:56.460 --> 01:02:05.155 align:middle line:84%
You don't identify with
what it's aware of.

01:02:05.155 --> 01:02:07.690 align:middle line:90%


01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:12.410 align:middle line:90%
I am aware of this body.

01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:15.660 align:middle line:84%
I am not identifying
with this body.

01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:18.715 align:middle line:90%
I am identifying with awareness.

01:02:18.715 --> 01:02:23.730 align:middle line:90%


01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:30.950 align:middle line:84%
If you identify with
awareness-- by the way,

01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:37.910 align:middle line:84%
you cannot study awareness
because awareness is not

01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:39.610 align:middle line:90%
a thing.

01:02:39.610 --> 01:02:41.580 align:middle line:90%
You can only be awareness.

01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:44.860 align:middle line:90%


01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:46.710 align:middle line:90%
You cannot see awareness.

01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:50.020 align:middle line:90%


01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:54.880 align:middle line:84%
If you have your
awareness and I have mine,

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:57.120 align:middle line:90%
we are together in awareness.

01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:59.770 align:middle line:90%


01:02:59.770 --> 01:03:01.490 align:middle line:90%
That's three.

01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:10.780 align:middle line:90%


01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:15.755 align:middle line:84%
We are aware in
many different ways.

01:03:15.755 --> 01:03:19.220 align:middle line:90%


01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:28.910 align:middle line:84%
I was in the planes of
India with this fellow

01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:31.120 align:middle line:90%
who is going to his Guru.

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:39.140 align:middle line:90%


01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:41.296 align:middle line:90%
I had to go to the bathroom.

01:03:41.296 --> 01:03:44.050 align:middle line:90%


01:03:44.050 --> 01:03:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And I went to the outhouse, and
it was a star-studded night.

01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And because the
stars were so near,

01:03:58.810 --> 01:04:10.470 align:middle line:84%
I thought about my mother who
had died six months before.

01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:13.300 align:middle line:90%
And then I got back into bed.

01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And I was a passenger
in this car.

01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:24.280 align:middle line:90%


01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:27.484 align:middle line:84%
This fellow wanted
to find his Guru.

01:04:27.484 --> 01:04:31.340 align:middle line:90%


01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:35.290 align:middle line:90%
We rode 170 miles.

01:04:35.290 --> 01:04:50.720 align:middle line:90%


01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And the fellow says,
this is the temple.

01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:56.150 align:middle line:90%


01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:59.620 align:middle line:90%
And I was recalcitrant.

01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:04.260 align:middle line:90%


01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:08.970 align:middle line:84%
This fellow I was
with, his Guru,

01:05:08.970 --> 01:05:16.349 align:middle line:90%
he's bowing on his stomach.

01:05:16.349 --> 01:05:16.890 align:middle line:90%
Dunda Pranam.

01:05:16.890 --> 01:05:19.530 align:middle line:90%


01:05:19.530 --> 01:05:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm standing by thinking,
I'm not going to do that.

01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:28.310 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm just a Westerner.

01:05:28.310 --> 01:05:31.755 align:middle line:84%
We don't go around
touching people's feet.

01:05:31.755 --> 01:05:34.230 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:37.210 align:middle line:90%


01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And so then he gave us
some talk-- a little talk.

01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:53.530 align:middle line:90%
Then he sent us some food.

01:05:53.530 --> 01:06:01.455 align:middle line:84%
And then he said to the fellow,
have you got a picture of me?

01:06:01.455 --> 01:06:04.690 align:middle line:90%


01:06:04.690 --> 01:06:06.630 align:middle line:90%
Fellow has a picture of him.

01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:10.495 align:middle line:90%
He said, give him the picture.

01:06:10.495 --> 01:06:10.995 align:middle line:90%
Me.

01:06:10.995 --> 01:06:15.370 align:middle line:90%


01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:19.870 align:middle line:84%
I think, well he wants to
have me have a picture of him.

01:06:19.870 --> 01:06:23.300 align:middle line:90%


01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:25.150 align:middle line:90%
We came up in this big car.

01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:29.240 align:middle line:90%


01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Land Rover, which belonged
to my friend, David.

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And this fellow who was touching
the guru's feet-- the guru

01:06:43.370 --> 01:06:48.950 align:middle line:90%
said, you came in a big car.

01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:51.580 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes.

01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:56.980 align:middle line:84%
