00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>Dr. Michio Kaku, who is an
internationally-recognized

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.240 align:middle line:84%
authority in
theoretical physics.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.570 align:middle line:84%
He holds the Henry
Semat Professorship

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.560 align:middle line:84%
in Theoretical Physics
at the City College

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.440 align:middle line:84%
and the Graduate Center of the
City University of New York.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.650 align:middle line:84%
His goal is to help
complete Einstein's dream

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.530 align:middle line:84%
of a theory of
everything, which will

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.630 align:middle line:84%
unify all the fundamental
forces in the universe.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.960 align:middle line:84%
Professor Kaku has
written nine books.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.040 align:middle line:84%
The last two, "Hyperspace"
and "Visions,"

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.530 align:middle line:84%
becoming international
best sellers.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And just a little
sidelight-- New York Magazine

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.840 align:middle line:84%
recently had a
contest, and Dr. Kaku

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.970 align:middle line:84%
was selected as one of the 100
smartest people in New York.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.777 align:middle line:84%
Let's give a warm welcome
to Dr. Michio Kaku.

00:01:23.777 --> 00:01:28.160 align:middle line:90%


00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>>It is true that New
York Magazine selected me

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.540 align:middle line:84%
as one of the 100 smartest
people in New York City.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.040 align:middle line:84%
However, in all fairness,
I should point out

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.450 align:middle line:84%
that Madonna also
made that same list.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.150 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.040 align:middle line:90%
Very smart woman.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.160 align:middle line:90%


00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, today, I'll be
talking about some

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.760 align:middle line:84%
of the revolutionary
breakthroughs taking place

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.720 align:middle line:84%
in the world of
physics and science.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And Stephen Hawking
has said that we

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.980 align:middle line:84%
are on the verge of, quote,
"reading the mind of God."

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.850 align:middle line:90%
However, we have to be humble.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.130 align:middle line:84%
There's one thing I've
learned being a physicist,

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.580 align:middle line:84%
and that is we have
to be humble when

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.550 align:middle line:84%
we approach the great
mysteries of the universe.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.050 align:middle line:84%
As Professor Haldane once
said, "The universe is not

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.420 align:middle line:84%
only queerer than we
suppose, it is queerer

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.710 align:middle line:90%
than we can suppose."

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And today, I will be
talking about the future.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.650 align:middle line:84%
What does the future
hold as we physicists

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.640 align:middle line:84%
close in on a comprehensive
theory of hyperspace?

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's very dangerous
talking about the future.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Yogi Berra-- let me now
quote from that great sage

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.350 align:middle line:90%
of the baseball diamond.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Yogi Berra once said, quote,
"Prediction is very hard to do,

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.480 align:middle line:84%
especially if it's
about the future."

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.320 align:middle line:84%
To which Abraham Lincoln
might have said, quote,

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.100 align:middle line:84%
"Gentlemen, sometimes,
it is better

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.730 align:middle line:84%
to keep your mouth shut,
even if your friends think

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.550 align:middle line:84%
of you as a fool,
rather than to open it

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.510 align:middle line:90%
up and remove all doubts."

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, today, I will be opening
the mouths of scientists,

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.360 align:middle line:84%
my colleagues, Steven
Hawking, and others who are,

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.770 align:middle line:84%
we think, closing in on
a theory of the universe.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.040 align:middle line:84%
However, I should also point
out that we physicists sometimes

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.380 align:middle line:84%
get too cocky, and
we make predictions

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.930 align:middle line:90%
that don't turn out.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.340 align:middle line:84%
We physicists
invented the internet.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.290 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was a
theoretician in Switzerland

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.695 align:middle line:90%
who created the worldwide web.

00:03:37.695 --> 00:03:41.090 align:middle line:84%
The internet was our
baby, our creation.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And we made a prediction
for the internet.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.020 align:middle line:84%
We predicted that it would
be a forum for high culture

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.960 align:middle line:90%
and high intellectual learning.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, today, we know that 10%
of the internet is pornography.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
mainly teenage boys

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.640 align:middle line:90%
log on to the internet.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Just wait till the grandmas and
grandpas log onto the internet.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.715 align:middle line:84%
Then 50% of the internet
will be pornography.

00:04:09.715 --> 00:04:12.650 align:middle line:90%


00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we physicists
in the past have been

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.610 align:middle line:90%
too arrogant and too cocky.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, we know
too much for our own good.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.810 align:middle line:90%
Let me tell you a story.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.850 align:middle line:84%
Because next week,
I'm speaking in Paris

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.330 align:middle line:84%
where, of course, 200 years ago,
they had a great revolution.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me tell you
a story about that.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.510 align:middle line:84%
200 years ago, there
were three gentleman

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.370 align:middle line:84%
about to lose their
head to the guillotine

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.670 align:middle line:84%
because they were members
of the aristocracy.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.160 align:middle line:84%
There was a priest, a lawyer,
and a theoretical physicist,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.320 align:middle line:84%
just like me, about to lose
our head to the chopping block.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, they put the priest's
head on the chopping block.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And they asked him, do
you have any last words

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.000 align:middle line:84%
before we cut your
aristocratic head off?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.850 align:middle line:90%
And he said yes.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:09.680 align:middle line:84%
He said, God, from above, from
heaven, he shall set me free.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, we'll see about
that, said the executioner.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.660 align:middle line:84%
So they put the priest's
head on the chopping block.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And they raised the
guillotine blade.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.260 align:middle line:90%
And the blade came down-- swish.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And it stopped right before
it hit the neck of the priest.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.600 align:middle line:90%
Well, the crowd gasped.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.170 align:middle line:84%
They'd never seen
anything like this before.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.970 align:middle line:90%
This was a miracle, they said.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.550 align:middle line:90%
Let him go.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.300 align:middle line:90%
Now let's see about that lawyer.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, they put the lawyer's
head on the chopping block.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And they asked him, do
you have any last words

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.420 align:middle line:90%
before we cut your head off?

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's see you talk your way
out of this one, Mr. Lawyer.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, he said, maybe the
spirit of justice in the sky,

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.310 align:middle line:84%
maybe she shall set
me free, I hope.

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.970 align:middle line:90%
Well, the blade came up.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.340 align:middle line:90%
And the blade came down-- swish.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.944 align:middle line:84%
And it stopped right before
it hit the neck of the lawyer.

00:06:03.944 --> 00:06:05.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, this time,
there was dancing

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.640 align:middle line:90%
in the streets of Paris.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.980 align:middle line:84%
People were saying,
God has spoken.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.430 align:middle line:90%
Let the priest go.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.750 align:middle line:90%
Let the lawyer go.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And now let's see about
that theoretical physicist.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, they put the physicist's
head on the chopping block.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And they asked him, do
you have any last words

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.300 align:middle line:84%
before we cut your
scientific head off?

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.120 align:middle line:90%
And the physicists said, yeah.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I got some last words.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know, I
don't know too much about God,

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.530 align:middle line:84%
and I know even
less about the law.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:50.070 align:middle line:84%
But I do know one
thing-- if you look up,

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.480 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that the rope
has caught on the pulley.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.860 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, if
you remove the rope,

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.750 align:middle line:84%
the blade should
come down real good.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.120 align:middle line:90%
Big mistake.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.920 align:middle line:90%
Big mistake.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.940 align:middle line:90%
Well, the rope came down.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.160 align:middle line:90%
The pulley came down.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.630 align:middle line:90%
The blade came down.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.640 align:middle line:90%
The physicist's head came down.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And it just goes to show you
that sometimes, we physicists

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.070 align:middle line:90%
get too cocky for our own good.

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, as Lincoln said,
we should keep our mouth shut.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me tell you how
I got involved in science.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.020 align:middle line:84%
When I was a kid,
I was fascinated

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.310 align:middle line:90%
by the work of Einstein.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.440 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I
was a child of eight,

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.620 align:middle line:90%
it was in all the papers.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.540 align:middle line:84%
My elementary school
teacher announced that day

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:48.060 align:middle line:84%
that a great scientist
had just died.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Very few people
understood what he said,

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.460 align:middle line:90%
but he changed everything.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.100 align:middle line:90%
The bomb, the universe.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.620 align:middle line:84%
But you see, that night,
on the newspapers,

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.360 align:middle line:84%
they flashed a
picture of his desk.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Because on that desk was
the unfinished manuscript

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.460 align:middle line:90%
of his greatest unfinished work.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:14.650 align:middle line:84%
It was to be the Unified
Field Theory, the theory

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:18.510 align:middle line:84%
of everything, the theory
that would unite the Big

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Bang with quasars,
stars, galaxies,

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.250 align:middle line:84%
all the ferment we
see in the heavens,

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:29.770 align:middle line:84%
with physics on the planet
Earth, people, maybe even love.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:31.280 align:middle line:90%
But he died.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And I said to
myself, as a kid, I

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:39.230 align:middle line:84%
want to know what was in
that unfinished manuscript.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.190 align:middle line:84%
To me, this was greater
than any detective story,

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:44.159 align:middle line:90%
greater than any murder mystery.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:48.060 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to complete
what was in that book.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in
high school, I was

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:54.795 align:middle line:84%
so enamored of this new physics
that I went to my mom one day.

00:08:54.795 --> 00:08:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And I said, mom, can
I have permission

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.950 align:middle line:84%
to build a 2.3 million
electron volt atom

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.930 align:middle line:90%
smasher in the garage?

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And my mom scratched her
head and said, sure, why not?

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And don't forget to take out
the garbage while you're at it.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, I went to Westinghouse.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:20.960 align:middle line:84%
I got 400 pounds of transformer
steel, 22 miles of copper wire.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And I built a 2.3 million
electron volt 6 kilowatt

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.470 align:middle line:90%
betatron in the garage.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.830 align:middle line:84%
The moment had finally
come to turn it on.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:33.290 align:middle line:84%
I closed my eyes, covered
my ears, and plugged it in.

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:36.120 align:middle line:84%
There was this huge
crackling as I blew out

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.680 align:middle line:84%
every single transformer,
every single fuse,

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.080 align:middle line:84%
every single circuit
breaker in the house.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And the whole house was
plunged in darkness.

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:45.680 align:middle line:90%
My poor mom.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.830 align:middle line:84%
My mom would say to
herself, why couldn't I

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:53.450 align:middle line:90%
have a son who plays baseball?

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:56.080 align:middle line:90%
Maybe if I buy him a basketball.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And for God's sake, why can't
he find a nice Japanese girl?

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.370 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with him?

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, the atom smasher
got me a full scholarship,

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:11.660 align:middle line:84%
and it won me the attention of
a scientist, an atomic scientist

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.430 align:middle line:90%
who made my career.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.360 align:middle line:90%
He took me under his wing.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And he arranged for me to
get a four-year scholarship

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:18.770 align:middle line:90%
to Harvard.

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.030 align:middle line:84%
I visit the family
twice a year--

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:24.220 align:middle line:90%
in summertime and in Christmas.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.470 align:middle line:84%
He lived on Hawthorne
Terrace in Berkeley.

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.640 align:middle line:90%
And I went an awful lot to him.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:35.030 align:middle line:84%
His name was Edward Teller, the
father of the hydrogen bomb.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.940 align:middle line:90%
But that's another story.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you now about
what was in that manuscript.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.970 align:middle line:84%
As we know, there
are four forces

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:50.680 align:middle line:84%
which govern the
universe, maybe a fifth.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Nobel laureate Richard
Feynman held out

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.400 align:middle line:84%
for the possibility
of a fifth force.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.620 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, so far, we have
found four fundamental forces

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.570 align:middle line:90%
that rule our visible universe.

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.500 align:middle line:90%
The first is gravity.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Gravity is the force which
keeps us on the chair.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.780 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we'll be flung into
outer space with satellites.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:15.390 align:middle line:84%
The second force is the
electromagnetic force.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:20.010 align:middle line:84%
The force that lights up our
cities and changed the world.

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm reminded of
a story they tell

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.610 align:middle line:84%
of Michael Faraday,
a man who's so

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:27.510 align:middle line:90%
famous he's on British money.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:30.770 align:middle line:84%
His face is actually
printed on British money.

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Michael Faraday, 150 years ago,
was building the generators,

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:39.870 align:middle line:84%
the machines, the motors, that
would electrify the world.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:44.850 align:middle line:84%
But 150 years ago in Piccadilly,
London, none of them worked.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:48.740 align:middle line:84%
The second great force
could not be harnessed.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:52.430 align:middle line:84%
One day, William Gladstone,
prime minister of England,

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:53.415 align:middle line:90%
came by.

00:11:53.415 --> 00:11:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And Mr. Gladstone kicked
some of these machines.

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Mr. Faraday,
your fame is widespread.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:13.840 align:middle line:84%
But of what use will your
machines have for the empire?

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, Mr. Faraday
didn't know what to say.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.704 align:middle line:90%
Nothing worked.

00:12:18.704 --> 00:12:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And then he collected
his thoughts

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.170 align:middle line:84%
and said, Mr. Prime
Minister, I know

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:26.870 align:middle line:84%
not of what use
electricity and my machines

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:29.250 align:middle line:90%
will have for the empire.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:35.540 align:middle line:84%
But I do know one thing--
one day, you will tax them.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.370 align:middle line:90%


00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:40.550 align:middle line:90%
And that has come to be.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:46.230 align:middle line:84%
50% of the world's taxes
come from electricity.

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:47.290 align:middle line:90%
We take it for granted.

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:49.730 align:middle line:90%
We never even see electricity.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.730 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you ever
see electricity,

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:54.330 align:middle line:90%
you're in big trouble.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.820 align:middle line:84%
We don't even use the word
"electricity" anymore,

00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.492 align:middle line:84%
unless, of course,
you're from California.

00:13:00.492 --> 00:13:03.550 align:middle line:84%
But electricity, as
we know, is governed

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:05.850 align:middle line:90%
by Maxwell's equations.

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.430 align:middle line:90%
It is an astonishing equation.

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:09.870 align:middle line:90%
It is half an inch long.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:12.430 align:middle line:90%
And it is required to get a PhD.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.230 align:middle line:84%
In any physics
laboratory in the world.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:20.210 align:middle line:84%
Maxwell's equations say, the
four-dimensional divergence

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:24.800 align:middle line:84%
of an antisymmetric second
rank tensor equals zero.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
equation for light.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, in Berkeley,
where I got my PhD,

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:37.000 align:middle line:84%
you can get a t-shirt which
says, "In the beginning,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.640 align:middle line:84%
God said, the
four-dimensional divergence

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.240 align:middle line:84%
of an antisymmetric second
rank tensor equals zero.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.740 align:middle line:90%
And there was light.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.500 align:middle line:90%
And it was good.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And on the seventh
day, he rested."

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:57.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, now we have the nuclear
force, the bad boy of physics.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.710 align:middle line:84%
We have something
called reductionism.

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:02.120 align:middle line:84%
We would smash
atoms apart, and we

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.750 align:middle line:90%
would see neutrons and protons.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:06.180 align:middle line:90%
And then it got really hairy.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:10.370 align:middle line:84%
In the 1950s, we
started to find mesons.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.680 align:middle line:84%
We started to find
kappa particles,

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.050 align:middle line:84%
and tau leptons, and
muons, and neutrinos.

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds, hundreds of particles
when we smashed the atom apart.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.330 align:middle line:90%
Could God be malicious?

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Showing that at the
fundamental reductionist level,

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.830 align:middle line:84%
there are thousands
of subatomic particles

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.820 align:middle line:90%
being discovered every day.

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:37.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Robert Oppenheimer, the
man who built the atomic bomb,

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.220 align:middle line:84%
was so frustrated by all
these subatomic particles

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.950 align:middle line:84%
literally pouring out of our
machines or atom smashers

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:49.770 align:middle line:84%
that he once said, quote,
"The Nobel Prize in physics

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:52.780 align:middle line:84%
should go to the physicist
who does not discover

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:56.360 align:middle line:90%
a new particle that year."

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.430 align:middle line:90%
Well, reductionism failed.

00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:59.930 align:middle line:90%
We had the quark model.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:03.510 align:middle line:84%
But we have gluons, and
leptons, and neutrinos,

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:05.870 align:middle line:90%
and three generations of quarks.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.810 align:middle line:84%
When I was a graduate
student, I had

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:11.760 align:middle line:84%
to memorize the names of
all these goddamn particles.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.640 align:middle line:90%
Hundreds of them.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.465 align:middle line:84%
Just like 100 years
ago, to get a PhD,

00:15:15.465 --> 00:15:17.940 align:middle line:84%
you had to memorize
all the crystals.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:19.760 align:middle line:90%
Well, we don't do that anymore.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.870 align:middle line:84%
We know that behind crystals,
we have a fundamental theory

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:24.250 align:middle line:90%
of a quantum.

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:26.280 align:middle line:90%
Now we have these particles.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And then people began to
try for a unified theory.

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:34.170 align:middle line:84%
A unified theory which
would unite these goddamn

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:38.840 align:middle line:84%
particles with gravity, with
the electromagnetic force,

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.990 align:middle line:84%
which would allow us to
understand stars and galaxies.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:47.010 align:middle line:84%
It was called the
Unified Field Theory.

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:49.330 align:middle line:90%
Many people tried.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:50.680 align:middle line:90%
They all failed.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.460 align:middle line:90%
Einstein tried.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.600 align:middle line:90%
Heisenberg tried.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:58.870 align:middle line:84%
One day, Niels Bohr, founder
of the atomic theory,

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:01.770 align:middle line:84%
was listening to a talk about
the Unified Field Theory.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:03.399 align:middle line:90%
He was at the back of the room.

00:16:03.399 --> 00:16:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And they were getting
all frustrated.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Everyone was
shaking their heads.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Finally, Niels Bohr
raised his hand and said,

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Pauli, we in
the back are all

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:19.720 align:middle line:84%
agreed that your
theory is crazy.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:23.080 align:middle line:84%
But what divides us
is whether or not

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.750 align:middle line:90%
your theory is crazy enough.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:30.220 align:middle line:90%


00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.680 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.296 align:middle line:84%
We tried all the
simple theories.

00:16:37.296 --> 00:16:41.510 align:middle line:84%
A theory of everything would
have to be crazy enough.

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:43.795 align:middle line:90%
It would have to be bizarre.

00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:46.630 align:middle line:90%
It would have to be fantastic.

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.525 align:middle line:90%
It would have to be incredible.

00:16:48.525 --> 00:16:54.600 align:middle line:84%
It would have to be queerer
than we can suppose.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.100 align:middle line:90%
Reductionism hit a dead end.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.110 align:middle line:84%
With the quark model, we
were drowning in quarks.

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:01.810 align:middle line:90%
How many quarks are there today?

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:03.090 align:middle line:90%
36.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:06.109 align:middle line:84%
We were drowning in these
subatomic particles.

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:09.160 align:middle line:90%
Well now, we have a new theory.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And this theory has shaken the
foundations of modern science.

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:16.710 align:middle line:84%
Several best sellers have now
been propelled onto the best

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:19.470 align:middle line:90%
seller list, my book included.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:23.030 align:middle line:84%
It's something
called string theory.

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And we now believe that these
strings, like violin strings,

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.740 align:middle line:90%
can have music.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And when these strings vibrate--
they vibrate, yes-- perhaps,

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.970 align:middle line:84%
they are the condensation
of energy itself.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:38.770 align:middle line:90%
They create notes.

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Now when you hear
a violin string,

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:43.320 align:middle line:90%
you don't say A is fundamental.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.730 align:middle line:84%
You don't say B-flat
is better than C-sharp.

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:49.910 align:middle line:84%
You don't say F
is better than G.

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:52.390 align:middle line:90%
They're just notes on a string.

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:54.190 align:middle line:90%
And how many notes are there?

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's middle C, low C,
high C. How many Cs are there?

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.140 align:middle line:90%
Infinite number.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Mariah Carey
could hit eight octaves.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.990 align:middle line:84%
How many octaves are
there on a violin string?

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:08.120 align:middle line:90%
Eight?

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.530 align:middle line:90%
Infinite number.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And how many melodies can
you play out on a string?

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:16.150 align:middle line:90%
Infinite number.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, now we have
a very simple way

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.720 align:middle line:84%
of describing all the
particles that I had

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.420 align:middle line:90%
to memorize as a PhD student.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Quarks, leptons, neutrinos,
tau mesons, kappa leptons,

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.850 align:middle line:84%
cascade particles,
thousands of particles

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:37.360 align:middle line:84%
can now be summarized by
one word-- the string.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.990 align:middle line:90%
Notes on a string.

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Music, just like the
Pythagoreans, the Greeks,

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.020 align:middle line:90%
thought 2,000 years ago.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, you might be saying to
yourself, Mr. Smarty Pants,

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.940 align:middle line:84%
if your theory can
explain quarks,

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:55.390 align:middle line:84%
and mesons, and
electrons, and protons,

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:57.260 align:middle line:84%
and neutrons, then
why didn't you

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.860 align:middle line:90%
get the Nobel Prize in physics?

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:01.875 align:middle line:90%
Well, there's a problem.

00:19:01.875 --> 00:19:04.770 align:middle line:90%


00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:06.790 align:middle line:90%
A big problem.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:11.830 align:middle line:84%
This theory is the only
theory known to science

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:16.480 align:middle line:84%
which selects out its
own dimensionality.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:24.910 align:middle line:84%
It can only exist in 10, perhaps
11-dimensional hyperspace.

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:27.820 align:middle line:84%
If this theory is correct,
it will be the greatest

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.820 align:middle line:84%
achievement of the human
mind in the last 2,000 years,

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:32.910 align:middle line:84%
since the Greeks
asked the question,

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:35.010 align:middle line:90%
what is the world made out of?

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And we now have a paradigm
for the mind of God.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:47.260 align:middle line:84%
The mind of God is music
resonating in hyperspace.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.960 align:middle line:90%


00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Music, melodies,
symphonies, harmonies,

00:19:56.350 --> 00:20:01.400 align:middle line:84%
being played out in
worlds that are invisible,

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:05.030 align:middle line:90%
beyond human comprehension.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.590 align:middle line:90%
What is matter?

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:09.190 align:middle line:90%
Matter that we see around us?

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:10.810 align:middle line:90%
What is chemistry?

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:13.010 align:middle line:90%
What is the atom?

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:16.590 align:middle line:84%
It's nothing but
melodies, melodies

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.390 align:middle line:90%
played out on the string.

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:21.190 align:middle line:90%
What is the universe?

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:25.120 align:middle line:84%
The universe is a
symphony of strings.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.560 align:middle line:90%
What are the laws of physics?

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.720 align:middle line:90%
Harmonies.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.560 align:middle line:90%
Harmonies on a string.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.569 align:middle line:84%
Well, when the string
theory came out,

00:20:32.569 --> 00:20:34.110 align:middle line:84%
and when it was
realized that it only

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:36.750 align:middle line:84%
existed in 10-dimensional
hyperspace,

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:39.610 align:middle line:90%
the model collapsed.

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:41.640 align:middle line:84%
Scientists could
not get themselves

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:48.550 align:middle line:84%
to believe that our universe
existed beyond visible sight.

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:53.730 align:middle line:84%
That there were unseen
universes, unseen worlds.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:55.960 align:middle line:90%
The model flopped.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Until about 10 years
ago, where it's since

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:02.570 align:middle line:84%
become the dominant theory
in theoretical physics.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:04.680 align:middle line:84%
You can go anywhere
on the Earth,

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.750 align:middle line:84%
go to any physics institution,
and they're desperately

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.160 align:middle line:90%
trying to learn this theory.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:14.310 align:middle line:84%
This theory has overturned
every single goddamn conception

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:15.410 align:middle line:90%
of our physical world.

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:20.200 align:middle line:84%
Harvard, which once boasted
that it would never ever hire

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.710 align:middle line:90%
a superstring physicist.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:24.590 align:middle line:84%
After all, why is it that
our generation of physicists

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:26.170 align:middle line:90%
never cracked Harvard?

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:27.360 align:middle line:90%
Simple answer.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.170 align:middle line:84%
They said never would
they tenure a superstring

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:32.020 align:middle line:90%
physicist at Harvard.

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Surprise-- they recently
hired three of them.

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Princeton, Caltech,
they're all scrambling

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:43.710 align:middle line:90%
to hire superstring theorists.

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Now let me tell you a
story about hyperspace.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:53.870 align:middle line:84%
When I was a child growing up
in San Francisco in a suburb,

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:57.324 align:middle line:84%
I used to visit the
Japanese Tea Garden.

00:21:57.324 --> 00:22:02.040 align:middle line:84%
In the Japanese
Tea Garden, there's

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.800 align:middle line:90%
a pond with carp swimming.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And these fish swim
in two dimensions.

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:14.290 align:middle line:84%
They can swim forward,
backward, left, right.

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:16.110 align:middle line:90%
But it's a shallow pond.

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:17.510 align:middle line:90%
There have lily pads.

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Plus, their eyes
face to the side.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:25.610 align:middle line:84%
If you were to talk
to a scientist carp

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:30.600 align:middle line:84%
and talk about the third
dimension, an unseen

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:37.400 align:middle line:84%
universe called "up," the
fish would say, bah, humbug.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.850 align:middle line:90%
There is no up.

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:42.270 align:middle line:90%
There is only the pond.

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:46.670 align:middle line:90%
What is visible is all that is.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.680 align:middle line:84%
What is visible is
all that can exist.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.230 align:middle line:90%
There is no up.

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:55.835 align:middle line:84%
And as a child, I asked
myself, what would it

00:22:55.835 --> 00:23:01.070 align:middle line:84%
be like to live in a
two dimensional pond?

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And then one day,
I reached down,

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:08.900 align:middle line:84%
and I thought of
grabbing one of the fish,

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:13.200 align:middle line:84%
lifting the scientist
fish into hyperspace,

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:17.500 align:middle line:84%
into the third dimension, where
the fish would see an unseen

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.290 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:21.650 align:middle line:90%
People moving without fins.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:25.000 align:middle line:90%
People breathing without water.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.670 align:middle line:84%
An alien physics, a whole world
in the direction called "up."

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And what would the
people of the pond say?

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:39.220 align:middle line:84%
The other fish would say, my god
the scientist just disappeared.

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.190 align:middle line:90%
Vanished.

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:41.930 align:middle line:90%
How could that be?

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And then if I put the
fish back into the pond

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:47.410 align:middle line:84%
where it would swim away,
they would say, the fish,

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:51.100 align:middle line:84%
our scientist friend
has suddenly reappeared.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:58.140 align:middle line:84%
This is magic-- the ability to
vanish, to walk through walls,

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.770 align:middle line:90%
to disappear.

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And I said to myself,
I could almost

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:05.810 align:middle line:84%
reach down and look on
the inside of these fish.

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:09.430 align:middle line:84%
If these people lived in flat
land, on a sheet of paper,

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:11.820 align:middle line:84%
like cookie men on
a sheet of paper,

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:16.270 align:middle line:84%
I could reach inside
and perform surgery

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:18.920 align:middle line:90%
without cutting their skin.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:22.940 align:middle line:84%
I could reach into a safe
and pull out the gold

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:26.110 align:middle line:90%
without ever breaking it open.

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:29.570 align:middle line:84%
I could take people in
jail, lift them out of jail,

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:32.060 align:middle line:90%
and pluck them someplace else.

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, 100 years ago,
mathematicians, scientists,

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:40.360 align:middle line:84%
philosophers, were
just beginning

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:44.550 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
fourth dimension.

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And they asked themselves
a simple question--

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:49.538 align:middle line:90%
who has this power?

00:24:49.538 --> 00:24:56.960 align:middle line:84%
The power to disappear,
reappear, walk through walls,

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.860 align:middle line:84%
reach into any safe
and pull out the gold

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:03.240 align:middle line:84%
without breaking the
safe, perform surgery

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:06.840 align:middle line:84%
without ever cutting
the skin, the ability

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:11.620 align:middle line:84%
to see all at once, to scan
a universe of its treasures?

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.420 align:middle line:90%
Who has this power?

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, ghosts.

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:17.890 align:middle line:90%


00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And then began a 50-year
romance between hyperdimensional

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:25.050 align:middle line:90%
physics and ghosts.

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Religious people got
into the picture.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Ever since Galileo, the
Catholic Church had a problem.

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:34.900 align:middle line:84%
The Catholic Church says
heaven is up there someplace.

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.030 align:middle line:90%
But Galileo had the telescope.

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:40.050 align:middle line:84%
He was passing out telescopes
everywhere he went.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:44.350 align:middle line:84%
For the rich, it was
going to a party on top

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:47.600 align:middle line:84%
of a building in
Venice and watching

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:51.310 align:middle line:84%
the sky with this telescope
that Galileo was passing out.

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:53.490 align:middle line:84%
In those days, they
didn't pass out cocaine.

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:57.460 align:middle line:84%
They passed out telescopes
at these parties.

00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:59.130 align:middle line:90%
Well, there was a problem.

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:01.300 align:middle line:90%
Where was heaven?

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.200 align:middle line:90%
No one could see heaven.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, around 1900, people
said that maybe God, heaven,

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.680 align:middle line:90%
lives in the fourth dimension.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And then in 1900, there was
an obscure Spanish painter

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:22.050 align:middle line:84%
who tried to paint
the fourth dimension.

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And he said to himself, what
is the essence of medieval art?

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Medieval art is
two-dimensional and flat.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever gone to a
museum and seen medieval art?

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:35.816 align:middle line:90%
People look like this.

00:26:35.816 --> 00:26:36.710 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And do you say to yourself,
gee, couldn't they draw?

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Why couldn't they
draw correctly?

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.750 align:middle line:90%
Why is everyone flat-looking?

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is medieval
art is two-dimensional

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.680 align:middle line:90%
because God is everywhere.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere, every point, is no
special than any other point,

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:58.490 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, the world must
be flat according to God.

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And then in 1500 or so, all
of a sudden, we had Leonardo.

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:05.020 align:middle line:90%
We had Donatello.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.135 align:middle line:90%
We had Michelangelo.

00:27:07.135 --> 00:27:10.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, what kids call
"The Ninja Turtles."

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:13.710 align:middle line:84%
We had them blasting
into the third dimension.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:16.820 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, we had
prospective, the vanishing

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.960 align:middle line:90%
point of the eye, the horizon.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.810 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, we
had "The Last Supper."

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:26.240 align:middle line:84%
The point of view of men and
women, not the point of view

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:26.990 align:middle line:90%
of God.

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:29.510 align:middle line:90%
The third dimension.

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And then in 1900, we had
this obscure Spanish painter,

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:40.720 align:middle line:84%
penniless, who said to
himself, if medieval art

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.300 align:middle line:84%
is two-dimensional,
if Renaissance art

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:47.230 align:middle line:84%
is three-dimensional,
then I shall introduce

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:52.270 align:middle line:90%
the fourth dimension in art.

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:53.660 align:middle line:90%
Can anyone tell me?

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Who was this obscure, penniless,
Spanish painter in Paris?

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:01.250 align:middle line:90%
It was Picasso.

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:03.410 align:middle line:90%
What is Cubism?

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:04.930 align:middle line:90%
Surrealism.

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Salvador Dali used to stay
at a friend of mine's house

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:11.440 align:middle line:84%
in Brown University,
professor of mathematics,

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Banchoff, an authority
in the fourth dimension.

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And Dali used to
pump all information

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:20.010 align:middle line:84%
he could from Thomas
Banchoff, asking him

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:21.980 align:middle line:90%
about the fourth dimension.

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:25.060 align:middle line:84%
You see, if you're
looking down on the pond,

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:28.460 align:middle line:84%
if you're looking
down on a cookie man,

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:34.440 align:middle line:84%
you see everywhere-- eyes,
nose, back, front, side.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:37.380 align:middle line:84%
You see the totality
of a cookie man

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.730 align:middle line:84%
from the vantage point
of the third dimension.

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:45.290 align:middle line:84%
So why did Picasso paint women
whose eyes are to the front

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:48.200 align:middle line:90%
and nose is to the side?

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:52.490 align:middle line:84%
Because if you are a hyperbeing
looking down from hyperspace,

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:57.670 align:middle line:84%
you will see the nose, the
eyes, the back of the head

00:28:57.670 --> 00:28:59.190 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously.

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Picasso
was trying to do,

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:05.470 align:middle line:90%
representing cubism in art.

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:10.570 align:middle line:84%
I was once in London, watching
some PhD students in art

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:12.730 align:middle line:84%
analyze some of the
works of Picasso.

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And I overheard
them saying, gee,

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:16.440 align:middle line:90%
what was Picasso trying to do?

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And I said to myself, gee,
I guess the only people

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:21.470 align:middle line:84%
who don't know that
Picasso was trying

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:24.180 align:middle line:84%
to represent the fourth
dimension, the only people who

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:28.440 align:middle line:84%
don't know that are
PhD majors in art.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:33.970 align:middle line:84%
What is "Persistence of
Time" by Salvador Dali?

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:38.010 align:middle line:84%
Dali, when he painted
these melted clocks,

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:41.960 align:middle line:84%
he was trying to represent
time as the fourth dimension.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:46.290 align:middle line:84%
What about Marcel Duchamp,
"Nude Descending a Staircase"?

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Why did we have a nude
descending a staircase?

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.520 align:middle line:84%
To represent a time-lapse
motion of time.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.710 align:middle line:90%
Time as the fourth dimension.

00:29:56.710 --> 00:30:02.360 align:middle line:84%
So now we have the idea that
perhaps in hyperspace, there's

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:06.820 align:middle line:84%
enough room to unite gravity,
the electromagnetic force,

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:11.360 align:middle line:84%
and the nuclear force into
an equation perhaps only one

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:14.180 align:middle line:90%
inch long.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And now let me ask
you another question,

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:20.360 align:middle line:84%
a question about the universe
and where it came from.

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:23.790 align:middle line:84%
Any theory this powerful
would say something

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:29.220 align:middle line:84%
about the beginning of
time, about creation itself.

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have the
Big Bang theory.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And the Big Bang
theory seems to agree

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:39.070 align:middle line:84%
with a Judeo-Christian
theory of Genesis--

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:44.230 align:middle line:84%
an instant of time when God
said, let there be light.

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:47.830 align:middle line:90%
However, there's also Buddhism.

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And in Buddhism, there is
nirvana, the nothingness,

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:57.790 align:middle line:84%
the timelessness, no
beginning, no end.

00:30:57.790 --> 00:30:59.240 align:middle line:90%
Just nirvana.

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:04.520 align:middle line:84%
How is it possible that we can
unite two divergent pictures,

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.990 align:middle line:84%
the theory of Genesis,
an instant of creation,

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:10.970 align:middle line:90%
with the theory of timelessness?

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, we physicists now have
a new theory of creation.

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:22.350 align:middle line:90%
It is called the multiverse.

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:27.560 align:middle line:84%
We now believe that in the
beginning, there was nirvana.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:31.030 align:middle line:90%
The nirvana of hyperspace.

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:33.380 align:middle line:90%
The nirvana of nothing.

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.520 align:middle line:90%
But there was the quantum.

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.870 align:middle line:84%
The quantum principle says
that even nothing is unstable.

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:42.790 align:middle line:84%
There's even uncertainty
with respect to nothing.

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, nothing became
unstable, and bubbles, bubbles

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:47.930 align:middle line:90%
began to form.

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:49.620 align:middle line:84%
Bubbling, as you may
know, is a purely

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:51.310 align:middle line:90%
quantum mechanical effect.

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:54.060 align:middle line:84%
If you have Newtonian billiard
balls representing atoms,

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:55.610 align:middle line:90%
you will never get boiling.

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Boiling is a purely
quantum mechanical effect.

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Bubbles, in nothing,
began to form.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And these bubbles began
to expand rapidly,

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:07.280 align:middle line:90%
giving us the Big Bang theory.

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:12.010 align:middle line:84%
In other words, even
as we speak now,

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:20.080 align:middle line:84%
universes may be being created
in an ocean of nothing.

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:27.290 align:middle line:84%
The gospel according to Saint
John, chapter 1, verse 1, says,

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:33.920 align:middle line:84%
"In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God,

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.980 align:middle line:90%
and the Word was God."

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, today, we physicists
have a candidate

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.570 align:middle line:84%
to complete Saint John
the Divine's gospel.

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:49.430 align:middle line:90%
"In the beginning was the Word.

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:52.940 align:middle line:90%
And the Word was the quantum.

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:55.724 align:middle line:90%


00:32:55.724 --> 00:33:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And the quantum principle
says that even hyperspace

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:02.410 align:middle line:90%
is unstable.

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:04.800 align:middle line:90%
Bubbles began to form.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Bubbles began to expand
rapidly, and they, in turn,

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:11.150 align:middle line:90%
became entire universes."

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And then the question
is, is it possible to go

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.280 align:middle line:90%
between universes?

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, we physicists
have introduced

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:20.560 align:middle line:90%
a concept called wormholes.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:21.980 align:middle line:90%
What is a wormhole?

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you were
in elementary school,

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:27.730 align:middle line:84%
your teacher told you that
if you take a sheet of paper,

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:30.060 align:middle line:84%
and you put two
points on it, what

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:33.320 align:middle line:84%
is the shortest distance
between two points?

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.760 align:middle line:90%
Well, a straight line, right?

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:39.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you didn't pass
elementary school unless you

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.460 align:middle line:84%
said, teacher, a straight
line is the shortest distance

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.540 align:middle line:90%
between two points.

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:45.840 align:middle line:90%
Wrong.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:52.500 align:middle line:84%
The shortest distance between
two points is a wormhole.

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:59.000 align:middle line:84%
A bridge through the third
dimension of hyperspace.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.330 align:middle line:84%
Now this concept of
a wormhole was first

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:07.120 align:middle line:84%
introduced in England 150 years
ago to a general audience.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:12.420 align:middle line:84%
There was a professor of
mathematics, an Oxford don,

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:13.960 align:middle line:90%
who knew about these things.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:18.139 align:middle line:84%
Mathematicians call them
multiply connected spaces.

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:19.900 align:middle line:84%
That's the technical
term for it.

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:22.170 align:middle line:84%
We physicists call
them wormholes.

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:26.780 align:middle line:84%
But he knew that adults
would not respond to it.

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:31.130 align:middle line:84%
So the first public
mention ever of a wormhole

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:34.620 align:middle line:90%
came out in a children's book.

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Who can tell me what is the
name of this children's book,

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:41.989 align:middle line:84%
and who was this
Oxford mathematician?

00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:45.350 align:middle line:84%
It was "Alice in Wonderland,"
and the mathematician

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:49.469 align:middle line:90%
was Charles Dodgson.

00:34:49.469 --> 00:34:54.250 align:middle line:84%
He knew that people would not
accept the musing of an Oxford

00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:59.760 align:middle line:84%
mathematician, so he wrote under
the pseudonym Lewis Carroll.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:03.930 align:middle line:84%
The looking glass
is the wormhole.

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And today, in fact, it
was announced last week,

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:08.850 align:middle line:84%
the Hubble Space
Telescope has now

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:11.730 align:middle line:84%
photographed not only
39 black holes in space,

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:13.450 align:middle line:90%
spinning black holes.

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:16.320 align:middle line:84%
Black holes rotating about
a million miles an hour.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.220 align:middle line:84%
We no longer believe that black
holes collapse to a point.

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:20.500 align:middle line:90%
That's the old picture.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Anyone falling through the
black hole would be crushed.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.810 align:middle line:84%
Einstein himself
realized that there's

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:29.380 align:middle line:90%
another side to a black hole.

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:32.160 align:middle line:84%
There's something called
the Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.340 align:middle line:84%
The Einstein-Rosen
Bridge is the wormhole,

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:39.530 align:middle line:84%
a tunnel through a black
hole to a parallel universe.

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:42.600 align:middle line:84%
But when Einstein died,
physicists were not worried.

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Anyone falling into a black
hole will be crushed into a dot.

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.590 align:middle line:90%
No problem.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:52.190 align:middle line:84%
No way to go through the
Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, then in 1963,
mathematician Roy Kerr,

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.600 align:middle line:84%
writing in New Zealand,
found a new solution

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.140 align:middle line:84%
of Einstein's
equation which show

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:05.120 align:middle line:84%
that spinning black
holes collapse

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:10.520 align:middle line:84%
to a ring, a ring of
neutrons, a ring of fire.

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Centrifugal force
prevents gravity

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.360 align:middle line:90%
from collapsing the ring.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you fell
through the ring,

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:25.160 align:middle line:84%
you wind up on the
other side of forever.

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:27.990 align:middle line:90%
The ring is a wormhole.

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:34.230 align:middle line:84%
It is a tunnel, a gateway
through space and time.

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:38.820 align:middle line:84%
We physicists are now working on
wormholes very rigorously now.

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:42.470 align:middle line:84%
We no longer believe that
space is simply connected.

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:44.920 align:middle line:84%
There could be multiply
connected spaces

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:48.690 align:middle line:84%
similar to what you
find in "Twilight Zone."

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And these universes may
give us the looking glass.

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:57.540 align:middle line:84%
The rim of the
mirror-- not the mirror

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:02.390 align:middle line:84%
itself-- the ring of the
mirror is the black hole.

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Anyone putting their
hand through the ring

00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:09.040 align:middle line:84%
may find themselves on the
other side of the universe.

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you can go, perhaps,
through this ring of fire

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:16.790 align:middle line:84%
to the other side of forever,
through hyperspace, by bending

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:20.130 align:middle line:84%
and folding space
itself, then perhaps you

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:24.170 align:middle line:90%
can fold time as well.

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Believe it or not,
we physicists believe

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:29.580 align:middle line:84%
that time machines
are a legitimate form

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.630 align:middle line:90%
of research activity.

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:34.850 align:middle line:84%
The first time machine was
discovered in the 1930s,

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:41.960 align:middle line:84%
mathematically, by a physicist
looking at Einstein's equation.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Godel, the famous
logician, in 1949,

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:48.010 align:middle line:84%
found another solution
of Einstein's equation

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:49.930 align:middle line:90%
which allowed for time travel.

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:51.810 align:middle line:84%
If the universe
spins rather than

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:54.890 align:middle line:84%
expands, if the
universe spins, and you

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:58.940 align:middle line:84%
walk around the universe,
you will meet yourself

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:00.325 align:middle line:90%
before you left.

00:38:00.325 --> 00:38:02.860 align:middle line:90%


00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:04.310 align:middle line:90%
How can that be?

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:07.440 align:middle line:84%
How can you meet yourself
before you're born?

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And what happens if you
take a gun along and shoot

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:13.880 align:middle line:90%
your parents before you're born?

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're
Michael J. Fox, what

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:17.700 align:middle line:84%
happens if you went
backwards in time

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and met your mother
as a teenager,

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:22.200 align:middle line:90%
and she fell in love with you?

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.470 align:middle line:90%
Talk about an Oedipus complex.

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:28.120 align:middle line:84%
How can you be born if
your mother as a teenager

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.150 align:middle line:90%
just fell in love with you?

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:32.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, some of you may
be saying to yourself,

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:33.660 align:middle line:90%
eh, I've heard it all before.

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Science fiction,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:37.620 align:middle line:84%
I know how to tease
apart those paradoxes.

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you think you're so
good, take apart this one.

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Robert Heinlein
talks about this.

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:49.610 align:middle line:90%
A story that begins in 1945.

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:54.790 align:middle line:84%
In 1945, there is a
dark and stormy night.

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And a stranger comes
out of the darkness,

00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:00.700 align:middle line:90%
carrying a precious baby girl.

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And he drops the baby
girl at an orphanage,

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:05.490 align:middle line:84%
and then disappears
into the darkness,

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:07.380 align:middle line:90%
never to be seen again.

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:10.040 align:middle line:90%
Well, nuns find the baby girl.

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:12.160 align:middle line:90%
They call her Jane.

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.600 align:middle line:90%
What else to call her?

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:17.786 align:middle line:84%
And Jane grows up wondering,
who is my mother, my father,

00:39:17.786 --> 00:39:19.660 align:middle line:84%
my brother, my sister,
my aunt, and my uncle?

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:20.850 align:middle line:90%
Where did I come from?

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:23.800 align:middle line:84%
I was left as a foundling
on the doorstep.

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, when Jane is 17 years
old, a handsome drifter

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:33.610 align:middle line:84%
suddenly sweeps into her
life, sweeps her off her feet.

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:37.030 align:middle line:90%
And it's love at first sight.

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:39.450 align:middle line:90%
But it was not meant to be.

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:43.440 align:middle line:84%
They argue, and the drifter
stomps off into the darkness,

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.240 align:middle line:90%
never to be seen again.

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.400 align:middle line:90%
Poor Jane.

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.900 align:middle line:84%
She's left abandoned
and pregnant.

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:51.490 align:middle line:90%
They rush Jane to the hospital.

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:53.395 align:middle line:90%
Something is wrong.

00:39:53.395 --> 00:39:54.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes, something's wrong.

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:57.990 align:middle line:84%
She delivers a beautiful baby
girl that very same night.

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:00.630 align:middle line:84%
But then somebody
breaks open the window,

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:05.560 align:middle line:84%
steals into the hospital,
and steals Jane's baby girl.

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.480 align:middle line:90%
Jane is bleeding, meanwhile.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.280 align:middle line:84%
It was a very
difficult delivery.

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors find out that
Jane is actually not normal.

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:16.090 align:middle line:90%
She is hermaphroditic.

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not going to define that
because this is a family show.

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:23.530 align:middle line:84%
You can look that up in
the dictionary tonight.

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:26.080 align:middle line:90%
Jane is not normal.

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:31.450 align:middle line:84%
The doctors have to
change Jane into Jim.

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:33.150 align:middle line:90%
It's a horrible operation.

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:35.510 align:middle line:90%
Jane wakes up as a man.

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And she says to himself,
I've really been screwed.

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:43.220 align:middle line:84%
No parents, my
boyfriend disappears,

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:46.920 align:middle line:84%
somebody steals my baby
girl, and now I'm Jim.

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:50.864 align:middle line:84%
Well, Jim gets into fistfights
any time someone says,

00:40:50.864 --> 00:40:51.780 align:middle line:90%
where'd you come from?

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Who's your mother, your father,
your brother, your sister,

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:55.170 align:middle line:90%
your aunt, and your uncle?

00:40:55.170 --> 00:41:02.190 align:middle line:84%
One day, poor Jim is stone drunk
lying on the floor of a bar

00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:04.080 align:middle line:90%
after another fist fight.

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And then a bartender
comes up to Jim and says,

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:10.066 align:middle line:90%
Jim, I can help you.

00:41:10.066 --> 00:41:14.510 align:middle line:84%
You see, I'm really
a time traveler.

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:16.850 align:middle line:84%
Come into my time
machine, and we will

00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:20.770 align:middle line:90%
unravel the mystery of Jane.

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, they go into
the time machine.

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:24.690 align:middle line:90%
He spins the dial.

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And they go way
back into the past.

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And then poor Jim is just
left someplace in the past.

00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:33.550 align:middle line:90%
He's very confused.

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And then he meets,
all of a sudden,

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:38.080 align:middle line:90%
a beautiful 17-year-old girl.

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:41.240 align:middle line:90%
And it's love at first sight.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:44.420 align:middle line:84%
But you know, it
was not meant to be.

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:48.860 align:middle line:84%
They quarrel, and Jim stomps
off into the darkness.

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:53.970 align:middle line:84%
But then Jim says, oh, wait a
minute, this happened to me.

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:55.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
repeat history again.

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:57.570 align:middle line:84%
I want to make sure
that my baby girl gets

00:41:57.570 --> 00:41:59.570 align:middle line:90%
the best education possible.

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:01.410 align:middle line:84%
So Jim comes back
to the hospital,

00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:04.880 align:middle line:84%
breaks open the window,
steals into the hospital,

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.310 align:middle line:90%
and steals his baby girl.

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And together, they go back
in time again, back, way back

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:16.760 align:middle line:90%
into the past, until it is 1945.

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:19.850 align:middle line:90%
It is a dark and stormy night.

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Jim comes in from the darkness,
carrying his precious baby girl

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:26.230 align:middle line:84%
that he leaves off
at an orphanage,

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:29.670 align:middle line:84%
knowing that she'll get the
best of care from the nuns.

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And the baby girl
grows up wondering,

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:35.170 align:middle line:84%
who is my mother, my father,
my brother, my sister, my aunt,

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:36.340 align:middle line:90%
and my uncle?

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, meanwhile,
Jim says to himself,

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:41.874 align:middle line:84%
you know, this is pretty
neat, traveling in time.

00:42:41.874 --> 00:42:43.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take the
advice of the bartender.

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:48.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to join the Time
Travelers Corp. And he does.

00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Jim joins the Time
Travelers Corp

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:54.210 align:middle line:84%
and has many famous exploits
in the annals of time.

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And when Jim is an old, elderly
man, he's about to retire,

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:05.840 align:middle line:84%
and Jim says, I want one
last wish, one last wish.

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:10.820 align:middle line:84%
My last mission shall be
to go backwards in time

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:17.490 align:middle line:84%
to impersonate a bartender, to
meet a certain bar room drunk

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:20.360 align:middle line:84%
who's lying on the floor
right now wondering,

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:23.250 align:middle line:84%
who is my mother, my father,
my brother, my sister, my aunt,

00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:23.950 align:middle line:90%
and my uncle?

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Now for 10 points, who is
Jane's mother, father, brother,

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:33.080 align:middle line:84%
sister, aunt, uncle,
grandfather, granddaughter,

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:36.360 align:middle line:84%
great grandfather, great
great granddaughter?

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:37.730 align:middle line:90%
Jane.

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine
a family reunion?

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:42.310 align:middle line:90%
And they get into a food fight.

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:43.610 align:middle line:90%
You did this to me.

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:45.570 align:middle line:90%
No, you did that to yourself.

00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:47.330 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Can you tease apart
the mystery of Jane?

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:53.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer is
given in my book.

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:57.970 align:middle line:90%


00:43:57.970 --> 00:44:01.330 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we physicists believe that
time travel may be possible.

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:03.330 align:middle line:84%
You see that in the video
in just a few minutes.

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:06.650 align:middle line:90%
However, there's a catch.

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:09.270 align:middle line:90%
There's always a catch.

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:14.330 align:middle line:84%
String theory, time machines,
these bubbles of universes,

00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:18.520 align:middle line:84%
they only take place
at a fantastic energy,

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:22.590 align:middle line:84%
the Planck energy-- 10 to the
19th billion electron volts,

00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:26.240 align:middle line:84%
the energy of a universe,
the energy of a black hole.

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:29.780 align:middle line:90%
Time machines are not for us.

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:32.270 align:middle line:84%
But then you may ask
yourself a question, well,

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:34.550 align:middle line:90%
who can be a master of time?

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Who can bend time
into a pretzel?

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:38.860 align:middle line:90%
Who can punch a hole in space?

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:42.760 align:middle line:84%
Who has the power to leap
into the 10th dimension?

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:44.980 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe our descendants.

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Maybe one of these days,
someone will knock on your door

00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:52.220 align:middle line:84%
and say, Grandad,
100 times removed.

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe aliens
from outer space.

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:03.100 align:middle line:84%
We physicists, when we
look into the night sky,

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:06.820 align:middle line:84%
we don't talk about little green
men in the "National Enquirer."

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:16.200 align:middle line:84%
We seriously talk about energy,
alien energy in outer space.

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:22.540 align:middle line:84%
We talk about Type I, Type II,
and Type III civilizations.

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:27.460 align:middle line:84%
A Type I civilization has
the power of a planet.

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:29.530 align:middle line:90%
They control the weather.

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:32.900 align:middle line:84%
They control the power of
volcanoes, earthquakes.

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:34.170 align:middle line:90%
They mine the ocean.

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Cities on the ocean.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.500 align:middle line:84%
A Type I civilization, a
planetary civilization.

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:44.940 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, such a civilization
exhausts the power of a planet,

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:47.770 align:middle line:90%
and they go to the stars.

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:51.830 align:middle line:84%
A Type II civilization is
a stellar civilization.

00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:54.900 align:middle line:90%
They play with stars.

00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:57.900 align:middle line:84%
When junior wants to
borrow the starship,

00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:59.900 align:middle line:84%
dad says, sure, you
can have the starship.

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:02.480 align:middle line:84%
Just put a white dwarf
star in the gas tank.

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:04.490 align:middle line:90%
And off he goes.

00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:08.830 align:middle line:84%
A Type II civilization,
they play with solar flares.

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:12.650 align:middle line:84%
A Type III civilization
is galactic.

00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:16.190 align:middle line:84%
They have colonized huge
chunks of the galaxy.

00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:19.220 align:middle line:90%
And they are truly galactic.

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm one of the advisers
to the Star Trek series.

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:23.810 align:middle line:84%
I've been on
startrek.com many times,

00:46:23.810 --> 00:46:25.870 align:middle line:84%
answering questions
of the Trekkies.

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:30.260 align:middle line:84%
In fact, once they had William
Shatner on startrek.com,

00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:32.320 align:middle line:84%
answering all the
questions of the Trekkies.

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And of course, everyone hit
him with questions like,

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:35.930 align:middle line:90%
what are black holes?

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:37.263 align:middle line:90%
What about the fourth dimension?

00:46:37.263 --> 00:46:38.470 align:middle line:90%
What about time travel?

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And poor Shatner was
getting very irritated.

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And he said, dammit,
dammit, I'm an actor.

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:45.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm an actor.

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:47.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't know anything
about black holes.

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:49.620 align:middle line:84%
Ask me a question
about priceline.com.

00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:53.210 align:middle line:90%


00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was on startrek.com,
answering all the questions.

00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:00.460 align:middle line:84%
One question was, what
is the Federation?

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:05.670 align:middle line:84%
The Federation is an emerging
Type II civilization.

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:09.870 align:middle line:84%
They can barely,
barely ignite stars.

00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:12.630 align:middle line:84%
In one episode,
they ignite a star.

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:15.350 align:middle line:84%
They're an emerging
Type II civilization.

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:21.040 align:middle line:84%
But they fear a true
Type III civilization.

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:23.590 align:middle line:84%
A rapacious civilization
that's Type III

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:26.080 align:middle line:84%
eats Type II civilizations
for breakfast.

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Who can tell me the name of
the only genuine Type III

00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:31.475 align:middle line:84%
civilization on
network television?

00:47:31.475 --> 00:47:34.190 align:middle line:90%


00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:36.120 align:middle line:90%
The Borg.

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And if you did not
understand what

00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:43.340 align:middle line:84%
just transpired in the last five
minutes, get with the program.

00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:44.985 align:middle line:90%
It's on Channel 11, WB.

00:47:44.985 --> 00:47:49.170 align:middle line:90%


00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:53.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was in London a few
years ago on a book tour.

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And I spoke at the
London Planetarium.

00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:57.900 align:middle line:90%
And a little boy comes up to me.

00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And he says, Professor,
you're wrong, there's Type IV.

00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:07.820 align:middle line:90%


00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:10.470 align:middle line:90%
Type IV.

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And I said to this
little kid, shut up, kid.

00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:16.300 align:middle line:90%


00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:17.940 align:middle line:90%
What do you know?

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:19.340 align:middle line:90%
You know nothing.

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:20.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm the big professor.

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:21.220 align:middle line:90%
You know nothing.

00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:22.720 align:middle line:90%
What about this Type IV?

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And then he said,
professor, you're wrong,

00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:32.440 align:middle line:84%
there is Type IV, the power
of-- well, you tell me.

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:35.540 align:middle line:90%
What is Type IV, anybody?

00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:38.820 align:middle line:90%


00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:41.820 align:middle line:90%
The Q is Type IV.

00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:44.262 align:middle line:90%


00:48:44.262 --> 00:48:44.970 align:middle line:90%
Look that one up.

00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:47.910 align:middle line:90%


00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:50.410 align:middle line:90%
The power of the continuum.

00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:53.030 align:middle line:90%
The power of a god.

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:54.430 align:middle line:90%
There could be Type IV.

00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:59.310 align:middle line:84%
Last week, front page of The New
York Times, it was announced,

00:48:59.310 --> 00:49:02.530 align:middle line:84%
physicists are now closing
in on the microsecond

00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:04.990 align:middle line:84%
of the first
instant of creation.

00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And we now believe that
the universe, indeed,

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:08.740 align:middle line:90%
came out of nothing.

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:11.070 align:middle line:84%
A quantum fluctuation
in nothing.

00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And what's driving
the universe is

00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:15.550 align:middle line:90%
something called dark energy.

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:19.830 align:middle line:84%
Dark energy is driving the
expansion of the universe.

00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And last week, front
page news in The New York

00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Times as we physicists are
now closing in on dark energy.

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:29.820 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there are
planets, stars, galaxy.

00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:35.460 align:middle line:84%
But there's also the energy
on nothing the energy

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:39.290 align:middle line:84%
of the continuum perhaps
a type for civilization.

00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Nikola Tesla talked about vacuum
energy, zero-point energy,

00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:45.220 align:middle line:90%
the energy of nothing.

00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:46.850 align:middle line:90%
People laughed at Tesla.

00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Now we think that the universe
is driven by dark energy.

00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And last week's announcement
in The New York Times

00:49:54.350 --> 00:49:58.380 align:middle line:84%
gives us pause because
the universe is queerer

00:49:58.380 --> 00:49:59.980 align:middle line:90%
than we can suppose.

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:02.684 align:middle line:90%
Well, what do we know?

00:50:02.684 --> 00:50:03.850 align:middle line:90%
What about our civilization?

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Are we Type I that
control the weather?

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:09.070 align:middle line:84%
Are we Type II that
play with solar flares?

00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:12.490 align:middle line:84%
But we tied three they
cruise across the galaxy what

00:50:12.490 --> 00:50:16.610 align:middle line:84%
early on this cosmic
scale anybody?

00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:19.960 align:middle line:90%
We are Type 0.

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:23.480 align:middle line:84%
We get our energy
from dead plants.

00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And George W. Bush wants
even more dead plants

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:31.230 align:middle line:90%
to be burned-- oil and coal.

00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:33.410 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I do not
believe that we should go

00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:36.600 align:middle line:90%
to reactors or nuclear energy.

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.860 align:middle line:84%
I think that's an
unfinished technology, too

00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:42.375 align:middle line:84%
dangerous for an emerging
Type 0 civilization.

00:50:42.375 --> 00:50:42.875 align:middle line:90%
Plutonium.

00:50:42.875 --> 00:50:49.240 align:middle line:90%


00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Plutonium is named
after the god of hell,

00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:56.330 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps with a reason,
is named after Pluto.

00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, some
physicists have

00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:59.800 align:middle line:84%
tried to say that
plutonium is not so

00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:03.130 align:middle line:90%
bad, that we can use plutonium.

00:51:03.130 --> 00:51:06.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, one physicists said
plutonium is no worse

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:08.540 align:middle line:90%
than reprocessed nuclear waste.

00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And he challenged Ralph
Nader to an eating contest,

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.900 align:middle line:84%
that he would eat
as much plutonium

00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:20.270 align:middle line:84%
as Ralph Nader would eat of
concentrated DDT and nicotine.

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:22.470 align:middle line:90%
An eating contest.

00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:27.810 align:middle line:84%
I call this the Gourmet School
of Nuclear Waste Disposal.

00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:30.340 align:middle line:84%
Feed it to those physicists
who think that plutonium is not

00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:33.790 align:middle line:84%
so dangerous and are willing to
eat it on national television,

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:35.520 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:38.441 align:middle line:90%
The question is, what are we?

00:51:38.441 --> 00:51:41.780 align:middle line:90%
We are Type 0.

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:46.570 align:middle line:84%
We are children when it
comes to the universe.

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:51.120 align:middle line:84%
The universe is indeed
queerer than we can suppose.

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:52.120 align:middle line:90%
We are Type 0.

00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:55.000 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we are at the
most dangerous transition.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.540 align:middle line:84%
Once you are Type I,
you are planetary.

00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:01.230 align:middle line:84%
All the old sectarian,
nationalist, fundamental

00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:04.190 align:middle line:84%
passions that rule the
swamp, they're gone.

00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Once you're Type II,
you are invulnerable.

00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:10.040 align:middle line:90%
You are immortal.

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Nothing known to science can
destroy a Type II civilization.

00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:18.300 align:middle line:84%
Meteor impacts,
comets, supernovas,

00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:23.690 align:middle line:84%
nothing known to science can
destroy a Type II civilization.

00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:26.050 align:middle line:90%
But you see, we are Type 0.

00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:28.450 align:middle line:84%
We are in the most dangerous
point of our transition,

00:52:28.450 --> 00:52:31.540 align:middle line:84%
but we see the beginnings
of a Type I everywhere.

00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:35.510 align:middle line:90%
What is the internet?

00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:40.540 align:middle line:84%
The internet is an emerging
Type I telephone system.

00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:43.280 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:46.240 align:middle line:90%
What is the European Union?

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:47.990 align:middle line:90%
What is NAFTA?

00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:51.600 align:middle line:84%
The beginning of
a Type I economy.

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:53.576 align:middle line:90%
What's going to be the language?

00:52:53.576 --> 00:52:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Who can tell me, what's going to
be the language of this Type I

00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:58.670 align:middle line:90%
civilization?

00:52:58.670 --> 00:53:00.830 align:middle line:90%
It's already clear now.

00:53:00.830 --> 00:53:03.830 align:middle line:84%
English will be the language
of this emerging Type I

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:05.000 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.810 align:middle line:84%
What's going to be the culture
of this Type I civilization?

00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:10.870 align:middle line:84%
You can go to
anywhere in the world,

00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:13.640 align:middle line:84%
show people a picture
of one man and woman,

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:16.190 align:middle line:84%
instantly recognizable anywhere
on the surface of the Earth.

00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Who are these two people,
a woman and a man,

00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:22.480 align:middle line:84%
instantly recognizable
on the planet Earth?

00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Madonna and Arnold
Schwarzenegger.

00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:28.440 align:middle line:84%
That's the beginning of our
Type I civilization culture.

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:30.550 align:middle line:90%
My god.

00:53:30.550 --> 00:53:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Blue jeans, rock
and roll, rap music.

00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:34.960 align:middle line:90%
Ugh.

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:37.400 align:middle line:84%
The emerging of
a Type I culture.

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:41.030 align:middle line:90%
However, we may not make it.

00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:45.540 align:middle line:84%
My friends, other physicists,
say, where are they?

00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:47.040 align:middle line:90%
Where are they?

00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:49.720 align:middle line:90%
We don't see them.

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:52.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there should
be 10,000 of them,

00:53:52.070 --> 00:53:55.870 align:middle line:84%
according to Frank
Drake, in our galaxy.

00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:58.142 align:middle line:90%
We don't see any of them.

00:53:58.142 --> 00:53:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps one of the
reasons is we're

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:01.840 align:middle line:84%
in the most dangerous
point of our transition--

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:05.630 align:middle line:84%
transition between
Type 0 to Type I.

00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:09.690 align:middle line:84%
The generation
now alive today is

00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:14.030 align:middle line:84%
the most important
generation ever to walk

00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:16.840 align:middle line:90%
the surface of the Earth.

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:21.490 align:middle line:84%
We will make the transition
to Type I in about 100 years.

00:54:21.490 --> 00:54:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Going at 3% per year, we
will attain planetary power

00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:28.190 align:middle line:90%
in about 100 years.

00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And we may not make it
because of nuclear weapons,

00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:37.530 align:middle line:84%
greenhouse effect,
perhaps emerging diseases.

00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:41.440 align:middle line:84%
There are huge barriers
facing our emergence

00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:44.320 align:middle line:90%
as a Type I civilization.

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Let me also say,
by the way, when

00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:49.750 align:middle line:84%
we look for outer space
signals, our Earth

00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:52.910 align:middle line:90%
also radiates into outer space.

00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:54.850 align:middle line:84%
For 50 years, we've
been broadcasting

00:54:54.850 --> 00:54:56.440 align:middle line:90%
radio and television.

00:54:56.440 --> 00:55:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Surrounding the Earth,
there is a sphere, expanding

00:55:01.550 --> 00:55:06.040 align:middle line:84%
at the speed of light,
50 light years in radius,

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:10.550 align:middle line:84%
containing the finest of
our cultural archives,

00:55:10.550 --> 00:55:14.940 align:middle line:84%
the noblest achievements of
the human creative spirit,

00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:17.510 align:middle line:84%
like "I Love Lucy,"
"Leave it to Beaver,"

00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:20.300 align:middle line:90%
"Beavis and Butt-head."

00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:23.870 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let me say
that we scientists have

00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:27.690 align:middle line:84%
tried to put ourselves in
the position of a Type III

00:55:27.690 --> 00:55:29.350 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:55:29.350 --> 00:55:33.550 align:middle line:84%
If we are truly galactic, and
we can use perhaps wormholes

00:55:33.550 --> 00:55:37.610 align:middle line:84%
or whatever to explore the
galaxy, how would we do so?

00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:41.580 align:middle line:84%
There are simply too many stars,
200 billion stars out there.

00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:46.390 align:middle line:84%
What we would do is send
robots, self-replicating robots.

00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:50.180 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
send William Shatner.

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:54.790 align:middle line:84%
These robots will land on a
moon, because moons are stable.

00:55:54.790 --> 00:55:56.240 align:middle line:90%
They have no erosion.

00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:58.520 align:middle line:84%
They're stable for
billions of years.

00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And once on the moon,
they'll build a factory.

00:56:01.410 --> 00:56:03.750 align:middle line:84%
The factory will then
produce thousands

00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:05.900 align:middle line:84%
of copies of themselves,
which will then

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:11.160 align:middle line:84%
shoot out to other moons
in other star systems.

00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And they will build
factories on them.

00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:16.100 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this
is the way that a virus

00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:18.145 align:middle line:90%
colonizes your entire body.

00:56:18.145 --> 00:56:18.770 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:21.470 align:middle line:84%
You consist of about
100 trillion cells.

00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And yet, one cold
virus, one cold virus

00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:28.350 align:middle line:84%
can colonize 100 trillion
cells in a fairly short period

00:56:28.350 --> 00:56:30.370 align:middle line:90%
of time, like about a week.

00:56:30.370 --> 00:56:32.440 align:middle line:90%
This is how viruses do it.

00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:36.830 align:middle line:84%
First encounter will
most likely take place

00:56:36.830 --> 00:56:40.170 align:middle line:84%
through what are called
self-replicating von Neumann

00:56:40.170 --> 00:56:44.170 align:middle line:84%
probes, and on our moon,
if there is a Type III

00:56:44.170 --> 00:56:47.110 align:middle line:90%
civilization in our own galaxy.

00:56:47.110 --> 00:56:50.350 align:middle line:84%
If there is Type III in
our galaxy, and Carl Sagan

00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:52.570 align:middle line:90%
firmly believed that there was.

00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:55.770 align:middle line:84%
If there's a Type III
civilization in our galaxy,

00:56:55.770 --> 00:56:57.900 align:middle line:90%
where would they most likely be?

00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:02.380 align:middle line:84%
They may have passed through
our system millions of years ago

00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:05.070 align:middle line:84%
and seen a planet in
the Goldilocks zone--

00:57:05.070 --> 00:57:08.040 align:middle line:84%
not too close, not too
far from the mother sun.

00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:10.080 align:middle line:90%
Left a probe on our moon.

00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:12.630 align:middle line:90%
Now let me ask you a question.

00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:15.170 align:middle line:84%
How long before
we become Type I?

00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Before we have an
operating moon base?

00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Before we can then probe
to see whether or not

00:57:20.010 --> 00:57:22.610 align:middle line:84%
any passing Type III
civilization left

00:57:22.610 --> 00:57:24.980 align:middle line:90%
a probe on our own moon?

00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:26.380 align:middle line:90%
Answer.

00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:29.120 align:middle line:90%
100 years.

00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:30.220 align:middle line:90%
Think about this.

00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:32.850 align:middle line:84%
On our own moon,
there could very well

00:57:32.850 --> 00:57:36.120 align:middle line:84%
be evidence of
previous visitation.

00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:41.150 align:middle line:84%
This is the most mathematically,
scientifically justifiable

00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:44.970 align:middle line:84%
theory that we have
for first encounter.

00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:48.180 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they
may already be here.

00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:50.130 align:middle line:90%
Except they're just waiting.

00:57:50.130 --> 00:57:53.010 align:middle line:84%
A Type 0 civilization
is not that interesting.

00:57:53.010 --> 00:57:56.000 align:middle line:84%
As I said before, Frank
Drake, the famous astronomer,

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:01.440 align:middle line:84%
estimated there should be 10,000
planets in our galaxy harboring

00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:02.070 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:58:02.070 --> 00:58:04.410 align:middle line:84%
But you see, they're
probably Type 0.

00:58:04.410 --> 00:58:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And they may have
self-destructed

00:58:07.090 --> 00:58:11.660 align:middle line:84%
before they reached Type I.
Once you attain Type I status,

00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:15.540 align:middle line:84%
you are interesting
to a passing Type III.

00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
another question.

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:20.400 align:middle line:90%
How would they interact with us?

00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And how would we
interact with them?

00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:24.920 align:middle line:84%
If you see ants in
a forest, and you're

00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:29.900 align:middle line:84%
building a 10-lane
superhighway near this anthill,

00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:33.740 align:middle line:84%
would the ants even know that
there's a 10-lane superhighway

00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:35.320 align:middle line:90%
going by?

00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:39.980 align:middle line:84%
Would they even understand
what a 10-lane superhighway is?

00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Would they be able
to communicate,

00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:45.150 align:middle line:84%
sense the presence of a 10-lane
superhighway being built

00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:47.120 align:middle line:90%
right next to the backyard?

00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:49.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, that 10-lane
superhighway is

00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:53.410 align:middle line:84%
comparable to a technology
of a Type III civilization

00:58:53.410 --> 00:58:56.250 align:middle line:84%
compared to the Type
0 that we have today.

00:58:56.250 --> 00:58:59.271 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't even
know where to look.

00:58:59.271 --> 00:59:03.820 align:middle line:84%
We look at just one frequency,
the frequency near hydrogen.

00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:06.880 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the most
sophisticated way

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:11.950 align:middle line:84%
of sending messages through the
galaxy is not on one frequency,

00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:15.520 align:middle line:84%
but you have what are called
spread spectrum broadcast.

00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:19.470 align:middle line:84%
You take a frequency, spread
it across all frequencies.

00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And then send that
signal throughout space.

00:59:22.790 --> 00:59:26.090 align:middle line:84%
That way, a passing star,
a passing meteorite,

00:59:26.090 --> 00:59:28.010 align:middle line:90%
won't disturb all frequencies.

00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Maybe one frequency
would have static.

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.870 align:middle line:84%
But you spread these
frequencies over all of them

00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:34.680 align:middle line:84%
and then reassemble
them at the other end.

00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:38.480 align:middle line:84%
Now if you were to listen
in on a spread frequency

00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:42.450 align:middle line:84%
message with your
radio telescopes,

00:59:42.450 --> 00:59:44.360 align:middle line:90%
what would you hear?

00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:45.780 align:middle line:90%
Nonsense.

00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:47.362 align:middle line:90%
Pure nonsense.

00:59:47.362 --> 00:59:48.945 align:middle line:84%
In the same way that
ants would listen

00:59:48.945 --> 00:59:50.870 align:middle line:84%
in on the conversations
of people building

00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:52.640 align:middle line:90%
a 10-lane superhighway.

00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:56.400 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm saying is
perhaps they're already here.

00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:59.218 align:middle line:84%
We're just too
primitive to know it.

00:59:59.218 --> 01:00:02.210 align:middle line:90%


01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:04.860 align:middle line:84%
String theory itself is
too difficult to solve.

01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:08.470 align:middle line:84%
No human mind at the present
time can solve the theory.

01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:12.180 align:middle line:84%
However, people have
emailed me about the fact

01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:15.100 align:middle line:84%
that string theory
has magic numbers,

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:18.770 align:middle line:84%
and that these magic numbers are
written in ancient manuscripts.

01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:20.715 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm no authority
on ancient manuscripts,

01:00:20.715 --> 01:00:23.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm just an authority
in mathematical physics.

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:30.180 align:middle line:84%
But string theory singles out
two magic numbers-- 26 and 10.

01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:32.950 align:middle line:84%
These are the magic
numbers of string theory.

01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:35.350 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the first
magic number, 26,

01:00:35.350 --> 01:00:37.970 align:middle line:84%
was pioneered by
an Indian mystic,

01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:39.740 align:middle line:84%
one of the greatest
mathematicians

01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:42.390 align:middle line:90%
of the century, Ramanujan.

01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:46.465 align:middle line:84%
He lived in total
obscurity in India.

01:00:46.465 --> 01:00:48.510 align:middle line:90%
He lived in total obscurity.

01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:50.960 align:middle line:84%
He wrote letters to the
great minds of England,

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.680 align:middle line:84%
trying to get anyone
to sponsor him.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, he
was racing ahead,

01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:57.780 align:middle line:84%
creating mathematics
we've never seen

01:00:57.780 --> 01:01:01.170 align:middle line:90%
before in the 26th dimension.

01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Ramanujan's life
is so fantastic,

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:07.480 align:middle line:90%
a movie was made recently.

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:09.335 align:middle line:84%
I think most of you
have seen that movie.

01:01:09.335 --> 01:01:10.960 align:middle line:84%
Who can tell me the
name of a Hollywood

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:13.300 align:middle line:84%
movie based on
perhaps the greatest

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:16.250 align:middle line:90%
Hindu mystic of the century?

01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:17.670 align:middle line:90%
Ramanujan.

01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:25.300 align:middle line:84%
The movie is called "Goodwill
Hunting," with Matt Damon.

01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:28.190 align:middle line:90%
Who is Matt Damon?

01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:31.240 align:middle line:90%
Matt Damon is Ramanujan.

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:33.260 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in the
movie, if you listen

01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:35.900 align:middle line:84%
to the conversation
between the MIT professors,

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:41.435 align:middle line:84%
they even say it-- "My god,
he's the next Ramanujan."

01:01:41.435 --> 01:01:43.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, what was Ramanujan doing?

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:48.150 align:middle line:84%
His manuscripts have still not
been totally deciphered yet.

01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:50.190 align:middle line:84%
He was working in
the 26th dimension,

01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:52.150 align:middle line:84%
the other magic number
of string theory.

01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:55.930 align:middle line:84%
However, there's a super magic
number, and that number is 10.

Well, somebody emailed
me a few years ago,

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:02.380 align:middle line:84%
stating that in Kabbalist
theory, if you add up

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:08.690 align:middle line:84%
the letters of God,
Yahweh, they add to 26.

01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And in the Kabbalah, there are
the 10 dimensions of heaven.

01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'm no
authority on religions.

01:02:15.350 --> 01:02:17.900 align:middle line:84%
All I'm saying is that
string theory does isolate

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:21.510 align:middle line:90%
two magic numbers-- 26 and 10.

01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:23.210 align:middle line:84%
So once again,
thank you so much.

01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:25.089 align:middle line:90%
You've been a great audience.

01:02:25.089 --> 01:02:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you. [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:26.130 --> 01:02:29.430 align:middle line:90%


01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>>And I'll stay for
questions afterwards.

01:02:34.580 --> 01:03:13.100 align:middle line:90%
