00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.540 align:middle line:84%
>>Dr. Stanislav Groff
is a psychiatrist

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.840 align:middle line:84%
with nearly 40
years of experience,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.780 align:middle line:84%
researching nonordinary
states of consciousness.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.570 align:middle line:10%
He received his scientific
training in his native Prague,

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.130 align:middle line:10%
leading to many
prestigious positions,

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.840 align:middle line:10%
including 14 years as
scholar in residence

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.390 align:middle line:10%
at the Esalen Institute.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.810 align:middle line:10%
He is one of the founders
and chief theoreticians

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.020 align:middle line:10%
of transpersonal psychology, and
a founder of the International

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.670 align:middle line:10%
Transpersonal Association.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.080 align:middle line:84%
His work has taken psychology
into realms so radically new

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.300 align:middle line:84%
and far reaching
that they challenge

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.330 align:middle line:84%
our understanding of the
laws of nature and physics.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.383 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, it is our deep pleasure
to welcome Dr. Stanislav Groff.

00:01:10.383 --> 00:01:10.883 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

00:01:10.883 --> 00:01:12.362 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:12.362 --> 00:01:15.320 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:25.200 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.340 align:middle line:84%
I would like to start with
a couple of questions.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you find
it very personal,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.850 align:middle line:90%
you can just ignore me.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And please don't
raise your hands

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.300 align:middle line:90%
until I finish my sentence.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.950 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to ask you, how many
of you experienced in your life

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.220 align:middle line:84%
some powerful nonordinary
states of consciousness.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.140 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
be psychedelics.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.250 align:middle line:84%
It could be as part
of spiritual practice.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.640 align:middle line:84%
It could be some powerful form
of experiential psychotherapy.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.280 align:middle line:84%
It could be a near-death
experience, participation

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.870 align:middle line:84%
in a shamanic ritual,
near-death experience,

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.160 align:middle line:84%
or it could be just
experiences that happened.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.080 align:middle line:84%
You don't ask for it, you don't
do anything to induce them.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.960 align:middle line:84%
You might even be fighting
them, and they happen anyway.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.360 align:middle line:90%
So any of those categories.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.120 align:middle line:90%
Can I see the hands?

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.500 align:middle line:90%
OK, you can look around.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Although, this is obviously
a self-selected audience,

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.970 align:middle line:90%
it's still pretty impressive.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.730 align:middle line:90%


00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Part of my talk will
be focusing on the fact

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.380 align:middle line:84%
that we do not have
in Western psychiatry

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.450 align:middle line:84%
a non-pathological category
for any of these experiences.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.240 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a category
like a mystical experience,

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.020 align:middle line:90%
a spiritual experience.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.990 align:middle line:84%
All nonordinary states
of consciousness

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.960 align:middle line:84%
are put in the category
of psychopathology.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And we have met many people
who had what in other cultures

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.350 align:middle line:84%
would be considered to
be extremely important,

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.480 align:middle line:90%
valuable experiences.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.680 align:middle line:84%
In our culture, they
would get a diagnosis.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.520 align:middle line:84%
They would be put
on tranquilizers.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.850 align:middle line:90%
They would be hospitalized.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you get a
diagnosis like that,

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.010 align:middle line:90%
it's a diagnosis for life.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.225 align:middle line:84%
Even if you don't have
any other experience

00:03:18.225 --> 00:03:19.600 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of
your life, you'll

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.490 align:middle line:84%
still be seen as
psychotic in remission.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.690 align:middle line:90%


00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.740 align:middle line:84%
So I will be talking today
about nonordinary states

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.610 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Even that term, "nonordinary,"
is used primarily

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.650 align:middle line:84%
by those of us who have done
some consciousness research.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.940 align:middle line:84%
The rest of
psychiatrists call them

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.450 align:middle line:84%
altered states of
consciousness that I really

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.730 align:middle line:90%
dislike very strongly.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.860 align:middle line:84%
It always reminds me
of veterinary medicine,

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.950 align:middle line:84%
what happens when you
get your dog altered.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.090 align:middle line:84%
So it involves
somehow the notion

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.750 align:middle line:84%
that there is one correct way
of experiencing ourselves,

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.620 align:middle line:84%
and that these states are
some kind of distorted

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.670 align:middle line:84%
bastardized versions of how
should we see ourselves,

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.390 align:middle line:90%
how we should see reality.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And I have been
primarily interested

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:19.940 align:middle line:84%
in the healing potential and
in the transformative potential

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.580 align:middle line:84%
of these states, their
evolutionary potential,

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.290 align:middle line:84%
and also what we call
heuristic potential.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.250 align:middle line:84%
This is from the Greek eureka,
which means I have found it.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.320 align:middle line:84%
So heuristic
potential of the state

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.370 align:middle line:84%
is what we can learn from
these states about ourselves--

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.130 align:middle line:84%
about human nature, about
the nature of consciousness,

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.200 align:middle line:84%
about emotional
psychosomatic disorders,

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:52.560 align:middle line:84%
about psycho-spiritual
transformation, and so on.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.320 align:middle line:84%
Now for this purpose, even
the term "nonordinary"

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.690 align:middle line:90%
is very broad.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.850 align:middle line:84%
There are many nonordinary
states of consciousness

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.120 align:middle line:84%
that are clinically
important, but they are not

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.360 align:middle line:84%
interesting from a
heuristic perspective,

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.870 align:middle line:90%
from a therapeutic perspective.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.230 align:middle line:84%
You can get very drunk,
and you'll certainly

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.900 align:middle line:84%
be in a nonordinary
state of consciousness.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.090 align:middle line:84%
You might learn a
lesson or two from that,

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.890 align:middle line:84%
but it's not going
to be very revealing.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.300 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to be healing.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
be transformative.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.040 align:middle line:84%
You can have a uremia,
your kidneys are failing,

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.860 align:middle line:84%
you have a lot of
toxicity in your body,

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.710 align:middle line:90%
and you go into a delirium.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's not something that's
interesting therapeutically,

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.780 align:middle line:84%
or that's interesting
heuristically.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.850 align:middle line:84%
Encephalitis, meningitis,
some kind of post

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:48.310 align:middle line:84%
traumatic situation after
contusion of the brain.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.240 align:middle line:84%
All those can alter
your consciousness

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.780 align:middle line:84%
very profoundly, but not in
the direction that I have

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.790 align:middle line:90%
been studying all these years.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.110 align:middle line:84%
I've been basically
studying the kinds of states

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.270 align:middle line:84%
that I was asking you about,
the kinds of things that

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.340 align:middle line:84%
happen in shamanic
procedures, things that happen

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.120 align:middle line:84%
in the rites of
passage or healing

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.800 align:middle line:84%
rituals of various
native cultures, the kind

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.900 align:middle line:84%
of experiences that the
initiates experienced

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.230 align:middle line:84%
in the mysteries of
death and rebirth,

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.420 align:middle line:84%
the kinds of experiences that
the yogis are experiencing,

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.690 align:middle line:84%
or that we can experience in
different forms of Buddhist

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:33.060 align:middle line:84%
meditation, Taoist
meditation, during Sufi Zikrs,

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.370 align:middle line:84%
doing some
Kabbalistic exercises,

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:42.260 align:middle line:84%
the kinds of things that
early Christians experienced,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:49.380 align:middle line:84%
Hesychasm, Jesus prayer, or
the result of the exercises

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.570 align:middle line:90%
of Ignatius of Loyola.

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
astounded to find out

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.590 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have a special
category for these experiences,

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.870 align:middle line:84%
that unquestionably
have a healing

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.970 align:middle line:84%
potential, a
transformative potential,

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:09.210 align:middle line:84%
evolutionary potential,
and heuristic potential.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Since I haven't found a name, I
decided to call in one myself.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.380 align:middle line:90%
And I call them holotropic.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:20.950 align:middle line:84%
This is a Greek word
where holos means whole,

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.400 align:middle line:84%
and tropic is from
trepane, which

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.340 align:middle line:84%
means moving towards
something or being

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.820 align:middle line:90%
oriented towards something.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.670 align:middle line:84%
You might know the term
from the word heliotropism.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Helios is the sun,
heliotropism is the property

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.070 align:middle line:84%
of the plant to
always follow the sun,

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.895 align:middle line:84%
or orient itself
towards the sun.

00:07:44.895 --> 00:07:47.530 align:middle line:84%
Now I hope that as we
continue you will understand

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:51.160 align:middle line:84%
the full meaning of
the term "holotropic,"

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.650 align:middle line:90%
moving towards wholeness.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.230 align:middle line:90%


00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:59.800 align:middle line:84%
But at this point, I will use
a kind of a Hindu shorthand

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.740 align:middle line:84%
and remind you of the
passage in Upanishads

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.656 align:middle line:84%
where it says in
Sanskrit, "Tat Tvam Asi."

00:08:06.656 --> 00:08:11.040 align:middle line:84%
This is an answer to the
question who you are.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And Ram Dass talked quite
extensively about it earlier.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:20.270 align:middle line:84%
So the answer to the
question is "Tat Tvam Asi",

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:25.600 align:middle line:84%
which is usually translated in
a kind of archaic language, Thou

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.690 align:middle line:84%
art that, the capital T, which
means you're number three.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.940 align:middle line:90%


00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.370 align:middle line:90%
You are not Namarupa.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.909 align:middle line:84%
You are not the
name and the shape.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:43.370 align:middle line:84%
You are not the body ego,
as we call it in the west,

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:47.360 align:middle line:84%
but your true identity is with
the divine principle itself,

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.970 align:middle line:84%
with the totality of the
creative consciousness,

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:56.190 align:middle line:84%
the absolute consciousness,
the creative principle

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.280 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.500 align:middle line:84%
So the holotropic
states are states

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:05.940 align:middle line:84%
that can move us step by step
from our everyday identity

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:13.142 align:middle line:84%
from the body ego to
Atman Brahman to the Tao,

00:09:13.142 --> 00:09:18.290 align:middle line:84%
to the cosmic Christ, Allah,
the Great Spirit, whatever

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:22.210 align:middle line:84%
terminology we want
to use for that.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:25.460 align:middle line:84%
So the basic idea behind
the term holotropic

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:30.320 align:middle line:84%
is we are somehow not
what we think we are,

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.330 align:middle line:84%
what we are experiencing
in the everyday state

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:33.900 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Our true identity spreads
between the body ego

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:43.700 align:middle line:84%
to the cosmic principle, and
we can experience ourselves

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.875 align:middle line:90%
as anything in between.

00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:50.340 align:middle line:90%


00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Now I will just give
a brief description

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:56.850 align:middle line:84%
of holotropic
states and how they

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:00.470 align:middle line:84%
differ from the other
nonordinary or altered

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:02.890 align:middle line:90%
states of consciousness.

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:07.580 align:middle line:84%
So the large category of the
altered states of consciousness

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.540 align:middle line:84%
could be called
trivial delirium, could

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.740 align:middle line:90%
be called organic psychosis.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Those are states that are
clinically important, but not

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:18.240 align:middle line:90%
healing, not transformative.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.530 align:middle line:84%
What's very important
in these states

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:25.010 align:middle line:84%
is that consciousness is
kind of grossly impaired.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.680 align:middle line:90%
People are confused.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.430 align:middle line:90%
People are disoriented.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:30.480 align:middle line:84%
People in that
state might not know

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.100 align:middle line:84%
who they are, where
they are, what's

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.840 align:middle line:90%
happening, what year it is.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Typically the intellect is
impaired in these states.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:42.810 align:middle line:90%
And there is typically amnesia.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:45.860 align:middle line:84%
Now none of this is true
in the holotropic states.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.110 align:middle line:84%
In the holotropic
states, consciousness

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.480 align:middle line:84%
is changed in a
very profound way,

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.380 align:middle line:90%
but also in a very subtle way.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.100 align:middle line:90%
We still remember our name.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.870 align:middle line:84%
We know where we are,
with the exception

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.020 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual
emergencies, we also

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.160 align:middle line:90%
know why we are in that state.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Have just taken 500
micrograms of LSD,

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.270 align:middle line:84%
or we are participating
in a shamanic ritual,

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:13.860 align:middle line:84%
or we are doing a holotropic
breath for a workshop.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.640 align:middle line:84%
So we are sort of
still in connection

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.700 align:middle line:84%
with the everyday reality
to a great extent,

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.960 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time, either a
radically different perspective

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.740 align:middle line:84%
on this reality, or
entirely different realities

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.890 align:middle line:84%
normally invisible would
be kind of invading

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:32.900 align:middle line:90%
our field of consciousness.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:37.740 align:middle line:84%
We would have each foot
in a different reality.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:42.010 align:middle line:84%
This is what the Swiss
psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:84%
called double bookkeeping,
or doppelte Buchführung,

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.060 align:middle line:90%
those of you who speak German.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.860 align:middle line:90%


00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.830 align:middle line:84%
So this is the change
in consciousness

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:58.400 align:middle line:84%
that characterizes
these holotropic states.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.990 align:middle line:84%
There are also powerful
changes in emotions.

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.910 align:middle line:84%
The emotions that
we can experience

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:07.850 align:middle line:84%
cover a very broad
spectrum, much broader

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:10.510 align:middle line:84%
than what we know
from everyday life.

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Where on one side
we can experience

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:18.610 align:middle line:84%
states of ecstatic rapture,
of bliss beyond imagination,

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:20.340 align:middle line:84%
peace that passes
all understanding.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.290 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:28.254 align:middle line:84%
We can experience tranquility,
serenity, and so on.

00:12:28.254 --> 00:12:30.790 align:middle line:84%
On the other side
of the spectrum,

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.800 align:middle line:90%
we can experience the opposite.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:38.660 align:middle line:84%
We can experience a profound
terror, abysmal despair,

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:42.410 align:middle line:84%
metaphysical feelings of
guilt, and so on, and anything

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:43.740 align:middle line:90%
in between.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And of course the
two extremes are

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.150 align:middle line:84%
states that have been described
in the spiritual textures

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.700 align:middle line:84%
as experiences
that are celestial,

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.870 align:middle line:84%
paradisian, on the one
hand, or experiences that

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:59.050 align:middle line:90%
are infernal on the other side.

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Now there are very interesting
changes in intellect.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.930 align:middle line:84%
In holotropic states, the
intellect is not impaired.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:09.946 align:middle line:84%
The intellect functions in
a radically different way.

00:13:09.946 --> 00:13:11.320 align:middle line:84%
So, for example,
I would not like

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:16.570 align:middle line:84%
to be in a holotropic state
when I have to do my taxes.

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:18.710 align:middle line:84%
That's where I want to
be in a different state

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:19.910 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:24.940 align:middle line:84%
I use for it the term
"hilotropic." "Hilo" in Greek,

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:28.010 align:middle line:90%
again, means matter.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:33.130 align:middle line:84%
Hilotropic or helotropic
would mean matter oriented,

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:37.190 align:middle line:84%
matter oriented consciousness
in which I experience myself

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:42.660 align:middle line:84%
as a Newtonian object, as a
body existing in a reality that

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:48.250 align:middle line:84%
has Newtonian characteristics,
where matter is solid,

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:52.280 align:middle line:84%
where time is linear, where
space is three dimensional.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Everything seems to be tied
into chains of cause and effect

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:58.530 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:04.570 align:middle line:84%
I usually give another example,
which is like a pilot of a 747

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:08.740 align:middle line:84%
that is landing the jumbo
jet in O'Hara airport.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not a great place
for the holotropic state

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.270 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:16.420 align:middle line:84%
You want to know that the
runway solid, that you

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.486 align:middle line:84%
have certain fixed
time space coordinates.

00:14:19.486 --> 00:14:22.280 align:middle line:84%
This is not a great time
to explore your past life

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.850 align:middle line:90%
in ancient Egypt.

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not a great
time to experience

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:34.370 align:middle line:84%
out-of-body astral
projection to San Francisco.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Now on the other
hand, the intellect

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.360 align:middle line:84%
has certain capacity
in a holotropic state

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.250 align:middle line:84%
that it does not have
in the hilotropic state.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.910 align:middle line:84%
So for example, in
a holotropic state,

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:53.800 align:middle line:84%
we can regress into
childhood or infancy.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.930 align:middle line:84%
We can discover that there's
some kind of traumatic things

00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:00.000 align:middle line:84%
that happened to
us early in life

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.730 align:middle line:84%
that make our present life
inauthentic, distorted,

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.110 align:middle line:84%
that there are sources of
different emotional and

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.750 align:middle line:90%
psychosomatic problems.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Now we can not only discover
that those things happen,

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.450 align:middle line:84%
but we can actually relive
them and we can integrate them.

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.240 align:middle line:90%
We can heal ourselves.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:24.630 align:middle line:84%
We can make our life
for more authentic.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:25.870 align:middle line:90%
We can even go further.

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:32.650 align:middle line:84%
We can discover that our life
is inauthentic in a certain way

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:35.870 align:middle line:84%
because of the
circumstances of our birth,

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:43.000 align:middle line:84%
that we repeat certain patterns
from that time, or even things

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.600 align:middle line:90%
that happened prenatally.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.160 align:middle line:84%
Earlier today, Ralph
mentioned that we

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.500 align:middle line:84%
can re-experience even
conception on a cellular level

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.650 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:00.550 align:middle line:84%
The other tremendous potential
of a holotropic state

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:03.830 align:middle line:84%
is we can now transcend
our boundaries.

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:07.240 align:middle line:84%
The boundaries of our ego
and our personal history

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.220 align:middle line:84%
in this lifetime
altogether, and we

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.900 align:middle line:84%
can experience
full identification

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.650 align:middle line:84%
with other people, getting
access to their feelings,

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:18.990 align:middle line:84%
getting access to
their thoughts,

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:23.490 align:middle line:84%
getting access to their
biographical history.

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:26.950 align:middle line:84%
We can experience consciousness
of a group of people.

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:30.210 align:middle line:84%
We can experience ourselves
as all mothers of the world,

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:34.990 align:middle line:84%
or all children of the world,
or all soldiers of the world,

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:40.420 align:middle line:84%
or the whole population
of India in one kind

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:41.430 align:middle line:90%
of experiential unit.

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:44.980 align:middle line:90%


00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.390 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
that can happen, we

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.100 align:middle line:84%
can transcend the
human boundaries

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:54.100 align:middle line:84%
and we can experience ourselves
as different life forms.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And again, anything from
primates all the way down

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.316 align:middle line:90%
to unicellular organisms.

00:16:59.316 --> 00:17:02.840 align:middle line:90%


00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:07.640 align:middle line:84%
We can transcend the boundaries
of the animal kingdom,

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and we can experience
ourselves as different aspects

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.589 align:middle line:90%
of plant life.

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:17.420 align:middle line:84%
I remember one of my sessions
where I became a Venus flytrap,

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:20.119 align:middle line:84%
experiencing fully
consciously what

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:25.130 align:middle line:84%
it is like when a Venus
flytrap, a carnivorous plant,

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:27.359 align:middle line:84%
catches the fly and
digests the fly,

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:29.740 align:middle line:84%
with all this
chemical sensations,

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:33.290 align:middle line:84%
gustatory sensations,
which was so fantastic

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:35.060 align:middle line:84%
that I couldn't
possibly conjure it up

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.740 align:middle line:90%
in my everyday consciousness.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:40.065 align:middle line:90%
And looked very, very authentic.

00:17:40.065 --> 00:17:42.910 align:middle line:90%


00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Now when we have these kinds
of states, of identification

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:51.910 align:middle line:84%
with other life
forms, we can find out

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:54.840 align:middle line:84%
that these are absolutely
authentic because we get access

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.840 align:middle line:84%
to new information about
these life forms that

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.530 align:middle line:84%
by far transcends anything
that we have learned

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:03.550 align:middle line:84%
in this lifetime, anything
that we have seen in NOVA

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:06.250 align:middle line:84%
programs, anything
that we have learned

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:10.150 align:middle line:84%
in the classes of biology,
any kind of movies

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:12.430 align:middle line:90%
that we have seen, and so on.

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:16.865 align:middle line:84%
Very authentic experience,
and also experience that is

00:18:16.865 --> 00:18:21.320 align:middle line:84%
a source of information of the
kind that we cannot get through

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.140 align:middle line:90%
our media.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:28.700 align:middle line:84%
For example, like a TV
program could show you

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.060 align:middle line:90%
what an eagle looks like.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:34.180 align:middle line:84%
It can show you
what it sounds like,

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:37.010 align:middle line:84%
but it cannot give you the
experience of what it feels

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:37.915 align:middle line:90%
like to be an eagle.

00:18:37.915 --> 00:18:40.990 align:middle line:84%
It cannot give you the
body image of an eagle.

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:46.650 align:middle line:84%
It cannot teach you what you
do with your wings to fly.

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:51.350 align:middle line:84%
It cannot show you the typically
the world through the eyes

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:54.990 align:middle line:84%
of the eagle, which is a
different kind of a perception.

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:58.990 align:middle line:84%
The eagle sees everything
larger because the lens is

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:00.790 align:middle line:90%
closer to the surface.

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:03.870 align:middle line:84%
The eagle also has what's
called bifocal vision,

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:10.680 align:middle line:84%
can zoom when he sees something,
or she, something interesting.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.500 align:middle line:84%
So I have a whole
list of experiences

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:16.300 align:middle line:84%
where people discovered
absolutely new information

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:21.100 align:middle line:84%
about these animals that was
very, very far beyond what

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.050 align:middle line:90%
they learned in this lifetime.

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:29.530 align:middle line:84%
For example, a woman in
a workshop in Brussels

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:32.130 align:middle line:84%
experienced herself
as a pregnant whale

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:36.960 align:middle line:84%
and delivered a
calf in that form,

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.700 align:middle line:84%
and gave a very
detailed description

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:44.660 align:middle line:84%
of the delivery of whales
that contained information

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:49.000 align:middle line:84%
that I later confirmed
with a marine biologist.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:56.360 align:middle line:84%
She learned all kinds of details
about the different aspects

00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:00.220 align:middle line:90%
of the whale delivery.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Another person experienced
herself as a lion.

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And when she was
describing it afterwards,

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:09.530 align:middle line:84%
she said that she got
insights into the hunting

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:13.950 align:middle line:84%
impulse of a lion, and then
the impulse for hunting

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:17.980 align:middle line:84%
comes from a place between
the shoulder blades.

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.080 align:middle line:84%
I looked at her and
said, shoulder blade

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.040 align:middle line:90%
doesn't seem right.

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.382 align:middle line:84%
And I studied some biology as
part of my medical studies.

00:20:24.382 --> 00:20:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think it
would have something

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:29.150 align:middle line:84%
to do with the oblongata with
the brain stem, and so on.

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And she said no,
shoulder blades.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:34.565 align:middle line:84%
And so we talked for a
while, and then we let it go,

00:20:34.565 --> 00:20:40.020 align:middle line:84%
and about two years
later, she and I met.

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And she said I told you it was
between the shoulder blades.

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.890 align:middle line:84%
She said I attended a
lecture of a dietitian,

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:48.490 align:middle line:84%
and during this
lecture, he talked

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:52.870 align:middle line:84%
about something called the
brown fat, which is a fat that

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:54.970 align:middle line:90%
is stored in a repository.

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.150 align:middle line:84%
It's like a hump on the
back of the felines.

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And when it gets depleted,
you have to go hunting.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.040 align:middle line:90%


00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:07.020 align:middle line:84%
So I have many hundreds of these
kinds of observations where

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:12.750 align:middle line:84%
a very authentic identification
with animal life and plant life

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:16.540 align:middle line:84%
actually brought
absolutely new information.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Now there's something that
goes even beyond that.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:21.840 align:middle line:90%
You can transcend linear time.

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:27.590 align:middle line:84%
You can experience episodes from
the lives of your ancestors.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:30.220 align:middle line:84%
You can experience racial
collective memories

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.490 align:middle line:90%
in the Jungian sense.

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:35.120 align:middle line:84%
You can experience
past life memories,

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:38.230 align:middle line:84%
where something from another
culture, from another century

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.410 align:middle line:84%
comes with a sense of
personal remembering.

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:44.210 align:middle line:84%
This is not the first time
this is happening to me,

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:46.560 align:middle line:84%
I once was that
person, and I'm now

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.850 align:middle line:84%
remembering that
this happened to me,

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:53.980 align:middle line:84%
which has also deep
connections to present life.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.930 align:middle line:90%
It can result in healing.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:22:01.410 align:middle line:84%
It can result in changes in
human relationships, and so on.

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Now another thing that can
happen in holotropic states

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:08.910 align:middle line:84%
is that you can transcend
this reality altogether

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:12.780 align:middle line:84%
and you can have
experiences of encounters

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:16.460 align:middle line:84%
with, or identification
with mythological beings,

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.610 align:middle line:84%
archetypal beings from
different cultures.

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And again, getting
accurate information

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.140 align:middle line:84%
about other mythologies,
even mythologies

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:28.140 align:middle line:90%
that you never studied.

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.380 align:middle line:84%
I have in one of
my books an example

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:35.230 align:middle line:84%
of that which is something
that happened in Prague when

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:38.560 align:middle line:84%
I worked with a person who
suffered from thanatophobia,

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.640 align:middle line:84%
which is a pathological
fear of death.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And after powerful experience of
encountering births and death,

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:50.170 align:middle line:84%
there was suddenly
a vision of an entry

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.350 align:middle line:84%
into the underworld
that was guarded

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:57.370 align:middle line:84%
by a goddess in the
form of a pig, a sow.

00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And he came out
of the experience

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:04.310 align:middle line:84%
and asked me for
a pencil and paper

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:07.280 align:middle line:84%
and started drawing very
complicated labyrinths.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And not being satisfied with
it, was trampling and sort

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:13.530 align:middle line:84%
of crumpling them and
throwing them around.

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And afterwards, when
we talked about it,

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.280 align:middle line:84%
I was still very Freudian, I
was using free associations,

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:21.620 align:middle line:84%
and we were not finding
very much, so again,

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:25.280 align:middle line:84%
then the process went elsewhere
and I forgot about it.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And then when I came to
Esalen, Joseph Campbell

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:32.980 align:middle line:84%
used to visit very frequently,
coming to our workshops

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.610 align:middle line:90%
and doing his own workshops.

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And usually by Wednesday he
got tired of the Esalen food,

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:42.590 align:middle line:84%
he called it rabbit food, and
wanted his steak and Glenlivet,

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:44.650 align:middle line:90%
so he came to our house.

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And I always had lists
of archetypal experiences

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:51.000 align:middle line:84%
that people had that
I didn't understand.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And Joseph was an incredible
encyclopedia of mythology.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:58.780 align:middle line:84%
So he had usually no
problems identifying,

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:02.160 align:middle line:84%
because these were real sort
of mythological experiences.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.580 align:middle line:84%
So at one point I
told him this story.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.000 align:middle line:90%
And he said this is fascinating.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.820 align:middle line:84%
This is the devouring
great mother goddess

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:13.200 align:middle line:84%
of the Moroccan
tribe in New Guinea.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.950 align:middle line:90%


00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Their goddess has
the form of a pig,

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:22.010 align:middle line:84%
and she's guarding the
entry into the underworld.

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And during their
lifetime, they practice

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.090 align:middle line:84%
drawing a very
complicated labyrinth,

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:30.610 align:middle line:84%
because when they die and
they come to the underworld,

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:34.180 align:middle line:84%
they have to show her that
they can draw this labyrinth,

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:38.110 align:middle line:84%
otherwise they would
not make the transition.

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is one of many,
many observations showing

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:46.210 align:middle line:84%
that you can get access to
mythological information

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:52.530 align:middle line:84%
about mythologies of cultures
that you have never studied.

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:55.510 align:middle line:84%
So this is the intellect
in holotropic states.

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:57.010 align:middle line:84%
In holotropic states,
there are also

00:24:57.010 --> 00:25:00.860 align:middle line:90%
powerful physical experiences.

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Again, broad spectrum, one side,
sense of incredible energy,

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:10.560 align:middle line:84%
vitality, healthy, energy
that seems inexhaustible.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And the other side
of the spectrum, you

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:15.100 align:middle line:84%
can experience
yourself as dying.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.110 align:middle line:84%
You can experience
unbelievable pain.

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.962 align:middle line:90%
You can experience suffocation.

00:25:19.962 --> 00:25:21.420 align:middle line:84%
If you are reliving
your birth, you

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:25.370 align:middle line:84%
can experience abysmal
nausea, for example.

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:28.210 align:middle line:84%
So again, a very,
very broad spectrum.

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:31.815 align:middle line:84%
So this is the phenomenology
of the holotropic states.

00:25:31.815 --> 00:25:34.352 align:middle line:90%


00:25:34.352 --> 00:25:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And now I will just talk a
little about the triggers.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.150 align:middle line:84%
How do we induce
nonordinary states?

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:43.220 align:middle line:84%
About five years ago,
we had a conference

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:45.810 align:middle line:84%
of the International
Transpersonal Association,

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:50.875 align:middle line:84%
which was in Manaus, in
the Amazonian jungle,

00:25:50.875 --> 00:25:53.620 align:middle line:90%
in the Tropical hotel.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And the name of
this conference was

00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:00.360 align:middle line:84%
"Technologies of the
Sacred: Ancient, Aboriginal,

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:03.890 align:middle line:84%
and Modern," where we explored
all different ways how

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:08.100 align:middle line:84%
you can induce these holotropic
experiences that mediate

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.900 align:middle line:84%
direct access to
what Jung would call

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:17.840 align:middle line:84%
a numinous aspect of reality,
sacred, holy, spiritual,

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:22.590 align:middle line:84%
mystical, whatever
terminology you want to use.

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:26.800 align:middle line:84%
So we had shamans from different
South American countries.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:31.320 align:middle line:84%
We had the people
using ayahuasca

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:34.470 align:middle line:84%
for religious purposes,
the Santo Daime people,

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:38.650 align:middle line:84%
the Uniao do Vegetal people, the
spiritists, the Umbanda people,

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:43.230 align:middle line:84%
and so on, the Jungians talking
about active imagination.

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:45.940 align:middle line:84%
We did a large holotropic
breathwork workshop.

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.410 align:middle line:84%
It was a pre-conference
workshop.

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in Brazil,
ayahuasca is legal.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:55.660 align:middle line:84%
It's seen properly as
a sacrament, so many

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:58.890 align:middle line:84%
of the people before
and after the conference

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:05.860 align:middle line:84%
could have also experiences
with this sacred medicine.

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:10.550 align:middle line:84%
So some of these techniques,
some of these technologies

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:14.120 align:middle line:84%
that the sacred, it can
induce holotropic experiences,

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:17.520 align:middle line:90%
go way back into prehistory.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And are very closely connected
with shamanism, the oldest

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:26.900 align:middle line:84%
religion or spiritual practice
and the oldest healing art

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:30.085 align:middle line:84%
we have in southern
France and northern Spain.

00:27:30.085 --> 00:27:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And there's beautiful
images of animals

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:34.750 align:middle line:90%
on the walls of the caves.

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And among them, there
are several figures that

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:41.010 align:middle line:84%
were identified as the
images of the early shamans,

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:45.660 align:middle line:84%
combining animal
and human features,

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:51.840 align:middle line:84%
the so-called sorcerer of Les
Trois Freres, the beast master,

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:56.430 align:middle line:84%
then there is this scene,
another scene from Lascaux

00:27:56.430 --> 00:28:02.220 align:middle line:84%
showing a wounded bison
and a figure lying

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:06.400 align:middle line:84%
on the ground, which usually
was interpreted as a hunting

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:10.150 align:middle line:84%
accident until somebody
noticed that the figure has

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:14.870 align:middle line:84%
an erect penis, which is an
unlikely event at the time

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:19.600 align:middle line:84%
of death, but it's a very common
event in a shamanic trance

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.420 align:middle line:90%
or a mediumystic trance.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So it is another image
of a shaman in trance.

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:36.630 align:middle line:84%
So shamanism has been around
for 20 to 40,000 years.

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Now shamanism is
closely connected

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.620 align:middle line:84%
to holotropic states
in several ways.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.550 align:middle line:84%
One is that the
career of many shamans

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:47.150 align:middle line:84%
begins by spontaneous
visionary state, which

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:50.600 align:middle line:84%
involves a journey
to the underworld,

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:54.060 align:middle line:84%
going through various ordeals,
being annihilated, being

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:59.405 align:middle line:84%
dismembered, and then getting a
new body, new flesh, new blood,

00:28:59.405 --> 00:29:02.670 align:middle line:84%
new eyes, and then
there's a magic journey

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:05.290 align:middle line:84%
into the supernal
realms, which takes

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:09.390 align:middle line:84%
different archetypal forms
in different cultures.

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Try being transformed
into a solar bird,

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:15.400 align:middle line:84%
like an eagle, condor,
thunderbird, falcon,

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:21.210 align:middle line:84%
or being carried by a solar
bird into the solar realm.

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:24.890 align:middle line:84%
It can be climbing the rainbow,
climbing the world's tree,

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:29.880 align:middle line:84%
climbing a pole with
notches, and so on.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Now during this experience, the
shaman will also very deeply

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:37.550 align:middle line:84%
connect with animals,
both real animals,

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:41.400 align:middle line:84%
living animals, and what we can
call archetypal animals, what

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:45.600 align:middle line:84%
the shamans would call power
animals, or animal spirits.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.170 align:middle line:84%
They connect with
forces of nature.

00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:49.880 align:middle line:84%
But what's even
more interesting,

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.740 align:middle line:90%
they typically heal themselves.

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:56.082 align:middle line:84%
The anthropologists talk about
shamans as wounded healers.

00:29:56.082 --> 00:29:58.920 align:middle line:84%
They very frequently
go into that experience

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:02.210 align:middle line:84%
with many problems,
that could be physical,

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:05.320 align:middle line:84%
that could be emotional,
that could be psychosomatic,

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.120 align:middle line:90%
and they heal themselves.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:10.870 align:middle line:84%
But not only that, they
get insight into healing

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:11.370 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:14.980 align:middle line:84%
It's like a crash
course in healing,

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:16.690 align:middle line:84%
but healing of a
different kind than what

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:19.530 align:middle line:90%
we know in the Western culture.

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:22.120 align:middle line:84%
We are just barely
beginning to have notion

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.920 align:middle line:84%
of that kind of healing,
which is energetic healing,

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:26.780 align:middle line:90%
working with energies.

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:29.080 align:middle line:84%
We have organ
pathological medicine.

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.190 align:middle line:84%
We have diseases of the heart
and the gastrointestinal

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:35.540 align:middle line:84%
system, and the genital
and urinary system

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:38.960 align:middle line:84%
and so on, diseases
of the brain.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.330 align:middle line:84%
Whereas in energy
medicine, the idea

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:44.760 align:middle line:84%
is that it's an
energetic problem,

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.310 align:middle line:84%
and that precedes by many years
frequently the development

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:51.100 align:middle line:90%
of actual organic symptoms.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.020 align:middle line:90%
And you can practice prevention.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:56.810 align:middle line:84%
You can actually prevent
development of diseases.

00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:59.770 align:middle line:84%
But you can also heal
diseases when they are there

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:03.560 align:middle line:84%
by working on energies
rather than doing

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:07.090 align:middle line:84%
allopathic
interventions, surgeries,

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:10.330 align:middle line:90%
organ transplants, and so on.

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:15.180 align:middle line:84%
So these shamans get insights
into energetic medicine,

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:19.180 align:middle line:84%
that behind symptoms
there is blocked energy,

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.510 align:middle line:84%
and there are ways you can
sort of free the energy.

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And when the energy is flowing,
the body takes care of itself.

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.850 align:middle line:84%
This is what you find
in Chinese medicine,

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:30.690 align:middle line:84%
under like acupuncture,
moxibustion, and so on.

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:34.610 align:middle line:84%
This is what you find
in homeopathy and so on.

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Then when the shaman integrates
this experience well,

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:42.760 align:middle line:84%
then he or she uses holotropic
states for working with others,

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.330 align:middle line:84%
either going into
a holotropic state,

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:48.410 align:middle line:84%
or inducing the holotropic
states in the client,

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:51.100 align:middle line:84%
or both of them go
into holotropic state,

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:54.250 align:middle line:84%
or a whole tribe would
go into a healing trance,

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:59.090 align:middle line:84%
like the Kalahari
Bushmen, for example.

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Now the second area
where we have techniques

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:06.160 align:middle line:84%
that in use are
holotropic states

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.550 align:middle line:84%
would be the rites of
passage and other kinds

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:11.450 align:middle line:90%
of native rituals.

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:13.250 align:middle line:84%
They're using the
same technologies

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:16.810 align:middle line:84%
as the shamans are,
which could be drumming,

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:19.370 align:middle line:84%
which would be working
with rattles, with sticks,

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:25.290 align:middle line:84%
with gongs, bells, the
didgeridoo, the bullroarer

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:26.570 align:middle line:90%
rower, and so on.

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:33.950 align:middle line:84%
Movements, dancing,
whirling, rocking, and so on.

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:36.620 align:middle line:84%
Some powerful physiological
interventions,

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:38.940 align:middle line:90%
bloodletting, for example.

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Like the Maya people, fasting,
sleep deprivation, dehydration,

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:50.331 align:middle line:84%
extreme physical pain, like
the Lakota Sioux Sun Dance,

00:32:50.331 --> 00:32:50.830 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:54.175 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
psychedelic plants.

00:32:54.175 --> 00:32:56.900 align:middle line:90%


00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:59.490 align:middle line:84%
So the rites of passage
are extremely important

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:03.930 align:middle line:84%
universal ubiquitous
kind of rituals conducted

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:05.560 align:middle line:84%
in these native
cultures at the time

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:09.430 align:middle line:84%
of some important transitions--
biological or social,

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:13.610 align:middle line:84%
like birth of a child,
circumcision, puberty,

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:18.080 align:middle line:84%
menopause, aging,
and, of course, dying.

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Again, using the same
kind of technology,

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:24.670 align:middle line:84%
inducing a holotropic state,
and if you study the experiences

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:29.350 align:middle line:84%
that the initiates have, again,
similar like the shamans.

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:31.940 align:middle line:84%
They have the experience
of psycho-spiritual death

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:34.690 align:middle line:90%
and rebirth.

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:36.150 align:middle line:84%
In these cultures,
it's interpreted

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:39.370 align:middle line:84%
as dying in the old row and
being born into the new one.

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:47.280 align:middle line:84%
So in a puberty rite, boys and
girls die, and adults are born.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:50.080 align:middle line:84%
Now in cultures that have
shamanism and rites of passage,

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:54.180 align:middle line:84%
the shamanic calling is
considered to be superior.

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Now the reason for this is
that it's a divine calling,

00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:01.150 align:middle line:84%
whereas the rite of passage
is a social institution.

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has to go
through that when

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.750 align:middle line:90%
you're a member of the tribe.

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Now the next important
context in which

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.590 align:middle line:84%
these holotropic
states were induced

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:17.480 align:middle line:84%
were the ancient mysteries
of death and rebirth.

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:24.060 align:middle line:84%
It's people like Joseph Campbell
and Mircea Eliade have shown.

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:31.080 align:middle line:84%
Many cultures had powerful
mythologies describing somehow

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:39.120 align:middle line:84%
gods, demigods, heroes, who, in
one way or another, are killed,

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.889 align:middle line:84%
they die, or they
visit the underworld

00:34:41.889 --> 00:34:48.080 align:middle line:84%
and then they are returned
back to reality transformed.

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Now in all these
places that have

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:51.510 align:middle line:84%
these powerful
mythologies, there

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:54.620 align:middle line:84%
were institutions
in which initiates

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:58.630 align:middle line:84%
would be put through a powerful
mind altering procedure, again

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:00.680 align:middle line:90%
inducing holotropic states.

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:04.410 align:middle line:84%
In many of them, we don't know
the techniques that were used.

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:07.130 align:middle line:90%
In some of them we do.

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:13.790 align:middle line:84%
So you can think about the
mysteries of Inanna and Thomas,

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:16.370 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Sumer,
the oldest four,

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:19.010 align:middle line:84%
or the mysteries
of Isis and Osiris,

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:24.330 align:middle line:84%
the Dionysiac, the Bacchanalia,
the mysteries of Attis

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:26.350 align:middle line:84%
and Adonis and so
on, the mysteries

00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:31.780 align:middle line:84%
of Xolotl in Mesoamerica, the
Mayan mysteries of Xibalba.

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:35.700 align:middle line:84%
These were all based on
mythologies of deities

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:42.232 align:middle line:84%
or some legendary figures
that died and were reborn.

00:35:42.232 --> 00:35:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Now I will just mention
one form of mysteries

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:47.580 align:middle line:84%
which is particularly
interesting,

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:50.300 align:middle line:84%
and that is the
Eleusinian variety.

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:55.640 align:middle line:84%
There's a place called Eleusis
about 14 miles from Athens

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.610 align:middle line:84%
where these mysteries
were conducted

00:35:57.610 --> 00:36:04.030 align:middle line:84%
for a period of almost 2,000
years, from 1400 BC to 400 AD.

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And even then, people didn't
just lose interest in them,

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:12.210 align:middle line:84%
but they were forbidden
by a special edict

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:16.880 align:middle line:84%
of a Christian emperor who
stopped all pagan ceremonies.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise people would
have probably continued

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.260 align:middle line:90%
for a very long time.

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Now people came
initially from Athens.

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:28.870 align:middle line:84%
It was a local cult. Then
later, everybody who spoke Greek

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:29.890 align:middle line:90%
would come.

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And then at the time of Graecia
Magna, the whole empire,

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:37.810 align:middle line:84%
anybody from Graecia
Magna could participate.

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And the list of people
who were participants

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:43.560 align:middle line:84%
in these ancient
mysteries, reads

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.670 align:middle line:90%
like who's who in antiquity.

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:48.230 align:middle line:84%
This includes Plato
and Aristotle.

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Both of them wrote about this.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.260 align:middle line:84%
They were initiates,
they wrote about it.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Aristotle's term "catharsis"
comes from the mysteries.

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:02.570 align:middle line:84%
Alcibiades, the military
leader was an initiate.

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Pindaros the poet,
Euripides, Cicero, also

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Emperor Marcus Aurelius,
if you saw "The Gladiator,"

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:18.570 align:middle line:84%
those were all initiates
in these mysteries.

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:22.280 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, what were
they offering to these people

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.580 align:middle line:84%
that they would travel
these incredible distances.

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:26.190 align:middle line:90%
This was not like today.

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:33.260 align:middle line:84%
You take a jet and in an hour,
you are where you wanted to be.

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:35.980 align:middle line:84%
These were very dangerous,
very long journeys.

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:37.690 align:middle line:90%
So what were they offering?

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:39.780 align:middle line:84%
There's a very interesting
book by three people,

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:43.260 align:middle line:84%
by Albert Hoffman,
Gordon Wasson.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Albert Hoffman is the
discoverer of LSD.

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Gordon Wasson is the man
who brought the mushrooms

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:54.825 align:middle line:84%
from the Mazatec Indians to
Europe, gave them to Albert

00:37:54.825 --> 00:37:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Hoffman for identification
and synthesis.

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And then Carl Ruck,
a Greek scholar.

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:05.220 align:middle line:84%
They studied for several
years the material

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:07.490 align:middle line:90%
from Eleusinian mysteries.

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And they found out that the key
to these mysteries was a sacred

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:16.340 align:middle line:84%
potion, which was called
kykeon-- K-Y-K-E-O-N--

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:20.030 align:middle line:84%
that was given to the initiates
at the very critical time

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:22.500 align:middle line:90%
of this initiation.

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And after a lot of studies
and actually experimentation,

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:30.580 align:middle line:84%
they found out that this was an
ergot derivative, very similar,

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:32.250 align:middle line:90%
close to LSD.

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:38.060 align:middle line:84%
So these people are offered
psychedelic experiences.

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Now when Christina and I visited
Eleusis about five years ago,

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:48.420 align:middle line:84%
we saw the Telesterion, which
is larger than this hall.

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:51.840 align:middle line:84%
The ruins you can
still see today.

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And so I was interested
how many people were

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:56.290 align:middle line:90%
having these experiences there.

00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:58.240 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I found?

00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:01.168 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to guess how
many people were having

00:39:01.168 --> 00:39:02.376 align:middle line:90%
these experiences in Eleusis?

00:39:02.376 --> 00:39:05.410 align:middle line:90%


00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:12.730 align:middle line:84%
No, no, it was destroyed,
stopped in the 400 AD.

00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:15.130 align:middle line:90%
Over 3,000 people.

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Now this is an interesting
piece of Greek history.

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:22.329 align:middle line:84%
This should be mentioned when
you talk about Greek culture.

00:39:22.329 --> 00:39:24.405 align:middle line:90%
We talk about the Greeks.

00:39:24.405 --> 00:39:28.440 align:middle line:84%
We say they had very interesting
ideas, very talented people.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Now if like 3,000 people would
have psychedelic experiences

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:36.280 align:middle line:84%
every five years, and
it would include people

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.410 align:middle line:84%
like Plato and
Aristotle, I mean it

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:43.790 align:middle line:84%
would be an interesting
contribution to the culture.

00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So when I read
Plato today, I don't

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:47.990 align:middle line:84%
see him pacing in the
academy and say well

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:49.810 align:middle line:90%
let me see how the world works.

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:51.940 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have just
this level, you know?

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:56.490 align:middle line:84%
There's also this other level,
or these archetypes and so on.

00:39:56.490 --> 00:39:58.420 align:middle line:84%
Those are obviously
direct experiences

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:01.470 align:middle line:84%
that you can have in
holotropic states.

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:06.320 align:middle line:84%
So just one last large context
in which holotropic experiences

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:12.090 align:middle line:84%
have played an important
role, and those

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:13.950 align:middle line:84%
are different
spiritual practices.

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:18.180 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it, those
are technologies of the sacred.

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Those are methodologies
for inducing

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:25.290 align:middle line:84%
holotropic experiences in which
you would either experience

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:28.450 align:middle line:84%
a radically different
perspective on this reality,

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:35.860 align:middle line:84%
or some alternative realities
normally invisible to us

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:40.420 align:middle line:84%
when we are in the usual
state of consciousness.

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:43.050 align:middle line:84%
So here would be the
different, yogas here

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:47.940 align:middle line:84%
would be the different
techniques of Buddhism,

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:51.500 align:middle line:84%
I already mentioned the
Taoist, the Sufi seekers,

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:58.490 align:middle line:84%
the Christian meditation, Jesus
prayer, Kabbalistic exercises

00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:00.880 align:middle line:90%
and all those things.

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:05.540 align:middle line:84%
So holotropic experiences
are an absolutely necessary

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:09.500 align:middle line:84%
prerequisite for any kind of
spiritual ritual practice.

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.910 align:middle line:84%
We would not have
religions today

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:14.810 align:middle line:84%
if it were not for these
holotropic experiences.

00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:16.900 align:middle line:84%
If you read the
ancient scriptures,

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:20.620 align:middle line:84%
they're full of descriptions of
these holotropic experiences.

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:23.970 align:middle line:84%
In the Old Testament,
you have Moses

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:27.900 align:middle line:84%
having the vision of Jehovah
in the burning bush, Abraham

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:30.880 align:middle line:90%
communicating with the angel.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:35.040 align:middle line:84%
You have Jesus having the
experience of temptation

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:39.400 align:middle line:84%
by the devil when he was in
the desert, St. John having

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:43.330 align:middle line:84%
the vision of the apocalypse
when he was meditating

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:47.240 align:middle line:84%
in his cave on the
island Patmos, Saul

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:51.390 align:middle line:84%
having the blinding vision of
Jesus on the way to Damascus.

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Those are all visionary
holotropic experiences.

00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:59.090 align:middle line:84%
In the PolyCon, and you have
the history of the Buddha,

00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:01.390 align:middle line:84%
six years of ascetic
practice, then the

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:03.130 align:middle line:84%
experiences under
the Bodhi tree,

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:07.420 align:middle line:84%
the temptation by Kama-Mara,
the attack of Kama-Mara's army.

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen "The Little
Buddha," the movie?

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:12.400 align:middle line:84%
It was really beautifully
represented there.

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Then the experience
of enlightenment.

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.840 align:middle line:84%
Then later, the
experiences of past

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:20.330 align:middle line:84%
lives, and liberation
from karmic bonds.

00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:25.170 align:middle line:84%
In the Muslim
tradition, it was--

00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:27.100 align:middle line:84%
it was mystical
experiences of Mohammad

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:33.630 align:middle line:84%
that gave the inspiration
for Quran and for Islam.

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:39.130 align:middle line:84%
The Book of Mormon is based
on visionary experiences.

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Now the interesting thing
is that our psychiatry

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:48.680 align:middle line:84%
sees these experiences
as being psychotic,

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:52.700 align:middle line:84%
as being products of some yet
unknown pathological process

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:56.715 align:middle line:84%
that hits your brain and
creates these kinds of worlds.

00:42:56.715 --> 00:43:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Now this is not a very
inspiring interpretation.

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Our best, I wrote in the book
"The Cosmic Game," described

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:08.350 align:middle line:84%
the very comprehensive
vision, alternative vision

00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:11.560 align:middle line:84%
of who we are in the
reality that is revealed

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:13.610 align:middle line:90%
in these kinds of states.

00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:14.920 align:middle line:90%
And that people agree upon.

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:17.245 align:middle line:84%
They have consensus
when they have--

00:43:17.245 --> 00:43:19.970 align:middle line:84%
they experience different
pieces of this kind

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:23.055 align:middle line:90%
of a vision of reality.

00:43:23.055 --> 00:43:24.430 align:middle line:84%
They would agree
with each other.

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:27.720 align:middle line:84%
They would sort of communicate
about it and so on.

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Now our best model for the
brain now is the computer.

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:35.300 align:middle line:84%
So to believe that there could
be some pathological process

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.820 align:middle line:84%
that creates these
kinds of worlds

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:41.300 align:middle line:84%
would be like believing that
some-- you can experience

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:43.820 align:middle line:84%
some damage to
your IBM computer,

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:46.370 align:middle line:90%
and it switches to a Mac.

00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:51.389 align:middle line:84%
If something damages your
computer, all you get,

00:43:51.389 --> 00:43:53.680 align:middle line:84%
it's going to scramble the
program that you have there.

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:58.410 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to come up with
a comprehensive alternative

00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:00.550 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Now these are usually seen
as schizophrenic visions.

00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Schizophrenics are
cross culturally

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:10.600 align:middle line:90%
about 1% of the population.

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Now how come, if these ideas
and these kinds of visions

00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:16.990 align:middle line:84%
are a product of
schizophrenics, how

00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:21.990 align:middle line:84%
come millions upon millions
of otherwise normal people

00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:23.410 align:middle line:90%
would get so ignited by them?

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:25.170 align:middle line:84%
They would sort
of follow in them.

00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:28.550 align:middle line:84%
They would sacrifice their
lives and go into monasteries

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:33.410 align:middle line:84%
and ashrams, and they
would spend years studying

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:34.925 align:middle line:90%
these kinds of scripts.

00:44:34.925 --> 00:44:37.690 align:middle line:90%


00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:40.890 align:middle line:84%
So this is an unbelievably
arrogant approach

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:44.892 align:middle line:84%
to the spiritual and
ritual history of humanity.

00:44:44.892 --> 00:44:47.310 align:middle line:84%
It pathologizes
the spiritual life

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:50.310 align:middle line:84%
of humanity, and to the
extent to which spirituality

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:54.600 align:middle line:84%
and religion played an important
role in history in general.

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:59.600 align:middle line:84%
It means to pathologize
the entire human history,

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:04.380 align:middle line:84%
is the only healthy group is
the monastic materialistic elite

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:09.110 align:middle line:90%
of the Western science.

00:45:09.110 --> 00:45:12.370 align:middle line:84%
We have articles, we
have books describing

00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:14.330 align:middle line:84%
what would be the best
diagnosis for just about

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:19.490 align:middle line:84%
every founder of a religion,
every prophet, every saint.

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Ramakrishna has been
called schizophrenic.

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:26.210 align:middle line:84%
St. John of the cross,
hereditary degenerative.

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:28.420 align:middle line:84%
St. Teresa of Avila,
it wasn't clear

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:31.080 align:middle line:84%
whether she was a severe
hysterical psychotic

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:32.415 align:middle line:90%
or had temporal epilepsy.

00:45:32.415 --> 00:45:36.090 align:middle line:90%


00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:38.120 align:middle line:84%
There are discussions
about shamans,

00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:40.320 align:middle line:84%
what would be the best
diagnosis of shamans.

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:41.790 align:middle line:90%
Are they schizophrenics?

00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:44.070 align:middle line:90%
Are they ambulant psychotics?

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Are they severe
hysterics because they

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.330 align:middle line:90%
can be so theatrical?

00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Or are they epileptics
because they sometimes

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:54.730 align:middle line:84%
can have some
manifestations that

00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:56.950 align:middle line:90%
appear kind of seizure-like?

00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:59.750 align:middle line:84%
There's even a paper
by Franz Alexander, one

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:02.560 align:middle line:84%
of the founders of
psychosomatic medicine,

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:06.920 align:middle line:84%
very famous psychoanalyst,
which puts meditation

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:11.740 align:middle line:84%
into a pathological context
in case you meditate.

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:14.110 align:middle line:84%
The paper is called
"Buddhist Training

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:15.570 align:middle line:90%
as Artificial Catatonia."

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:18.510 align:middle line:90%
(LAUGHTER)

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:20.770 align:middle line:84%
There's a tremendous difference
between the worldview

00:46:20.770 --> 00:46:25.860 align:middle line:84%
of all pre-industrial cultures,
or ancient and native cultures,

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:28.880 align:middle line:84%
on the one hand, and the
Western industrial civilization.

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.740 align:middle line:90%
It is the official version.

00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:34.170 align:middle line:84%
There are obviously a lot of
people who don't share it,

00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:37.390 align:middle line:84%
and I think the
number is increasing.

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Now a very obvious difference
is we know much more

00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:44.560 align:middle line:84%
about the details of
the material world,

00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:46.580 align:middle line:84%
about the microworld,
the macroworld,

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:49.440 align:middle line:84%
and we can sort of use it to
apply it to technology and so

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:50.359 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:46:50.359 --> 00:46:52.150 align:middle line:84%
But this is something
that you would expect

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:56.270 align:middle line:84%
after 300 years of
experiments and sort

00:46:56.270 --> 00:47:00.490 align:middle line:84%
of sharing the information
through book print and so on.

00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:03.460 align:middle line:84%
But there's one difference
which is much more striking,

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:06.950 align:middle line:84%
and that's in regard to
the spiritual dimension.

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:10.580 align:middle line:84%
For all ancient and
pre-industrial cultures,

00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:12.290 align:middle line:90%
this was not the only reality.

00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:16.770 align:middle line:84%
There were also other
normally invisible dimensions

00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:21.170 align:middle line:84%
that were inhabited by
beings, by deities, by gods,

00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:24.960 align:middle line:84%
by discarnate entities, by
spirit guides, and so on.

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:28.810 align:middle line:90%


00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:32.870 align:middle line:84%
When we die, this was
not the end of existence.

00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:35.680 align:middle line:84%
The idea was there was something
like the posthumous journey

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:36.570 align:middle line:90%
of the soul.

00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:40.766 align:middle line:84%
That we're abouts of
the beyond, and so on.

00:47:40.766 --> 00:47:43.350 align:middle line:84%
In many cultures
independently, you

00:47:43.350 --> 00:47:46.180 align:middle line:90%
had the idea of reincarnation.

00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:49.110 align:middle line:84%
This is not the only
time we are here.

00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:50.560 align:middle line:90%
We have been here before.

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:52.101 align:middle line:84%
We're going to come
back, and there's

00:47:52.101 --> 00:47:57.460 align:middle line:84%
some kind of link, karmic link
between those incarnations.

00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:01.450 align:middle line:84%
Now there is a diametrically
different opinion on that.

00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:03.600 align:middle line:84%
All these
pre-industrial cultures

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:09.270 align:middle line:84%
agree that the world has
a spiritual dimension.

00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:12.590 align:middle line:84%
The official opinion of the
Western industrial civilization

00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:13.600 align:middle line:90%
is this is nonsense.

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.030 align:middle line:90%
These are fairy tales.

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:17.430 align:middle line:84%
These guys didn't
have decent science.

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:23.100 align:middle line:84%
They were into superstition,
primitive, magical thinking.

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Now if somebody from a strictly
psychiatric perspective,

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:31.000 align:middle line:84%
if somebody takes mysticism
and spirituality seriously,

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.680 align:middle line:84%
and they are intelligent,
you can't blame them,

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.810 align:middle line:84%
not knowing about
Western science,

00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:40.540 align:middle line:84%
then we have psychoanalysis that
tells us, if that's the case,

00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:42.360 align:middle line:84%
then you have a
hangup from childhood.

00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:45.790 align:middle line:84%
You're carrying around infantile
images of your parents.

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And you're projecting
it out there

00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:51.120 align:middle line:84%
and making gods and
goddesses out of them.

00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you have
direct experiences

00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:55.100 align:middle line:84%
of these other realities,
you get a diagnosis,

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:59.570 align:middle line:84%
you're put on tranquilizers,
and you're hospitalized.

00:48:59.570 --> 00:49:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Now the official opinion again
about the difference in the two

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.370 align:middle line:84%
perspectives is that it
reflects the superiority

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:09.595 align:middle line:90%
of Western science.

00:49:09.595 --> 00:49:12.170 align:middle line:90%


00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Now the kind of
conclusion I've come to,

00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:16.920 align:middle line:84%
and I think many
of my colleagues

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:19.270 align:middle line:84%
who are doing
consciousness research

00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:21.080 align:middle line:84%
and had some
personal experiences

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:25.440 align:middle line:84%
of these holotropic states,
is that the explanation

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:28.470 align:middle line:84%
is somewhat
different, and that is

00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:31.200 align:middle line:84%
that this difference
reflects naivete

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.950 align:middle line:84%
of the Western industrial
civilization in relation

00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:36.070 align:middle line:90%
to the holotropic states.

00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:38.120 align:middle line:84%
What these other
cultures had that we

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:45.070 align:middle line:84%
don't have were systematic, was
systematic use of technologies

00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:48.580 align:middle line:84%
of using these experiences,
and during their lifetimes,

00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:52.920 align:middle line:84%
they had repeated opportunities
to have those experiences.

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
those experiences,

00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:58.640 align:middle line:84%
you have to include them
into your worldview.

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:00.710 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with
hundreds of people

00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:03.000 align:middle line:84%
in the Western
civilization, in Europe

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and here, who had all
the best education

00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:10.090 align:middle line:84%
you can imagine--
university studies, IQ,

00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:12.380 align:middle line:90%
trained in various disciplines.

00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:15.780 align:middle line:84%
When they had the opportunity
to have these experiences,

00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:19.080 align:middle line:84%
they would not subscribe anymore
to what Fritjof Capra called

00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:24.180 align:middle line:84%
the Cartesian-Newtonian monastic
materialistic worldview.

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:29.440 align:middle line:84%
They would discover that we have
lost some profound wisdom, that

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:33.540 align:middle line:84%
was there before that
is not here anymore.

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And they would move
in the direction

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:39.420 align:middle line:84%
of the great spiritual
philosophies of the East.

00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:42.970 align:middle line:84%
Many of them would even
embrace the cosmologies

00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:45.940 align:middle line:90%
of some of the native cultures.

00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:50.160 align:middle line:84%
I have seen people who have the
best anthropological training

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.570 align:middle line:84%
at Harvard and
Stanford, and after they

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:54.680 align:middle line:84%
had these experiences,
they would end up

00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:59.072 align:middle line:84%
as apprentices of a shaman
of an illiterate culture,

00:50:59.072 --> 00:51:01.280 align:middle line:84%
because they realize they
can learn there's something

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:04.120 align:middle line:84%
that their training,
the Western training,

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:08.242 align:middle line:90%
couldn't possibly provide.

00:51:08.242 --> 00:51:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Many of you probably
know Michael Harner.

00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:15.370 align:middle line:84%
He's an anthropologist
in sort of good standing,

00:51:15.370 --> 00:51:18.760 align:middle line:84%
academic standing,
taught here in the New

00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:20.810 align:middle line:90%
School for Social Research.

00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:23.960 align:middle line:84%
He's now in California where
at least all these people

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:25.220 align:middle line:90%
seem to be flocking now.

00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:28.410 align:middle line:90%


00:51:28.410 --> 00:51:32.060 align:middle line:84%
He is a trained anthropologist
who also experienced

00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:35.410 align:middle line:84%
shamanic initiation
when he was doing

00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:38.230 align:middle line:90%
field research in the Amazon.

00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote a book called
"The Way of the Shaman."

00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:43.857 align:middle line:84%
And in the preface
of this book, he

00:51:43.857 --> 00:51:45.190 align:middle line:90%
says something very interesting.

00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:47.370 align:middle line:84%
He says that from
his dual prospective,

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:51.160 align:middle line:84%
as a Western trained
academician, and also somebody

00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:54.700 align:middle line:84%
who experienced personally
shamanic initiation,

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:58.250 align:middle line:84%
that Western psychology and
psychiatry is seriously biased

00:51:58.250 --> 00:52:00.750 align:middle line:90%
in at least two important ways.

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:05.510 align:middle line:84%
It is ethnocentric and
it is cognicentric.

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:07.180 align:middle line:90%
And I will explain it.

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:09.046 align:middle line:84%
Now, everybody
understand ethnocentric?

00:52:09.046 --> 00:52:14.600 align:middle line:84%
It means Western
psychiatry and psychology

00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:19.790 align:middle line:84%
has a certain perspective on
the psyche in health and disease

00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:22.540 align:middle line:84%
that was developed by a
small group of people,

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:25.700 align:middle line:84%
by, again, the monastic
materialistic group

00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:29.480 align:middle line:84%
of scientists in the
industrial civilization.

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:32.120 align:middle line:84%
Now this group considers
its own perspective

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:35.910 align:middle line:84%
to be absolutely superior
to any perspective

00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:39.390 align:middle line:90%
that anybody had ever anywhere.

00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:41.660 align:middle line:84%
So anything that in
ritual spiritual life

00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:45.220 align:middle line:84%
of other cultures doesn't make
sense to a Freudian analyst

00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:49.830 align:middle line:84%
or to behaviors would be
called primitive, magical,

00:52:49.830 --> 00:52:53.550 align:middle line:84%
superstitial, borderline
kind of stuff.

00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:57.300 align:middle line:90%


00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:01.440 align:middle line:84%
If you would take a Western
trained psychiatrist who

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:05.920 align:middle line:84%
buys that trip, or an
anthropologist to India,

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:09.060 align:middle line:84%
and show them what the yogis
and the sadhus are doing there,

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:11.970 align:middle line:90%
they would get a diagnosis.

00:53:11.970 --> 00:53:17.390 align:middle line:84%
At least ambulatory,
psychotic, if not more.

00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:22.210 align:middle line:84%
The same with shamans,
I already mentioned it.

00:53:22.210 --> 00:53:24.030 align:middle line:84%
But because it's
ethnocentric, it also

00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:25.980 align:middle line:90%
works the other way around.

00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:30.040 align:middle line:84%
If you would take a shaman
from central Mexico, which

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.690 align:middle line:84%
we have done, and
take that person who

00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:35.030 align:middle line:84%
comes from a culture
that has any sense

00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:39.530 align:middle line:84%
of our biological nature, any
sense for cycles in nature,

00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:41.870 align:middle line:84%
cycles in the cosmos,
would take them

00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:45.405 align:middle line:84%
to a place like Los
Angeles, and I'm not just

00:53:45.405 --> 00:53:48.030 align:middle line:84%
talking about the time when they
were burning their own houses,

00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:53.010 align:middle line:84%
but just an ordinary day
in Los Angeles, a person

00:53:53.010 --> 00:53:55.760 align:middle line:84%
from that kind of culture would
think that we have completely

00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:56.390 align:middle line:90%
lost it.

00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:58.620 align:middle line:84%
We don't know where
the priorities are.

00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:00.130 align:middle line:90%
We are biological creatures.

00:54:00.130 --> 00:54:01.880 align:middle line:90%
We depend on the earth.

00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:02.895 align:middle line:90%
We depend on water.

00:54:02.895 --> 00:54:05.430 align:middle line:90%
We depend critically on air.

00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:07.540 align:middle line:90%
We have contaminated it all.

00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:10.930 align:middle line:84%
We have spoiled
the earth, spoiled

00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:16.690 align:middle line:90%
the water, spoiled the air.

00:54:16.690 --> 00:54:18.680 align:middle line:84%
In Los Angeles and
other places, we've

00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:24.840 align:middle line:84%
covered every square yard with
asphalt, with cement, and so

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:29.780 align:middle line:84%
on, going to more
money, power, status,

00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:33.500 align:middle line:84%
tripling, quadrupling the gross
national product, absolutely

00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:40.690 align:middle line:84%
linear kind of an
orientation, kind

00:54:40.690 --> 00:54:46.230 align:middle line:84%
of squandering
nonrenewable resources

00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:50.622 align:middle line:90%
and turning them into pollution.

00:54:50.622 --> 00:54:52.580 align:middle line:84%
So somebody who comes
from that kind of culture

00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:54.620 align:middle line:84%
will thing that we have
completely lost it.

00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:55.900 align:middle line:90%
We are crazy.

00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:58.530 align:middle line:90%
We are insane.

00:54:58.530 --> 00:55:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Now the second thing
that Michael says,

00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:10.380 align:middle line:84%
psychiatry and psychology
is also cognicentric.

00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Now cognicentric,
probably a better term

00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:18.810 align:middle line:84%
would be pragnocentric, means
that we have built our theories

00:55:18.810 --> 00:55:22.550 align:middle line:84%
in psychology and psychiatry
exclusively on evidence

00:55:22.550 --> 00:55:26.270 align:middle line:84%
that comes from observations
done in the hilotropic state,

00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:28.920 align:middle line:84%
in the ordinary state
of consciousness.

00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:32.860 align:middle line:84%
Now the exception is
dreams, if the dreams don't

00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:35.150 align:middle line:84%
repeat themselves
and if they are not

00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:36.970 align:middle line:90%
associated with anxiety.

00:55:36.970 --> 00:55:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And even dreams
are pathological.

00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:41.740 align:middle line:84%
But you can have just
the ordinary variety

00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:43.830 align:middle line:90%
and get away with it.

00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:47.310 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about it,
we have an enormous amount

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:51.640 align:middle line:84%
of evidence that we have
amassed in different avenues

00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.270 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness research.

00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not just talk about
the psychedelic research, which

00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:00.490 align:middle line:84%
certainly has produced an
enormous amount of evidence

00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:03.290 align:middle line:84%
published in scientific
articles and books.

00:56:03.290 --> 00:56:09.910 align:middle line:84%
But look at the studies in
parapsychology, well documented

00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:13.280 align:middle line:84%
methodologically sound,
statistically sound,

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:16.970 align:middle line:90%
that have been discarded.

00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:19.860 align:middle line:84%
What's happening today in
powerful experiential forms

00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:21.080 align:middle line:90%
of psychotherapy?

00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.890 align:middle line:84%
People experiencing,
reliving their birth,

00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:27.300 align:middle line:84%
experiencing prenatal
experiences, having past life

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:28.090 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:34.350 align:middle line:84%
None of that has been taken into
consideration by our psychiatry

00:56:34.350 --> 00:56:34.980 align:middle line:90%
and psychology.

00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:40.140 align:middle line:84%
We still use a model which is
limited to postnatal biography

00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:42.630 align:middle line:90%
and the individual unconscious.

00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:45.890 align:middle line:90%


00:56:45.890 --> 00:56:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Something that's astonishing
is how the evidence

00:56:50.550 --> 00:56:52.030 align:middle line:90%
from thanatology is ignored.

00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:56.260 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned last night the
work of thanatologists, showing

00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:59.320 align:middle line:84%
that disembodied
consciousness maintains,

00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:02.170 align:middle line:84%
in a near death situation,
maintains the capacity

00:57:02.170 --> 00:57:07.860 align:middle line:84%
to perceive the environment,
the immediate environment--

00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:10.130 align:middle line:84%
rooms behind the walls
or something that's

00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:13.500 align:middle line:90%
happening in remote locations.

00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Blind people are capable of
seeing when their consciousness

00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:18.330 align:middle line:90%
leaves the body.

00:57:18.330 --> 00:57:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And those are major,
major paradigm

00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:23.940 align:middle line:90%
challenging observations.

00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you think how little
the physicists needed

00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:29.620 align:middle line:84%
in the first three
decades of the century

00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:34.070 align:middle line:84%
to change somehow radically
the image of physics,

00:57:34.070 --> 00:57:36.510 align:middle line:84%
we have an enormous
amount of evidence

00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:38.290 align:middle line:90%
from all these different areas.

00:57:38.290 --> 00:57:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And it has been ignored,
as far as these near death

00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:45.450 align:middle line:90%
experiences are concerned.

00:57:45.450 --> 00:57:47.080 align:middle line:90%
People in the street know that.

00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:50.390 align:middle line:84%
We have talk shows
where thanatologists

00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:53.350 align:middle line:84%
are talking about their
experiences, people

00:57:53.350 --> 00:57:56.820 align:middle line:84%
who had these experiences
talk about them.

00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Some of the books
describing them

00:57:58.630 --> 00:58:01.900 align:middle line:84%
made the New York
Best Seller List.

00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:05.760 align:middle line:84%
A number of Hollywood
movies portray these kind

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:09.710 align:middle line:84%
of out-of-body experiences
with maintaining perception,

00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:10.930 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:58:10.930 --> 00:58:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And the academic circles have
not responded to it at all.

00:58:14.810 --> 00:58:17.830 align:middle line:90%


00:58:17.830 --> 00:58:22.170 align:middle line:84%
John Mack who talked yesterday
was working with a group,

00:58:22.170 --> 00:58:24.190 align:middle line:90%
studying anomalous experiences.

00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:27.740 align:middle line:84%
This is just one of
many, these thanatologic.

00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:31.280 align:middle line:84%
We really have a major,
major challenging evidence

00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:32.790 align:middle line:90%
that has been ignored.

00:58:32.790 --> 00:58:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is with Michael
calls cognicentric bias.

00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:41.900 align:middle line:84%
We have simply a censored
out, vast amount of evidence

00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:46.070 align:middle line:84%
coming from these
holotropic states.

00:58:46.070 --> 00:58:48.860 align:middle line:84%
So the question
now would be, what

00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:54.030 align:middle line:84%
would be psychology
and psychiatry,

00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:59.470 align:middle line:84%
if it were not ethnocentric, if
it were culturally sensitive,

00:58:59.470 --> 00:59:02.430 align:middle line:84%
if it treated with
respect the ritual

00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual life
of other cultures?

00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And what psychiatry
and psychology

00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:13.190 align:middle line:84%
would look like if it
were not cognicentric,

00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:17.190 align:middle line:84%
if it would really open itself
to the overwhelming evidence

00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:21.250 align:middle line:84%
that's coming from modern
consciousness research?

00:59:21.250 --> 00:59:23.210 align:middle line:84%
So I can think
about at least five

00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:27.090 align:middle line:84%
or six areas in which we
would absolutely radically

00:59:27.090 --> 00:59:29.840 align:middle line:90%
have to change our thinking.

00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:33.630 align:middle line:84%
Now you will understand
why this is not happening,

00:59:33.630 --> 00:59:37.910 align:middle line:84%
why the academic circles are
showing such resistance to this

00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:40.690 align:middle line:84%
evidence, because it cannot
be handled by a little what we

00:59:40.690 --> 00:59:44.300 align:middle line:84%
call ad hoc hypothesis, a
little patchwork here and there.

00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:46.140 align:middle line:90%
This is a major overhaul.

00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:49.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we would have to do
that what we have been teaching

00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:53.150 align:middle line:90%
is nonsense, is not true.

00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:55.160 align:middle line:84%
So the first of
these areas would

00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:57.960 align:middle line:84%
relate to something
very fundamental, which

00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:59.870 align:middle line:90%
is the nature of consciousness.

00:59:59.870 --> 01:00:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is seen
by the academic circles

01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:07.370 align:middle line:84%
as somehow mysteriously
emerging out

01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:10.510 align:middle line:84%
of the complexity of the
neurophysiological processes

01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:11.570 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

01:00:11.570 --> 01:00:13.510 align:middle line:84%
Now if you think
about it, the gap

01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:16.880 align:middle line:84%
between matter and
consciousness is so radical

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:20.710 align:middle line:84%
that it's very,
very hard to imagine

01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:25.870 align:middle line:84%
how that could be bridged, how
something that's dead, inert,

01:00:25.870 --> 01:00:32.430 align:middle line:84%
reactive would suddenly
become aware of itself

01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:39.110 align:middle line:84%
and be capable of developing
life and intelligence.

01:00:39.110 --> 01:00:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And these are
metaphysical assumptions

01:00:42.730 --> 01:00:48.980 align:middle line:84%
that are camouflaged
as scientific theories.

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:51.710 align:middle line:84%
There's absolutely
no evidence that I

01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:54.550 align:middle line:84%
know about showing
that consciousness

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:56.724 align:middle line:90%
is generated in the brain.

01:00:56.724 --> 01:01:00.540 align:middle line:84%
We have enormous
evidence showing

01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:03.860 align:middle line:84%
that there's a
correlation between things

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:07.550 align:middle line:84%
that are happening in the brain
and states of consciousness.

01:01:07.550 --> 01:01:09.370 align:middle line:84%
If we have a temporal
tumor, you can

01:01:09.370 --> 01:01:11.540 align:middle line:84%
have certain kinds of
changes in consciousness,

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:14.720 align:middle line:84%
different from when you
have a prefrontal tumor

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:17.830 align:middle line:90%
or a suboccipital tumor.

01:01:17.830 --> 01:01:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Somebody hits you over the head
or compresses your carotids,

01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:24.520 align:middle line:90%
you lose consciousness.

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:29.710 align:middle line:84%
You take LSD, your consciousness
changes, and so on.

01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Nobody is arguing this
is kind of evidence.

01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:35.440 align:middle line:90%
This is blatantly true.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:38.335 align:middle line:84%
But then there's a
logical jump which

01:01:38.335 --> 01:01:40.900 align:middle line:84%
is that because there is
this kind of connection,

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:42.845 align:middle line:84%
it means that
consciousness actually

01:01:42.845 --> 01:01:44.650 align:middle line:90%
is concocted in the brain.

01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:47.110 align:middle line:90%
And that's a whole other story.

01:01:47.110 --> 01:01:52.810 align:middle line:84%
We have the same connection
in the television set.

01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:55.970 align:middle line:84%
The quality of the
picture and of the sound

01:01:55.970 --> 01:02:00.820 align:middle line:84%
depends critically on
the component of the set.

01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:02.130 align:middle line:90%
Now what does it mean?

01:02:02.130 --> 01:02:04.530 align:middle line:84%
It means that there is
a critical connection

01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:06.730 align:middle line:84%
between the quality
of the program

01:02:06.730 --> 01:02:09.240 align:middle line:90%
and the functioning of the set.

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:12.600 align:middle line:84%
Where the program is coming
from is a whole other question.

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.210 align:middle line:84%
We would laugh at
somebody who would go down

01:02:15.210 --> 01:02:18.340 align:middle line:84%
to molecular level and
the different condensers

01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:22.840 align:middle line:84%
and the wires and believe that
if he or she can understand

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:24.460 align:middle line:84%
everything about
the box, they're

01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:26.670 align:middle line:84%
going to understand
why at 7 o'clock

01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Ed Sullivan showed up with
the Beatles on the thing.

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:33.190 align:middle line:84%
So obviously there
is an alternative way

01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:35.130 align:middle line:90%
off interpreting this data.

01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:36.590 align:middle line:90%
There is a connection.

01:02:36.590 --> 01:02:42.170 align:middle line:84%
But what it is showing may be
that the brain is necessary,

01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:44.460 align:middle line:84%
that it mediates on
our consciousness,

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:46.890 align:middle line:84%
but there is no
reason to see this

01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:51.210 align:middle line:84%
has an absolute scientific proof
that consciousness actually

01:02:51.210 --> 01:02:53.120 align:middle line:90%
comes from the brain.

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:54.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is the first
major radical change

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.160 align:middle line:90%
we would have to make.

01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness very likely is
not generated by the brain.

01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:05.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a universal phenomenon
in which we all participate

01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:08.710 align:middle line:90%
through our individual psyche.

01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned, we can
dissolve those boundaries

01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:15.230 align:middle line:84%
and we can experience larger
and larger parts of this field

01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:17.840 align:middle line:90%
of universal consciousness.

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Now the second major change
we would have to make

01:03:20.770 --> 01:03:24.980 align:middle line:84%
is in what I would call the
cartography of the psyche.

01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:28.500 align:middle line:84%
We have a model which is
limited to postnatal biography

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:31.425 align:middle line:84%
and to the individual
unconscious.

01:03:31.425 --> 01:03:34.120 align:middle line:90%


01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Freud said that a
newborn is a tabula rasa,

01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:41.850 align:middle line:84%
is a clean slate,
so there's nothing

01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:45.820 align:middle line:84%
of interest for psychologists
that precedes birth, including

01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:47.040 align:middle line:90%
birth itself.

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:51.370 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a fantastic
thing in current psychiatry.

01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:55.410 align:middle line:84%
We ask people about birth,
but the reason for it

01:03:55.410 --> 01:03:58.120 align:middle line:84%
is that if it was
really bad, it could

01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:00.350 align:middle line:90%
have damaged your brain cells.

01:04:00.350 --> 01:04:03.071 align:middle line:84%
As long as it didn't
irreversibly damage your brain

01:04:03.071 --> 01:04:04.320 align:middle line:90%
cells, it is not psychotrauma.

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:07.250 align:middle line:90%


01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:11.990 align:middle line:84%
So we have this concept that
the experience of birth, which

01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:16.660 align:middle line:84%
could be 20, 30, 40, 50 hours
of a life-threatening situation,

01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:20.730 align:middle line:90%
is not a psychotrauma.

01:04:20.730 --> 01:04:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Now on the other hand, there
is a very clearly general

01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:29.510 align:middle line:84%
agreement that immediately
afterwards, nuances of nursing

01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:33.750 align:middle line:84%
are all important, even
gynecologists or obstetricians

01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:37.170 align:middle line:84%
talk about bonding,
or pediatricians talk

01:04:37.170 --> 01:04:42.130 align:middle line:84%
about bonding, the importance
of the visual contact

01:04:42.130 --> 01:04:44.060 align:middle line:84%
between the mother
and the child.

01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:47.520 align:middle line:84%
The general agreement that
experiences in nursing

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.390 align:middle line:90%
can really shape personality.

01:04:49.390 --> 01:04:51.990 align:middle line:90%


01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Sullivan talks about the little
child, a little infant nursing,

01:04:57.130 --> 01:05:00.966 align:middle line:84%
distinguishing a good nipple,
evil nipple, and wrong nipple.

01:05:00.966 --> 01:05:03.040 align:middle line:84%
The good nipple is a
nipple that gives you milk,

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:05.200 align:middle line:84%
and the mother is a loving
mother that holds you

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.480 align:middle line:90%
the right way and so on.

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:09.320 align:middle line:84%
The evil nipple is nipple
that gives you milk,

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:12.660 align:middle line:84%
but the mother is
rejecting or unloving.

01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:14.770 align:middle line:90%
The milk is kind of sour.

01:05:14.770 --> 01:05:17.672 align:middle line:84%
And then the wrong nipple
is like your thumb.

01:05:17.672 --> 01:05:20.860 align:middle line:84%
You just suck it and it
doesn't even give you milk.

01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:26.427 align:middle line:84%
So the infant responds
to nuances of nursing.

01:05:26.427 --> 01:05:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Now with this kind
of thinking that we

01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:29.590 align:middle line:84%
have in current
psychiatry, you're

01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:33.080 align:middle line:84%
asked to believe that it's
possible to go through hours

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:38.430 align:middle line:84%
of a life-threatening situation
involving pain, choking,

01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:39.790 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

01:05:39.790 --> 01:05:42.010 align:middle line:84%
The child didn't notice
that something strange

01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:42.980 align:middle line:90%
was happening.

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:45.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not recorded anywhere.

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:48.670 align:middle line:84%
But instantly after
coming out to the breast,

01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:51.090 align:middle line:84%
the child becomes
this-- or the infant

01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:55.380 align:middle line:84%
becomes this connoisseur
of female nipples.

01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:57.180 align:middle line:90%
Things are not quite right.

01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Mommy's not holding
me the right way.

01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:03.900 align:middle line:84%
So obviously those are important
things in earliest, or nursing

01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:05.440 align:middle line:90%
is phenomenally important.

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:09.140 align:middle line:84%
But so is birth, and if you
have a holotropic state,

01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:11.390 align:middle line:84%
you'll find out that
the record is there

01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:14.850 align:middle line:84%
and that it's very,
very important.

01:06:14.850 --> 01:06:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Now the usual reason that
is given by births cannot be

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:21.930 align:middle line:84%
important is the cortex
is not myelinized,

01:06:21.930 --> 01:06:23.550 align:middle line:90%
the cortex is not finished.

01:06:23.550 --> 01:06:26.610 align:middle line:90%


01:06:26.610 --> 01:06:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Now Eric Kandel from Sweden
just got a Nobel Prize

01:06:32.350 --> 01:06:37.380 align:middle line:84%
for showing-- he was working
with a sea slug, Aplysia,

01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:40.510 align:middle line:90%
studying memory in the sea slug.

01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:46.170 align:middle line:84%
So we are denying that a
newborn can remember something

01:06:46.170 --> 01:06:51.230 align:middle line:84%
like 30 hours of delivery,
but a sea slug has memory.

01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:55.770 align:middle line:90%


01:06:55.770 --> 01:06:58.610 align:middle line:84%
So we have to have a
much larger cartography.

01:06:58.610 --> 01:07:01.280 align:middle line:84%
Certainly there is
the biographical level

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:04.120 align:middle line:84%
that is described
by psychoanalysis,

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.810 align:middle line:84%
but then there is
the perinatal level.

01:07:05.810 --> 01:07:08.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a very important
imprint of birth,

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:12.850 align:middle line:84%
and then there is also the
whole transpersonal level.

01:07:12.850 --> 01:07:16.960 align:middle line:84%
I described the experiences of
identifying with other people,

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.840 align:middle line:84%
experiencing group
consciousness,

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:24.470 align:middle line:84%
experiencing with experiences
of animal consciousness,

01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:26.230 align:middle line:90%
plant consciousness, and so on.

01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:28.610 align:middle line:84%
The third one would
be, if we have

01:07:28.610 --> 01:07:32.360 align:middle line:84%
emotional and psychosomatic
problems, according

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:39.240 align:middle line:84%
to traditional psychiatry, the
whole history is postnatal.

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:42.330 align:middle line:84%
In other words, things happen
to us in infancy, in childhood,

01:07:42.330 --> 01:07:43.570 align:middle line:90%
and later in life.

01:07:43.570 --> 01:07:46.620 align:middle line:84%
If something is not organic,
it can be fully explained

01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:48.600 align:middle line:90%
from postnatal history.

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:50.380 align:middle line:84%
If you work with
holotropic states,

01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:53.900 align:middle line:84%
you always find something
in biographical history.

01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:57.730 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, there
are additional deeper roots

01:07:57.730 --> 01:08:01.450 align:middle line:84%
that go to the perinatal
and even deeper

01:08:01.450 --> 01:08:02.930 align:middle line:90%
roots that are transpersonal.

01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:06.750 align:middle line:84%
For example, karmic,
for example, archetypal.

01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:10.120 align:middle line:84%
So behind emotional and
psychosomatic problems,

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:14.360 align:middle line:84%
there is a multi-level
sort of dynamic system

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:18.399 align:middle line:84%
that has to be confronted
in an effective therapy.

01:08:18.399 --> 01:08:22.029 align:middle line:90%


01:08:22.029 --> 01:08:28.390 align:middle line:84%
I will just mention
one important area when

01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:30.450 align:middle line:84%
we get new insights,
which has to do

01:08:30.450 --> 01:08:32.979 align:middle line:84%
with the strategy
of self exploration,

01:08:32.979 --> 01:08:35.450 align:middle line:90%
or the strategy of therapy.

01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:39.700 align:middle line:84%
We have many, many different
schools of psychotherapy.

01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:41.430 align:middle line:84%
Each of those schools
says something

01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:44.060 align:middle line:84%
very different about what
are the important forces

01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:46.640 align:middle line:84%
in the psyche, why
symptoms develop,

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:48.319 align:middle line:90%
what the symptoms mean.

01:08:48.319 --> 01:08:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And each of these schools will
give us a different technique

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:59.010 align:middle line:84%
that we use with clients to
quote, unquote, fix them.

01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's absolute lack
of unanimity about this.

01:09:02.650 --> 01:09:04.880 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a problem,
you can flip a coin,

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:06.970 align:middle line:84%
you choose a school,
which each school

01:09:06.970 --> 01:09:11.010 align:middle line:84%
you get a different story
about what's wrong with you,

01:09:11.010 --> 01:09:14.359 align:middle line:84%
and in each school you will
be offered a different method.

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:16.700 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is you can
understand the psyche

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:18.760 align:middle line:84%
with your head,
with your intellect.

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:22.580 align:middle line:84%
You can sort of come up with
some kind of a bag of tricks

01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:26.710 align:middle line:84%
that you can sort of
straighten out the situation.

01:09:26.710 --> 01:09:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Now this work with
holotropic states

01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:32.580 align:middle line:84%
shows a radically
different approach

01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:36.069 align:middle line:84%
to this, which is in
a holotropic state,

01:09:36.069 --> 01:09:42.410 align:middle line:84%
you immobilise your own
inner healing intelligence.

01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:44.350 align:middle line:84%
This is really something
that Jung was talking

01:09:44.350 --> 01:09:47.370 align:middle line:90%
about in different words.

01:09:47.370 --> 01:09:51.189 align:middle line:84%
For Jung, it was impossible
to use your intellect

01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:53.900 align:middle line:90%
to understand the psyche.

01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:55.400 align:middle line:84%
The reason for that
is the intellect

01:09:55.400 --> 01:10:00.680 align:middle line:84%
is just a tool that helps
us to orient ourselves

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:05.900 align:middle line:90%
in the practical situations.

01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:09.250 align:middle line:84%
The psyche in the Jungian
understanding is cosmic.

01:10:09.250 --> 01:10:10.990 align:middle line:90%
The psyche is anima mundi.

01:10:10.990 --> 01:10:14.020 align:middle line:84%
This is the consciousness
and the intelligence that

01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:15.890 align:middle line:90%
permeates all of existence.

01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And our individual
psyche is teased out

01:10:18.210 --> 01:10:20.570 align:middle line:90%
of this cosmic matrix.

01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned, in
transpersonal states,

01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:24.830 align:middle line:84%
we can expand our
consciousness and we

01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:30.650 align:middle line:84%
can experience larger and
larger pieces of this matrix.

01:10:30.650 --> 01:10:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So the intellect cannot
understand the psyche.

01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:36.990 align:middle line:84%
So for Jung, the alternative
was, what we can do,

01:10:36.990 --> 01:10:41.950 align:middle line:84%
we can create a sort of
a supportive environment.

01:10:41.950 --> 01:10:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And the Jungian model for
that is the hermetic vessel.

01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:48.930 align:middle line:84%
Jung was very interested in
alchemy, the hermetic vessel

01:10:48.930 --> 01:10:50.820 align:middle line:90%
where transformation happens.

01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:52.880 align:middle line:84%
So we create a
supportive framework.

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:58.860 align:middle line:84%
We give a method to the client
through which the conscious ego

01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:02.130 align:middle line:84%
can now communicate with a
higher aspect of the client

01:11:02.130 --> 01:11:05.650 align:middle line:84%
himself or herself, which
Jung called the Self, which

01:11:05.650 --> 01:11:10.810 align:middle line:84%
in English would be capital
S. And this exchange

01:11:10.810 --> 01:11:13.830 align:middle line:84%
is happening through
symbolic means.

01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And the healing is
guided from within,

01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:21.280 align:middle line:84%
through the client's
own higher intelligence.

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:26.600 align:middle line:84%
So it is what Jung called
the individuation process.

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:29.740 align:middle line:84%
So when we work with nonordinary
states, with holotropic states,

01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:31.350 align:middle line:90%
we are not the therapists.

01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:32.930 align:middle line:90%
We are not the fixers.

01:11:32.930 --> 01:11:34.830 align:middle line:90%
We are sort of co-adventurers.

01:11:34.830 --> 01:11:38.990 align:middle line:84%
We are people who are creating
supportive environment

01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:43.560 align:middle line:84%
and we support the process,
even if we don't intellectually

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:45.550 align:middle line:90%
understand it.

01:11:45.550 --> 01:11:47.930 align:middle line:84%
Now I see a very
different situation

01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:53.120 align:middle line:84%
than I remember from
the Freudian years,

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:57.090 align:middle line:84%
where the very typical situation
is that after years of therapy,

01:11:57.090 --> 01:12:00.020 align:middle line:84%
you can give lectures about
what's wrong with you.

01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:02.560 align:middle line:90%
But the problem is still there.

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Whereas in nonordinary
states, it's

01:12:05.210 --> 01:12:08.140 align:middle line:84%
much more common that
the problem disappears,

01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:10.290 align:middle line:84%
the symptom disappears,
but we don't quite

01:12:10.290 --> 01:12:15.130 align:middle line:84%
understand the past ways
to which it happened.

01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:17.110 align:middle line:90%
So I have run out of time.

01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:18.880 align:middle line:84%
So thank you very much
for your patience.

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:21.930 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:12:21.930 --> 01:13:07.300 align:middle line:90%
