00:00:23.218 --> 00:00:24.700 align:middle line:90%
>>Robert Anton Wilson.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:33.592 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.592 --> 00:00:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Robert Anton Wilson is
co-author with Robert Shea

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.090 align:middle line:84%
of the underground classic,
"The Illuminatus!" trilogy.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.040 align:middle line:84%
His other writings include
"Schrodinger's Cat"

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.670 align:middle line:84%
trilogy called "the most
scientific of all science

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.600 align:middle line:90%
fiction novels."

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.230 align:middle line:84%
His novel "Illuminatus!" was
adapted as a one-hour science

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.050 align:middle line:90%
fiction rock epic.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.970 align:middle line:90%
>>10-hour.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>>How many?

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.600 align:middle line:90%
>>10-hour.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.100 align:middle line:90%
>>10-hours.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.300 align:middle line:90%


00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.620 align:middle line:84%
Bob, who sees himself
as a futurist,

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.242 align:middle line:84%
author, and now,
a sit-down comic.

00:01:10.242 --> 00:01:13.620 align:middle line:90%


00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Bob regularly gives
seminars at Esalen

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.390 align:middle line:84%
and lectures at the Prophets
conferences around the world.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.180 align:middle line:84%
Let's give a big, warm welcome
to Robert Anton Wilson.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:38.800 align:middle line:90%


00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>>That was very nice.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.870 align:middle line:84%
If you kept on applauding
a little longer,

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.703 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have to think
of anything to say.

00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:47.100 align:middle line:90%
The time would get used up.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.367 align:middle line:84%
It's true I once
described myself

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:50.450 align:middle line:90%
as a guerrilla ontologist.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.020 align:middle line:90%


00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.110 align:middle line:90%
That was back in the '70s.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.560 align:middle line:84%
In the '80s, I decided guerrilla
ontologist kept getting

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.440 align:middle line:90%
me confused with King Kong.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.000 align:middle line:84%
So I started pronouncing it
as its original Spanish form,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.430 align:middle line:90%
"gureeya" ontologist.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knew what the
hell I was talking about.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Then I read two
books in which I was

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.840 align:middle line:90%
described as a postmodernist.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.870 align:middle line:84%
One was a sociological
textbook and the other

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.480 align:middle line:84%
was a book of
literary criticism.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.170 align:middle line:84%
I figured if a literary
critic and a sociologist

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.390 align:middle line:84%
can both consider
me a postmodernist,

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.660 align:middle line:84%
I might as well use
that as my label.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.890 align:middle line:84%
So I was calling
myself a postmodernist

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.362 align:middle line:84%
for a while, until I read some
of the other postmodernists

00:02:37.362 --> 00:02:42.770 align:middle line:84%
and decided I didn't want to
be associated with them at all.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.820 align:middle line:84%
So now I just call myself
a damned old crank,

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.960 align:middle line:84%
which I think covers the
situation much better

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.650 align:middle line:84%
than either of my
previous labels.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.160 align:middle line:84%
But if anybody wants to call
me a guerrilla ontologist,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.330 align:middle line:90%
that's OK.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.584 align:middle line:90%
[GRUNTING]

00:02:57.584 --> 00:02:59.410 align:middle line:90%


00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm supposed to be talking
about-- the title of my talk

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.380 align:middle line:84%
is "The Universe
Contains a Maybe."

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And to start with, I'll take
off of where Dr. Kaku left off

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.820 align:middle line:90%
yesterday, Schrodinger's cat.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'm here
and maybe I'm not.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Which is to say, in some
eigenstates, I got here safely.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.200 align:middle line:84%
In some eigenstates, the cab
carrying me here from the hotel

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.060 align:middle line:90%
crashed into a bread truck.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And I got killed, and
I didn't get here.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Why are you seeing me? 'Cause
you're in one of the universes

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.980 align:middle line:90%
where I did get here.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.520 align:middle line:84%
There's another universe
where you're all sitting here

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.860 align:middle line:84%
looking at an empty stage,
waiting to hear news

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.926 align:middle line:90%
about where the hell I am.

00:03:45.926 --> 00:03:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And I hope you would at least
have a slight pang of remorse

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.850 align:middle line:84%
when you heard about the bread
truck and my body scattered

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.676 align:middle line:84%
all over Amsterdam
Avenue and all of that.

00:03:56.676 --> 00:03:59.580 align:middle line:90%


00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.980 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Everett-Wheeler-Graham

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.200 align:middle line:84%
interpretation of the
Schrodinger's cat problem,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.650 align:middle line:84%
the cat's alive
in some universes

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.300 align:middle line:90%
and dead in other universes.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.930 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't just apply to a
cat with a complicated trap

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.839 align:middle line:90%
that Schrodinger invented.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:20.134 align:middle line:84%
Every time there's
a 0.5 probability,

00:04:20.134 --> 00:04:21.920 align:middle line:90%
the universe splits in two.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And we get more
and more universes.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.370 align:middle line:90%


00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.740 align:middle line:84%
You might be happy to
know, those of you who

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.520 align:middle line:84%
aren't really into
surrealism, that this only

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.200 align:middle line:90%
applies to possible universes.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.330 align:middle line:90%


00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.885 align:middle line:84%
But if it's a possible
universe, it exists somewhere

00:04:39.885 --> 00:04:43.230 align:middle line:90%
in hyper space.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.840 align:middle line:84%
There's a universe where
Marilyn Monroe actually

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.790 align:middle line:84%
succeeded in persuading
John Kennedy to divorce

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.890 align:middle line:90%
Jackie and marry her.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.740 align:middle line:90%
And she became First Lady.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.857 align:middle line:84%
I wish I had lived in
that universe instead

00:04:57.857 --> 00:05:00.610 align:middle line:90%
of the mess we're in now.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.380 align:middle line:84%
In that universe,
the whole world

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.790 align:middle line:84%
might have become
a lot more liberal.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And I could have got a
little bit of cocaine

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.934 align:middle line:84%
this morning to wake
me up before performing

00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:10.326 align:middle line:90%
at this ungodly hour.

00:05:10.326 --> 00:05:13.580 align:middle line:90%


00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.520 align:middle line:84%
As it is, I'm stuck
in a universe where

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.565 align:middle line:84%
a crackhead in the
White House could throw

00:05:18.565 --> 00:05:22.720 align:middle line:84%
all the poor crackheads in jail
and has hired somebody tougher

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.430 align:middle line:84%
than the previous czar
to carry that out.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.516 align:middle line:84%
Who the hell wants to live
in a universe like that?

00:05:29.516 --> 00:05:34.360 align:middle line:90%


00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.110 align:middle line:84%
Of course, that
may be just a libel

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.807 align:middle line:90%
spread by the Democratic party.

00:05:37.807 --> 00:05:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Maybe George isn't
a crackhead anymore.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.470 align:middle line:84%
There's a website
that sells buttons

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.542 align:middle line:84%
with a picture of George,
His Fraudulency George II.

00:05:47.542 --> 00:05:49.490 align:middle line:84%
They have a button
with a picture of him,

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.140 align:middle line:84%
and it says, "Not a
crackhead anymore."

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.350 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't that cheer you up?

00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:01.100 align:middle line:84%
That kind of cheers me
up, sort of, in a way.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.342 align:middle line:90%
I loved the last election.

00:06:03.342 --> 00:06:05.050 align:middle line:84%
It was the first time
in American history

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.860 align:middle line:84%
we had to choose between a
pothead who claimed he was not

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.870 align:middle line:84%
a pothead anymore and
a crackhead who claimed

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.480 align:middle line:90%
he was not a crackhead anymore.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And the public was so
damn confused that nobody

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.070 align:middle line:90%
knows who won the election.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.735 align:middle line:90%


00:06:19.735 --> 00:06:23.140 align:middle line:84%
As Mr. Justice Stevens
said, "We will never

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.320 align:middle line:84%
know with certainty who
won this year's election.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.690 align:middle line:90%
But we do know the loser.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.610 align:middle line:84%
The loser is the
public's confidence

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.760 align:middle line:90%
in the integrity of our judges."

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.290 align:middle line:84%
That's not a very
funny line, is it?

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, stop and think about
it for a while though.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:45.570 align:middle line:84%
John Adams, our second
president, wrote in a letter

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.950 align:middle line:84%
to Thomas Jefferson, who
you may have heard of,

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.740 align:middle line:90%
he was our third president.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Adams wrote to Jefferson,
"I cannot consider political

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.310 align:middle line:84%
history seriously without
either weeping or laughing.

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.140 align:middle line:90%
I prefer to laugh."

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.930 align:middle line:90%
And that's the way I look at it.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.680 align:middle line:84%
If we got a crackhead in
the White House, well,

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.170 align:middle line:90%
I think that's pretty funny.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:06.800 align:middle line:84%
That's the next
best thing to having

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.464 align:middle line:90%
Harpo Marx in the White House.

00:07:08.464 --> 00:07:16.060 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.783 align:middle line:90%
As for getting back to maybe.

00:07:17.783 --> 00:07:20.310 align:middle line:90%


00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.580 align:middle line:84%
I think I had a few
more anti-Bush jokes,

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.210 align:middle line:84%
but they just
slipped from my mind.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.740 align:middle line:84%
At this hour in the
morning, my memory

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.530 align:middle line:84%
is not functioning
as well as my tongue.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.700 align:middle line:84%
I can talk, but I can't think
about what I'm talking about.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.960 align:middle line:90%
But oh well.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.985 align:middle line:84%
I think I've had that
problem for years.

00:07:35.985 --> 00:07:39.630 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.490 align:middle line:84%
I have found a way to get
high and stay spaced out

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.630 align:middle line:84%
for hours on end,
and the government

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.970 align:middle line:90%
can't take it away from me.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:48.933 align:middle line:90%
It's called senility.

00:07:48.933 --> 00:07:53.190 align:middle line:90%


00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:57.950 align:middle line:90%
And there are four major traits.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.620 align:middle line:90%
Increase in long-term memory.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.690 align:middle line:84%
I can wheel myself to the
kitchen when I'm home.

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And on the way, I can remember
a fistfight I had with a kid

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:11.540 align:middle line:84%
named Billy Batson in
kindergarten, 65 years ago.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And I can even remember
my life in the womb.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And I can remember
back to when I

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.730 align:middle line:84%
was swinging through the
trees with the other apes.

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.750 align:middle line:84%
I can remember back
to being a fish.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:26.190 align:middle line:84%
All evolution opens up before
me in an endlessly retreating

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:29.640 align:middle line:90%
abyss of timeless time.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
get to the kitchen,

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.584 align:middle line:84%
the second effect takes over, a
decrease in short-term memory.

00:08:34.584 --> 00:08:38.350 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember what I
went to the kitchen for.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:39.850 align:middle line:90%
I look around, what the hell?

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:42.858 align:middle line:84%
What am I doing
in this room now?

00:08:42.858 --> 00:08:45.080 align:middle line:90%
I thought I was at the computer.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.900 align:middle line:90%
And the third effect.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.370 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember what
the third effect is.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:57.690 align:middle line:90%


00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth is I don't
give a fuck anymore.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:11.560 align:middle line:90%


00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.000 align:middle line:90%
The Chinese have a proverb.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.560 align:middle line:84%
I got a friend who just got
his PhD in Chinese language

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.306 align:middle line:90%
and literature.

00:09:19.306 --> 00:09:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And I quoted this
proverb to him.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And he said he
heard it many times,

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.370 align:middle line:84%
but he didn't know where it
came from or who invented it.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.770 align:middle line:84%
He's got a Chinese
wife, raised in Taiwan.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:29.780 align:middle line:90%
And she's heard it too.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.090 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't know
who invented it.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:33.970 align:middle line:90%
So I guess it's a folk proverb.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.870 align:middle line:90%
There's no known author.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:39.210 align:middle line:84%
It says, "The wise are
Confucian in good times,

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Buddhist in bad times,
and Taoist in old age."

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:47.030 align:middle line:10%
Now the Confucians try
to improve society.

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:48.550 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhists say,
that's hopeless.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.080 align:middle line:90%
Just try to improve yourself.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And the Taoists say,
I don't give a fuck.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.800 align:middle line:10%
So you see, between
senility and Taoism,

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.500 align:middle line:10%
I have arrived at a
remarkable tranquility.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.760 align:middle line:10%
Every time Bush
finds a new excuse

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.005 align:middle line:10%
to bomb someplace, instead
of weeping, I laugh.

00:10:04.005 --> 00:10:07.100 align:middle line:10%
Oh well, what can you
expect of a species

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.170 align:middle line:10%
of domesticated primates but
except the alpha males will

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:14.130 align:middle line:10%
be the ugliest and meanest
ones in the whole damn tribe?

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.360 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the
evolutionary script, I think.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:20.951 align:middle line:90%


00:10:20.951 --> 00:10:21.450 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.990 align:middle line:90%


00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I would like to argue,
or propose, or cogitate,

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.105 align:middle line:84%
or ruminate, or
blabber to the effect

00:10:35.105 --> 00:10:39.290 align:middle line:84%
that if everybody used the
word "maybe" more often,

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:41.600 align:middle line:84%
the whole human race might
suddenly become stark,

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.410 align:middle line:90%
staring sane.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.030 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine if
every time you turn

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.200 align:middle line:84%
to the high channels
on your TV set,

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.225 align:middle line:84%
you'd catch Pat Robertson,
or Jerry Falwell,

00:10:53.225 --> 00:10:59.150 align:middle line:84%
or one of those weird people
proclaiming, I tell you,

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:02.325 align:middle line:84%
brethren, maybe Jesus
was the Son of God.

00:11:02.325 --> 00:11:05.310 align:middle line:90%


00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if you travel through
the Mid-East and every muezzin

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:13.220 align:middle line:84%
was howling from the parapets,
maybe Allah is the only god,

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and maybe Muhammad
is his prophet.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if the Israelis
were going around chanting,

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.770 align:middle line:84%
maybe God gave us
this land, and we

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.160 align:middle line:90%
can clean off the aborigines.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.790 align:middle line:90%


00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:29.980 align:middle line:84%
Imagine, as the
parapsychologists were saying,

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:33.360 align:middle line:84%
maybe this proves the
existence of psy powers.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And CSICOP was
going around saying,

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:39.880 align:middle line:84%
maybe their laboratory methods
were not strict enough.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.480 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if all the
communists that

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.270 align:middle line:84%
are left in the world,
all seven of them said,

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.350 align:middle line:84%
maybe we need a
violent revolution

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:48.286 align:middle line:90%
to overthrow capitalism.

00:11:48.286 --> 00:11:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if all the conservatives
are going around saying,

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.590 align:middle line:84%
maybe we got the best
economic system in the world

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:55.160 align:middle line:84%
even though most
of our population

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.695 align:middle line:84%
is living on the streets and
nobody gets adequate health

00:11:57.695 --> 00:11:58.380 align:middle line:90%
care.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.590 align:middle line:90%
But maybe it's the best.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Maybe humanity can't
do better than this

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.700 align:middle line:90%
because of original sin.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.159 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:12:04.159 --> 00:12:05.950 align:middle line:84%
If everybody was going
around saying maybe,

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:10.080 align:middle line:84%
think of how fewer violent
quarrels we'd have.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.140 align:middle line:84%
I've seen some pretty
violent quarrels

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:15.100 align:middle line:84%
between parapsychologists
and members of CSICOP

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.550 align:middle line:84%
because none of
them ever say maybe.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:20.325 align:middle line:84%
The parapsychologists
say, we have proven this.

00:12:20.325 --> 00:12:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And the CSICOPs say,
you haven't proven it.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.670 align:middle line:90%
And they got an out too.

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.340 align:middle line:84%
They got this
wonderful clause, which

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:32.290 align:middle line:84%
is, "An extraordinary claim
demands extraordinary proof."

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:35.029 align:middle line:84%
Now you could use that against
every argument you hear.

00:12:35.029 --> 00:12:36.570 align:middle line:84%
No matter what
anybody says, you say,

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:37.944 align:middle line:84%
that's an
extraordinary argument.

00:12:37.944 --> 00:12:40.190 align:middle line:90%
I demand extraordinary proof.

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:43.010 align:middle line:84%
What the fuck is
extraordinary proof?

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.980 align:middle line:84%
Why can't ordinary
proof handle the matter?

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.990 align:middle line:84%
But you keep asking for
extraordinary proof,

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:50.960 align:middle line:90%
nobody can ever produce it.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:55.600 align:middle line:84%
But "maybe" can be a
very powerful word,

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.050 align:middle line:84%
especially if you use some
of Korzybski's other devices

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:04.180 align:middle line:84%
to moderate overly dogmatic
Indo-European languages.

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:10.150 align:middle line:84%
For instance, John is
grouchy and irritable.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.920 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of sentence
you hear all the time.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:17.530 align:middle line:84%
Suppose somebody said, maybe
John is grouchy and irritable.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Then you might be
ready to accept

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:22.900 align:middle line:84%
the fact that John isn't grouchy
and irritable all the time.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.335 align:middle line:84%
Or if you used
Korzybski's dating

00:13:25.335 --> 00:13:30.060 align:middle line:84%
and-- has anybody here ever
hear of Korzybski, by the way?

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.310 align:middle line:90%
Hey, what a literate audience.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:34.460 align:middle line:84%
I think I saw 10 hands
out in the crowd.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:37.750 align:middle line:84%
Alfred Korzybski was
a Polish mathematician

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:41.330 align:middle line:84%
who proposed the two-valued
Aristotelian either-or

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.620 align:middle line:84%
logic does not fit the
universe we live in.

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we
should abandon it

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and use a more flexible
logic, which he

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.440 align:middle line:90%
called infinite-valued logic.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Now this is an outgrowth
on Neumann's maybe.

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Neumann and his book
on quantum mechanics

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:01.670 align:middle line:84%
handle the Schrodinger's
cat paradox

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:04.060 align:middle line:84%
by saying the cat can
be in three states--

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.500 align:middle line:84%
dead, which is 0;
alive, which is 1;

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.110 align:middle line:90%
and a half, which is maybe.

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.125 align:middle line:84%
And the cat is in the maybe
state until we open the door,

00:14:13.125 --> 00:14:16.830 align:middle line:90%
as Dr. Kaku explained yesterday.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And that makes a lot of sense
mathematically because until we

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.630 align:middle line:84%
open the door, the cat
is in a maybe state.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.586 align:middle line:84%
"In the math that's
in our head, the cat

00:14:24.586 --> 00:14:26.530 align:middle line:90%
is both alive and dead."

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Quoting my favorite poet--
that's myself, by the way.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:40.490 align:middle line:84%
That's from my novel,
"Schrodinger's Cat."

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:43.220 align:middle line:84%
"In every random
quantum state, the cat

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:47.320 align:middle line:84%
remains suspended state in
some quantum eigenstate.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.840 align:middle line:84%
In precisely half the
cases, that's 0.5,

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.030 align:middle line:90%
the cat is both dead and alive."

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:53.520 align:middle line:90%
No, I can't quote my own poetry.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.770 align:middle line:90%
It's too early in the morning.

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.295 align:middle line:84%
I keep losing the meter and
putting in the wrong words.

00:14:57.295 --> 00:15:01.650 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:03.010 align:middle line:90%
Suppose we met two people.

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And one said, John is
grouchy and irritable.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.955 align:middle line:84%
And the other said,
John is cheerful

00:15:06.955 --> 00:15:10.470 align:middle line:84%
and makes everybody
else cheerful too.

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:13.100 align:middle line:84%
That leads us into a state of
perpetual, which one of them

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.925 align:middle line:90%
is inaccurate?

00:15:14.925 --> 00:15:17.425 align:middle line:84%
Well, in our language, one of
them has got to be inaccurate.

00:15:17.425 --> 00:15:20.310 align:middle line:84%
Our traditional
Indo-European language

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:23.790 align:middle line:84%
has codified it to
Aristotelian logic.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.990 align:middle line:84%
But if we throw in a maybe and
date, and index our statement,

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:31.265 align:middle line:84%
we might come out with something
like, John seemed to me grouchy

00:15:31.265 --> 00:15:34.024 align:middle line:84%
and irritable at
the office all week.

00:15:34.024 --> 00:15:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And the other one
might be saying,

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.160 align:middle line:84%
John seemed very
cheerful and made

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.930 align:middle line:84%
everybody else cheerful at
the beach on the weekend.

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Now the statements don't
contradict each other at all

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:46.345 align:middle line:84%
because we've modified them
by adding more information

00:15:46.345 --> 00:15:50.220 align:middle line:84%
and dropping out the "is"
and putting in "seems to me."

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:54.579 align:middle line:84%
How many times have you
heard people arguing?

00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:56.745 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe you don't hang
out with the same circles

00:15:56.745 --> 00:15:58.600 align:middle line:90%
that I do.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.700 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's try it.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:00.760 align:middle line:84%
How many times have
you heard people

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.468 align:middle line:84%
arguing about whether
Beethoven is better

00:16:02.468 --> 00:16:07.060 align:middle line:84%
than Mozart or Mozart is
better than Beethoven?

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Or the Iron Butterfly is
better than the Sex Pistols.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:14.170 align:middle line:84%
No, the Sex Pistols are better
than the Iron Butterfly.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:16.320 align:middle line:84%
That gives you an idea how
much I know about rock.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Both of those examples come
from the '60s and '70s.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.505 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to
Mozart and Beethoven

00:16:21.505 --> 00:16:25.230 align:middle line:84%
where I know a little about
what I'm talking about.

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Now if we were to try to talk in
operational functional language

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.784 align:middle line:84%
like scientists do
about their instruments,

00:16:30.784 --> 00:16:32.200 align:middle line:84%
we have to include
the instrument.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.740 align:middle line:84%
The instrument is
my nervous system.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.370 align:middle line:84%
So before I can get to an
argument about whether Mozart

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:39.730 align:middle line:84%
is better than Beethoven
or Beethoven is better

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:41.480 align:middle line:84%
than Mozart, I'd have
to reformulate it

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:45.550 align:middle line:84%
into language that includes the
instrument and the observer.

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.930 align:middle line:84%
So I'd have to say,
in my present mixed

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:53.470 align:middle line:84%
state of musical
knowledge and ignorance,

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Beethoven seems better
to be than Mozart.

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:59.860 align:middle line:84%
That might even influence
the guy or the girl

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.590 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
of the argument

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:04.160 align:middle line:84%
to say, well, in my
present state of mixed

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.300 align:middle line:84%
musical ignorance and knowledge,
Mozart seems a hell of a lot

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.140 align:middle line:90%
better than Beethoven to me.

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:10.859 align:middle line:84%
What have we got
left to argue about?

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:13.339 align:middle line:84%
We're not arguing about
Mozart and Beethoven at all.

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:15.130 align:middle line:84%
We're arguing about
our own nervous systems

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:18.169 align:middle line:90%
and how they apprehend music.

00:17:18.169 --> 00:17:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And yet most of the
time, we get into these

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.290 align:middle line:84%
is arguments as if we're
talking about something

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:26.040 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't include ourselves.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.440 align:middle line:84%
There's an old Sufi story which
you will not disappoint me

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.700 align:middle line:90%
if you don't laugh at it.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Nobody ever does laugh at it,
but I still like to use it.

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Nasreddin, the wisest
man in all Islam,

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:40.662 align:middle line:84%
was seen racing through
the streets of Baghdad.

00:17:40.662 --> 00:17:42.120 align:middle line:84%
This was several
hundred years ago,

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.940 align:middle line:84%
so he wasn't trying to get
away from American bombers.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:50.170 align:middle line:84%
He's racing around on his
donkey through every palazzo,

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and alley, and street, and
every place he could race.

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And people came out, what
is Nasreddin looking for?

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:00.720 align:middle line:84%
So finally, they started running
out to him, going, Nasreddin,

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.420 align:middle line:90%
what are you looking for?

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And Nasreddin yelled back,
I'm looking for my donkey.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.050 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I got a laugh that time.

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:14.670 align:middle line:10%
The donkey represents what
we're all looking for,

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:17.840 align:middle line:10%
the answer to all of the
mysteries of the universe,

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.190 align:middle line:10%
the mysteries of emotional
life, the mysteries

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:22.280 align:middle line:10%
of intellectual life,
the mysteries of being

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.380 align:middle line:10%
a human being.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.370 align:middle line:90%
We look for it everywhere.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's carrying us around
all the time like the donkey

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:32.060 align:middle line:90%
that Nasreddin lost track of.

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.930 align:middle line:84%
In my workshops,
when I do a workshop,

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.320 align:middle line:84%
I usually have the
people describe the hall

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.487 align:middle line:90%
outside the workshop room.

00:18:39.487 --> 00:18:41.820 align:middle line:84%
I have everybody write out a
list of what they remember.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:45.100 align:middle line:84%
No two lists are alike,
which illustrates what

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.940 align:middle line:90%
I call neurological relativism.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:51.550 align:middle line:84%
No two people ever pass
through the same hallway.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:53.670 align:middle line:84%
Each one creates a different
hallway in their head

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:56.440 align:middle line:84%
which they think is
the real hallway.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Just like everybody
thinks Mozart is better

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.780 align:middle line:84%
than Beethoven or Beethoven
is better than Mozart.

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Except for the
wisenheimers who claim

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.080 align:middle line:84%
Wagner is better
than either of them.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.680 align:middle line:84%
But we can do without
them, can't we?

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.455 align:middle line:84%
Now if there's any Wagnerians in
the audience, I'm only kidding.

00:19:11.455 --> 00:19:11.955 align:middle line:90%
Honest.

00:19:11.955 --> 00:19:19.360 align:middle line:90%


00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.890 align:middle line:84%
The funny thing
about these lists,

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:24.700 align:middle line:84%
after we compare them, it turns
out the person with the longest

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.910 align:middle line:84%
list, it's always about
half as long as the list

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:30.880 align:middle line:84%
we get by putting all
the other lists together.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Which indicates the most
observant person, the Sherlock

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Holmes in the
group, observes half

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.790 align:middle line:84%
of what the whole audience
as a group observes.

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:42.050 align:middle line:84%
So you can always learn
something from everybody else

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:44.350 align:middle line:84%
no matter how dumb or
wrongheaded they seem.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:45.920 align:middle line:84%
If you listen to
them closely enough,

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.430 align:middle line:84%
they know something
you don't know.

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:51.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's worth
listening to everybody.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:57.660 align:middle line:84%
When I was a wee tot
back in the last ice age,

00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:00.710 align:middle line:84%
dinosaurs still
roamed the Earth.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:04.240 align:middle line:90%
Roosevelt was president.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:08.170 align:middle line:90%
It was rugged times.

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:12.890 align:middle line:84%
It cost a whole goddamn
dime to go to the movies.

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And all you got was an A
movie, a B movie, a travel log,

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:23.040 align:middle line:84%
a cartoon, a "Three Stooges"
comedy, and a news reel,

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.070 align:middle line:90%
and a candy bar.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:26.640 align:middle line:90%


00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And back in those days, nobody
but the extreme right-wing

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Republicans, the most
reactionary bastards

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:37.010 align:middle line:84%
in the country, said, once
they give you a Social Security

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:38.800 align:middle line:84%
number, they'll
keep track of you.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.200 align:middle line:90%
They'll know everything you do.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.630 align:middle line:90%
There will be no privacy left.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.140 align:middle line:90%
It'll be like Nazi Germany.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.460 align:middle line:90%
How can anybody be that crazy?

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:51.345 align:middle line:84%
We've had Social Security
numbers for over 60 years now.

00:20:51.345 --> 00:20:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And they're not keeping
track of everything you do.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:54.595 align:middle line:90%
They don't have everything.

00:20:54.595 --> 00:20:57.370 align:middle line:84%
You can cash a check without
putting your Social Security

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:58.050 align:middle line:90%
number on it.

00:20:58.050 --> 00:20:59.687 align:middle line:90%
Well, no, you can't.

00:20:59.687 --> 00:21:01.520 align:middle line:84%
You could order something
over the internet.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.430 align:middle line:84%
No, you gotta give them
your Social Security number.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.596 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, they do
know everything we're doing,

00:21:05.596 --> 00:21:06.500 align:middle line:90%
don't they?

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Besides, they've
got satellites now

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:10.620 align:middle line:84%
that can read the
headline on a newspaper

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.120 align:middle line:84%
if you open a newspaper
on the street.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.750 align:middle line:84%
They've got
heat-sensitive helicopters

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:18.800 align:middle line:84%
that can tell which room
of your house you're in.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.670 align:middle line:84%
So the right-wing
reactionaries who

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:23.390 align:middle line:84%
said that they'd be tracking
us through our Social Security

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:25.930 align:middle line:90%
numbers were right after all.

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:28.579 align:middle line:84%
So don't ignore anybody
just because their politics

00:21:28.579 --> 00:21:29.620 align:middle line:90%
are different than yours.

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.131 align:middle line:90%
They might have a point.

00:21:31.131 --> 00:21:31.630 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:37.820 align:middle line:90%


00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Nasreddin was hired once to
bring 10 donkeys to the market.

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.245 align:middle line:84%
So he got on one of
the donkeys and led

00:21:46.245 --> 00:21:48.720 align:middle line:84%
the other 9 ahead of him,
and started to the market.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And after about an
hour, he got worried

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:53.580 align:middle line:84%
that he might have lost
a donkey, so he counted.

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:56.180 align:middle line:90%
And there were only 9.

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.190 align:middle line:84%
So he got off to look
around for the other donkey.

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And he kept patting each donkey
as he walked around till he

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:04.170 align:middle line:90%
found all 10 of them again.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And he got on the donkey
and started riding again.

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And after another hour, he
got a bit worried again,

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:12.440 align:middle line:90%
so he started counting.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.790 align:middle line:90%
Only 9.

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:18.460 align:middle line:84%
So he got off his donkey and
walked around, feeling them

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:19.740 align:middle line:90%
by the sides, patting them.

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:22.110 align:middle line:90%
And there were 10 donkeys again.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:23.180 align:middle line:90%
So he got back on.

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:25.940 align:middle line:84%
This is the disappearing
donkey trick again

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.800 align:middle line:90%
in a different form.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And the next time he
found there were 9,

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:33.060 align:middle line:84%
he had to get off, and walk
around, and count them again

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:33.575 align:middle line:90%
on foot.

00:22:33.575 --> 00:22:35.060 align:middle line:90%
And there were 10 again.

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.850 align:middle line:84%
So around the middle
of the afternoon,

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:40.140 align:middle line:84%
he arrived at the market,
driving 9 donkeys behind him

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.490 align:middle line:84%
and carrying 1
donkey on his back.

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:47.180 align:middle line:84%
That always gets a bigger
laugh than the first one.

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I ask people to
describe the hall outside,

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:51.500 align:middle line:90%
they never include themselves.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:52.880 align:middle line:90%
They never include the observer.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:56.740 align:middle line:84%
That's another variation of
the disappearing donkey trick.

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:59.400 align:middle line:84%
The kind of science that
everybody at new age

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.730 align:middle line:84%
conferences rants
and raves against

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:06.030 align:middle line:84%
and denounces, so-called
Newtonian Descartian science.

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Hasn't been taken seriously by
scientists for over 100 years.

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:15.570 align:middle line:84%
With [INAUDIBLE] theorized
of quantum mechanics,

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:17.660 align:middle line:84%
science has become
aware, especially

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:21.820 align:middle line:84%
physics, has become aware
of what Buddhism has always

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:24.590 align:middle line:84%
told us, you can't
leave out the observer.

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Any separation between the
observer and the observed

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.770 align:middle line:90%
introduces tremendous fallacies.

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:31.830 align:middle line:84%
That's another reason
for putting in the maybe.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:33.980 align:middle line:84%
When you leave out
the maybe, you're

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.950 align:middle line:84%
assuming that your
nervous system,

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:38.990 align:middle line:84%
your brain, your
sensory apparatus

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:41.570 align:middle line:84%
is apprehending
the whole universe.

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:43.160 align:middle line:84%
Which is rather
an unlikely thing.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Do you think you can swallow the
whole universe in your stomach?

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Do you think you could inject
all the blood of the human race

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:52.170 align:middle line:84%
into your veins
without exploding?

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Do you really think your brain
can contain the whole universe?

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.090 align:middle line:84%
That's another reason
for putting a maybe

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:01.080 align:middle line:90%
on most of your statements.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:04.100 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody knows
things you don't know,

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.880 align:middle line:84%
and everything you think you
know is really only a maybe.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.395 align:middle line:84%
Now Korzybski in
1933 recommended

00:24:10.395 --> 00:24:14.220 align:middle line:90%
an infinite-valued logic.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:17.840 align:middle line:84%
I have found, in trying to
teach this to audiences,

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.530 align:middle line:84%
that people's
minds go blank when

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:22.110 align:middle line:90%
you say infinite-valued logic.

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:24.640 align:middle line:84%
So I reduced it to
a 10-valued logic.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.830 align:middle line:90%
That's much easier to deal with.

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:28.500 align:middle line:84%
You can extend it to
infinity if you've

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.740 align:middle line:84%
got enough decimal places
and enough instruments

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.715 align:middle line:84%
to make enough
delicate readings.

00:24:32.715 --> 00:24:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Everyday affairs, you can
reduce it to a 10-valued logic.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.490 align:middle line:90%
A 0 to 10.

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:40.355 align:middle line:84%
That's actually
an 11-valued logic

00:24:40.355 --> 00:24:42.565 align:middle line:84%
since I just
included the 0 in it.

00:24:42.565 --> 00:24:45.560 align:middle line:84%
The 0, you put in everything
you're absolutely sure

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:49.360 align:middle line:84%
has been totally refuted
and can't possibly be true.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Most of that will turn
out to be true later on.

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:54.275 align:middle line:84%
But what the hell,
we're talking about life

00:24:54.275 --> 00:24:56.320 align:middle line:84%
in time in which we
were not thinking

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:59.200 align:middle line:84%
about evolution and further
discoveries and so on.

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.040 align:middle line:84%
In 10, you put in everything
absolutely sure has been proven

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:06.130 align:middle line:84%
and can never be refuted,
like Newtonian gravity,

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:07.760 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Oh, no, that's been
refuted by Einstein.

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:10.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, the general
theory of relativity.

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:15.880 align:middle line:84%
No, Hawking is working
on revising that.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Well anyway, in between
the 0 and the 10,

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.846 align:middle line:84%
you've got 9 other
places-- 1 to 9.

00:25:21.846 --> 00:25:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And just imagine if people
had the philosophy of maybe.

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:29.310 align:middle line:84%
To take an example
it seems, I think,

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:35.960 align:middle line:84%
less emotional and
dogmatically key than most,

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.890 align:middle line:84%
one that people don't actually
attack each other with axes

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:42.490 align:middle line:90%
over-- the Loch Ness monster.

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:48.950 align:middle line:84%
Now under the present
Indo-European speaking peoples,

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:52.040 align:middle line:84%
due to the Indo-European
subject-predicate structure

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.380 align:middle line:84%
and the either-or logic
that derives from that,

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:58.330 align:middle line:84%
generally divide into people who
say I believe in the Loch Ness

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:02.160 align:middle line:84%
monster, and I don't believe
in the Loch Ness monster.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.270 align:middle line:84%
But in my 11-valued
logic, which I mistakenly

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:08.990 align:middle line:84%
called 10-valued logic because
maybe I'm not fully awake yet.

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:13.470 align:middle line:90%


00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Since we don't have
accurate scientific data,

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:19.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm using subjective
estimates of probabilities.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:23.010 align:middle line:84%
I would rate the Loch
Ness monster at about 6.

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Which is to say that I feel
enough people have seen

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.280 align:middle line:84%
something floating around
in Loch Ness over a period

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.380 align:middle line:90%
of a couple hundred years.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.255 align:middle line:84%
So there's probably
something floating around

00:26:31.255 --> 00:26:35.430 align:middle line:84%
in Loch Ness besides
ordinary fishy wishies

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:38.050 align:middle line:90%
and guppies and whatnot.

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:39.620 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not 100% sure.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.946 align:middle line:84%
And most people think if
you give up being 100% sure,

00:26:41.946 --> 00:26:44.100 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have a
definite yes and no, you're

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.580 align:middle line:84%
floating in an abyss
of uncertainties

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.060 align:middle line:90%
from which you'll never escape.

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:49.893 align:middle line:84%
But when you start
putting probabilities on,

00:26:49.893 --> 00:26:51.700 align:middle line:84%
you find a lot of
things have a 9.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:53.570 align:middle line:90%
You put them at least at 9.

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:56.525 align:middle line:84%
I feel I'd give a 9
rating to the probability

00:26:56.525 --> 00:27:02.690 align:middle line:84%
that the sun is going to seem
to rise tomorrow morning again.

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Of course, everybody knows
the sun doesn't really rise.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.080 align:middle line:90%
It's just the Earth rotating.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.160 align:middle line:84%
But we still have this
Neolithic language,

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.170 align:middle line:90%
so we talk about the sun rising.

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:12.320 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I mean.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.360 align:middle line:84%
I think there's over
a 9% probability

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.120 align:middle line:84%
that I expect that we'll
see the sun again tomorrow,

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.270 align:middle line:84%
whether we see it rising,
or whether we stop and think

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:22.450 align:middle line:90%
the sun isn't rising.

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:24.085 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is rotating,
or revolving,

00:27:24.085 --> 00:27:27.900 align:middle line:90%
or orbiting around the sun.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:31.030 align:middle line:84%
So some things have a
very high probability.

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Some thing's have a
very low probability.

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:37.830 align:middle line:84%
I was speaking to the Irish
Science Fiction Society

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:39.500 align:middle line:90%
a few years ago.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And in the question
period, somebody asked me,

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:44.325 align:middle line:90%
do you believe in UFOs?

00:27:44.325 --> 00:27:46.695 align:middle line:84%
And instead of going
into my maybe logic,

00:27:46.695 --> 00:27:49.864 align:middle line:84%
and 10-valued
logic, and so on, I

00:27:49.864 --> 00:27:51.530 align:middle line:84%
felt, that's a
straightforward question.

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:53.155 align:middle line:84%
I'll give him a
straightforward answer.

00:27:53.155 --> 00:27:54.730 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes, of course.

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So he went off into a
tirade to the effect

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:03.080 align:middle line:84%
that all UFOs were
sun dogs, which

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:07.210 align:middle line:84%
are heat inversions caused by
the mixture of water and oxygen

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:10.370 align:middle line:84%
in the atmosphere, which creates
strange glints in the air.

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:13.960 align:middle line:84%
When he finally ran down,
I said, well, we agree.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.989 align:middle line:84%
We both believe
in UFOs, only you

00:28:15.989 --> 00:28:18.405 align:middle line:84%
think you know what they are,
and I'm still a bit puzzled.

00:28:18.405 --> 00:28:21.385 align:middle line:90%


00:28:21.385 --> 00:28:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Which is very strange
because when most people talk

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:25.490 align:middle line:84%
about UFOs, they
either believe in them

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:27.440 align:middle line:90%
or they don't believe in them.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I don't see how anybody
could possibly deny them.

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:33.482 align:middle line:90%
What does UFO mean?

00:28:33.482 --> 00:28:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Most people have
forgotten what it means.

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:37.865 align:middle line:84%
It means Unidentified
Flying Objects.

00:28:37.865 --> 00:28:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, I see three UFOs every
week, at least, at minimum.

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:45.590 align:middle line:84%
I happen to have a very
nice balcony where I live,

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:47.000 align:middle line:90%
with a view of Monterey Bay.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.765 align:middle line:84%
And I love to sit out there when
I'm not working at my computer.

00:28:50.765 --> 00:28:53.260 align:middle line:84%
I love to sit out on the
balcony and look at the view.

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.520 align:middle line:84%
I've written more haiku
since I moved there

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.900 align:middle line:84%
than I have in my
whole life before.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's not because
my health care

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:02.400 align:middle line:90%
worker happens to be Japanese.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.090 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't even know
I'm writing haiku.

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:08.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm writing haiku because
they seem the appropriate form

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.770 align:middle line:84%
to describe the views you
see from three floors up,

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:11.850 align:middle line:90%
looking at Monterey Bay.

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:13.130 align:middle line:90%
The view keeps changing.

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:17.282 align:middle line:84%
It's never twice the same
from one hour to the next.

00:29:17.282 --> 00:29:20.060 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, I
could condense all my haiku

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:23.520 align:middle line:84%
into two words in
Greek-- rhei panta.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Which is probably the
wrong pronunciation,

00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:28.410 align:middle line:90%
but it's the right letters.

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:31.600 align:middle line:84%
That was said by
Heraclitus-- all things flow.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Not only does Monterey flow,
but whether the dolphins

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:38.100 align:middle line:84%
are there that day or not,
that changes over time.

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:39.900 align:middle line:84%
Whether I could see
Monterrey or not

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:43.660 align:middle line:84%
changes depending on how
much fog we've got that day.

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.400 align:middle line:84%
So the view keeps
changing, so I keep

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:49.070 align:middle line:84%
writing more haiku to express
my impressions of the changing

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:49.570 align:middle line:90%
views.

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:52.930 align:middle line:90%


00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And I see at least
three UFOs every week,

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.190 align:middle line:90%
especially around twilight.

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:01.380 align:middle line:84%
I see even more of them
after it gets dark.

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.370 align:middle line:84%
This does not
particularly impress me

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:06.720 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not quick to
identify things anyway.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:10.270 align:middle line:84%
I see at least seven
UNFOs every week.

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:13.950 align:middle line:84%
That's Unidentified
Non-Flying Objects.

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:15.810 align:middle line:84%
They go by on the
street so fast,

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:17.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
the hell they are.

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:20.530 align:middle line:90%


00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:24.420 align:middle line:84%
I saw a guy without arms
going by just a couple of days

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:26.850 align:middle line:90%
ago on a bicycle.

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:30.010 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe it
was a guy with arms,

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:34.130 align:middle line:84%
only he was holding them down
to test his ability to steer

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:35.405 align:middle line:90%
without using the handlebars.

00:30:35.405 --> 00:30:37.100 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not sure.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.790 align:middle line:84%
He's another unidentified
non-flying object.

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:42.850 align:middle line:84%
It was either a guy
without arms or a guy

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:45.060 align:middle line:84%
driving his bike
without using his arms.

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:48.260 align:middle line:84%
I see weirder things
than that though.

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:51.950 align:middle line:84%
I saw a seagull land on
the roof across from me

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:55.610 align:middle line:90%
with a silk top hat on.

00:30:55.610 --> 00:31:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And I just had my glasses
changed recently too.

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:03.300 align:middle line:84%
The world is full of
unidentified objects

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:04.360 align:middle line:90%
as far as I'm concerned.

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.915 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, my
own wife was frequently

00:31:06.915 --> 00:31:10.540 align:middle line:84%
an unidentified object
at 3:00 in the morning.

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:13.270 align:middle line:84%
When I get up to go to the
john at 3:00 in the morning,

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:16.890 align:middle line:84%
on my way back, I often
saw an unidentified object

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:21.496 align:middle line:84%
approaching me down the
hall with the lights out.

00:31:21.496 --> 00:31:23.120 align:middle line:84%
It was only when she
got within 3 feet,

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.980 align:middle line:84%
I would say, yeah,
that's my wife after all.

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:28.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not a burglar or
anything sinister like that.

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:31.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm surprised that people
identify so many objects

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:32.260 align:middle line:90%
so easily.

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.295 align:middle line:84%
The world consists mostly,
at least partially,

00:31:35.295 --> 00:31:37.115 align:middle line:90%
of unidentified objects.

00:31:37.115 --> 00:31:52.020 align:middle line:90%


00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:57.725 align:middle line:84%
Professor Timothy FX Finnegan
of the Royal Sir Myles

00:31:57.725 --> 00:32:03.320 align:middle line:84%
nag Copaleen Astro-Anomalistic
Society in Dalkey, Ireland,

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:09.300 align:middle line:84%
sometime lecturer at Trinity
College, the founder of CSICON.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:12.230 align:middle line:84%
That's the Committee for
Surrealist Investigation

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:13.505 align:middle line:90%
of Claims of the Normal.

00:32:13.505 --> 00:32:17.730 align:middle line:90%


00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:20.800 align:middle line:84%
CSICON has a
million dollar offer

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.120 align:middle line:84%
to anybody who can produce
something totally normal.

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.650 align:middle line:84%
If you can produce
a normal playmate

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:29.960 align:middle line:84%
of the month, or
an average peacock,

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:35.210 align:middle line:84%
or an ordinary Beethoven
sonata, or a typical view,

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:39.946 align:middle line:84%
or an average man, they'll
give you a million dollars.

00:32:39.946 --> 00:32:41.570 align:middle line:84%
But they've got to
be typical, average,

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:42.825 align:middle line:90%
and ordinary in all respects.

00:32:42.825 --> 00:32:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Not just slightly
in that direction.

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:45.900 align:middle line:84%
They've got to be
totally typical.

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's ever found
something totally normal.

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever seen a
totally normal dog?

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:55.910 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever seen
an average cat?

00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:57.986 align:middle line:84%
Has anybody seen an
ordinary rhinoceros?

00:32:57.986 --> 00:33:00.710 align:middle line:90%


00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:02.340 align:middle line:90%
Have you read an average haiku?

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:05.460 align:middle line:90%


00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Professor Finnegan
is the one who's

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:13.000 align:middle line:84%
computer-enhanced photos
conclusively demonstrated

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.820 align:middle line:84%
that the Face on Mars
is Moishe Horwitz.

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:19.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was
conclusively proven

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:23.090 align:middle line:84%
to those who were willing
to be conclusively convinced

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:24.710 align:middle line:84%
by computer-enhanced
photographs.

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:28.340 align:middle line:90%


00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Since I have in
my computer files

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:34.360 align:middle line:84%
computer-enhanced photographs
of George Bush with cocaine

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:37.990 align:middle line:84%
all over his lip while he's
taking his [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:40.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't find
computer-enhanced photographs

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:41.600 align:middle line:90%
entirely convincing.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:45.270 align:middle line:84%
But I admit that looking
at the photographs

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:48.120 align:middle line:84%
I have seen of the face on
Mars, that it looks a lot more

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:51.115 align:middle line:84%
like Moishe Horwitz than it
looks like Elvis Presley, which

00:33:51.115 --> 00:33:53.510 align:middle line:90%
is another popular theory.

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Except among the disciples of
Richard Hoagland, who insist

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:59.451 align:middle line:90%
it looks like the Sphinx.

00:33:59.451 --> 00:34:00.825 align:middle line:84%
And then there
are those dullards

00:34:00.825 --> 00:34:04.700 align:middle line:84%
who claim it looks like a
pile of rocks and shadows.

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.870 align:middle line:84%
They haven't studied
Salvador Dali's

00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:08.629 align:middle line:90%
critical paranoiac methods.

00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:11.170 align:middle line:90%


00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:16.530 align:middle line:84%
If you want to read up on Dali's
critical paranoiac method,

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:18.570 align:middle line:90%
go to my website.

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:21.409 align:middle line:84%
Click on the article on
CSICON, the Committee

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:24.750 align:middle line:84%
for Surrealist Investigation
of Claims of the Normal.

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:26.190 align:middle line:84%
At the end of
that, you can click

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:30.760 align:middle line:84%
on Salvador Dali's critical
paranoiac method, which

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:34.670 align:middle line:84%
shows you how looking at the
tiles on the bathroom floor,

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:37.520 align:middle line:84%
you can see faces,
clouds, Mickey Mouse.

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.370 align:middle line:84%
You can see all sorts of
things, especially if you're

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:43.315 align:middle line:84%
constipated and sitting
there for a long time

00:34:43.315 --> 00:34:44.800 align:middle line:90%
and getting bored.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:53.230 align:middle line:90%


00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:56.429 align:middle line:84%
What I'm waiting
for is somebody who

00:34:56.429 --> 00:35:00.030 align:middle line:84%
has carried the critical
paranoiac method far enough

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:03.550 align:middle line:84%
to publish a whole book-length
proof that the Face on Mars

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:05.225 align:middle line:90%
is not a face at all but a body.

00:35:05.225 --> 00:35:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's Miss February,
1966, in "Playboy."

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:12.170 align:middle line:84%
That, I think, would
really show the power

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:15.010 align:middle line:84%
of human imagination, which
William Blake said was just

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:16.220 align:middle line:90%
another name for the divine.

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:18.830 align:middle line:90%


00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:22.020 align:middle line:84%
Saying the human imagination
is another name for the divine

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:24.430 align:middle line:84%
is a backwards way of
saying the divine is

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:28.073 align:middle line:84%
another name for human
imagination, I suppose.

00:35:28.073 --> 00:35:35.090 align:middle line:90%


00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of the
science of his day,

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:41.440 align:middle line:84%
they say the sun is
only a burning rock.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:44.470 align:middle line:90%
I say, no, no, no.

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:48.230 align:middle line:84%
It is a million angels singing
glory to God in the highest.

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:50.040 align:middle line:90%
Hallelujah.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.880 align:middle line:84%
Now in ordinary
Aristotelian logic,

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.340 align:middle line:84%
we've got to decide
which is right.

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Are the scientists of the
18th century right in calling

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:57.480 align:middle line:90%
the sun a burning rock?

00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Or was Blake right in seeing
it as a million angels

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:04.360 align:middle line:90%
singing glory, glory, et cetera.

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:07.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't think we have to choose.

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:09.280 align:middle line:84%
If you want to do
18th century science,

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:10.430 align:middle line:90%
consider it a burning rock.

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:12.220 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
write good poetry,

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:15.240 align:middle line:90%
consider it a band of angels.

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.370 align:middle line:84%
What matters is your purpose
and how your perceptions

00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:19.950 align:middle line:90%
suit your purpose.

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:23.210 align:middle line:84%
I believe Blake did see
it as a million angels.

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:25.570 align:middle line:84%
I can see it as a million
angels, especially when I

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:28.120 align:middle line:90%
dropped acid that day.

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.245 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, even
when I haven't.

00:36:30.245 --> 00:36:34.555 align:middle line:90%


00:36:34.555 --> 00:36:38.700 align:middle line:84%
In the question period, most
times, most places I appear,

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:41.710 align:middle line:84%
there's one question that
almost always pops up.

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And that question is,
are you still doing acid?

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:47.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why people
keep thinking I'm the one

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.416 align:middle line:90%
to ask that question to.

00:36:48.416 --> 00:36:51.910 align:middle line:90%


00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:55.910 align:middle line:84%
Maybe because there's so many
references to acid in my books,

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:59.980 align:middle line:84%
nobody ever thinks I
might be making it all up.

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:00.480 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:08.360 align:middle line:90%


00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:13.480 align:middle line:84%
When people started
asking me that question,

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:14.960 align:middle line:90%
are you still doing acid?

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:17.980 align:middle line:84%
I used to answer, you
tell me how much you

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:19.930 align:middle line:84%
cheated on your
income tax last year,

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:22.210 align:middle line:90%
and I'll answer your question.

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:23.600 align:middle line:90%
That generally shut them up.

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.980 align:middle line:84%
But I felt that was a bit
hostile, so I've changed it.

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Now when people ask me,
are you still doing acid?

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:33.140 align:middle line:84%
I always answer emphatically, I
haven't done acid in two days,

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:37.560 align:middle line:84%
and it's great to
be clean at last.

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:40.770 align:middle line:84%
I may even get appointed the
next drug czar, who knows,

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:41.742 align:middle line:90%
with a line like that.

00:37:41.742 --> 00:37:48.060 align:middle line:90%


00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever stop
to consider how

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:52.180 align:middle line:84%
we got a czarist
government in this country

00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:53.310 align:middle line:90%
in the first place?

00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:56.320 align:middle line:90%


00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:59.922 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you a
theory of modern history.

00:37:59.922 --> 00:38:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And please put it in the
maybe mold as much as you can.

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:05.890 align:middle line:84%
Or as Aleister
Crowley used to say,

00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:11.250 align:middle line:84%
"Don't believe me, believe
your own common sense."

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:15.630 align:middle line:84%
In 1945, General
Reinhard Gehlen,

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:19.390 align:middle line:84%
who was the chief of
the Soviet intelligence

00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:23.660 align:middle line:84%
section of Hitler's Secret
Service, as the American armies

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:26.210 align:middle line:84%
overran Germany,
General Reinhard

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:28.800 align:middle line:84%
piled all the documents
he had about Soviet

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.100 align:middle line:90%
Russia into a couple of trucks.

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Drove them to an unknown
location and buried them.

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And then drove to the
nearest American army troops

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:42.240 align:middle line:84%
he could find and surrendered,
telling them what he had

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:45.170 align:middle line:84%
and also telling them about
his connections in the Soviet

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:50.142 align:middle line:84%
Union, which included General
Vlasov of the Red Army, who

00:38:50.142 --> 00:38:53.200 align:middle line:84%
was a czarist who had
infiltrated the Red Army

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:57.390 align:middle line:84%
with a leader of a czarist
group within the communist

00:38:57.390 --> 00:39:00.650 align:middle line:84%
government, intent on
overturning the communists

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:03.810 align:middle line:90%
and restoring czarism.

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, by the time
the word got back

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:08.710 align:middle line:84%
to the Office of Strategic
Service, the forerunner

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:14.595 align:middle line:84%
of the CIA, they for General
Gehlen out of his Nazi uniform

00:39:14.595 --> 00:39:17.710 align:middle line:84%
into an American
general's uniform.

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:19.790 align:middle line:84%
He was flown back to
Washington, became

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:22.730 align:middle line:84%
part of the US
Army intelligence.

00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:25.330 align:middle line:84%
Pretty soon, he was
transferred to the CIA

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:27.490 align:middle line:90%
after that was created.

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Went back to
Germany and ran what

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:35.160 align:middle line:84%
was called the Gehlen Apparat,
which was in close contact

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:37.710 align:middle line:84%
with General Vlasov
and other czarists

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:40.460 align:middle line:90%
within the Soviet government.

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And so the presidents of the
United States from Truman,

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:51.300 align:middle line:84%
Eisenhower onward,
Kennedy, Johnson,

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:58.780 align:middle line:84%
and so on up through Reagan,
and George I, and Slick Willie,

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:05.580 align:middle line:84%
and George II, His Royal
Fraudulency, all of them

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:08.260 align:middle line:84%
were getting their basic
information about the Soviet

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Union by way of a
Nazi general who

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:15.490 align:middle line:84%
got his information from
czarists within Soviet Russia.

00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Which I think explains
why the rest of the world

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:20.790 align:middle line:84%
gradually came to the conclusion
that American foreign policy

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:23.780 align:middle line:90%
was batshit crazy.

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Nazis, and czarists, and
spooks, oh, my, as it

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:31.180 align:middle line:90%
says in "The Wizard of Oz."

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, more and more
American foreign policy

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:36.860 align:middle line:84%
was influenced by
czarism, until finally,

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:41.260 align:middle line:84%
American domestic policy began
to be influenced by czarism.

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:44.120 align:middle line:84%
I've got a yoga exercise
for you like you've never

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.015 align:middle line:90%
heard of before.

00:40:45.015 --> 00:40:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And matter of fact, it's
not a yoga exercise at all.

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:50.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm just calling it
that to intrigue you.

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:52.640 align:middle line:90%
Go to your dictionary.

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:56.470 align:middle line:84%
In the back of your dictionary,
any good-size dictionary,

00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:59.280 align:middle line:84%
they got a historical document
called the United States

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:01.040 align:middle line:90%
Constitution.

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:02.750 align:middle line:84%
They keep it in
print in dictionaries

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:05.840 align:middle line:84%
as a historical
curiosity because it

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.640 align:middle line:84%
has no relevance at
all to how the United

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:10.980 align:middle line:90%
States is run these days.

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:13.350 align:middle line:84%
After the main body
of the Constitution,

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:15.770 align:middle line:84%
then comes the first 10
amendments which are generally

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:17.840 align:middle line:90%
called the Bill of Rights.

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:19.170 align:middle line:90%
Read that.

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:22.160 align:middle line:84%
Read it slowly, carefully,
and thoughtfully.

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And see if any of those rights
are still guaranteed to us.

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.770 align:middle line:84%
Every single one of them has
been nullified by one Supreme

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:31.470 align:middle line:90%
Court or another.

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:34.880 align:middle line:84%
I'll just start
with the first one.

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:38.480 align:middle line:84%
It says, "Congress shall make no
law abridging freedom of speech

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.460 align:middle line:90%
or of the press."

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Now as Justice Black pointed
out in one of his dissents,

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:47.830 align:middle line:84%
not only does "no" seem
to mean "no" in most

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:51.680 align:middle line:84%
cases in the English language,
when people who are writing

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:55.520 align:middle line:84%
happen to be literate, when
they write "no," they mean "no."

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:59.050 align:middle line:84%
But we have plenty of evidence
in the letters, diaries,

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:01.970 align:middle line:84%
and other writings of the
authors of the Constitution.

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:04.700 align:middle line:84%
They were very
versatile, eloquent,

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:10.930 align:middle line:84%
and adept in the use
of style in language.

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:13.735 align:middle line:84%
Like the Elizabethan age
was the great age of poetry

00:42:13.735 --> 00:42:16.930 align:middle line:84%
in the English language,
the late 18th century

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:19.560 align:middle line:84%
was probably the greatest
age of prose we ever had.

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:22.790 align:middle line:84%
We had more great prose
stylists at the end.

00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:26.690 align:middle line:84%
We had Gibbon, and Hume,
and Burke in England.

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Oh, Burke came from
Ireland, actually.

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Let's not give the
English credit for one

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:35.700 align:middle line:84%
single Irishman
that they adopted.

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And over here, we had Jefferson,
and Adams, and Madison.

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:43.560 align:middle line:84%
It was a fantastic age
for clear, crisp prose.

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And so when they wrote "none,"
when they said "no laws,"

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:50.090 align:middle line:84%
they almost certainly
meant no laws.

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:52.710 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to be really
tricky, you might say,

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:middle line:84%
they left out a letter,
and they meant one law.

00:42:54.720 --> 00:43:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Congress shall establish one
law abridging freedom of speech.

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:02.890 align:middle line:90%
That's quite a stretcher.

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:05.380 align:middle line:84%
But a good sophist,
somebody who studied logic

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:08.475 align:middle line:84%
with the ancient Greeks and
philosophy with Plato and so

00:43:08.475 --> 00:43:10.840 align:middle line:84%
on, might be able to
put across an argument

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:13.840 align:middle line:84%
that when they wrote "no
laws," they meant "one law."

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:17.520 align:middle line:84%
But Justice Black never
believed that because he said,

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.930 align:middle line:84%
"no laws," to me, seems
to mean "no laws."

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Probably, the problem is I'm
still a farm boy at heart.

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:25.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what my
problem is, but to me,

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:28.540 align:middle line:90%
"no laws" means "no laws" too.

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.710 align:middle line:84%
But we not only have
a Supreme Court--

00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:36.050 align:middle line:84%
have had several Supreme
Courts over the last 200 years

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:38.860 align:middle line:84%
which have decided that "no
laws" not only means "one law,"

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:41.190 align:middle line:90%
it means "many laws."

00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:43.670 align:middle line:84%
We have many laws
abridging freedom of speech

00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:46.280 align:middle line:90%
and of the press.

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:48.180 align:middle line:84%
What the hell happened
to the Bill of Rights?

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:49.520 align:middle line:90%
That's only one clause.

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.910 align:middle line:84%
Read the rest of
the Bill of Rights.

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:53.566 align:middle line:84%
See if any of the
things guaranteed

00:43:53.566 --> 00:43:55.065 align:middle line:84%
in the Bill of
Rights are still part

00:43:55.065 --> 00:43:57.580 align:middle line:90%
of the law in this country.

00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:00.070 align:middle line:84%
I read the whole damn
thing very carefully,

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:02.990 align:middle line:90%
both straight and stoned.

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:05.052 align:middle line:84%
This is something I
learned from Timothy Leary.

00:44:05.052 --> 00:44:07.260 align:middle line:84%
If you want to understand
anything, read it straight,

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:10.160 align:middle line:84%
then read it stoned, and
then read it straight again.

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.610 align:middle line:90%
It's also the best way to write.

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Write straight, then
rewrite stoned, and then

00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:17.850 align:middle line:90%
rewrite straight again.

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the way
my prose is produced.

00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And I got a lot
of fans, so there

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:23.714 align:middle line:84%
must be something in that
theory of composition.

00:44:23.714 --> 00:44:29.290 align:middle line:90%


00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not saying the
Constitution is perfect.

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:34.910 align:middle line:84%
The Constitution is
definitely flawed, especially

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:36.770 align:middle line:90%
in relation to slavery.

00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:38.360 align:middle line:84%
But by and large,
the Constitution

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:41.430 align:middle line:84%
is a much better system
than what we've got now.

00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:51.800 align:middle line:90%


00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:53.620 align:middle line:84%
There's no place in
the Constitution,

00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:55.556 align:middle line:84%
by the way, where it
says that Congress

00:44:55.556 --> 00:44:56.930 align:middle line:84%
or any other branch
of government

00:44:56.930 --> 00:45:00.540 align:middle line:84%
should supervise our
medicine or our recreations.

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.880 align:middle line:84%
That's also totally
unconstitutional.

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:06.340 align:middle line:84%
But we got a czar in
charge of supervising both.

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:09.210 align:middle line:84%
That's a result of General
Gehlen and the Gehlen Apparat,

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:11.860 align:middle line:84%
and the gradual takeover
of our government.

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.210 align:middle line:84%
When the czarists took over
our government in the 1920s,

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:15.900 align:middle line:84%
they didn't appoint
an official czar

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.110 align:middle line:90%
until the end of the 1980s.

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:21.000 align:middle line:84%
But now they're coming out
in the open, more and more.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Now what a czar is
based on, Trotsky

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:26.550 align:middle line:84%
called it a combination
of European monarchism

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:30.030 align:middle line:90%
and oriental despotism.

00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:32.720 align:middle line:84%
I think we've passed the
stage of European monarchism

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and entered the stage
oriental despotism,

00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:39.460 align:middle line:84%
extreme right-wing
czarism during Bush I. Now

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:43.630 align:middle line:84%
we're approaching total
oriental despotism.

00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>>I'd like to ask something,
but I would not like a maybe.

00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:52.065 align:middle line:84%
Regarding "The Illuminati,"
how much is it science fiction

00:45:52.065 --> 00:45:54.090 align:middle line:90%
and how much is it real?

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's all
science fiction maybe.

00:45:57.530 --> 00:46:00.740 align:middle line:90%
And some of it is real maybe.

00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:02.840 align:middle line:84%
The original title
of "Illuminatus!"

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:03.625 align:middle line:90%
was "Illuminatus!

00:46:03.625 --> 00:46:05.340 align:middle line:90%
A Head Test."

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason, Dell
took the subtitle off.

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:10.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:13.370 align:middle line:84%
But the whole point is to make
the reader think for herself

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:15.920 align:middle line:84%
or himself and decide
how much is real

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.550 align:middle line:90%
and how much is science fiction.

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And it would ruin the
whole game if I told you.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.590 align:middle line:90%
And besides, I can't tell you.

00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:26.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how much is
real and how much is fiction.

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:32.490 align:middle line:84%
That's assuming I possessed the
objective, absolute authority

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:36.390 align:middle line:84%
that 19th century novelist
all pretended to possess,

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:39.550 align:middle line:90%
the impersonal narrative voice.

00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And "Illuminatus!" does not have
one single impersonal narrative

00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:43.440 align:middle line:90%
voice in it.

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:47.360 align:middle line:84%
It's got 101 narrators, all of
whom have different prejudices.

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:48.800 align:middle line:84%
You've got to
decide for yourself

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:51.850 align:middle line:84%
which ones to trust if you're
going to trust any of them.

00:46:51.850 --> 00:46:53.310 align:middle line:90%
I didn't invent that technique.

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Joyce used it in
"Ulysses," by the way.

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:58.950 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the only way to
write a novel contemporary

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:01.560 align:middle line:84%
with our times in which
unanimity has entirely

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:02.300 align:middle line:90%
disappeared.

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Nobody believes in objectivity
anymore except Ayn Rand,

00:47:05.830 --> 00:47:07.120 align:middle line:90%
who was a speed freak.

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:10.730 align:middle line:90%


00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:13.770 align:middle line:84%
We're all very well aware
of neurological relativism,

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:17.530 align:middle line:84%
whether we use that
word for it or not.

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:19.800 align:middle line:84%
All of my books are
deliberately constructed so

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:21.440 align:middle line:84%
that the reader
can't [AUDIO OUT]

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:22.890 align:middle line:90%
and when I'm telling the truth.

00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:27.530 align:middle line:84%
By the way, does anybody
know who Moishe Horwitz is?

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:32.131 align:middle line:84%
He's the Face on Mars according
to Timothy FX Finnegan.

00:47:32.131 --> 00:47:32.630 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:35.140 align:middle line:90%
What was the answer?

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows who
Moishe Horwitz is.

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:38.670 align:middle line:90%
Find out who Moishe Horwitz is.

00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Then you'll figure out
whether I invented Timothy FX

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:44.550 align:middle line:90%
Finnegan or he really exists.

00:47:44.550 --> 00:47:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And then you might
have a better chance

00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:49.410 align:middle line:84%
of figuring out what the hell
the Face on Mars really is.

00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:52.320 align:middle line:84%
If you believe the word "really"
means something and the word

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:54.460 align:middle line:90%
"is" really means something.

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:56.275 align:middle line:84%
As far as I'm
concerned, I've never

00:47:56.275 --> 00:47:57.900 align:middle line:84%
found any use of the
word "is" where it

00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:00.505 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean "it seems to me."

00:48:00.505 --> 00:48:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it confuses you into
thinking you're not talking

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.500 align:middle line:90%
about your own reactions.

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:08.390 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
something quote "objective."

00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>>When's your next book?

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>>I don't know when
it's coming out.

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:13.090 align:middle line:90%
I haven't finished it.

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:18.496 align:middle line:84%
But it's called "The
Tale of the Tribe."

00:48:18.496 --> 00:48:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's a study of the
influence of Ezra Pound's

00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:24.310 align:middle line:84%
"Cantos" and James
Joyce's "Finnegans

00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Wake" on the communication
theories of Marshall McLuhan,

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:32.440 align:middle line:84%
which he wrote way back in
the dark ages of television

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:35.480 align:middle line:84%
in the 1960s, which
I think are coming

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:39.000 align:middle line:84%
true on the internet
in the 21st century.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's about how Joyce
and Pound are our best

00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:46.400 align:middle line:84%
guides to the emerging
multicultural world we're

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.400 align:middle line:84%
entering in the 21st
century, in which we're

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:52.310 align:middle line:84%
going to have to learn to speak
to people from other cultures

00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:56.340 align:middle line:84%
and understand them, and
help them understand us too.

00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Which is why "Finnegans
Wake" and "The Cantos"

00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:02.060 align:middle line:84%
are written in 20
languages or more.

00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Because they are
attempts to communicate

00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:08.270 align:middle line:84%
across cultural
boundaries, which

00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:10.470 align:middle line:84%
is what internet is more
and more teaching us

00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:13.110 align:middle line:90%
we've got to do.

00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:16.411 align:middle line:84%
I'm all for globalization,
unlike most radicals.

00:49:16.411 --> 00:49:18.160 align:middle line:84%
I just want it to come
from the grassroots

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:21.960 align:middle line:84%
up and not from the
Federal Reserve Board down.

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:22.460 align:middle line:90%
>>Right on.

00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:24.885 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:24.885 --> 00:49:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>>Ah, we got some
other people here

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:29.580 align:middle line:84%
who don't trust the
Federal Reserve.

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:31.440 align:middle line:90%
That's good to know.

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:34.582 align:middle line:84%
>>I was wondering what you
think about modern models

00:49:34.582 --> 00:49:37.844 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness evolution, like
Wilber Spectrum psychologies

00:49:37.844 --> 00:49:42.880 align:middle line:84%
compared to the Eight-Circuit
models of the brain.

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:46.440 align:middle line:90%


00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:47.660 align:middle line:90%
>>Ken Wilber?

00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:49.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:51.540 align:middle line:84%
I have worked out
a correspondence

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:55.370 align:middle line:84%
between Ken Wilber's Spectrum,
Gurdjieff's Vibration Levels,

00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:56.790 align:middle line:90%
and Leary's Eight-Circuits.

00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:58.930 align:middle line:84%
I think they're all saying
the same thing in sets

00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:01.560 align:middle line:90%
of three different metaphors.

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:05.690 align:middle line:84%
I prefer Leary's because
I've been thinking

00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:08.690 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the nervous
system rather than in terms

00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:13.090 align:middle line:84%
of more abstract
and ghostly entities

00:50:13.090 --> 00:50:16.720 align:middle line:84%
ever since I got interested
in general semantics

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:19.380 align:middle line:90%
about 45 years ago.

00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:22.980 align:middle line:84%
So Leary's system seems
more natural to me,

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:26.530 align:middle line:84%
which does not mean it's the
best system for everybody.

00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:28.470 align:middle line:84%
It's just I'm used to
thinking in terms of how

00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:32.870 align:middle line:84%
does my nervous system
respond to this?

00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:37.420 align:middle line:84%
But I think the eight
levels, whether you

00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:40.360 align:middle line:84%
want to call them eight
circuits or eight spectrums.

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:43.610 align:middle line:84%
They're all in "Finnegans
Wake" too, by the way.

00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:46.520 align:middle line:84%
They go back to the seven
souls of the Egyptians

00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:50.600 align:middle line:84%
and the seven chakras of the
various Hindu and Buddhist

00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:52.750 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:55.890 align:middle line:84%
I do think it's very easy
to make the distinction

00:50:55.890 --> 00:50:58.140 align:middle line:90%
between those levels.

00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And what language
you're going to use

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:02.690 align:middle line:84%
to discuss it depends
on what language makes

00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:04.710 align:middle line:84%
most sense to you,
and what language you

00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:09.140 align:middle line:84%
think will make most sense to
the audience you're talking to.

00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:11.910 align:middle line:84%
If I were addressing a
theosophical convention,

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:14.470 align:middle line:90%
I'd use Ken Wilber's terms.

00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:18.366 align:middle line:84%
If I were addressing, as
I did a few years ago,

00:51:18.366 --> 00:51:19.865 align:middle line:84%
the Institute for
General Semantics,

00:51:19.865 --> 00:51:22.630 align:middle line:84%
I used Leary's
neurological terms.

00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:25.785 align:middle line:84%
It depends on who
you're talking to.

00:51:25.785 --> 00:51:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And I can use the Gurdjieff
system pretty well by now too

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:32.931 align:middle line:84%
if I happen to be talking
to a bunch of Fourth Wayers

00:51:32.931 --> 00:51:34.680 align:middle line:84%
or whatever they call
themselves nowadays.

00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:38.160 align:middle line:90%


00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:41.444 align:middle line:84%
Does that answer
your question, maybe?

00:51:41.444 --> 00:51:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>>I was wondering what you
think about the emerging

00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:49.570 align:middle line:84%
popularization of
transpersonal psychology.

00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Leary was saying the
same stuff 30 years ago.

00:51:54.730 --> 00:52:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And just how it affects
culture the same way.

00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:05.340 align:middle line:84%
Wilber is much more accepted
than Leary ever was.

00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, well of course.

00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:07.470 align:middle line:90%
He's 100% acid-free.

00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:17.340 align:middle line:90%


00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:19.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually,
I'm more interested

00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:21.030 align:middle line:84%
in transpirational
linguistics than

00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:23.140 align:middle line:90%
in transpirational psychology.

00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:25.370 align:middle line:84%
I know the people
at Berkeley who

00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:28.340 align:middle line:84%
invented transpirational
linguistics, which fits in

00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:31.720 align:middle line:84%
very well with Benjamin Lee
Whorf's metalinguistics,

00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:34.610 align:middle line:84%
Korzybski's general
semantics, and Bandler's

00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:37.140 align:middle line:90%
neurolinguistic programming.

00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:40.120 align:middle line:84%
I do believe we live
in mostly acceptance

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:42.740 align:middle line:84%
for certain special
states of consciousness.

00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:45.430 align:middle line:84%
We live mostly in
a web of words.

00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And learning which
words control us

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:51.180 align:middle line:84%
and how to take control
over the words seems--

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:54.370 align:middle line:84%
The whole area that Korzybski
called neurosemantics

00:52:54.370 --> 00:52:57.720 align:middle line:84%
and Bandler called
neurolinguistics,

00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:59.680 align:middle line:84%
this seems to me
the most vital thing

00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:02.965 align:middle line:84%
to study because we're
communicating all the time.

00:53:02.965 --> 00:53:04.840 align:middle line:84%
Even when we're not
talking to somebody else,

00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:08.610 align:middle line:84%
we're communicating to ourselves
in words most of the time.

00:53:08.610 --> 00:53:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And to learn which
words are hypnotizing us

00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and which words
can dehypnotize us.

00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:15.820 align:middle line:90%


00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Korzybski believed we
should all learn mathematics

00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:20.970 align:middle line:84%
to break the spell that
Indo-European has on

00:53:20.970 --> 00:53:24.330 align:middle line:84%
making us think of
actor-action, the thing

00:53:24.330 --> 00:53:27.140 align:middle line:84%
acted upon, which is not the
way the universe is constructed

00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:28.242 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:53:28.242 --> 00:53:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And I used to go
around for years,

00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:32.872 align:middle line:84%
urging people to learn more
mathematics until I found out

00:53:32.872 --> 00:53:34.830 align:middle line:84%
that most people would
rather cut their throats

00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:36.981 align:middle line:90%
than try to study mathematics.

00:53:36.981 --> 00:53:38.680 align:middle line:90%
So now I found an easier way.

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:41.670 align:middle line:84%
I just tell them
to study Chinese.

00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:43.694 align:middle line:84%
If you study Chinese
at all, you'll

00:53:43.694 --> 00:53:45.860 align:middle line:84%
find that doesn't have a
subject-predicate structure

00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:46.359 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:53:46.359 --> 00:53:48.250 align:middle line:90%
And every noun is a verb.

00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:50.890 align:middle line:84%
As Ernest Fenollosa
said in his essay,

00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:54.700 align:middle line:84%
"The Chinese Written Character
as a Medium for Poetry,"

00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:58.120 align:middle line:84%
"In ideogramic languages, the
verb and the noun are one.

00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Motion in things,
things in motion."

00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:04.160 align:middle line:84%
If Dr. Kaku is here,
I think he'd agree,

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:07.530 align:middle line:84%
that's the best
one-sentence summary

00:54:07.530 --> 00:54:09.690 align:middle line:90%
of modern physics ever written.

00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:12.300 align:middle line:84%
Fenollosa did not
know one bloody thing

00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:13.220 align:middle line:90%
about modern physics.

00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:15.970 align:middle line:84%
He was just trying to describe
how you have to think in order

00:54:15.970 --> 00:54:18.240 align:middle line:90%
to read Chinese ideograms.

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:21.560 align:middle line:90%


00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:25.510 align:middle line:84%
So if you can't study
math, study Chinese.

00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And if Chinese is
too hard for you,

00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:29.060 align:middle line:90%
try an American Indian language.

00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:33.640 align:middle line:84%
They also don't have the
subject-predicate structure.

00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think I better
get off so you

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:38.200 align:middle line:84%
have a little rest before
the next speaker comes on.

00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.122 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very
much for your time.

00:54:40.122 --> 00:55:03.090 align:middle line:90%


00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm not bad for a guy
who's half asleep, eh?

00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:06.390 align:middle line:90%
>>What's that?

00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:07.973 align:middle line:84%
>>Not bad for a guy
who's half asleep.

00:55:07.973 --> 00:55:10.040 align:middle line:90%
>>You did good, man.

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:55.800 align:middle line:90%
