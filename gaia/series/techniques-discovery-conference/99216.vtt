00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>Huston Smith is a holder
of 11 honorary degrees.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.800 align:middle line:84%
He's an internationally
recognized philosopher

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.150 align:middle line:90%
and scholar of religion.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.720 align:middle line:84%
His book, "The
World's Religions,"

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.380 align:middle line:84%
has been the most widely
used textbook on the subject

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.815 align:middle line:90%
for a third of a century.

00:00:43.815 --> 00:00:46.350 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Smith taught at Washington
University, MIT, Syracuse

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.200 align:middle line:84%
University, and the University
of California, Berkeley.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.350 align:middle line:84%
In 1996, Bill Moyers
devoted a five-part special

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.240 align:middle line:84%
to Dr. Smith's life and his
work called "The Wisdom of Faith

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.240 align:middle line:90%
with Huston Smith."

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Huston Smith himself has
produced three series

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.980 align:middle line:90%
for public television.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And his films on Hinduism,
Tibetan Buddhism, and Sufism

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.110 align:middle line:84%
have all won awards at
international film festivals.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.090 align:middle line:90%


00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.190 align:middle line:84%
We appreciated the clarity and
insight in his recent book,

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.890 align:middle line:84%
"Cleansing of the
Doors of Perception,"

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.230 align:middle line:84%
and especially gained
much and enjoyed

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.380 align:middle line:84%
much with his latest
work, his latest book,

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.800 align:middle line:90%
"Why Religion Matters."

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.686 align:middle line:90%
Let us welcome Huston Smith.

00:01:50.686 --> 00:01:54.158 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:54.158 --> 00:02:04.090 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>>It's not usual for me
to lecture sitting down.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.750 align:middle line:84%
The doctor's still
can't quite figure

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.810 align:middle line:84%
what's happened
to my lower back,

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.850 align:middle line:84%
but I happen to know the
deep subliminal reason.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.940 align:middle line:90%
Which I haven't told them.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:32.528 align:middle line:84%
For a number of years now, Ram
Dass has been one of my gurus,

00:02:32.528 --> 00:02:40.060 align:middle line:84%
and when, a couple of months
ago, we shared the platform

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.490 align:middle line:84%
for a benefit for the
Zen Hospice project

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:53.660 align:middle line:84%
in San Francisco, his
last words were suffering,

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.210 align:middle line:84%
my suffering has brought
me closer to God.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, if
that's what it takes,

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.180 align:middle line:84%
I'll just follow
along in his trail.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.210 align:middle line:84%
I wish that his yoga were
not quite as demanding,

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.100 align:middle line:90%
but nevertheless, there it is.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.080 align:middle line:90%
Now my topic is the third eye.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:33.420 align:middle line:84%
As an organ of wisdom, we come
across this cross culturally

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.570 align:middle line:84%
in many, many of the
leading spiritual traditions

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.450 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:84%
The term itself comes
from the Tibetans,

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.060 align:middle line:84%
but it has its con
counterpart, Plato

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.140 align:middle line:90%
called it the eye of the soul.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Sufis call it the
eye of the heart.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.370 align:middle line:90%
But, never mind the terminology.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:18.120 align:middle line:84%
All of them target an organ of
perception capable of seeing

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:25.620 align:middle line:84%
things which are ocular
eyes cannot take in.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to tell
you the story about how

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.570 align:middle line:90%
that organ works.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.550 align:middle line:90%
It beats me.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.650 align:middle line:84%
It's far too mysterious
for me to give

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.020 align:middle line:90%
a linear rational account.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.750 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to be circling this
topic rather than giving you

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:02.060 align:middle line:84%
a straight forward instruction
on exactly what it is

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.510 align:middle line:90%
and how it works.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.480 align:middle line:84%
My remarks will be
divided into three parts.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.060 align:middle line:84%
I want to begin by
telling you a story.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.660 align:middle line:84%
It is, of course,
a teaching story,

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.080 align:middle line:84%
but that's what I'm-- and that's
what I'm going to begin with.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And the second part,
I will move from there

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.660 align:middle line:90%
into the phenomenon of savants.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.760 align:middle line:84%
We used to call
them idiot savants,

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:43.720 align:middle line:84%
but of course, we have learned
that that's totally a misnomer.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.600 align:middle line:84%
They do not, they're
in no ways idiots,

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.780 align:middle line:84%
but they're savants--
a word means

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:56.870 align:middle line:84%
knowing-- because they are
gifted with a special channel

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.180 align:middle line:90%
of knowing.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, I want to
go to the cognitive sciences

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:19.840 align:middle line:84%
and see what they might
make of this phenomenon.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And then, as something
of a coda or a wrap-up,

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:33.050 align:middle line:84%
I will turn to the
entheogens, which

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.300 align:middle line:84%
are the direct
trigger of everything

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.080 align:middle line:84%
that I will be saying
this afternoon.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.950 align:middle line:84%
All right, to begin
with the story.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.290 align:middle line:84%
I just learned
this morning what I

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:54.020 align:middle line:84%
would have suspected
that there is,

00:06:54.020 --> 00:07:01.310 align:middle line:84%
living in Oakland, a woman
whom some of you know.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Her name is Elizabeth
Mayer, known as Lisby.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And she has only entered our
company within the last year.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:20.220 align:middle line:84%
She's a new friend and
a very valuable one,

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.030 align:middle line:84%
because she's on very
exceptional woman.

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:28.760 align:middle line:84%
The credentials, well, she
mounted the Christmas Revels,

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:34.550 align:middle line:84%
which has become an
institution in Oakland

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.110 align:middle line:90%
in the Christmas season.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.310 align:middle line:90%
But never mind the details.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.000 align:middle line:90%
This story comes from her.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And it is one the most
remarkable stories

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:52.750 align:middle line:90%
that we have ever encountered.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:59.290 align:middle line:84%
We, my wife and
I, though Berkeley

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:03.830 align:middle line:84%
has taught me never
to say my wife.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:08.584 align:middle line:90%
Say she whose husband I am.

00:08:08.584 --> 00:08:17.690 align:middle line:84%
So but-- Lisby is one of our
most valuable, valued friends.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.050 align:middle line:90%
And this story comes from her.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:27.840 align:middle line:84%
I will strip it down,
not to make it too long.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:33.600 align:middle line:84%
A daughter of theirs, very
early around the age of eight,

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.480 align:middle line:84%
expressed an interest
in having a harp.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.534 align:middle line:84%
Well, harps are not inexpensive,
and at the age of eight,

00:08:43.534 --> 00:08:51.250 align:middle line:84%
why your interests come and
go, so her parents said, well,

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:59.310 align:middle line:84%
we will rent a harp for you
and start you on harp lessons,

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and we'll just see where
things stand in two years.

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, she evidenced an
extraordinary faithfulness

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:15.480 align:middle line:90%
to this passion for the harp.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Practiced regularly with great
joy, and around the age of 14,

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:26.100 align:middle line:84%
I think-- well,
in the meanwhile,

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.640 align:middle line:84%
the parents had
bought her a harp,

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.660 align:middle line:84%
and a very good one to
reward her for her fidelity.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And at the age of
14, she was actually

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:45.800 align:middle line:84%
a member of the Oakland Symphony
Orchestra, one of the harpists.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And then after one
concert, when they

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:54.800 align:middle line:84%
were unpacking
things, loading things

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:59.730 align:middle line:84%
from dressing costume
room for operas and so on,

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.490 align:middle line:90%
the harp didn't turn up.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.470 align:middle line:84%
They searched for
two weeks, assuming

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:11.250 align:middle line:84%
it was lost in the pile
of costumes somewhere.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.940 align:middle line:90%
But finally they gave up.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Nowhere to be found, the
harp was clearly stolen.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:29.030 align:middle line:84%
They were crestfallen,
but Lisby's mother

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:35.170 align:middle line:84%
had a peculiar
interest in dowsing.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Now dowsing isn't exactly
finding lost objects,

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:46.450 align:middle line:84%
but Lisby was desperate
and knew where to turn,

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:50.180 align:middle line:84%
so she told her mother
about it, and says,

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:54.110 align:middle line:84%
can dowsers find
objects that are lost?

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, we work on water, but
she said we've got a network.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And there is some people in
that who find lost objects.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:08.550 align:middle line:84%
I'll get on the phone
and see what I can do.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:14.280 align:middle line:84%
A couple of days pass,
and then her mother

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.060 align:middle line:84%
called back and
said, well, I think

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.040 align:middle line:84%
I've come upon
somebody who would

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.060 align:middle line:90%
be worth your looking into.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:28.610 align:middle line:90%
His name is Harold McCoy.

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.550 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I may
have a few details.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:35.580 align:middle line:84%
It may be Harvey McCoy,
but I know it's McCoy.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And he lives in Fayetteville,
Arkansas, in a trailer.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.500 align:middle line:90%
And here is his phone number.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:51.400 align:middle line:84%
So Lisby called him, and I
wish I were good at dialect,

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:51.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm not.

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:55.010 align:middle line:84%
But Lisby is, and
you could almost

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:59.390 align:middle line:84%
see the straw coming
out of the guys teeth

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:05.420 align:middle line:84%
in the accent, Ozark
accent that Lisby gave him.

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I hear
that you find things.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.990 align:middle line:90%
We've lost a harp.

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:18.510 align:middle line:90%
A harp's been stolen.

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Do you think you
can help us find it?

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And without any
hesitation, he said, yes, I

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:31.180 align:middle line:90%
can find that harp for you.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And then he said,
where do you live?

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.290 align:middle line:90%
And she said Oakland.

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And he paused for
a moment, he said,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:50.400 align:middle line:84%
is there a 580
highway in that area?

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.080 align:middle line:90%
And she said yes.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Those of you who
know the Bay Area

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:57.817 align:middle line:84%
know that it goes
right through Oakland.

00:12:57.817 --> 00:13:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And so Harold said, well,
that's all I'm getting now.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:08.990 align:middle line:90%
I've never been to Oakland.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:13.630 align:middle line:84%
I've never been any
further west than Kansas,

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:16.190 align:middle line:90%
so I don't know Oakland.

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:20.284 align:middle line:84%
Could you send me a
street map of Oakland?

00:13:20.284 --> 00:13:21.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.945 align:middle line:90%
So that was sent.

00:13:23.945 --> 00:13:30.060 align:middle line:84%
A few days later, he
called back and he said,

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:34.160 align:middle line:90%
I've found your harp.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:40.400 align:middle line:84%
You take this 580
highway going west,

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:45.080 align:middle line:84%
and then when it-- and I
checked it on the map--

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:49.310 align:middle line:84%
when it closes,
crosses Broadway,

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:56.300 align:middle line:84%
you make a left turn on
Broadway and you go two blocks.

00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And then you make a right
turn, and after that right

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:10.530 align:middle line:84%
turn, in the block, next
block, in the second house

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:14.305 align:middle line:84%
on the right, that's
where your harp is.

00:14:14.305 --> 00:14:16.840 align:middle line:90%


00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:21.840 align:middle line:90%
Well, what was Lisby to do?

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Her first thought was
she went to the police

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:29.550 align:middle line:84%
and asked if they
could conduct a search.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:32.060 align:middle line:90%
They laughed at her.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:35.940 align:middle line:84%
We have to have a warrant
to search a house.

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:39.360 align:middle line:90%
And what's the warrant for?

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:46.210 align:middle line:84%
Some hypothesis of some
cook, the psychic who

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:48.820 align:middle line:90%
says something's in that house.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.320 align:middle line:90%
They just laughed at her.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:57.780 align:middle line:84%
So Lisby and her friends
put their heads together

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:01.310 align:middle line:84%
and finally decided
on this strategy.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:08.740 align:middle line:84%
They printed up a
flyer, saying lost harp.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:10.940 align:middle line:90%
Reward.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:17.110 align:middle line:84%
No questions asked, and
then her telephone number.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And they plastered a four-block
area around that house,

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.160 align:middle line:90%
nowhere else.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Nothing happened
for about a week.

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And then a phone call came,
is this the harp woman?

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:40.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And the voice said, I
know where that harp is.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:51.460 align:middle line:84%
It's in the house
next door to mine.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:55.260 align:middle line:84%
I'll just throw in, you
know, the probability

00:15:55.260 --> 00:16:00.980 align:middle line:84%
is that he was the thief
and it was in his house

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:05.080 align:middle line:84%
and he was getting
nervous about the way

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:10.470 align:middle line:84%
in which these flyers were
zeroing in on that area

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.710 align:middle line:90%
and wanted to unload it.

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And so there were
calls back and forth,

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:19.900 align:middle line:84%
but I don't want to string
this out any longer.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the man said,
you know, the Safeway

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:27.930 align:middle line:90%
a few blocks from here?

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:29.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes, she knew it.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:34.590 align:middle line:84%
There's a small wood
area behind that.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:36.516 align:middle line:90%
Lisby knew it.

00:16:36.516 --> 00:16:41.270 align:middle line:84%
He said, I will bring
that harp there,

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:45.880 align:middle line:84%
have that harp there at
9 o'clock tomorrow night.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And Lisby said, I'm sorry,
it's very dark back there.

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:52.380 align:middle line:90%
There are no lights.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to go into
that area alone by myself.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.790 align:middle line:90%
But they worked it out.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:05.030 align:middle line:84%
There was a fire escape
iron, an iron fire escape,

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:08.760 align:middle line:84%
and the agreement was
that at 9 o'clock,

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:15.160 align:middle line:84%
why Lisby would be half way up
that stairs, and sure enough,

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:23.190 align:middle line:84%
he came rushing and thrust
this object up at her,

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:25.500 align:middle line:90%
and then turned to run.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And Lisby called
wait, your reward.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:35.853 align:middle line:84%
And he turned around and
she threw him an envelope

00:17:35.853 --> 00:17:39.320 align:middle line:90%
and there it was.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.950 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's my story.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:47.660 align:middle line:84%
If you don't believe
it, ask Lisby.

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And there are people
here who know her.

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:58.900 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to go
to move from that.

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, this man had a
talent that is totally lost

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:14.990 align:middle line:90%
on the rest of us.

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:18.180 align:middle line:84%
We don't have
anything like that.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:24.520 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I did omit
the fact, oh, I just

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:30.600 align:middle line:84%
have two more minutes,
because, of course Lisby,

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.640 align:middle line:84%
filled with gratitude, said
what can we do for you?

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.530 align:middle line:90%
This was a handmade harp.

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.800 align:middle line:84%
The harpists would
stop over in Oakland

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.620 align:middle line:90%
to have the chance to play.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Oh no, he said, if
I took any money,

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.780 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't do this
sort of thing.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.920 align:middle line:90%
And she persisted.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And finally, he said,
well there is something.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:59.460 align:middle line:90%
Do you know any educated folk?

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.730 align:middle line:90%
That's in the hillbilly twang.

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, Lisby allowed, she
has her undergraduate

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:12.220 align:middle line:84%
from Harvard under
John Kenneth Galbraith.

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:14.690 align:middle line:90%
And a PhD in psychology.

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I know a few
educated folks.

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Harold said, I've
never met any educated folks.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:29.120 align:middle line:84%
But it might be interesting
if I, I've always thought,

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.040 align:middle line:84%
if I could get
together with them,

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:35.870 align:middle line:84%
why we could each learn a
little something from the other.

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And so it was arranged,
he was flown out.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And actually, he thought he
could teach other people.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:49.160 align:middle line:90%
And there were a few workshops.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:53.620 align:middle line:84%
But turned out that it
wasn't transmittable.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:58.520 align:middle line:84%
What I forgot to say is this
talent, he wasn't born with it.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:03.690 align:middle line:84%
It came with him when he
took a very serious fall

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:08.630 align:middle line:90%
and went into a concussion.

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And the clairvoyance and
so on came after that.

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And when, it turned out
that his workshops weren't

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:22.410 align:middle line:84%
very successful in
conveying the art.

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Why, I thought to myself,
what he overlooked

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:34.220 align:middle line:84%
was to have somebody behind
the door with a baseball bat,

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:38.290 align:middle line:84%
and when they came in,
why give them that.

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:42.350 align:middle line:90%
OK, now let's go from this.

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Let's go from this to the
phenomenon of savants that have

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:53.410 align:middle line:90%
been very carefully studied.

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And some of the best studies
come from Oliver Sacks,

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:01.322 align:middle line:90%
the neuropsychiatrist.

00:21:01.322 --> 00:21:04.400 align:middle line:90%


00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And you may have read
his story about-- I

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:12.940 align:middle line:84%
forget the name-- it's
something like the Tourette's

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:17.870 align:middle line:84%
syndrome, where, just
unpredictably, people just

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:19.850 align:middle line:90%
go into spasm.

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:24.190 align:middle line:84%
Normally, before that, and
then sort of roll on the floor

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:25.840 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And Oliver Sacks
did a careful study

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:34.360 align:middle line:84%
of a physician up
in the Northwest.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And working in a
rather small town, just

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:44.780 align:middle line:84%
revered by the people as
the best physician ever.

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:50.790 align:middle line:84%
But they would entrust
themselves to him

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:57.550 align:middle line:84%
because he never had
a spasm convulsion

00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:59.970 align:middle line:90%
while he was operating.

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:04.410 align:middle line:84%
He happened also to
be an amateur pilot.

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And having become friends
with Oliver Sacks,

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:14.220 align:middle line:84%
said it's a pleasant afternoon,
let me take you up for a ride.

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And Oliver confesses
to be very nervous.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:24.080 align:middle line:84%
What if we went into that
syndrome up in the sky?

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.250 align:middle line:90%
And what would happen then?

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:28.720 align:middle line:90%
But it never happened then.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'll throw in
this little tidbit.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:37.480 align:middle line:84%
In the entire
history of theater,

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:47.370 align:middle line:84%
there has never been one case
when an actor sneezed on stage.

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Now you know, who's
in charge here,

00:22:53.020 --> 00:23:01.080 align:middle line:84%
when these kinds of
covering mechanisms

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:07.400 align:middle line:84%
rule out what otherwise
would gum up the work?

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Just two more examples,
one quite recent.

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Leslie Lemke, the musician,
he was on television a decade

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:22.060 align:middle line:84%
or so ago, and he
was a piano player.

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:25.140 align:middle line:90%
Not very good, not very good.

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:30.550 align:middle line:84%
But, he would invite
anybody from the audience

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:37.960 align:middle line:84%
to come up and play any piece
from classical to something

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.840 align:middle line:90%
they had made up.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And after they finished it,
he would go to the platform,

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:53.660 align:middle line:84%
to the piano, awkwardly--
his body coordination wasn't

00:23:53.660 --> 00:24:01.330 align:middle line:84%
very good-- and
repeat the number that

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:06.500 align:middle line:84%
had been played, right
down to the mistakes

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:13.940 align:middle line:84%
that the player had made
in playing a number.

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:21.980 align:middle line:84%
But I think my favorite example
is of a slave, Thomas Fuller.

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:27.180 align:middle line:84%
This man has been
studied very carefully

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:33.290 align:middle line:84%
by a professor of psychology
at Clark University, who

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:36.280 align:middle line:84%
found him
extraordinary and would

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:43.070 align:middle line:84%
go down and conduct experiments,
and write down careful notes.

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And the one that I took enough
interest in to note is--

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Now Thomas Fuller, a
slave, could barely count.

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And once a professor
said to him,

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:09.460 align:middle line:84%
and I don't carry these
figures around in my head,

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.770 align:middle line:90%
so I'll just give them to you.

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:22.500 align:middle line:84%
He said Tom, how many seconds
are there in 70 years, 17 days,

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:26.380 align:middle line:90%
12 hours?

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, it took Tom about two
minutes to work that through.

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:49.320 align:middle line:90%
And then he said 2,210,500,800.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, the professor went
back to his rooming house

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:57.420 align:middle line:84%
that evening, got
out his calculus

00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:01.390 align:middle line:84%
or whatever they had in those
days, maybe in his head,

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:04.090 align:middle line:90%
and worked out the figures.

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And triumphantly, he
went back the next day,

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:18.360 align:middle line:84%
and told Tom that
he had over counted.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:22.580 align:middle line:84%
That it was considerably
short of that.

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Whereupon, Tom, cap in
hand, replied, Mr., Mr.,

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:35.420 align:middle line:90%
you forget the leap years.

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:41.050 align:middle line:90%


00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:43.280 align:middle line:90%
Now what's going on?

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.420 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And what does this tell
us about the human mind?

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:57.895 align:middle line:84%
Well, I told you I'm
not going to give you

00:26:57.895 --> 00:27:02.640 align:middle line:84%
any detailed answer,
because I don't know.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:12.546 align:middle line:84%
But, to me, it is proof positive
that somewhere in our makeup,

00:27:12.546 --> 00:27:20.980 align:middle line:84%
are veil by veils
of oblivion, there

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:33.040 align:middle line:84%
are talents that we do not
normally have access to.

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:43.160 align:middle line:84%
William James said that in so
many words, and [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:48.650 align:middle line:84%
and Aldous Huxley,
and William James

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:53.410 align:middle line:84%
are only two of the
eminent thinkers-- three--

00:27:53.410 --> 00:28:01.000 align:middle line:84%
that I know who said it would
be more accurate to think

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:09.010 align:middle line:84%
of the human mind
as a reducing valve

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:15.780 align:middle line:84%
rather than as a
generator of information.

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:21.040 align:middle line:84%
You catch the point
that in principle, it

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:29.010 align:middle line:84%
may be unlimited,
conceivably unto omniscience.

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:39.130 align:middle line:84%
But if we tried to walk down
these streets of New York City,

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:47.720 align:middle line:84%
with all the information
flooding in on us, obviously,

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:51.450 align:middle line:84%
our attention would
not be focused

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:56.950 align:middle line:84%
on the cars that were
bearing down on us,

00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:02.650 align:middle line:84%
and we obviously
could not survive.

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:06.800 align:middle line:84%
So, now I'm through
with my second part,

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:14.140 align:middle line:84%
and the moral of that is that
we, at least in entertain

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:20.400 align:middle line:84%
this possibility of the
mind as a reducing valve

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:25.020 align:middle line:84%
rather than as a
generator of information

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:33.110 align:middle line:84%
based on prior experience that
we've acquired in this life.

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:37.200 align:middle line:84%
Now with that in place I want
to turn to my third part, which

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.920 align:middle line:90%
is the cognitive sciences.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:45.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to report
a theory that

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:52.670 align:middle line:84%
is being put forth by
people at the very cutting

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:56.690 align:middle line:90%
edge of cognitive science.

00:29:56.690 --> 00:30:04.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not by any means agreed
upon by the profession,

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:08.520 align:middle line:84%
but I'm talking about people
like Steve Pinker, who

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:13.340 align:middle line:84%
heads a cognitive
science program at MIT.

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:16.670 align:middle line:84%
I think we can assume
he's no slouch.

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And then Bernard McGinn at
Rutgers University, Tom Nagel

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:27.416 align:middle line:90%
at New York University.

00:30:27.416 --> 00:30:31.970 align:middle line:84%
The best account
of their position

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:38.590 align:middle line:84%
is in a book by
Bernard McGinn-- Colin,

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:44.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry-- Colin McGinn,
titled "The Mysterious Flame."

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.860 align:middle line:84%
It's good because
it is absolutely

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:51.590 align:middle line:84%
state of the art in
terms of knowledge.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:58.860 align:middle line:84%
But as Steve Pinker said,
again, thinks like a razor

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:02.440 align:middle line:90%
and writes like a dream.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.500 align:middle line:90%
And it's a combination.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.040 align:middle line:84%
He knows what he's
talking about,

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:14.790 align:middle line:84%
but he has a wonderful way of
making complex ideas simple.

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:22.000 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to be summarizing
the thesis of this frontier

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.320 align:middle line:84%
school, knowing that in
a knowledgeable audience

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:30.700 align:middle line:84%
like this, a number of you are
already acquainted with it.

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:37.120 align:middle line:84%
So bear with me as I
tell it to the others.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Now McGinn begins by saying
it's common knowledge

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:49.490 align:middle line:84%
that Descartes in
the 17th century

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:59.957 align:middle line:84%
split the world in two,
into mind and matter.

00:31:59.957 --> 00:32:03.310 align:middle line:90%


00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:07.680 align:middle line:84%
For 300 years,
McGinn continues, we

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:11.650 align:middle line:84%
have known two
things indubitably

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:17.840 align:middle line:90%
about this categorical division.

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:22.640 align:middle line:84%
First, there are
two things involved.

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Meaning it is impossible to
reduce either to the other.

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.350 align:middle line:90%
Of course, the behaviorists try.

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:38.310 align:middle line:84%
They try to reduce
mind to matter,

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:48.040 align:middle line:84%
but despite BF Skinner's noble
attempt, or ignoble, at least

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:54.160 align:middle line:84%
very valiant attempt,
why it doesn't work.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.910 align:middle line:90%
There are two things here.

00:32:55.910 --> 00:33:02.000 align:middle line:84%
The second thing we know, beyond
any peradventure of a doubt,

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:09.420 align:middle line:84%
is that there is mutual
causation between the two.

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:24.320 align:middle line:84%
If I tell my body to raise
my right hand, it obeys.

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:30.470 align:middle line:84%
That intention, that
desire, that thought somehow

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:36.720 align:middle line:84%
signals the neurons
firing in the brain, which

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:45.770 align:middle line:84%
activate nerves, which activate
muscles, and my hand goes up.

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:49.520 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
we know very well

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:52.810 align:middle line:84%
that if I were to fall
off those platform

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:57.450 align:middle line:84%
and suffer a severe concussion
that would scramble whatever

00:33:57.450 --> 00:34:02.930 align:middle line:84%
there is in this brain, why
I could lose consciousness,

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:06.450 align:middle line:84%
the pictures would stop
and everything could go,

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:07.720 align:middle line:90%
would go black.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.610 align:middle line:90%
So we know those two things.

00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:14.620 align:middle line:84%
We have two things that can't
be reduced one to the other,

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:18.179 align:middle line:90%
and there's two-way causation.

00:34:18.179 --> 00:34:22.150 align:middle line:84%
However, now the story
begins to pick up.

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:29.570 align:middle line:84%
In 300 years, we
have not discovered

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:43.960 align:middle line:84%
one iota as to how each of
these can influence the other.

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:51.350 align:middle line:84%
If you hold the human
brain in your hand,

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:57.860 align:middle line:84%
you've got a handful
of gray matter, which

00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:07.920 align:middle line:84%
in appearance doesn't look too
different from, say, the liver.

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And how is it that this
gray matter in our crania

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:22.890 align:middle line:84%
can elicit thoughts
and feelings,

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:28.710 align:middle line:84%
and the liver can't come
any closer to doing that,

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:30.750 align:middle line:90%
anywhere close to doing that.

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:35.070 align:middle line:90%


00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Now it begins to get
really interesting,

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:43.240 align:middle line:84%
because with those
points, in fact,

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:49.860 align:middle line:84%
they move on to this
surprising statement.

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And this, they say,
may be exactly where

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:04.100 align:middle line:90%
it is going to remain.

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a different note to
hear from science, you know.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:16.900 align:middle line:84%
Usually what we hear is give
us a problem, give us the time,

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:22.840 align:middle line:84%
and give us the money, and we
will come up with the answer.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:29.210 align:middle line:84%
But for scientists
themselves to say,

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:35.680 align:middle line:84%
in this, we may have just
bumped into something that

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:41.742 align:middle line:90%
is too big for the human mind.

00:36:41.742 --> 00:36:46.420 align:middle line:84%
For what do we think
we are-- I'm still

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:48.030 align:middle line:90%
paraphrasing-- omniscient?

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:50.870 align:middle line:90%


00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And in this, as I
say, issue, they're

00:36:54.990 --> 00:37:01.120 align:middle line:84%
saying we may have encountered
a problem that's too big for us.

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Then they go on to
say every species has

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:10.970 align:middle line:84%
things that it's good
at doing and things

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:14.660 align:middle line:90%
it's not good at doing.

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:27.162 align:middle line:84%
Birds have a mastery, a
genius for building nests out

00:37:27.162 --> 00:37:34.360 align:middle line:84%
of little scraps of this,
that, and the other flotsam,

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:38.990 align:middle line:84%
and a little saliva
mixed in, that

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:47.650 align:middle line:84%
would just make any construction
crew green with envy.

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And ants have a talent
for building nests.

00:37:55.750 --> 00:38:00.700 align:middle line:84%
This is really
amazing, as you know.

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Every ant seems to
be intuitively aware

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:14.340 align:middle line:84%
of what every other
ant in the colony

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:18.160 align:middle line:84%
is doing in building
this, and where

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:27.980 align:middle line:84%
the spaces are that need to it
to enter to fill that space.

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Human beings building
bridges, whatever,

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:39.100 align:middle line:84%
can't get into that
ballpark of this kind

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:48.700 align:middle line:84%
of intuitive psychic connection
between the other ant.

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:52.020 align:middle line:90%
What about us?

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:55.550 align:middle line:90%
Language, obviously.

00:38:55.550 --> 00:39:02.760 align:middle line:84%
We are geniuses compared with
other species in language,

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:07.750 align:middle line:90%
the complexity and alike.

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:11.840 align:middle line:90%
And we're good at science.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:17.280 align:middle line:84%
No other species can
come close to us,

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:25.320 align:middle line:84%
not even really engage
in it in any direct way.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:31.970 align:middle line:84%
But, this mind
brain connection may

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:41.140 align:middle line:84%
be just one of those mysteries
that we are not good at solving

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:51.310 align:middle line:84%
and to repeat their
own conclusion,

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:58.970 align:middle line:84%
this may be where it
will always remain.

00:39:58.970 --> 00:40:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Now I've completed
my three parts

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:09.220 align:middle line:84%
and have laid out the
trajectory, but really

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:19.190 align:middle line:84%
how I got into all of this is
the bafflement that I continue

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:33.750 align:middle line:84%
to have as to how certain
molds of chemistry

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:44.530 align:middle line:84%
can open the doors of
perception to ultimate reality.

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:47.695 align:middle line:90%
Because, for my part, they do.

00:40:47.695 --> 00:40:50.620 align:middle line:90%


00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:57.710 align:middle line:84%
It's an unshakable premise
to me that, again, we always

00:40:57.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:middle line:84%
have to factor in
set and setting,

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:12.240 align:middle line:84%
but when we do that, for some
people, in some circumstances,

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:21.470 align:middle line:84%
changes in brain chemistry can,
the best metaphor we have is

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:31.970 align:middle line:84%
open the doors of perception
or the windows or perception

00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:39.150 align:middle line:84%
on to a radically
different view which comes

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:43.160 align:middle line:90%
to us with the ring of truth.

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Now each of you has your right,
of course, to raise questions

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:57.040 align:middle line:84%
about that, but I'm
just telling you,

00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:00.230 align:middle line:84%
and this is the
best we can do when

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:04.510 align:middle line:84%
we're in an area as
mysterious as this,

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:09.110 align:middle line:90%
is to call it as we see it.

00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:21.290 align:middle line:84%
So nonnegotiable to me is that
it does veridically open us

00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:33.840 align:middle line:84%
to a deeper and more
profound seeing of the nature

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.600 align:middle line:90%
of ultimate reality.

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there's other cases
where the set and setting isn't

00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:45.470 align:middle line:84%
right, where it just comes
out as gibberish and nonsense,

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:49.160 align:middle line:84%
but I'm talking about
the authentic experience.

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:56.900 align:middle line:84%
All right, if I begin with
that as my nonnegotiable,

00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:05.660 align:middle line:84%
then how am I going to explain
why, as far as we now know,

00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:11.060 align:middle line:84%
a very limited number,
a handful, maybe six,

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:16.250 align:middle line:84%
maybe eight-- if you get into
anthropology and small tribes,

00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:23.400 align:middle line:84%
maybe more than that--
a very restricted number

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:31.320 align:middle line:84%
of plants or chemicals
have the power to do that.

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:34.880 align:middle line:90%


00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:43.080 align:middle line:84%
I not just think, I
worry about that a lot.

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:47.650 align:middle line:84%
But having come upon,
within the last year,

00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:55.020 align:middle line:84%
this frontier school of
cognitive psychologists,

00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:59.310 align:middle line:84%
I would still like to know
the answer to my question.

00:43:59.310 --> 00:44:04.700 align:middle line:84%
How is it that certain
substances, limited number,

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:09.490 align:middle line:90%
can do this and others cannot?

00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know,
but I take comfort--

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:20.620 align:middle line:84%
not quite the right word,
but I won't fish around--

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:30.680 align:middle line:84%
assurance that if the
professional in cognitive

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:43.230 align:middle line:84%
science cannot explain even
the first step, namely,

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:53.630 align:middle line:84%
how can these two related
parts of ourselves interact,

00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:58.180 align:middle line:84%
even if we're doing nothing
more than looking at a glass

00:44:58.180 --> 00:44:59.640 align:middle line:90%
of water?

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And they cannot explain how
your own firing will produce

00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:11.960 align:middle line:84%
a subjective experience of
light gleaming on the surface

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:22.710 align:middle line:84%
of the water, why should I
feel humiliated, or badly,

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:32.000 align:middle line:84%
or defeated if I cannot explain
something which seems to me

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:43.140 align:middle line:84%
to be far more momentously
mysterious than simple a color

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:51.620 align:middle line:84%
coming through the brain
functioning into my experience.

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
am at this point.

00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
customary to allow

00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:06.240 align:middle line:90%
for questions or comments.

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know who's
in charge around here,

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:16.496 align:middle line:84%
but if that is so, why this is
now your time to talk to me.

00:46:16.496 --> 00:46:20.470 align:middle line:90%


00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:25.075 align:middle line:84%
>>Yes, would you please comment
on neurotheology, please?

00:46:25.075 --> 00:46:27.630 align:middle line:90%


00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I mean, let
me tell you something

00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:34.760 align:middle line:84%
that really how that happened
in an audience I was addressing,

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:40.440 align:middle line:84%
and somebody was pressing
neurotheology quite hard,

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:46.620 align:middle line:84%
and was going on and on,
to me, rather tiresomely

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:54.010 align:middle line:84%
about how brain research, we're
getting more and more precise

00:46:54.010 --> 00:47:01.460 align:middle line:84%
as to what areas control
what cognitive activities.

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I was getting a
little annoyed with his detail

00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:10.440 align:middle line:84%
and his grandiose
pride and how we're

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:13.830 align:middle line:84%
getting it down more
and more precise,

00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:17.570 align:middle line:84%
and I finally said--
when he gave me

00:47:17.570 --> 00:47:26.190 align:middle line:84%
a chance-- I said, well,
while you have been talking,

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:37.570 align:middle line:84%
your speech has eventuated
from brain chemistry and neuron

00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:41.030 align:middle line:84%
firing in your
left brain, right?

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:42.960 align:middle line:90%
Let's just leave it to that.

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:46.280 align:middle line:84%
The left brain
monitors language.

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And probably, I
said, you can get it

00:47:49.850 --> 00:48:01.180 align:middle line:84%
to certain parts of
the brain, but is

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:06.160 align:middle line:84%
that neural
underpinning, does it

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:18.120 align:middle line:84%
give us any clue as to whether
what you are saying is true?

00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:21.760 align:middle line:84%
In other words, do
you think you're

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:28.380 align:middle line:84%
going to get it down so
precise that if you activate

00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:33.850 align:middle line:84%
this neuron, it will
give you true statement,

00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:40.100 align:middle line:84%
and if you activate this one, it
will give you false statement?

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:43.893 align:middle line:84%
Well, he admitted he had
never thought of that.

00:48:43.893 --> 00:48:54.220 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, in some ways,
the correlation and mapping

00:48:54.220 --> 00:49:02.680 align:middle line:84%
can be made more precise, but
I don't foresee that anything

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:07.670 align:middle line:84%
in that direction which
is going to give us

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:15.740 align:middle line:84%
the faintest clue as to
whether our thoughts are true.

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, I think there
is a cutoff point beyond which

00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:30.610 align:middle line:84%
that whole activity is not
going to generate what we really

00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:31.860 align:middle line:90%
want to know.

00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:36.444 align:middle line:90%


00:49:36.444 --> 00:49:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>>What you're
saying is that we've

00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:41.782 align:middle line:84%
reached the limit of
a certain trajectory,

00:49:41.782 --> 00:49:47.340 align:middle line:84%
and that limit that what we're
trying to really understand,

00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:49.040 align:middle line:84%
what we're really
trying to understand,

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:52.360 align:middle line:84%
perhaps we don't really know
the question that we're asking,

00:49:52.360 --> 00:50:01.310 align:middle line:84%
but that we're approaching
the question in a way that

00:50:01.310 --> 00:50:06.324 align:middle line:84%
is based on a fundamental
misunderstanding of reality.

00:50:06.324 --> 00:50:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And I know that a lot of
the traditions in the world,

00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:14.700 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient teachings
that are still alive today,

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:18.180 align:middle line:84%
speak about this, as
far as I understand,

00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:21.650 align:middle line:84%
as fundamental
misunderstanding, at least they

00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:26.830 align:middle line:84%
have their ideas about
the way that science

00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:30.260 align:middle line:90%
has been approaching things.

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:33.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm curious, as the
expert, or as one

00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:37.780 align:middle line:84%
of the great minds
on these traditions,

00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:42.470 align:middle line:84%
can you please
clarify what you feel

00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:45.330 align:middle line:84%
the mystical traditions
have been saying

00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:49.280 align:middle line:84%
is this misunderstanding,
what the traditions have been

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:55.610 align:middle line:84%
saying, and then what your
understanding is from studying

00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:57.590 align:middle line:90%
all of these together?

00:50:57.590 --> 00:50:59.526 align:middle line:84%
What do you find is
the common ground?

00:50:59.526 --> 00:51:02.280 align:middle line:90%


00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:03.720 align:middle line:90%
>>There is one.

00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:07.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure that it's the
most relevant one to what you

00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:09.980 align:middle line:90%
may be thinking about.

00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:16.870 align:middle line:84%
But I think the great choice
between the scientific

00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:22.320 align:middle line:84%
worldview and the traditional
religious worldview,

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:26.960 align:middle line:84%
one of the key
differences is that

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:34.240 align:middle line:84%
in the scientific worldview,
matter is the fundamental,

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:38.140 align:middle line:90%
is the foundation of reality.

00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And everything else comes from
a refinement and rearrangement

00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:47.650 align:middle line:90%
and so on of matter.

00:51:47.650 --> 00:51:52.600 align:middle line:84%
In the traditional view,
spirit is the most,

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:59.360 align:middle line:84%
is the fundamental
reality, and matter is,

00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:05.460 align:middle line:84%
it's like icebergs,
appearing here and there

00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:10.530 align:middle line:84%
in the infinite ocean
of consciousness.

00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:16.140 align:middle line:84%
So you see we have a fundamental
difference of approach

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:20.380 align:middle line:84%
that I think you were
trying to tease out.

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:27.590 align:middle line:84%
In the scientific
worldview, consciousness

00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:28.950 align:middle line:90%
is an epiphenomenon.

00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:32.060 align:middle line:90%


00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:40.910 align:middle line:84%
It is sort of like the steam
that is give off in the brain

00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:45.140 align:middle line:84%
when the brain gets to
working in certain ways

00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and certain activities,
but the steam

00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:54.470 align:middle line:84%
depends on the-- I've
mixed my metaphors, never

00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:56.520 align:middle line:90%
mind-- on matter.

00:52:56.520 --> 00:53:02.550 align:middle line:84%
So you're trying to get from
matter to consciousness.

00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:04.270 align:middle line:84%
I personally think
that's impossible.

00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:07.250 align:middle line:90%


00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:16.980 align:middle line:84%
Epiphenomenal, mind as
epiphenomenal and matter.

00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:25.970 align:middle line:84%
The scientists try to explain
it by the word "emergence."

00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness emerges
out of matter,

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:35.050 align:middle line:84%
but they totally
missed the point

00:53:35.050 --> 00:53:40.350 align:middle line:84%
that emergence is a
descriptive term rather than

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:43.270 align:middle line:90%
an explanatory term.

00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:50.130 align:middle line:84%
It tells us what happened,
but now not how it happened.

00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the traditional view,
consciousness and spirit

00:53:56.360 --> 00:54:03.180 align:middle line:84%
are fundamental, and it's
like the great chain of being.

00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Infinite awareness,
the Hindus would say,

00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:13.070 align:middle line:84%
saccidananda, infinite
being, infinite awareness,

00:54:13.070 --> 00:54:15.050 align:middle line:90%
infinite bliss.

00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And then it's a graded ladder,
the great chain of being,

00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:28.280 align:middle line:84%
and the further removed,
what we're talking about

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:32.930 align:middle line:84%
is from that infinite
sea of awareness,

00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:37.810 align:middle line:84%
being in bliss,
more shadow, or more

00:54:37.810 --> 00:54:45.630 align:middle line:84%
the light dims in proportion to
our distance from the source.

00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:49.580 align:middle line:84%
So you're quite
right in targeting

00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:52.240 align:middle line:90%
two different approaches.

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Both of them are
very mysterious.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:01.230 align:middle line:84%
I happen to think
that of the two,

00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:06.490 align:middle line:84%
if we were not conditioned
to the contrary,

00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:14.880 align:middle line:84%
we would find the traditional
religious view more plausible,

00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:17.720 align:middle line:90%
more understandable.

00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:22.790 align:middle line:84%
But we've been heavily
conditioned to the opposite.

00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:25.942 align:middle line:90%


00:55:25.942 --> 00:55:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>>Mr. Huston, could you
comment on the phenomenon

00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:32.970 align:middle line:84%
that we see where
other tissues seem

00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:38.380 align:middle line:84%
to take on functions that we
normally reserve for the brain?

00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:41.780 align:middle line:84%
Specifically,
transplant patients

00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:46.400 align:middle line:84%
who have received the heart
of a donor, these patients

00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:52.202 align:middle line:84%
then take on memories of
both vocabulary, events,

00:55:52.202 --> 00:55:56.640 align:middle line:84%
specific memories of events
that come from the donor?

00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm glad you raised that.

00:55:58.510 --> 00:56:04.150 align:middle line:84%
I have read those
reports, and assuming

00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:09.600 align:middle line:84%
that they are veridical,
and some of them have,

00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:16.360 align:middle line:84%
that I have read, are written
by reporters who are just

00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:19.240 align:middle line:84%
trying to get at
the facts and not

00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:24.010 align:middle line:84%
arguing any particular
case, so yes, I

00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:27.126 align:middle line:84%
would be open to
that possibility.

00:56:27.126 --> 00:56:29.900 align:middle line:90%


00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>>Hello, my question has to do
with neurological disorders.

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:37.874 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering
about schizophrenia,

00:56:37.874 --> 00:56:43.616 align:middle line:84%
people that have bipolar,
bipolar depression,

00:56:43.616 --> 00:56:45.240 align:middle line:84%
different kind of
neurological problems

00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:47.970 align:middle line:90%
and what is has to do with.

00:56:47.970 --> 00:56:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Is it a short
circuit in the brain?

00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And what kinds of treatments
are there out there right now?

00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>>This is out of my depth.

00:56:58.050 --> 00:57:02.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is for the
specialists who work in that.

00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:11.390 align:middle line:84%
I will mention one thing
that it brings to my mind.

00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:17.370 align:middle line:84%
One of my students
at Cal, he was

00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:22.620 align:middle line:84%
my student as an
undergraduate premed student.

00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:27.830 align:middle line:84%
In a seminar on mysticism,
where we used my book

00:57:27.830 --> 00:57:33.460 align:middle line:84%
"Forgotten Truth," he-- by the
way, what I'm going to say next

00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:40.610 align:middle line:84%
is very self-serving, but I'm
too old to worry about it--

00:57:40.610 --> 00:57:46.270 align:middle line:84%
he said, it changed his life
more than any other book

00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:52.330 align:middle line:84%
he had ever read, and
though he continued and has

00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:56.940 align:middle line:84%
is MD, why it was that
book that made him sure

00:57:56.940 --> 00:58:02.340 align:middle line:84%
he wanted to go into
psychiatry as a special,

00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:06.870 align:middle line:84%
his special field,
working with the mind.

00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:14.516 align:middle line:84%
And his last letter to
me was saying how sure,

00:58:14.516 --> 00:58:20.470 align:middle line:84%
how happy he is to find what
he has chosen to work with.

00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:23.610 align:middle line:84%
He's totally engrossed
with it, but the reason

00:58:23.610 --> 00:58:27.840 align:middle line:84%
he wrote his letter was
after reading my last book,

00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:29.600 align:middle line:90%
"Why Religion Matters."

00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:33.890 align:middle line:84%
He said, though
"spirit" is still

00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:39.260 align:middle line:84%
kind of a suspect
word in psychiatry,

00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:45.840 align:middle line:84%
he is finding among his
mentors and his colleagues,

00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:50.000 align:middle line:84%
as he's doing his
residence in psychiatry,

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:58.250 align:middle line:84%
that there is a growing
recognition among psychiatrists

00:58:58.250 --> 00:59:04.810 align:middle line:84%
of the extent to
which psychiatric

00:59:04.810 --> 00:59:09.550 align:middle line:84%
and, for that matter,
medical disorders

00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:19.370 align:middle line:84%
are occasioned by a yearning
in the patient's life, which

00:59:19.370 --> 00:59:24.690 align:middle line:84%
this world, with its
standard outlook,

00:59:24.690 --> 00:59:28.930 align:middle line:90%
is incapable of fulfilling.

00:59:28.930 --> 00:59:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And I found his testimony
as an apprentice journeyman

00:59:36.270 --> 00:59:42.440 align:middle line:84%
up the ladder, that he was
speaking for his profession.

00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And even to recognize
that, I think,

00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:52.640 align:middle line:84%
is a very real step forward,
and he saw it as being,

00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:56.570 align:middle line:84%
this is a change
that is occurring

00:59:56.570 --> 00:59:58.245 align:middle line:90%
within the field of psychiatry.

00:59:58.245 --> 01:00:04.466 align:middle line:90%


01:00:04.466 --> 01:00:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>>In my explorings
with entheogens,

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:11.484 align:middle line:84%
these states of
consciousness, I've

01:00:11.484 --> 01:00:18.460 align:middle line:84%
been struck with how different
each plant, or entheogen, how

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:22.610 align:middle line:84%
different each one sort of
reacts with my consciousness,

01:00:22.610 --> 01:00:27.050 align:middle line:84%
and with all the discussion
this last weekend about there

01:00:27.050 --> 01:00:31.650 align:middle line:84%
seeming to be some web, quantum
web of consciousness that

01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:36.110 align:middle line:84%
sort of unites us
all, have you thought

01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:41.640 align:middle line:84%
about why it is that, depending
on which entheogen you ingest,

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:45.900 align:middle line:84%
you seem to go to a
different part of that web.

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like I go
to different places,

01:00:47.730 --> 01:00:51.180 align:middle line:84%
depending on which
entheogen I take.

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:55.033 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sort of wondering, why
isn't it always the same place?

01:00:55.033 --> 01:00:58.090 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a remarkable
difference in the places

01:00:58.090 --> 01:01:01.060 align:middle line:90%
it seems you are taken to.

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>>You know, my involvement
was very important,

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:15.170 align:middle line:84%
I might say decisive for me, but
nevertheless, quantitatively,

01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:17.530 align:middle line:84%
there are many in
this audience who

01:01:17.530 --> 01:01:21.440 align:middle line:90%
have had a wider experience.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:28.850 align:middle line:84%
The three, actually, added by
peyote, when in the last decade

01:01:28.850 --> 01:01:32.930 align:middle line:84%
I got involved with the Native
American Church winning back

01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:35.160 align:middle line:90%
their religious rights.

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:39.650 align:middle line:84%
But before that, there was
only the standard three

01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:42.460 align:middle line:90%
LSD, mescaline, and psilocybin.

01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't
even-- of course, I

01:01:46.750 --> 01:01:50.660 align:middle line:84%
didn't have very many, only
two or three with each,

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:56.120 align:middle line:84%
but I could not see
that they were taking me

01:01:56.120 --> 01:02:00.640 align:middle line:84%
into different
places, or if they

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:07.830 align:middle line:84%
were, the commonality of that
other world just overshadowed

01:02:07.830 --> 01:02:09.500 align:middle line:90%
the differences.

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:14.930 align:middle line:84%
But in saying that, I'm
just simply registering

01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:20.848 align:middle line:84%
the limitations of my
experience on this question.

01:02:20.848 --> 01:02:25.588 align:middle line:90%


01:02:25.588 --> 01:02:27.484 align:middle line:90%
>>Hi Dr. Smith.

01:02:27.484 --> 01:02:32.200 align:middle line:84%
I'd like, in your expertise,
to give me an idea

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:38.500 align:middle line:84%
how to introduce to top
leaders, in management,

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:45.202 align:middle line:84%
people in the high levels of
decision making, what third eye

01:02:45.202 --> 01:02:48.670 align:middle line:84%
or intuition management
and responsibility

01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:50.800 align:middle line:84%
within among your
book, your work,

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.320 align:middle line:90%
within the cognitive sciences.

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:57.450 align:middle line:84%
What would you recommend that
I can use in this scenario?

01:02:57.450 --> 01:03:00.240 align:middle line:90%


01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>>That is a strait of
society that I do not

01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:09.670 align:middle line:90%
mingle with very much.

01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:15.790 align:middle line:84%
But, there is back of your
question a more general one,

01:03:15.790 --> 01:03:21.770 align:middle line:84%
and that is whatever you're
in, management, government,

01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:27.980 align:middle line:84%
whatsoever, are there
certain fields of endeavor

01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:31.740 align:middle line:84%
where this will help
more than others?

01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:33.400 align:middle line:90%
Not to my knowledge.

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:40.620 align:middle line:84%
I just deal with the
generic human situation.

01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Is the target audience
important here?

01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:45.860 align:middle line:90%
Managers--

01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:48.890 align:middle line:84%
>>Yes, it is, because
you're talking about leaders

01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:52.050 align:middle line:84%
and people in power
that makes decision

01:03:52.050 --> 01:03:56.900 align:middle line:84%
how to do management, take
on the responsibility using

01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:58.900 align:middle line:90%
the third eye, or the intuition.

01:03:58.900 --> 01:03:59.910 align:middle line:90%
There are people.

01:03:59.910 --> 01:04:00.890 align:middle line:90%
They have that.

01:04:00.890 --> 01:04:01.590 align:middle line:90%
We all do.

01:04:01.590 --> 01:04:05.350 align:middle line:84%
So why not train
them on that area?

01:04:05.350 --> 01:04:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>>OK, now we're
talking specifically

01:04:07.870 --> 01:04:12.560 align:middle line:90%
about managers and leaders.

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And the question is,
what would I say to them?

01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually,
there are people who

01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:23.950 align:middle line:84%
are working on this
who are we ahead of me,

01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and they don't
need my theorizing.

01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:31.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about Willis
Harman and the Institute

01:04:31.410 --> 01:04:33.190 align:middle line:90%
of Noetic Sciences.

01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And the last time we were
going to a conference

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:46.360 align:middle line:84%
together in Bombay, and we got
together as far as New York,

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:49.360 align:middle line:84%
and then there was a
bomb scare in New York,

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:54.870 align:middle line:84%
so they did not-- Air
India did not continue on,

01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:59.750 align:middle line:84%
but they put us up for the
night and brought to our rooms

01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:02.180 align:middle line:90%
a nice Indian dinner.

01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:05.530 align:middle line:84%
So with Willis Harman,
he was telling me

01:05:05.530 --> 01:05:09.580 align:middle line:84%
about how he was
working with managers

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:16.310 align:middle line:84%
on just this area, because
there seems to be a growing

01:05:16.310 --> 01:05:26.096 align:middle line:84%
feeling, he was telling me,
that the really top managers,

01:05:26.096 --> 01:05:30.860 align:middle line:84%
they got to where they
were because they homed

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:36.690 align:middle line:84%
their intuition,
not their logic,

01:05:36.690 --> 01:05:41.750 align:middle line:84%
numbers crunching, and
extrapolations of what to do,

01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:49.940 align:middle line:84%
but their inner feeling,
and sense, and intuition.

01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And he and others
were working, holding

01:05:55.550 --> 01:06:03.530 align:middle line:84%
workshops for top managers to
develop exactly that thing.

01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:10.250 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's already
happening without my needing

01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:12.486 align:middle line:90%
to give it any support.

01:06:12.486 --> 01:06:16.380 align:middle line:90%


01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:19.790 align:middle line:84%
By the way, there is a
generalization on this.

01:06:19.790 --> 01:06:24.870 align:middle line:84%
We-- and this is
important-- we always

01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:33.780 align:middle line:84%
know more than we
know how we know it.

01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And that is the final reputation
of idolatrizing a methodology

01:06:46.790 --> 01:06:50.320 align:middle line:90%
for producing right answers.

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:52.910 align:middle line:90%


01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm a bit confused by
some of your remarks,

01:06:57.670 --> 01:07:01.110 align:middle line:84%
and certainly more of some
of the other presenters

01:07:01.110 --> 01:07:06.780 align:middle line:84%
about the role and
limitations of drugs,

01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:13.300 align:middle line:84%
particularly psychedelics, which
is seemed to be focused on.

01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:17.190 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand,
it seems that we're

01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:22.550 align:middle line:84%
told, not just at this
conference, but over and over,

01:07:22.550 --> 01:07:26.310 align:middle line:90%
to quiet the mind.

01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:29.120 align:middle line:90%
Purify the body.

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And yet, at least in my very
limited psychedelic experience,

01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:38.780 align:middle line:84%
stretching back 25 years
ago, LSD did not do that.

01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:40.700 align:middle line:90%
It was quite the opposite.

01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:46.590 align:middle line:84%
It was very stimulating in terms
of sensory perception, which

01:07:46.590 --> 01:07:51.960 align:middle line:84%
seems contrary to
what we're being told.

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, in addition to
that, as a psychologist,

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:59.190 align:middle line:84%
I follow the line
of reasoning that we

01:07:59.190 --> 01:08:03.660 align:middle line:84%
want to make the unconscious
conscious, which I think also

01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:05.800 align:middle line:84%
has some spiritual
implications as well.

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:08.800 align:middle line:90%


01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Drugs seem to diminish
consciousness and stimulate

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:18.990 align:middle line:84%
the perceptions that our
body particularly has.

01:08:18.990 --> 01:08:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So some clarifying
comments would

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:27.180 align:middle line:84%
help me understand the
role and limitations, uses

01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:34.300 align:middle line:84%
and disuses of drugs,
particularly, psychedelics.

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>>First of all, on the
specific quieting the mind.

01:08:40.210 --> 01:08:45.399 align:middle line:84%
We heard a lot of that
from Russell this morning.

01:08:45.399 --> 01:08:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And, again, she whose husband
I am, is an avid meditator.

01:08:51.330 --> 01:08:53.859 align:middle line:90%
She teaches vipassana.

01:08:53.859 --> 01:08:58.920 align:middle line:84%
So I get a good bit of that
for supper every evening.

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:04.520 align:middle line:90%
And I believe it.

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.330 align:middle line:90%
And I believe it.

01:09:06.330 --> 01:09:09.970 align:middle line:90%
But, it's not the whole story.

01:09:09.970 --> 01:09:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Nothing finite ever
is, because we've all

01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:24.160 align:middle line:84%
had the experience of hitting
on a new idea that was exciting.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's like fireworks
going on in the mind.

01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And that pays off, too,
that kind of thing.

01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:42.359 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very meandering line.

01:09:42.359 --> 01:09:45.430 align:middle line:84%
All I find, at the moment
at least, I can say,

01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:52.580 align:middle line:84%
is we can't absolutize
any one picture of this.

01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:57.390 align:middle line:84%
It's more like a feel theory
of everything going on

01:09:57.390 --> 01:10:02.570 align:middle line:84%
and how does it
creatively orchestrate?

01:10:02.570 --> 01:10:07.650 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a specific about
the quieting of the mind

01:10:07.650 --> 01:10:08.790 align:middle line:90%
that I heard.

01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And then the general rule
about the positive effects

01:10:18.330 --> 01:10:28.110 align:middle line:84%
and the negative, we know very
clearly that there are both.

Aldous Huxley's second
collection on this subject

01:10:33.690 --> 01:10:38.260 align:middle line:84%
was titled, "The
Heaven and Hell Drug,"

01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:46.850 align:middle line:84%
and it is the very mischief
to try to lay down guidelines.

01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:49.710 align:middle line:90%


01:10:49.710 --> 01:10:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Ram Dass said be sure you
have a firm base camp.

01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:04.540 align:middle line:90%
I think that's an absolute.

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Translates in my mind is,
if your ego boundaries are

01:11:11.650 --> 01:11:21.120 align:middle line:84%
pretty fluent and porous,
don't touch these things.

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.890 align:middle line:90%
That's my judgment.

01:11:22.890 --> 01:11:28.250 align:middle line:84%
Or at least, not unless
you're under psychiatric care

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:31.990 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:39.370 align:middle line:84%
But blanket assertions,
it's too mysterious for me

01:11:39.370 --> 01:11:49.520 align:middle line:84%
to do much in the way of any
but the most obvious rules.

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:52.870 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]
