00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>It's my pleasure to
introduce you to Dr. John Mack.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.290 align:middle line:84%
Dr. John Mack tells
the Prophets Conference

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.520 align:middle line:84%
a story of one
man's determination

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.090 align:middle line:84%
to bear witness to
cosmic mysteries

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.410 align:middle line:84%
with extraordinary implications
for the human future.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.850 align:middle line:84%
An esteemed professor of
psychiatry at Harvard Medical

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.460 align:middle line:84%
School and a Pulitzer Prize
winning biographer, Professor

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Mack has become an expert
in the controversial study

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.820 align:middle line:84%
of alien abductees
that challenge the most

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.830 align:middle line:84%
basic assumptions that
make up our understanding

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:03.450 align:middle line:84%
of our existence and our
role in the universe.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.310 align:middle line:84%
Connections between abductions,
near death experiences,

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.770 align:middle line:84%
and past life regressions
are, Dr. Mack suggests,

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.210 align:middle line:84%
vehicles for recovering
perennial wisdom.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.848 align:middle line:84%
Let's give a warm
welcome to Dr. John Mack.

00:01:19.848 --> 00:01:20.824 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:20.824 --> 00:01:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm going to give a kind
of statement of the journey

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.360 align:middle line:84%
that I've come to the
place where I arrived

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.290 align:middle line:84%
at the focus of
the title, which is

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.000 align:middle line:84%
the need for a sacred science
that can look at phenomena

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.230 align:middle line:84%
such as the so-called
alien abduction

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.740 align:middle line:84%
experience or near
death experiences

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.960 align:middle line:84%
and which can have the
kind of reliability

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.870 align:middle line:84%
that the scientific method
has achieved in relation

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.890 align:middle line:90%
to the physical world.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm indebted to a writer,
an extraordinary scholar

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.800 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Seyyed
Hossein Nasr, who

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.800 align:middle line:84%
has focused on this whole
question of sacred science

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.330 align:middle line:84%
and the need for
a sacred science.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.720 align:middle line:90%
One of his books has that title.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.470 align:middle line:90%
He's an Islamic scholar.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.880 align:middle line:84%
He's at George
Washington University.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And he has been writing
more eloquently than anyone

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.180 align:middle line:84%
I know about the epistemology
of the sacred and the need

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.410 align:middle line:84%
to develop and return
to ways of knowing

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.720 align:middle line:84%
that bring us to a
much more expanded

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.420 align:middle line:84%
profound panoramic
awareness of reality.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.240 align:middle line:90%


00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'll have a
little bit further

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.530 align:middle line:90%
say about him toward the end.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happened with me is
that I, as most of you know,

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.670 align:middle line:84%
began about 12 years ago
to work with people who'd

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.700 align:middle line:84%
had these so-called
abduction experiences,

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.980 align:middle line:90%
encounters with strange beings.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And I was at first
incredulous and then astounded

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.290 align:middle line:84%
and then excited about
what I was finding.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.570 align:middle line:84%
I figured if I went out
there and wrote about that

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.240 align:middle line:84%
and talked about that, everybody
who could listen, intelligent

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.750 align:middle line:84%
or not, really, would
find it equally exciting

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.140 align:middle line:84%
and find that this
is really important

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and that we were in a
relationship with beings

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.760 align:middle line:84%
from another dimension
or whatever it was.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.130 align:middle line:84%
But that wasn't the
response that I received.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.180 align:middle line:84%
I found a lot of people
got very upset about this

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.670 align:middle line:84%
and began to wonder
why somebody who

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.470 align:middle line:84%
was a more or less
respected Harvard professor

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.900 align:middle line:84%
would embark on such a strange
and disturbing journey, just

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.500 align:middle line:90%
a disturbed journey.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And the focus we came upon
me and what was wrong with me

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.930 align:middle line:84%
that I should even take
such things seriously.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in the
psychiatric community

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.940 align:middle line:84%
there's no shortage of
diagnoses for people like me.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.960 align:middle line:84%
The notion of a
midlife crisis was

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:19.779 align:middle line:84%
extended into the late '60s,
which I found sort of curiously

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.470 align:middle line:90%
satisfying in a way.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.010 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:30.600 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is this ran into
a kind of buzz saw in the media

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.260 align:middle line:90%
and at Harvard.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.280 align:middle line:84%
So much so that a committee
was appointed, a three person

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.160 align:middle line:90%
committee, to investigate.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.580 align:middle line:84%
There were vague hints
of a kind of Kafka

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.360 align:middle line:84%
like nature that questions had
been raised about my methods.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And I was thoroughly
investigated for 15 months.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And the dean, when he presented
to me the letter telling me

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.760 align:middle line:84%
that this committee had
been formed, said, "John,

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.620 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't be in,"
because we had been friends,

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.600 align:middle line:84%
"You wouldn't be in
trouble if you had just

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.890 align:middle line:84%
said you'd discovered a new
psychiatric syndrome whose

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:10.790 align:middle line:90%
cause was unknown.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.950 align:middle line:84%
It's when you said
that this work required

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.010 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps we reconsider
the nature of reality.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.720 align:middle line:84%
That's what got
you into trouble."

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.540 align:middle line:84%
So I've thought
a lot about that.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.330 align:middle line:84%
One of the recommendations
of the committee

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.950 align:middle line:84%
was that I should
involve more colleagues.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had a lot of trouble
doing that in the early years

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.580 align:middle line:84%
because they dismissed
this out of hand

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.280 align:middle line:84%
and wanted to be as far
away from me as possible.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.800 align:middle line:84%
But finally with the help of
Karen Wosolowski, who's here,

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.160 align:middle line:84%
and others in our program, we
had a conference at Harvard.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.834 align:middle line:84%
Not sponsored by Harvard,
but two years ago

00:05:50.834 --> 00:05:53.250 align:middle line:84%
at the Harvard Divinity School,
in which we brought people

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.400 align:middle line:84%
together from many
different fields

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.940 align:middle line:84%
to look at how do we think
about, how do we study

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.180 align:middle line:90%
anomalous phenomena like this.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And what emerged, among many
things, from this meeting

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:10.340 align:middle line:84%
was that we lacked a reliable
science of human experience.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And especially of experiences,
however powerful or important,

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.020 align:middle line:84%
that challenged the
prevailing worldview.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.310 align:middle line:84%
So I've begun to think
about that a great deal.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:29.930 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, rather than sort of taking
on the scientific method, which

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.090 align:middle line:84%
is pretty popular
these days, I've

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:43.350 align:middle line:84%
been more interested in what
is an offer that has been

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:44.796 align:middle line:90%
so extraordinarily successful?

00:06:44.796 --> 00:06:47.900 align:middle line:90%


00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.460 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine, Bill
Gibson's a playwright

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.009 align:middle line:84%
who wrote "Two For The
Seesaw" and "Miracle Workers"

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:54.550 align:middle line:90%
and a friend.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And he was raised as a Roman
Catholic and very quite strict.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And he sort of left that,
became very secular.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And then he kind of
wandered back occasionally

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:05.540 align:middle line:90%
into the church.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And he said when he goes into
the church, he told me this,

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.590 align:middle line:84%
when he goes into the
church, his consciousness

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:17.700 align:middle line:84%
seems to open up and he feels
connected with the divine,

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:22.280 align:middle line:84%
with beings that extend
beyond this world.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's an
incredible experience.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And then when he comes
out of the church,

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.010 align:middle line:84%
he goes back to saying this
is reality, the material

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.530 align:middle line:84%
world around me, and
he dismisses all that.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.610 align:middle line:84%
So I asked him, I
said, "Well Bill,

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:41.360 align:middle line:84%
why you favor of the
worldview that you return

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.910 align:middle line:84%
to when you come out of
the church over the one

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.460 align:middle line:84%
that you experience
in the church?"

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And he said that science, the
material science, Newtonian,

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:57.140 align:middle line:84%
Cartesian science, wherever
you want to call it,

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:00.670 align:middle line:84%
has been so successful
in giving us

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.412 align:middle line:90%
a blueprint, a map of the world.

00:08:03.412 --> 00:08:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I argued
with him of course,

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:05.880 align:middle line:84%
and I said, well what
about all these other

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.600 align:middle line:84%
the dimensions
and this and that.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.600 align:middle line:84%
He said, but there's
no reliable way

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.900 align:middle line:84%
of knowing what's true in
those other dimensions.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.030 align:middle line:90%
Anything seems to go.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:14.540 align:middle line:90%
So I thought about that.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.270 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And I begin to think about, how
do we decide when somebody's

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:27.190 align:middle line:84%
reporting to us, profound,
powerful human experiences,

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:30.790 align:middle line:84%
or potentially so, how do
we decide what to believe?

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:34.559 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the reasons that
channeling is such a problem.

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:37.679 align:middle line:84%
Some channeled information
is tremendously important

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:39.659 align:middle line:84%
and the channelers people
of great integrity.

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:43.730 align:middle line:84%
But anybody can sort
of hang on a shingle

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.600 align:middle line:84%
and say they're channeling this
or that entity or god figure.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.006 align:middle line:84%
And the universe is just
as full of misinformation

00:08:50.006 --> 00:08:51.380 align:middle line:84%
out there as it
is in Washington.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.560 align:middle line:90%


00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.475 align:middle line:84%
So that question
began to really,

00:08:57.475 --> 00:08:59.650 align:middle line:84%
I began to wrestle
with that a lot.

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:04.040 align:middle line:90%


00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.370 align:middle line:84%
It's also, as for example in
the so-called alien abduction

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.670 align:middle line:84%
matter, the stakes
are very high.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.220 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with
something which

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:17.250 align:middle line:84%
so fundamentally challenges
the Western worldview.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:22.040 align:middle line:84%
As those of us that claim to
be or offering information

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.370 align:middle line:84%
might do that are being held
to very tough standards.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And properly so, because the
scientific method, whatever

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.490 align:middle line:84%
its limitations has
been, has developed

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.310 align:middle line:84%
very clear standards
of experimentation,

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:37.652 align:middle line:84%
testing, rational analysis,
replicability, and so forth.

00:09:37.652 --> 00:09:38.610 align:middle line:90%
And we don't have that.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:39.990 align:middle line:90%
And we can't have that.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.080 align:middle line:90%
But what can we have?

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.640 align:middle line:90%


00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:48.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're dependent
on the reports.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:49.170 align:middle line:90%
Not entirely.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:52.240 align:middle line:90%
There is physical evidence.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.970 align:middle line:84%
For example, abductees do
have marks on their bodies.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:01.430 align:middle line:84%
There's missing time, although
it's hard to objectify that.

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:02.940 align:middle line:84%
But the physical
evidence is kind

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:08.400 align:middle line:84%
of like if you were trying to
study a giant and all that you

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.800 align:middle line:84%
got was the toenail
of the giant.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.812 align:middle line:84%
I even like the image of
it because it's sort of

00:10:13.812 --> 00:10:16.420 align:middle line:90%
curved like a spaceship.

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.120 align:middle line:90%
And you study that toenail.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.870 align:middle line:84%
You measure it and you get how
many toenails have you seen

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.828 align:middle line:84%
or how many people have
seen it, this and that.

00:10:23.828 --> 00:10:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And you conclude this
is what it's about.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:28.080 align:middle line:90%
But you don't see the toe.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.540 align:middle line:84%
You don't see the
rest of the body.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.710 align:middle line:84%
You don't see the
giant that's there.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:34.040 align:middle line:90%
You miss knowing.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.290 align:middle line:84%
But how do you know the
giant of the reality beyond?

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:40.400 align:middle line:84%
You know through consciousness,
through your whole self.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.621 align:middle line:84%
But how do you know
what's reliable?

00:10:42.621 --> 00:10:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have
the answer to this.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:48.950 align:middle line:84%
I just can keep asking this
question and addressing it.

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:53.590 align:middle line:84%
In part it's a clinical
question because it

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:56.910 align:middle line:84%
involves the reliability
of the people who

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.832 align:middle line:90%
are making the reports.

00:10:58.832 --> 00:11:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things it allowed me

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:03.680 align:middle line:84%
to endure through this whole
Harvard inquisition period

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.440 align:middle line:84%
was that I could keep saying,
look, you see these people.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.170 align:middle line:90%
You talk to them.

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.510 align:middle line:84%
Do they seem like
they're suffering

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:12.225 align:middle line:84%
from some kind of
mental condition?

00:11:12.225 --> 00:11:14.832 align:middle line:90%


00:11:14.832 --> 00:11:16.540 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people just
refuse to see them.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.669 align:middle line:84%
But those who were willing
to come in the room with me

00:11:19.669 --> 00:11:21.460 align:middle line:84%
would come out shaking
their heads and say,

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.293 align:middle line:90%
I see what you mean.

00:11:22.293 --> 00:11:24.090 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand this either.

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:26.675 align:middle line:84%
And I keep saying,
nothing in my 40,

00:11:26.675 --> 00:11:29.700 align:middle line:84%
of course it's now more
than 40, years of experience

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:33.950 align:middle line:84%
as a clinician has given me
one bit of information that

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:39.560 align:middle line:84%
helps me understand what
I'm hearing psychiatrically.

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.430 align:middle line:84%
The people are talking
to me about experiences

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:46.350 align:middle line:84%
with emotion that's appropriate
to what they're talking about,

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:47.810 align:middle line:90%
appropriate questioning.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:49.410 align:middle line:90%
They have solid lives otherwise.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.370 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing to
suggest delusion.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:54.674 align:middle line:84%
The only problem,
the only problem

00:11:54.674 --> 00:11:56.090 align:middle line:84%
is that what they're
talking about

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:59.880 align:middle line:84%
is not considered possible
from the standpoint

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.830 align:middle line:84%
of the worldview in which
they and I were raised.

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, I happen to make
the choice of deciding

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.480 align:middle line:84%
that it's something
wrong with the worldview

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.640 align:middle line:84%
rather than that if would just
keep going down that same road,

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.560 align:middle line:84%
we're going to find a syndrome
that's going to explain this.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.650 align:middle line:84%
But once you go down the road
of challenging the worldview,

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:22.260 align:middle line:84%
things really begin
to get interesting.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:26.030 align:middle line:84%
The people's stories were
consistent one from another.

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:27.180 align:middle line:90%
They would vary some.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.840 align:middle line:90%
Some were more traumatic.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Some were more opening up to
experiences of the divine.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.680 align:middle line:84%
But by and large there
was a consistent pattern

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.250 align:middle line:90%
of the stories.

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And they were
reported with feeling

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:49.360 align:middle line:84%
that I could determine
was based on what

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.920 align:middle line:84%
sounded like something that
had really happened to them.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And the intensity of the
feeling, as I mentioned,

00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.660 align:middle line:84%
the self-doubt, the clinical
soundness of these individuals.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:03.790 align:middle line:90%
All of this I could speak about.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.740 align:middle line:90%
But there was something more.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Because even that, I'd say,
look, I argued, I presented,

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.700 align:middle line:84%
everybody do
psychological tests.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.860 align:middle line:84%
You find out that there's no
pathology that can explain it.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:19.370 align:middle line:84%
We have done studies that
appear of that nature.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And psychiatric
analyses don't reveal

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.950 align:middle line:84%
anything that's
particularly helpful

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:28.460 align:middle line:90%
or doesn't add anything to it.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.977 align:middle line:84%
But even those arguments
don't get anywhere

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:32.560 align:middle line:84%
or don't get very
far, because there's

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.390 align:middle line:84%
something missing in this
question of what is reliable.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And I came upon the
notion of the witness.

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, this came because in
San Marino in April 1999,

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:49.160 align:middle line:90%
I was at a conference.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And at that conference was
a Catholic prelate wearing

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.210 align:middle line:90%
the cassock.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And he was talking about the
UFO and abduction phenomenon.

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And he said, and he was not
speaking for the Vatican,

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:09.120 align:middle line:84%
but clearly what he said was
not offensive to the Vatican,

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.070 align:middle line:84%
he said, "I take this
very, very seriously why?

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Because there are so
many reliable witnesses,

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:19.520 align:middle line:90%
apparently reliable witnesses.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And in the church
when we're trying

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.600 align:middle line:84%
to evaluate miracles, determine
what miracles to believe,

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.020 align:middle line:90%
we have to depend on witnesses."

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.460 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is a reliable witness?

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, they go through
much of what we do.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Currently they've been using
psychiatric and psychological

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.450 align:middle line:84%
examinations of people
reporting miracles.

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:45.640 align:middle line:84%
But there is something about
the Witness with a capital W

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.597 align:middle line:90%
that is in a sacred tradition.

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:50.930 align:middle line:90%
Not just in the Catholic Church.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.310 align:middle line:84%
I talked with a zen
master about this.

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:57.120 align:middle line:84%
He says that there's a
way that you experience

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.800 align:middle line:84%
somebody who has
a clarity of mind,

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.682 align:middle line:84%
does not have another
agenda, is not attached

00:15:03.682 --> 00:15:04.640 align:middle line:90%
to what they're saying.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.550 align:middle line:84%
There's a purity of the
way they express it.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:09.556 align:middle line:84%
You experience what they're
talking about as if it

00:15:09.556 --> 00:15:10.680 align:middle line:90%
were happening to yourself.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.620 align:middle line:84%
They convey to you
something that you just

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.040 align:middle line:90%
are part of the experience.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And one of the people that
I work with, an experiencer,

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:24.090 align:middle line:84%
said it's as if they come and
they've been touched by God.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:27.700 align:middle line:84%
You feel that there's
that connection that they

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:31.190 align:middle line:90%
express and represent.

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:36.410 align:middle line:84%
So I began then to
reinterpret my own job.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Since I'm not a direct
witness in the sense of having

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:43.750 align:middle line:84%
had these experiences
with beings or been taken

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.600 align:middle line:84%
or whatever happens
to people when

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.320 align:middle line:90%
they encounter this phenomenon.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:53.300 align:middle line:84%
I began to look upon
myself as a kind of witness

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.540 align:middle line:84%
to the witnesses, somebody
that helps give them voice

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.530 align:middle line:90%
or asserts their reliability.

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Because the notion of somebody
in my "position," quote,

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:11.250 align:middle line:84%
unquote, and that's in
an archetypal sense,

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.570 align:middle line:84%
has a chance, even
though it gets shot

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:16.680 align:middle line:84%
at a lot, a chance to
be heard or to enable

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:17.740 align:middle line:90%
other people to be heard.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.950 align:middle line:84%
So there is this relationship I
have with the experiences where

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:24.580 align:middle line:84%
I am helping them
to be legitimized

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.460 align:middle line:90%
because I'm convinced.

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:30.169 align:middle line:84%
It's not just to help them
integrate their experiences.

00:16:30.169 --> 00:16:31.460 align:middle line:90%
And that's important in itself.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.180 align:middle line:84%
But I believe they
bring something

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.115 align:middle line:84%
of extraordinary
importance to the culture.

00:16:36.115 --> 00:16:40.510 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they are
receiving information

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:44.500 align:middle line:84%
from whatever source
this phenomenon emanates

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:50.240 align:middle line:84%
from that says human
beings have to change.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.050 align:middle line:84%
We have to open
our consciousness.

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:55.400 align:middle line:84%
We're acting like, as one of
the experiencers would call it,

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.720 align:middle line:90%
rednecks in the galaxy.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.850 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Bent on destroying
not only ourselves,

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.819 align:middle line:84%
but life way beyond ourselves,
other species on the planet,

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:10.630 align:middle line:84%
and even causing a cosmic
ripple in the dimensions

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:11.700 align:middle line:90%
of our destructiveness.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:12.849 align:middle line:90%
They have to change.

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And the experiencers
have something

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.550 align:middle line:84%
terribly important to
tell us about this.

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:20.250 align:middle line:84%
But then those of us
that work with them

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:24.844 align:middle line:84%
have that job of legitimizing,
trying to legitimize

00:17:24.844 --> 00:17:25.760 align:middle line:90%
what they have to say.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, Veronica who I've
not known very long.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:37.030 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the first time that
Veronica and I were ever

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.665 align:middle line:84%
in a conference together,
I spontaneously, I

00:17:39.665 --> 00:17:41.540 align:middle line:84%
think it was in Palm
Springs even, wasn't it?

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.235 align:middle line:84%
I just pulled her
up on the stage

00:17:43.235 --> 00:17:45.360 align:middle line:84%
and said, come on, darling,
let's do this together.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.530 align:middle line:84%
Because I had such a kind
of confidence in her as what

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:50.580 align:middle line:90%
I've called a reliable witness.

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:54.720 align:middle line:90%


00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the disadvantages
for me this time

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.250 align:middle line:84%
is that I've had time to
think about this talk.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:04.580 align:middle line:84%
Whereas in Palm Springs, it
was so spontaneous I didn't.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that won't
work against me here.

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:19.690 align:middle line:84%
I guess it's my feeling that all
of us, in one form or another,

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:24.440 align:middle line:84%
have had some kind of
encounter, experience.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.045 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise we wouldn't
be in this room.

00:18:27.045 --> 00:18:30.910 align:middle line:90%


00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I would like to just
honor those invisible presences

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:42.360 align:middle line:90%
that are here with us today.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:47.390 align:middle line:90%


00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:50.040 align:middle line:84%
What I'd like to do actually
is start with a dream.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the things
that has become increasingly

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:58.180 align:middle line:84%
clear to me is that although
the encounter experience

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:09.450 align:middle line:84%
that I had in 1989, which
is now 12 years ago,

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:11.750 align:middle line:90%
it was not an isolated event.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:16.900 align:middle line:84%
I myself have not had
other encounter experiences

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.100 align:middle line:84%
such as the one that I
had, as many people do

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.180 align:middle line:90%
have repeated experiences.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.310 align:middle line:84%
But the story
doesn't stop there.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And what I've noticed is
that the link that was made

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:35.320 align:middle line:90%
continues in different forms.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.450 align:middle line:90%
One for me is in my dreams.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:40.890 align:middle line:84%
They also happen
in other ways too.

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:42.570 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if
I have dreams where

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:45.650 align:middle line:84%
there are unknown
figures, I do what

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Jung calls active imagination
and I engage the figures.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And I've found that
these luminous ones also

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:57.000 align:middle line:84%
come through those meditative
kinds of experiences.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.230 align:middle line:84%
So the connection continues
and the journey continues.

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:03.660 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to
start with a dream

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:08.225 align:middle line:84%
that I actually had on May
the first, just this month.

00:20:08.225 --> 00:20:10.730 align:middle line:90%


00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And as it turns out,
sort of mayday, mayday

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:16.555 align:middle line:84%
has a kind of resonance in terms
of the content of this dream.

00:20:16.555 --> 00:20:23.220 align:middle line:90%


00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.770 align:middle line:84%
I'll just try and talk about
the part that's relevant.

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:30.120 align:middle line:84%
There's an opening
scene, but it moves on.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:33.070 align:middle line:84%
It becomes apparent
there's a woman who's

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:36.760 align:middle line:84%
had an unusual encounter with
a small yet powerful being

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:41.380 align:middle line:84%
from another realm who has
disclosed some secrets to her

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:44.670 align:middle line:84%
concerning the current
situation on Earth.

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And she's going to tell
us what she was told.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:53.400 align:middle line:84%
This being, whose form was
a bluish glowing light,

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:58.970 align:middle line:84%
revealed to her that
humans are really gods.

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:02.360 align:middle line:84%
But this knowledge has been
too frightening for humans

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.050 align:middle line:90%
to handle thus far.

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And their terror about
this awesome realization

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:12.740 align:middle line:84%
has made them, namely
us, run away in fear.

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Our fear has been so
profound that the only means

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:18.980 align:middle line:84%
of expressing our terror with
the power at our disposal

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:22.900 align:middle line:84%
has been to create attitudes,
technologies, and weapons

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.620 align:middle line:84%
of destruction that
have almost succeeded

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:28.880 align:middle line:90%
in annihilating the Earth.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.520 align:middle line:84%
The extent of the
devaluing of life on Earth

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.570 align:middle line:84%
has become so extreme
in recent years

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:37.280 align:middle line:84%
that there have been
interventions made

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.120 align:middle line:84%
from other realms
to help humans take

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:44.130 align:middle line:84%
on the responsibility
of our divine natures

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:48.940 align:middle line:84%
and to try to help us
accept our awesome power

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.120 align:middle line:90%
in the service of the sacred.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.290 align:middle line:84%
In harmony with the
wholeness of creation,

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:58.820 align:middle line:90%
both invisible and manifest.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:03.550 align:middle line:84%
In the service all creative
effort, not destruction.

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:07.070 align:middle line:84%
In loving regard
for all being, not

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:12.680 align:middle line:84%
fear resulting in expressions
of hatred and violence.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.870 align:middle line:84%
The dread become fear
needs to be transmuted

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:19.880 align:middle line:84%
into the awe reserved for
the appropriate response

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:24.520 align:middle line:84%
to the wondrous
beauty of creation.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.140 align:middle line:84%
The chaos of our
impoverished times

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.980 align:middle line:84%
in which the tension of the
separation between humans

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:32.080 align:middle line:84%
and the divine has reached
critical proportions,

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:36.460 align:middle line:84%
has constellated the need
for a profound metanoia

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:39.120 align:middle line:90%
in the hearts of all of us.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:44.430 align:middle line:84%
On many different levels and
in a diverse variety of ways,

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:49.170 align:middle line:84%
through stones, through
sea creatures, visionaries

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:53.430 align:middle line:84%
and children, the silent
and invisible ones,

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:56.262 align:middle line:90%
and the active and outspoken.

00:22:56.262 --> 00:22:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Earth is receiving
tremendous aid

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:01.470 align:middle line:84%
in shifting its
paradigm of reality

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:04.140 align:middle line:84%
from an overly
constricted view based

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:10.352 align:middle line:84%
in fear to one that calls us
back to our angelic resonance.

00:23:10.352 --> 00:23:11.310 align:middle line:90%
And that was the dream.

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:14.730 align:middle line:90%


00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:19.440 align:middle line:90%
So these connections continue.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.710 align:middle line:84%
There are many different kinds
of these encounter experiences.

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:29.882 align:middle line:84%
And all I want to say is that
this is the way it came to me.

00:23:29.882 --> 00:23:31.590 align:middle line:84%
What happened in the
encounter experience

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:34.940 align:middle line:84%
was that I was on a
meditation retreat

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.630 align:middle line:84%
in the Southern California
desert participating

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:42.490 align:middle line:84%
in the second part of an
ancient mystery school retreat.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:46.770 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's important
to acknowledge the context.

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:48.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to say that
there's a cause effect

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:49.990 align:middle line:90%
relation.

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:53.230 align:middle line:84%
But I'm trying to say that
I was in a field phenomenon.

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:59.110 align:middle line:84%
I had been doing meditation
on all the chakras

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:03.545 align:middle line:84%
in a fairly intensive setting
with a group for 12 days.

00:24:03.545 --> 00:24:06.440 align:middle line:90%


00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:10.420 align:middle line:84%
We'd done many
ceremonies and rituals.

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And the conference was over and
I was living on the East Coast

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:19.130 align:middle line:84%
at that time and I was going
to fly back the next day.

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And a friend and I said,
well, you know, why don't we

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.280 align:middle line:84%
go up the mountain over Palm
Springs and look at the view

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.880 align:middle line:90%
below?

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And so the two of
us got in the car

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:35.580 align:middle line:84%
and we started driving
up the mountain.

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.650 align:middle line:84%
We'd had dinner
with a group of us.

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:43.727 align:middle line:84%
And it was probably about
8:00 in the evening.

00:24:43.727 --> 00:24:44.560 align:middle line:90%
Something like that.

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.190 align:middle line:84%
It was still light
when we started anyway.

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:49.420 align:middle line:84%
So we began to make
our way up one of them

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:53.050 align:middle line:84%
beautiful mountains
surrounding Palm Springs.

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:59.054 align:middle line:84%
And there were two features
about the actual journey

00:24:59.054 --> 00:24:59.720 align:middle line:90%
up the mountain.

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:05.370 align:middle line:84%
One was that it was an
incredibly blustery evening.

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:10.190 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of wind
sort of bashing the car.

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
was that there

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:17.110 align:middle line:84%
was a lot of traffic on
the road up and down.

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:19.280 align:middle line:84%
So we got near the top
and it was already dark.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And so we said, well,
let's just get off

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:25.930 align:middle line:90%
of this view parking lot thing.

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And so we parked the
car and we looked out

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:37.210 align:middle line:84%
from the mountain down towards
the town, the lights below.

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:40.530 align:middle line:84%
But it was so cold and
windy that we said, well,

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:43.532 align:middle line:84%
don't let's hang around
and we'll go back down.

00:25:43.532 --> 00:25:49.500 align:middle line:84%
At which point my companion
turned back towards the car

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:55.470 align:middle line:84%
and he suddenly
noticed this what

00:25:55.470 --> 00:26:02.855 align:middle line:84%
seemed like a stationary object
off the side of the mountain.

00:26:02.855 --> 00:26:06.350 align:middle line:90%


00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And it had these
circulating colored lights

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.880 align:middle line:90%
on its underbelly.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And that was really only
the part that we could see.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:21.670 align:middle line:84%
So I don't really know what the
shape of whatever this was was.

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:24.490 align:middle line:84%
But he saw him and he said,
looking at it like this,

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:28.580 align:middle line:84%
he said, well, what
do you think that is?

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:33.670 align:middle line:84%
So I followed his gaze and I
turned to where he was looking.

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, an
extraordinary thing happened.

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:46.200 align:middle line:84%
The whole landscape
suddenly shifted

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.890 align:middle line:84%
into a completely
different dimension.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:52.650 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way
I can describe it.

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:55.400 align:middle line:90%


00:26:55.400 --> 00:27:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Our feet were still planted
on the same geographical spot.

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:04.200 align:middle line:84%
But the wind
completely disappeared

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and the entire traffic
completely disappeared.

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:12.900 align:middle line:84%
What happened was
the landscape became

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:16.180 align:middle line:90%
illumined by a sort of moon.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:20.190 align:middle line:84%
If I were to try to describe
it, it was a kind of moonscape,

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:25.550 align:middle line:84%
as if a light source you didn't
know illuminated the land

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:28.360 align:middle line:90%
that we were on.

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:34.810 align:middle line:84%
But as I say, it was moved into
a profound kind of stillness.

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And the wind and traffic
were no longer present.

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:47.360 align:middle line:84%
There was this union of the
timeless with the time bound.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.830 align:middle line:84%
As if fully knowledgeable
of my own presence,

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:53.470 align:middle line:84%
but in communion
with something that

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:56.660 align:middle line:90%
was eternal and transcendent.

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.480 align:middle line:90%


00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:08.080 align:middle line:84%
The other feeling
was one of a kind

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:13.470 align:middle line:84%
of benign, compassionate,
loving presence.

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:18.530 align:middle line:90%


00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:23.990 align:middle line:84%
I think we are being called
increasingly to the center that

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.565 align:middle line:90%
is the heart.

00:28:24.565 --> 00:28:29.070 align:middle line:90%


00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:34.434 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
long that event took.

00:28:34.434 --> 00:28:35.850 align:middle line:84%
When I say to
people I don't know,

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:38.010 align:middle line:84%
I can only say it seemed
like about two minutes.

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Even that may be
longer than it was.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:51.080 align:middle line:84%
But when that window,
whatever it was, closed,

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:53.910 align:middle line:84%
the wind came back
with full force

00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:56.066 align:middle line:84%
and the traffic was
again on the road

00:28:56.066 --> 00:28:57.190 align:middle line:90%
going up and down the road.

00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:01.230 align:middle line:90%


00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:04.775 align:middle line:84%
It was an extraordinarily
awesome experiences.

00:29:04.775 --> 00:29:08.070 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way
I know how to say it.

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:11.080 align:middle line:84%
We got back in the car
and we drove down and back

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:15.150 align:middle line:84%
to the house that
we were guests in.

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:19.790 align:middle line:90%
And two things about that.

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:25.180 align:middle line:84%
One, everybody was
in bed and asleep.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.874 align:middle line:90%
It was 2 o'clock in the morning.

00:29:27.874 --> 00:29:29.290 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize
that at the time.

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:31.040 align:middle line:84%
It was actually only
later that I suddenly

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:35.470 align:middle line:84%
realized, well, what happened
between about nine and two?

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:38.860 align:middle line:84%
The other thing was that
when I went into the bathroom

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:42.900 align:middle line:84%
and looked in the mirror,
I had light radiating off

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:48.560 align:middle line:84%
a rainbow kind of aura
radiating off my form.

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:51.660 align:middle line:90%


00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:53.620 align:middle line:84%
When I went back
to the East Coast,

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:58.530 align:middle line:84%
I didn't tell a couple of
people about this experience.

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:01.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry to say that I've been
a Jungian therapist for about

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:06.220 align:middle line:84%
20 years and have worked
a lot with dreams.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.201 align:middle line:84%
It's almost impossible, I hope
I'm not offending anybody here.

00:30:09.201 --> 00:30:10.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure there are exceptions.

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:14.740 align:middle line:84%
But what was sad to me was
that this experience could not

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.180 align:middle line:84%
be valued for the actual
ontological reality

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:18.640 align:middle line:90%
that it had.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.760 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if I'd reported
this experience as a dream,

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:24.340 align:middle line:84%
it would have been
much more acceptable.

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Because with dreams, particular
in the Jungian tradition,

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:32.585 align:middle line:84%
you appreciate dreams for
their symbolic as if resonance.

00:30:32.585 --> 00:30:37.040 align:middle line:90%


00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:39.960 align:middle line:84%
But it's as if it's not OK to
have a really real experience,

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:44.275 align:middle line:84%
even though these experiences
are not of the ordinary world.

00:30:44.275 --> 00:30:47.290 align:middle line:90%


00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, they're
not interior experiences.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
that's happening inside.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:55.780 align:middle line:84%
It is actually a movement
to a new outside,

00:30:55.780 --> 00:31:01.170 align:middle line:84%
but the outside is not
that of ordinary reality.

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Like John, I feel
that there's a kind

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:14.280 align:middle line:84%
of perennial ancient mystic,
gnostic, alchemical gnosis that

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:19.320 align:middle line:84%
before our time, our time being
the last 400 or 500 years,

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:23.710 align:middle line:84%
knew these states of being
and highly valued them.

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:26.070 align:middle line:84%
For example, in
the Sufi tradition

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:28.050 align:middle line:84%
it's called the
mundus imaginalis.

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:31.550 align:middle line:84%
A third ontological
realm between pure spirit

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:33.370 align:middle line:90%
and the sensory world.

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:37.035 align:middle line:84%
And in alchemy, of course,
it has other names too.

00:31:37.035 --> 00:31:39.450 align:middle line:90%
The imaginatio verit.

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And that was distinguished
from fantasy.

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:46.280 align:middle line:84%
It was a world that was in
between matter and spirit,

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:49.650 align:middle line:84%
a subtle body realm but
they are constructed

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:54.140 align:middle line:84%
by unconditional
cosmic compassion.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:32:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And the other is that
they're landscapes

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:01.980 align:middle line:90%
of tremendous beauty.

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Beauty being also a value
that we have lost, I think,

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:07.160 align:middle line:90%
in our time.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And they carry enormous
emotional and healing powers.

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I think is
being recovered in our time.

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:20.566 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:32:20.566 --> 00:32:23.542 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:23.542 --> 00:32:29.000 align:middle line:90%


00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>>I wanted to mention something
that's coming up in my work

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:39.410 align:middle line:84%
now, which is the
sort of frontier edge.

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:43.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm reading about
and seeing in my work

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:45.130 align:middle line:84%
people that are
having experiences

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:48.640 align:middle line:90%
with so-called reptilian beings.

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And these experiences vary
from sexual encounters

00:32:54.900 --> 00:33:01.190 align:middle line:84%
to violent encounters
even to people

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:04.190 align:middle line:90%
being devoured by these beings.

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:07.880 align:middle line:84%
But whatever the experiences
are, they are powerful

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:11.640 align:middle line:84%
and they are primal
and they are very real.

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And it occurred to me while
I was thinking about this,

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:26.540 align:middle line:84%
the original or first epic
in the English language

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:28.600 align:middle line:90%
was "Beowulf."

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And what "Beowulf" is
about, if you recall,

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:37.860 align:middle line:84%
is the heroic figure
there wrestles

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:40.780 align:middle line:84%
with a dragon by
the name of Grendel

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:45.410 align:middle line:84%
and later with his mother,
which hardly needs interpreting.

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:50.240 align:middle line:90%
And he drowns in the water.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.460 align:middle line:84%
The son, Grendel, he
just crunches and crushes

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:56.480 align:middle line:90%
in a great battle.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.820 align:middle line:84%
It made me think what
connection there might be.

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:00.360 align:middle line:90%
And this is speculative.

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.640 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't do this
anyplace but here.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:06.770 align:middle line:84%
But what connection
is there with the fact

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:11.909 align:middle line:84%
that our first epic is a battle
between a reptilian dragon

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:17.110 align:middle line:90%
being and a heroic human?

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And to me those battles
are very similar to what

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:22.860 align:middle line:84%
I hear about in the whole
reptilian struggle of some

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:25.210 align:middle line:90%
of the abduction experiences.

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:27.580 align:middle line:84%
So I thought two
things about this.

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:31.560 align:middle line:84%
One is there's some aspect
of our own primal reptilian

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:36.170 align:middle line:84%
phylogenetically carried
nature that we have not

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:37.090 align:middle line:90%
come to terms with.

00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And right in that
first epic, we're

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.909 align:middle line:84%
projecting it
outside of ourselves

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:43.820 align:middle line:90%
and then destroying it.

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:47.239 align:middle line:84%
So there's sort of a more
somewhat standard return

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:50.250 align:middle line:84%
of the repressed phenomenon
there to be integrated

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:52.170 align:middle line:90%
and dealt with.

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:54.460 align:middle line:90%
But that doesn't quite do it.

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:56.719 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's important
and that's part of it.

00:34:56.719 --> 00:35:01.065 align:middle line:84%
But the other part of it is
that these beings are not simply

00:35:01.065 --> 00:35:01.565 align:middle line:90%
projections.

00:35:01.565 --> 00:35:05.340 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we have
this anthropocentric notion

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:08.240 align:middle line:84%
coming down through
psychology and psychiatry

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:11.420 align:middle line:84%
that these mythic
entities are simply

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.360 align:middle line:84%
projections of our
own unconscious,

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.820 align:middle line:90%
mythic or otherwise.

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And we don't credit the fact
that the universe may actually

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:22.230 align:middle line:84%
contain beings of this
kind that reach us

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:23.300 align:middle line:90%
from another dimension.

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:27.210 align:middle line:84%
That's more disturbing
to our world view.

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:31.300 align:middle line:84%
But I think the last
thing about that

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.550 align:middle line:84%
that came up just
a few days ago when

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:36.780 align:middle line:84%
I was working with a woman
who was having reptilian

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:40.120 align:middle line:84%
encounters that for her were
highly negative involving

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:45.309 align:middle line:84%
the devouring of babies and
terrible filth and terror.

00:35:45.309 --> 00:35:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And she said something at
the end of the session,

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:50.330 align:middle line:84%
because she became much calmer
as we integrated some very

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:52.090 align:middle line:90%
disturbing experiences.

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:56.390 align:middle line:84%
She said, you think that if
we put out negative energy,

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:59.160 align:middle line:84%
it attracts negative
experiences?

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.670 align:middle line:90%
And that fit her very well.

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Because she was a
person full of anger,

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:05.131 align:middle line:90%
trying to move beyond anger.

00:36:05.131 --> 00:36:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's doesn't
mean this, again,

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:08.490 align:middle line:84%
was a projection
of our own psyche.

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:12.090 align:middle line:84%
But in some way,
the relationship,

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:15.000 align:middle line:84%
the connection in
consciousness between her

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.954 align:middle line:84%
and whatever was coming
to her made sense.

00:36:16.954 --> 00:36:18.870 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it was
the kind of experiences

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:20.520 align:middle line:90%
that you would expect.

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.310 align:middle line:84%
I see Veronica as
somebody who would

00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:24.440 align:middle line:84%
be more likely to be
having experiences

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:28.540 align:middle line:84%
of love and enlightenment
of a different kind.

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think that may be
related, this is speculative,

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:33.550 align:middle line:90%
of the energy that she puts out.

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:36.950 align:middle line:84%
I know that Stan Grof
came here and is here

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:39.020 align:middle line:90%
and I want to acknowledge Stan.

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:42.300 align:middle line:84%
I always acknowledge this with
a little bit of mixed feelings.

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.300 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:47.546 align:middle line:90%


00:36:47.546 --> 00:36:50.220 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, I'm
deeply grateful to him

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:53.400 align:middle line:84%
because I learned about
nonordinary experiences

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:56.450 align:middle line:84%
as I never had before
during the training with him

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:58.350 align:middle line:84%
and working with
him over the years.

00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:03.320 align:middle line:84%
The slight sort of
downward slope on this

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:08.757 align:middle line:84%
is that he got me into this work
with the abduction phenomenon.

00:37:08.757 --> 00:37:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Because in the middle of
the training, for reasons

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.490 align:middle line:84%
I've really never asked
him why he did this,

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:17.630 align:middle line:84%
he handed me a paper in a book
on spiritual emergencies, which

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:22.080 align:middle line:84%
was about the UFO
encounter phenomenon.

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And I kept asking myself
after I read it, OK, this

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:27.680 align:middle line:84%
is kind of Jungian
interpretation of it.

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And I kept asking myself, yeah,
but is it really happening?

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:33.070 align:middle line:90%
Is it real?

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:38.887 align:middle line:84%
And within a few months I
began to see cases and sort

00:37:38.887 --> 00:37:40.860 align:middle line:90%
of totally changed my life.

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:44.240 align:middle line:90%
And so for good or ill.

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:47.200 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, thank you
in a way, Stan.

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.290 align:middle line:90%


00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>>Dr. Mack, have
made any comparisons

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:56.370 align:middle line:84%
between the
contactee experiences

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:58.540 align:middle line:84%
and the ever increasing
number of those

00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:00.950 align:middle line:84%
that claim to be the victim
of some kind of mind control

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:02.050 align:middle line:90%
technology?

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>That's another
frontier in this field.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Somebody did a study at
McCarthy in New Jersey.

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Something like 40% of people
that are reporting mind control

00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:20.620 align:middle line:84%
experiments, when they were
studied in greater depth,

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:23.280 align:middle line:90%
are abductees.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And there is a whole
complex of phenomenon

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:30.950 align:middle line:84%
which seem to be
interrelated, which

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:35.085 align:middle line:84%
is a kind of dark
frontier in this.

00:38:35.085 --> 00:38:36.710 align:middle line:84%
By the way, speaking
of dark frontiers,

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:39.000 align:middle line:84%
did you happen to notice
the cartoon in the latest

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Newsweek which shows a
Darth Vader figure tapping

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Rumsfeld, the Secretary
of Defense Rumsfeld,

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.090 align:middle line:84%
looms over him to
start tapping him.

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying to him,
"I am your father."

00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:59.218 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:59.218 --> 00:39:00.527 align:middle line:90%


00:39:00.527 --> 00:39:01.360 align:middle line:90%
The latest Newsweek.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:04.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're
catching on out there.

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, the whole
militarization of space

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:09.735 align:middle line:84%
deserves some discussion in
terms of the dark energies.

00:39:09.735 --> 00:39:12.510 align:middle line:90%


00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:17.034 align:middle line:84%
So you take the
military abduction.

00:39:17.034 --> 00:39:18.450 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
controversial area.

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:22.580 align:middle line:84%
Some people report
that aliens and they've

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:25.180 align:middle line:84%
seen aliens and military
people working together

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:27.310 align:middle line:90%
in underground bases.

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Other people report the NSA is
doing all kinds of mind control

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:33.340 align:middle line:84%
experiments on the abductees
or they meet the abductees

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:39.090 align:middle line:84%
when they come out of the
ships and there they are.

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And this may be related
to the nonordinary state

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:48.290 align:middle line:84%
work I've done, but I tend
to see this not necessarily

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:50.540 align:middle line:90%
entirely literally.

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:55.950 align:middle line:84%
More as some kind of archetypal
expression of the shadow

00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:58.390 align:middle line:90%
side of our whole being.

00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:03.140 align:middle line:84%
Where the whole military complex
represents that shadow and is

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:06.110 align:middle line:84%
emergent with the abduction
phenomenon in some way.

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:10.510 align:middle line:84%
Not that there isn't a lot of
destructive stuff going on.

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:13.470 align:middle line:84%
But when it's connected with
the abduction phenomenon,

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:15.500 align:middle line:84%
I tend not to take it
entirely literally.

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:17.550 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know.

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:20.314 align:middle line:90%
So it's a scary area.

00:40:20.314 --> 00:40:22.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've stayed away
from it in some ways.

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:23.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's an
area where people

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:25.168 align:middle line:84%
have done this
research have gotten

00:40:25.168 --> 00:40:32.360 align:middle line:84%
into disappeared mysteriously
or gotten-- I don't know.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:34.220 align:middle line:90%
I don't even want to.

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:38.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a very disturbing subject.

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>>Veronica.

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:40.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm curious.

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Your companion that
night, you said

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.985 align:middle line:84%
you were with someone when
you had that experience.

00:40:44.985 --> 00:40:45.740 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>What was your
companion's experience?

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, we both experienced
the phenomenon of the landscape

00:40:56.970 --> 00:41:00.750 align:middle line:84%
shifting, the light shifting,
the wind, the traffic

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:08.780 align:middle line:84%
disappearing and
the pathway that

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:11.740 align:middle line:84%
was opened up between
where we were standing

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:16.190 align:middle line:90%
and the object in the sky.

00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:19.167 align:middle line:90%


00:41:19.167 --> 00:41:21.750 align:middle line:84%
We talked on the phone from time
to time about this experience

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:26.617 align:middle line:84%
because it was so unlike
anything either of us

00:41:26.617 --> 00:41:27.283 align:middle line:90%
had experienced.

00:41:27.283 --> 00:41:31.310 align:middle line:90%


00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:37.290 align:middle line:84%
When I did the recovery of
missing time, all I can say

00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:42.630 align:middle line:84%
is that I don't claim that
what came through when

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:51.170 align:middle line:84%
I did go to recover
that period of time

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:52.600 align:middle line:84%
that it should be
taken literally.

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:54.058 align:middle line:84%
All I can say is
that what happened

00:41:54.058 --> 00:41:58.000 align:middle line:84%
was so beyond anything that
I could have anticipated

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:58.500 align:middle line:90%
would occur.

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:05.330 align:middle line:90%


00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:10.080 align:middle line:84%
He did not accompany
me onto the,

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:14.040 align:middle line:84%
for want of a better
word, vessel or ship.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.622 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know about
that part of it for him.

00:42:16.622 --> 00:42:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was actually
rather terrifying for him

00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:23.685 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't really want
to go into it anymore.

00:42:23.685 --> 00:42:26.230 align:middle line:90%


00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:29.560 align:middle line:84%
So I think the
content of that part

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:32.330 align:middle line:90%
was probably very different.

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:35.570 align:middle line:84%
I did want to say just very
briefly about this dark aspect.

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:37.890 align:middle line:84%
I think if you look at all
the religious traditions

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:40.310 align:middle line:84%
of the world, and
then I'll stick

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:44.135 align:middle line:84%
in mystical traditions, the
element of the dark night

00:42:44.135 --> 00:42:50.500 align:middle line:90%
of the soul or the black sun.

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:53.980 align:middle line:84%
There are these connections
between the dark

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:56.140 align:middle line:84%
and the light in all
mystical traditions.

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And that is part
of any analysis.

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:02.580 align:middle line:84%
It's part of a
spiritual journey.

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Facing the dark
aspects are extremely

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:12.010 align:middle line:84%
important for the development of
self knowledge and the journey

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:13.696 align:middle line:90%
to the divine.

00:43:13.696 --> 00:43:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's become part
of also the UFO experience.

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:24.360 align:middle line:84%
>>Dr. Mack, in your experience
of using past life regression

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:28.220 align:middle line:84%
with people, how far
back have you taken them

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:34.410 align:middle line:84%
and how far back to have people
had reptilian experiences?

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>>I don't take people into past
life regression experiences.

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:40.390 align:middle line:90%
They just happen.

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:41.940 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
ask the question.

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:44.760 align:middle line:84%
In other words, somebody's
in a relaxation session.

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:46.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't even use
the word hypnosis

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:47.915 align:middle line:84%
because of all the
baggage it has.

00:43:47.915 --> 00:43:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Somebody puts their
head back and relaxes

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:52.967 align:middle line:90%
and they go onto a trance.

00:43:52.967 --> 00:43:54.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't even call
that trance anymore,

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:56.770 align:middle line:84%
because I think what we
call normal reality is

00:43:56.770 --> 00:44:00.140 align:middle line:90%
the real trance now.

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:05.540 align:middle line:84%
But they'll say something
like, oh god, I'm here again.

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:07.450 align:middle line:90%
That means they've been born.

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can ignore
that and say, what's

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:11.440 align:middle line:90%
it like being here again?

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:14.150 align:middle line:90%
Or I can say, again?

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.890 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll go into
a past life experience.

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:21.350 align:middle line:84%
But it's not like I go back,
back, back, back, back.

00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:27.010 align:middle line:84%
One woman I work
with immediately

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:29.860 align:middle line:84%
associated to an
experience which occurred

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:33.100 align:middle line:90%
when she was in ancient India.

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Must've been 5,000
years ago where

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:39.440 align:middle line:84%
she was born into
a very poor family

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:43.910 align:middle line:84%
and her soul was present at
the moment of conception.

00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And this was where in her
soul's journey she needed to be

00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:52.162 align:middle line:84%
was to be in this most
primitive humiliating,

00:44:52.162 --> 00:44:53.970 align:middle line:84%
humiliating in the
sense of simple,

00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:56.610 align:middle line:90%
kind of unpretentious life.

00:44:56.610 --> 00:44:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And it does seem that
abduction experiences,

00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:02.610 align:middle line:84%
and maybe it's just
because my own,

00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:05.460 align:middle line:84%
having gone that route,
I'm open to anything.

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:08.470 align:middle line:84%
So I get to hear about
past life experiences.

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:14.950 align:middle line:84%
It may not be that abductees
are particularly prone to that.

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:17.330 align:middle line:84%
Although it does
seem that they are

00:45:17.330 --> 00:45:20.320 align:middle line:84%
open to nonordinary
states of consciousness

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:21.380 align:middle line:90%
by their experiences.

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And then they readily recall
past life experiences.

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:29.610 align:middle line:84%
The furthest back
was a man that I

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:33.230 align:middle line:84%
wrote about in my first
book on abduction who

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:36.560 align:middle line:84%
actually found himself back
in the time the dinosaurs.

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And again, this
reptilian consciousness

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:42.160 align:middle line:84%
which kept knocking
on my door began then.

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.570 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't think
much about it.

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And now it's become something
that I think about and hear

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.040 align:middle line:90%
about a lot.

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
related to what Veronica

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:52.520 align:middle line:84%
was saying about the shadow
side or the dark side

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:53.440 align:middle line:90%
of our natures.

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:56.140 align:middle line:90%
The unintegrated reptilian.

00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:59.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to give
reptiles a bad rap here.

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:02.790 align:middle line:84%
It's something more to do
with the most primal parts

00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:05.970 align:middle line:84%
of our inner being
that we haven't

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:11.760 align:middle line:84%
come to terms with in our
socialization process.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Mack, you mentioned earlier
about "Beowulf" and dragons.

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that many of our
ancient folk tales and fairy

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:24.700 align:middle line:84%
tales are actually based on
true experiences of people

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:28.060 align:middle line:84%
having such experiences
with reptilian figures

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:31.770 align:middle line:84%
or visiting other
worlds, other realities,

00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:35.210 align:middle line:84%
opening a magical door, going
into another reality then

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:38.000 align:middle line:84%
returning to this world
with new enlightenment?

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Even something as recent
as "Alice in Wonderland."

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>>I think that's a
wonderful question.

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:47.330 align:middle line:90%
I don't know the answer.

00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:52.620 align:middle line:84%
I think there's some kind
of energetic or connected

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:58.160 align:middle line:84%
systemic relationship between
these creatures, monsters,

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:01.390 align:middle line:84%
reptiles, whatever, that
appear in fairy tales and myths

00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:03.010 align:middle line:84%
that are both part
of our psyches

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:05.900 align:middle line:84%
but also have some kind
of ontological validity

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:12.550 align:middle line:84%
outside of ourselves and that
we have yet to integrate.

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, for example, the
whole Godzilla type series

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:21.490 align:middle line:84%
of movies which began
in Japan, interestingly,

00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:24.510 align:middle line:90%
after the atomic bomb went off.

00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And these creatures
presumably were originally

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:32.720 align:middle line:84%
kind of mutations that turned
reptilian monsters after what

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:35.730 align:middle line:90%
we did in using the atomic bomb.

00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, we have all these
very popular monster alien

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:44.620 align:middle line:84%
movies, which are kind of
these horrible reptilian

00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:48.050 align:middle line:84%
like creatures with
sticky bodies and tails.

00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And this is part of our whole
world that we have not really,

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.740 align:middle line:84%
we're scared of it,
but we haven't seen it

00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:57.100 align:middle line:90%
as something of ourselves.

00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it's very
much related to the violence

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:03.696 align:middle line:84%
we perpetrate by not
owning this and coming

00:48:03.696 --> 00:48:05.445 align:middle line:84%
to terms with this
dimension of ourselves.

00:48:05.445 --> 00:48:08.820 align:middle line:90%


00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>>It's clear from
your work and others

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:14.460 align:middle line:84%
that people are having
alien abduction experiences.

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:17.640 align:middle line:84%
In current times people
have experiences with things

00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:19.640 align:middle line:90%
that look like flying saucers.

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:23.210 align:middle line:84%
In the previous century,
people had experiences

00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:26.160 align:middle line:84%
with things that looked like
dirigibles before the word

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:27.380 align:middle line:90%
dirigibles.

00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:32.700 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to ask you whether you
believe these experiences are

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:36.120 align:middle line:84%
endogenous, coming out of
the person's subconscious

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:40.480 align:middle line:84%
processes, or whether the
aliens they're experiencing

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:45.800 align:middle line:84%
are independent creatures
with their own alien agenda

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:50.170 align:middle line:84%
independent of us, or
something entirely different.

00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>Well the simplest
answer is both.

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:56.120 align:middle line:84%
I believe that they have
an ontological status which

00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:59.650 align:middle line:84%
we don't understand, which
is in part archetypal

00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:03.220 align:middle line:84%
and a reflection of our own
unconscious in the way Jung

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:04.000 align:middle line:90%
talked about it.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.340 align:middle line:84%
I also believe but in the
sense of William James

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:08.950 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
true provoker here.

00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:14.300 align:middle line:84%
That there is a physical reality
that comes to us from outside.

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And this has to do, I think,
with what Richard Tarnas

00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:20.370 align:middle line:84%
and Stan and others have
written about that we have

00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:24.190 align:middle line:84%
systematically in our
anthropocentric humanism

00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:27.070 align:middle line:84%
voided the cosmos of
all intelligence other

00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:29.660 align:middle line:84%
than that which is a
projection of our own minds.

00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And that is it
catastrophe in itself

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:34.860 align:middle line:84%
and has left us, as
Rick Tarnas says,

00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:37.230 align:middle line:84%
in a terrible state
of mourning and grief.

00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Because we have in
that process completely

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:43.800 align:middle line:84%
rid the universe, not only of
all intelligent and beings,

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:45.620 align:middle line:90%
with god itself.

00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:49.330 align:middle line:84%
So here we are
completely alone and

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:54.740 align:middle line:84%
unrelated beyond our immediate
material circumstances.

00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:58.300 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned Professor
Nasr, Seyyed Nasr.

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And in several of the
books of his I read,

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:05.160 align:middle line:84%
the thesis is that by
restricting our consciousness,

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:07.810 align:middle line:84%
our epistemology to
the material world,

00:50:07.810 --> 00:50:11.080 align:middle line:84%
to cutting ourselves
off from the divine,

00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:15.930 align:middle line:84%
we have thereby
allowed ourselves

00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:19.460 align:middle line:84%
to become these destructive
agent in the cosmos.

00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:23.630 align:middle line:84%
What I mentioned, these
rednecks in the universe.

00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:26.930 align:middle line:90%
And that we're not accountable.

00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:31.469 align:middle line:84%
We're not accountable to any
kind of spiritual hierarchy.

00:50:31.469 --> 00:50:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me the
most important thing

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:35.990 align:middle line:84%
about these experiences,
and my thoughts about this,

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:38.900 align:middle line:84%
I like the question,
but it keeps evolving.

00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Right now I think that the
most important aspect of it

00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:46.600 align:middle line:84%
is if we can legitimize
the experiences of people

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:48.830 align:middle line:84%
like Veronica, the most
important aspect of it

00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:51.910 align:middle line:84%
is that we are
learning something.

00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:53.280 align:middle line:90%
We are being told something.

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.090 align:middle line:84%
We have been given
vital information

00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:57.510 align:middle line:84%
about what we're doing to
the earth, about what we're

00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:59.580 align:middle line:84%
doing to ourselves,
to one another,

00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:02.260 align:middle line:90%
and that it's a wake up.

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:04.820 align:middle line:90%
It's an attempt to wake us up.

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:07.490 align:middle line:90%
And we are aware of this trance.

00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:09.430 align:middle line:84%
I live with an
eight-year-old child.

00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:11.260 align:middle line:84%
So I get to see a lot
of children's movies

00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:13.560 align:middle line:84%
that I wouldn't probably
otherwise go to see.

00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:17.640 align:middle line:84%
So I went to see with him
"Rocky and Bullwinkle."

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:20.460 align:middle line:84%
How many of you have seen
it, "Rocky and Bullwinkle."

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:22.420 align:middle line:90%
Anyone at all?

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:23.110 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter.

00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:27.750 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, what that's about is
that this fearless leader,

00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:30.070 align:middle line:84%
this bad guy, well he was
actually in a TV series

00:51:30.070 --> 00:51:33.310 align:middle line:84%
in the '60s as kind
of a Nazi character

00:51:33.310 --> 00:51:34.320 align:middle line:90%
called Fearless Leader.

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And he's got to
Russian accomplices.

00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And he's taking over the
country and presumably the world

00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:42.950 align:middle line:90%
eventually through our RBTV.

00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Now RBTV is Really
Bad Television.

00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:52.640 align:middle line:84%
What he does is he broadcasts
nonstop these soporific

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:53.240 align:middle line:90%
programs.

00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:56.440 align:middle line:84%
This sort of sterile
marketing of him

00:51:56.440 --> 00:52:01.247 align:middle line:84%
and all the empty products
and meaningless stuff,

00:52:01.247 --> 00:52:02.830 align:middle line:84%
which of course is
very much like what

00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:05.240 align:middle line:90%
we're getting for real now.

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:08.381 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's kind
of like zombies.

00:52:08.381 --> 00:52:10.880 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what to do and
they're going to vote for him

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.390 align:middle line:90%
and make him president.

00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:16.390 align:middle line:84%
So Bullwinkle, using
the latest technology,

00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:19.580 align:middle line:84%
gets sent by email
into the studio

00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:23.180 align:middle line:84%
and emerges from the
fax machine just in time

00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:25.890 align:middle line:84%
to break up the
television equipment.

00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And as he does so, blows up
the television equipment,

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:34.044 align:middle line:84%
they can't hear Fearless
Leader's voice anymore.

00:52:34.044 --> 00:52:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And they all begin to
wake up from the trance.

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:37.500 align:middle line:90%
You see them in the movie.

00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And then they begin to
think for themselves.

00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:44.470 align:middle line:84%
So somehow I see this
phenomenon as like that.

00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:45.440 align:middle line:90%
As a wake up.

00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:48.650 align:middle line:90%
Trying to get through to us.

00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:51.700 align:middle line:84%
We're cut off of through
this RBTV and the like

00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:55.440 align:middle line:84%
from our relationship with
the divine, with spirit.

00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And to get to us, because
we are so cut off,

00:52:59.150 --> 00:53:02.550 align:middle line:84%
it has to get to us in
a form we can recognize.

00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we
don't pay attention

00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:06.860 align:middle line:84%
to esoteric religion
like the Kabbalah

00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:12.110 align:middle line:84%
or all the Sufi truth or
even Seyyed Nasr's incredibly

00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:15.290 align:middle line:84%
eloquent words
because we are not

00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:18.740 align:middle line:84%
engaged in the practice
of knowing the divine.

00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:21.540 align:middle line:84%
So it has to take a
form we can recognize.

00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:25.122 align:middle line:84%
UFOs and spaceships
and this kind of thing.

00:53:25.122 --> 00:53:26.205 align:middle line:90%
Not that they're not real.

00:53:26.205 --> 00:53:28.509 align:middle line:84%
They've been around
for centuries.

00:53:28.509 --> 00:53:30.050 align:middle line:84%
There's pictures
from the Renaissance

00:53:30.050 --> 00:53:33.810 align:middle line:84%
which shows UFOs in
Renaissance paintings.

00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:36.090 align:middle line:84%
But it's hard to interpret
some of these things.

00:53:36.090 --> 00:53:39.130 align:middle line:84%
But it's now that
phenomena like this

00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:43.230 align:middle line:84%
are coming to us as
if a kind of return

00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:45.930 align:middle line:84%
of the repressed from the
cosmos through the spiritually

00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:46.610 align:middle line:90%
impaired.

00:53:46.610 --> 00:53:49.480 align:middle line:90%
It's a crashing through.

00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the experiences
are receiving this information

00:53:57.190 --> 00:54:00.950 align:middle line:84%
like in this way that is so
profoundly transformative,

00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:02.540 align:middle line:90%
as Veronica was talking about.

00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the most
important aspect of it.

00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is the thing I wanted
to really emphasize and close

00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:18.950 align:middle line:84%
with is that we have
work to do in developing

00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:22.517 align:middle line:84%
a reliable epistemology
methodology science, whatever

00:54:22.517 --> 00:54:23.350 align:middle line:90%
you want to call it.

00:54:23.350 --> 00:54:24.760 align:middle line:90%
A way of knowing.

00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Because knowing was
originally a sacred act

00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:27.570 align:middle line:90%
for knowing the divine.

00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:30.610 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just about breaking
up pieces of the material world

00:54:30.610 --> 00:54:32.110 align:middle line:84%
and then studying
them in isolation.

00:54:32.110 --> 00:54:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Knowing was about opening
consciousness, soul to who

00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:38.710 align:middle line:90%
we were in a much larger sense.

00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:40.070 align:middle line:90%
And we've lost that.

00:54:40.070 --> 00:54:44.210 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, what I think
this is helping us to do

00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:48.220 align:middle line:84%
is force me to do is
to work on developing

00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:52.090 align:middle line:84%
a sacred science or an
epistemology of the divine

00:54:52.090 --> 00:54:54.200 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it would be.

00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:58.900 align:middle line:84%
So we can begin to legitimate
this kind of a report.

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:01.620 align:middle line:84%
Which tends to get
rejected and ridiculed

00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:04.120 align:middle line:84%
for all kinds of reasons,
because it is threatening,

00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:05.770 align:middle line:90%
and all the reasons you know.

00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:08.260 align:middle line:84%
But there is also
the valid critique

00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:10.420 align:middle line:84%
which is that we
haven't developed

00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:16.280 align:middle line:84%
a reliable, systematic way
of knowing and understanding

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:21.540 align:middle line:84%
these realms from which we
have so separated ourselves.

00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:22.580 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:26.230 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:26.230 --> 00:56:10.237 align:middle line:90%
