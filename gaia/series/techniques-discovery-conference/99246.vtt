00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.364 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the psychiatrists
on the program

00:00:29.364 --> 00:00:31.030 align:middle line:84%
sitting here with me,
I know that you'll

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.370 align:middle line:84%
appreciate the great power,
or whole body experience,

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.060 align:middle line:84%
such as a re-stimulating
experience

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.330 align:middle line:84%
that I had this evening when
I had dinner at the V & T

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Pizzeria across the street--
the place where I ate hundreds

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.600 align:middle line:84%
of meals when I was a
graduate student at Columbia

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.150 align:middle line:84%
University which is also
just across the street.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.579 align:middle line:90%


00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.870 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know what I should
talk about this evening.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And Robin said, well, just
talk about your spiritual path.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.992 align:middle line:84%
So that's a path
that started in 1954.

00:01:01.992 --> 00:01:04.599 align:middle line:84%
I was a graduate
student in physics

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:09.160 align:middle line:84%
with some of the toughest task
masters around-- TD Lee and CS

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Wu and a bunch of other very
difficult and inscrutable

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.030 align:middle line:84%
people that I worked
for for many years.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And somehow over the
ensuing 45 years,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm here today to describe
my path from atomic physicist

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.950 align:middle line:84%
to the mashed potato
you see today.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.320 align:middle line:90%


00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Now I had a chance to
do many different things

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.360 align:middle line:90%
during that career.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.510 align:middle line:84%
I spent half of my time
working on the development

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.810 align:middle line:84%
of the laser, which came out
of my atomic spectroscopy

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.300 align:middle line:84%
at Columbia and half of my time
doing ESP research at Stanford

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Research Institute, where we had
the interesting task of trying

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.610 align:middle line:84%
to increase the reliability and
accuracy of psychic functioning

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.860 align:middle line:84%
and learning to put
government scientists and army

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.640 align:middle line:84%
intelligence officers
in touch with apart

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.020 align:middle line:90%
of themselves that's psychic.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.580 align:middle line:84%
What I learned in my last
job, I was putting lasers

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.030 align:middle line:90%
on airplanes at Lockheed.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.930 align:middle line:90%
I was in aerospace.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And all of this I
discovered, my whole career

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.860 align:middle line:84%
has been in remote sensing,
sometimes with ESP, sometimes

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.510 align:middle line:84%
with lasers, but
always trying to see

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.270 align:middle line:90%
what nobody had seen before.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And in listening to
the discussion tonight,

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.110 align:middle line:84%
it reminds me of
one of the things

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.220 align:middle line:90%
that I noticed in aerospace.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.750 align:middle line:84%
If you're about to put a
sensor on a satellite that's

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.880 align:middle line:84%
getting launched and
everybody at the table agrees,

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.780 align:middle line:84%
it means you've probably
overlooked something.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.970 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to have to be the
person who doesn't entirely

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.820 align:middle line:90%
agree with what we see today.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.560 align:middle line:84%
In a book that I wrote recently,
called "Miracles of Mind,"

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.850 align:middle line:84%
I was talking about
what we know about

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.620 align:middle line:84%
parapsychology, ESP research,
what we know about physics.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.445 align:middle line:84%
And I had a wonderful
quote from Stephen Hawking

00:02:58.445 --> 00:03:01.360 align:middle line:84%
that he wrote in
1985, in which he

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.470 align:middle line:84%
said, "by the end
of this decade,

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.420 align:middle line:84%
we will understand
everything there is

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.960 align:middle line:90%
to know about modern physics."

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Now I had the advantage
of writing this

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.360 align:middle line:90%
10 years later in 1995.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And I sort of
unceremoniously said

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.060 align:middle line:84%
that Stephen better turn the
crank pretty fast because, I

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.100 align:middle line:84%
mean, enormous number of things
on the horizon that were not

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.260 align:middle line:84%
understood and very
unlikely to be understood

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.000 align:middle line:90%
in the next 5, 10, 20 years.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.300 align:middle line:90%
And indeed, they have not been.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.250 align:middle line:84%
With regard to understanding the
nature of the world we live in,

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.230 align:middle line:84%
great progress has
obviously been made.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.260 align:middle line:84%
We can explain with great detail
how the billiard balls move

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.240 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the table.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And even with the uncertainty
in quantum physics,

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.590 align:middle line:84%
we can calculate, to at
least eight decimal figures,

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.260 align:middle line:84%
the wavelength of
an atomic transition

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.830 align:middle line:84%
by subtracting the energy
levels in the published tables.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.300 align:middle line:84%
So atomic physics
works extremely well.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Maxwell's equations
work excellently.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.980 align:middle line:84%
But there are things that
come unraveled at the edge

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.060 align:middle line:84%
of the field, little
threads that you

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.730 align:middle line:84%
tug and notice that things
keep coming unraveled.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.990 align:middle line:84%
One of those in physics
is called "superposition"

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.709 align:middle line:90%
that was alluded to earlier.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Superposition is
this nasty business

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.220 align:middle line:84%
where you have the
cat in the box that's

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.470 align:middle line:90%
neither alive nor dead.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.780 align:middle line:84%
It also pertains to the
even nastier problem

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.520 align:middle line:84%
for people in
optics, who observe

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.100 align:middle line:84%
that when you send photons
through a pair of slits,

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.460 align:middle line:84%
even though there's only
one photon in the apparatus

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.240 align:middle line:84%
at a time, you still
observe interference.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.930 align:middle line:90%
And it's not limited to photons.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.230 align:middle line:84%
It's limited to really big
things, like buckyballs.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.400 align:middle line:84%
A buckyball is 60 carbon
atoms arranged the size

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.250 align:middle line:84%
of a soccer ball or in the
configuration of a soccer ball.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.600 align:middle line:84%
John Clauser, who
was the first person

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.620 align:middle line:84%
to demonstrate
nonlocality, said recently,

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.040 align:middle line:84%
"it looks like you can't keep
anything in a box anymore."

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.590 align:middle line:84%
That is, things that appear to
be separated from one another,

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.320 align:middle line:84%
even in physical reality
appear to interact.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Henry Stapp, who is a
distinguished physicist

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.690 align:middle line:84%
at the University of
California in Berkeley said,

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.150 align:middle line:84%
"possibly the most important
discovery in all of science,

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.200 align:middle line:84%
in the history of science, is
the discovery of nonlocality."

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.345 align:middle line:84%
Nonlocality was this awful
thing that Einstein, Podolsky,

00:05:33.345 --> 00:05:37.930 align:middle line:84%
and Rosen postulated
in 1935, saying

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.620 align:middle line:84%
that, "even photons traveling
away from each other

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.810 align:middle line:84%
at the speed of light are still
in contact with one another.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So that if you polarize
one, you notice

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.840 align:middle line:84%
a change in the
polarization of the other."

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Einstein correctly
predicted that this

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.360 align:middle line:84%
is what was predicted
by quantum mechanics.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.020 align:middle line:84%
He said, therefore, since it
violated special relativity,

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.150 align:middle line:84%
quantum mechanics
couldn't be right.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.270 align:middle line:84%
However, there have
now been a multitude

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.520 align:middle line:84%
of experiments showing that
these twin photons do indeed

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.950 align:middle line:90%
remain connected.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, this
has now been shown

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.720 align:middle line:90%
over many, many kilometers.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.660 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of this
nonlocal connection

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.690 align:middle line:84%
is not a metaphysical
proposition.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Of course, Buddha
in his writings,

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.730 align:middle line:84%
said in many different ways
that separation is an illusion.

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.070 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, that
there is only one of us

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.817 align:middle line:90%
here in consciousness.

00:06:32.817 --> 00:06:34.275 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
we're compassionate.

00:06:34.275 --> 00:06:37.950 align:middle line:84%
We're compassionate because
there is in fact only one of us

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.060 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.930 align:middle line:84%
But when Clauser and
Freedman, or Aspect, or Gisin,

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.650 align:middle line:84%
or the distinguished
physicists around the world

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.610 align:middle line:84%
are looking at the nonlocal
connection between particles,

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.430 align:middle line:84%
they're not thinking about ESP,
metaphysics, or consciousness.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.830 align:middle line:84%
They're thinking about this
very interesting connection

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.950 align:middle line:84%
that they observe in
the physical universe.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's one of the
interesting things

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.540 align:middle line:84%
that's predicted by
quantum theory, observed

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:05.570 align:middle line:90%
in the laboratory.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.370 align:middle line:90%
And that's the good news.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.270 align:middle line:84%
We don't yet have a description
of the space/time in which we

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.120 align:middle line:84%
live that describes the
nature of the metric

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.410 align:middle line:90%
that would give us nonlocality.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.070 align:middle line:84%
In my other career path, we
do have some interesting data

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:27.690 align:middle line:84%
that bears on this that is only
beginning to become described

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:29.830 align:middle line:90%
sensibly by modern physics.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And that is the data for
extrasensory perception.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.720 align:middle line:84%
We know a few things without
a shadow of the doubt.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.660 align:middle line:84%
We know that it's possible
to sit in the laboratory,

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.300 align:middle line:84%
close your eyes,
and quiet your mind,

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.670 align:middle line:84%
and describe with
surprising accuracy what's

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.850 align:middle line:84%
going on in distant
parts of the world.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:53.710 align:middle line:84%
We know that a person can
hold a thought in his mind

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.600 align:middle line:84%
and that thought can
be accurately described

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.340 align:middle line:84%
by another person,
even though there

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:04.960 align:middle line:84%
is no physical, material object
corresponding to that thought.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.777 align:middle line:84%
Even more astonishing is
that we know-- probably

00:08:08.777 --> 00:08:10.610 align:middle line:84%
the most interesting
thing I could tell you,

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.193 align:middle line:84%
if you don't hear
anything that I say,

00:08:12.193 --> 00:08:14.830 align:middle line:84%
if you don't come tomorrow-- the
most interesting thing I could

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:20.290 align:middle line:84%
tell you is that it is no
more difficult to describe

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.140 align:middle line:84%
and experience something
that's going to happen

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.470 align:middle line:84%
in your future-- in your
near future-- that's no more

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:30.340 align:middle line:84%
difficult than to describe
a picture that's face down

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.570 align:middle line:84%
on the table and
hidden from view.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:36.200 align:middle line:84%
That is, our ability
to know the future

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.590 align:middle line:84%
can be made as accurate
and reliable as our ability

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.900 align:middle line:90%
to describe the hidden present.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.850 align:middle line:84%
What that says is not that
there's some magic afoot

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:49.170 align:middle line:84%
but rather that we
profoundly misunderstand

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.350 align:middle line:84%
the nature of the
causality that,

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.680 align:middle line:84%
in fact, underlies
the organizing

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.810 align:middle line:90%
principles of the universe.

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:57.930 align:middle line:84%
There's something fundamentally
with our knowledge

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.470 align:middle line:90%
of causality.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And modern physics has yet
to say the very first word

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.180 align:middle line:84%
about how it is that we
can sit in the laboratory,

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.800 align:middle line:84%
as we did for 20
years, and describe

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.360 align:middle line:84%
what's going on in China,
Soviet Union, Iran hostages.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.310 align:middle line:90%


00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:15.475 align:middle line:90%
That experiment worked.

00:09:15.475 --> 00:09:18.640 align:middle line:84%
That is, we published in the
proceedings of the Engineering

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Society, Nature Magazine,
Academy of Sciences,

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.700 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.380 align:middle line:84%
That is, the ESP side of
this is not metaphysics.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:32.070 align:middle line:84%
We had very tough contract
monitors and NASA, CIA,

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.390 align:middle line:84%
the army-- none of whom
suffer fools gladly.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And if any of you
have ever tried

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.360 align:middle line:84%
to get government
research money,

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.890 align:middle line:84%
you'll appreciate that the
most paranormal part of this

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:47.570 align:middle line:84%
is that we had continued support
for ESP research for 23 years.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.370 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:54.000 align:middle line:84%
So we must have been
doing something right.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Now what I discovered, it's as
though I had a spiritual path.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:03.030 align:middle line:84%
That is, what I'm telling you
is that somehow I started out

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.690 align:middle line:84%
as a research physicist
and had the opportunity,

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.910 align:middle line:84%
through my career, to
metamorphise from a research

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:14.170 align:middle line:84%
physicist to a psychic
spy for the CIA.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And through that path,
I had an opportunity

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.630 align:middle line:84%
to discover that there are
many expansive experiences

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.330 align:middle line:90%
available to us.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.280 align:middle line:84%
The principle of those
is that the observation

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.500 align:middle line:84%
that there is more
going on than simply

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.650 align:middle line:90%
residing in the physical body.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:35.980 align:middle line:84%
That is, we are capable
of expanded awareness

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.540 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to
inflow information

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.940 align:middle line:84%
from distant locations
that is quite verifiable.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.820 align:middle line:90%
And often surprisingly accurate.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:49.910 align:middle line:84%
We can inflow that
information and the distance

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.180 align:middle line:90%
doesn't matter.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:55.710 align:middle line:84%
We can also outflow
our healing intention.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:59.290 align:middle line:84%
We can sit in a laboratory
if we're trained as a healer

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:02.455 align:middle line:84%
and affect the physiology
and the physical outcome

00:11:02.455 --> 00:11:04.680 align:middle line:90%
of people who are very sick.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And that research has been
done in several laboratories,

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.250 align:middle line:84%
including California
Pacific Medical

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Center, where a
recent experiment was

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.770 align:middle line:90%
done with 60 AIDS patients.

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:20.310 align:middle line:84%
30 of them received
healing prayers.

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:23.880 align:middle line:84%
The other 30 were controls
in a double blind study.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.090 align:middle line:84%
So everybody wished that they
were prayed for, of course,

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:29.280 align:middle line:90%
but only 30 actually were.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And those 30 had
significantly improved

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:36.330 align:middle line:84%
outcomes-- fewer opportunistic
illnesses, fewer trips

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.570 align:middle line:90%
to the hospital, and so forth.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And there are now four large
clinical studies published

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.170 align:middle line:90%
in mainline medical magazines.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And in a certain sense, in
the same way that experiments

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:56.040 align:middle line:84%
in nonlocality are the hot
issue in modern physics,

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.510 align:middle line:84%
experiments in distant
healing are the hot issue

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:04.750 align:middle line:84%
in modern medicine, strongly
supported these days by NIH.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, as a physicist,
I would have

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.890 align:middle line:84%
to say that physics does not
have a lot to say, presently,

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:15.570 align:middle line:84%
about either inflowing
information from the distance

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:19.170 align:middle line:84%
or from the future
or outflowing healing

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.600 align:middle line:84%
intention across the
country and affecting,

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:27.280 align:middle line:84%
beneficially, the physical
state of people in the hospital.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And what I observed in my
10 years sitting in the dark

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:36.300 align:middle line:84%
with my eyes shut is that
between this interesting

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:40.790 align:middle line:84%
condition of inflowing
information and outflowing

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:45.720 align:middle line:84%
healing intention, by the
continuity that any physicist

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.040 align:middle line:84%
would know, between the
inflow and the outflow,

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.160 align:middle line:90%
there must be a quiet place.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.200 align:middle line:84%
In that quiet place
we have an opportunity

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.670 align:middle line:84%
to experience the expanded
awareness that precipitates us

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:05.440 align:middle line:84%
into an opportunity to reside
in love, to experience God,

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.440 align:middle line:84%
to have the kind of
oceanic experiences

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.230 align:middle line:90%
the mystics talk about.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And none of this, of course,
requires belief in anything.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.190 align:middle line:90%
None of this is dogma.

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:21.150 align:middle line:84%
It's the path that all mystics
have had which says, basically,

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.140 align:middle line:84%
if you will sit
down and be quiet,

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.580 align:middle line:84%
you will have the
following experience.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.610 align:middle line:84%
It's like a lab report
that we do at Columbia

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:31.860 align:middle line:84%
says that if you will stop
your mental chatter, if you'll

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:36.360 align:middle line:84%
give up your judgment and
your fear and just be quiet,

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.840 align:middle line:84%
we think that
you're going to have

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.340 align:middle line:90%
some interesting experiences.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you go home,
do that for six weeks,

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.270 align:middle line:84%
write it up, and let
us know what you found?

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:46.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very
scientific approach.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.440 align:middle line:84%
There's no conflict
between spirituality

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.920 align:middle line:90%
and a scientific frame of life.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And this experience
of expanded awareness,

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.840 align:middle line:84%
this opportunity to
reside in a loving state,

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:05.300 align:middle line:84%
is the reward for learning
to quit the ongoing chatter

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.370 align:middle line:84%
and especially difficult for
a New Yorker like myself,

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.220 align:middle line:84%
to give up some of my favorite
things like fear and judgment.

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.770 align:middle line:90%


00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.040 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, it turns
out to be worthwhile.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:16.540 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.980 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:27.780 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>>All of us agree that
consciousness exists.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And my question is, is
consciousness a product

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.100 align:middle line:84%
of the physiological
processes of the brain

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:45.050 align:middle line:84%
or a fundamental
aspect of existence?

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>>A slightly easier
way of phrasing it,

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:50.280 align:middle line:84%
instead of talking
about consciousness,

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.310 align:middle line:84%
which is somewhat
of a loose concept,

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:55.290 align:middle line:90%
we might talk about awareness.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, awareness is good,
but Dr. Coker tonight,

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:04.080 align:middle line:84%
was saying in physics that
he accepts consciousness,

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.925 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness is part of
what's going on in physics.

00:15:06.925 --> 00:15:09.110 align:middle line:84%
Now are we talking about
the same thing here?

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.780 align:middle line:84%
Are we talking about the
consciousness of the brain?

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Or are we talking about it
as a fundamental situation

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.260 align:middle line:90%
that exists?

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>Several years ago, I saw
in a bookstore the book

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:23.460 align:middle line:90%
by Francis Crick.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:26.180 align:middle line:84%
It said "The
Astonishing Hypothesis."

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Nobel Prize winning scientist
explains consciousness.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.230 align:middle line:84%
So I said, this is a
book I have to read.

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.110 align:middle line:84%
So I bought the
book, open it up.

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And at the beginning,
he says, well,

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:41.000 align:middle line:84%
let's simplify it a little
to the problem of perception.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And then he gives
pages and pages

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.870 align:middle line:84%
of experiments showing that
when we observe something,

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:50.050 align:middle line:84%
there are changes happening in
the retina-- electric changes,

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.820 align:middle line:90%
biochemical changes.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Then have many, many experiments
showing that things are

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:57.390 align:middle line:90%
happening in the optical track.

00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Again, more electric currents,
more biochemical changes.

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And then finally changes in
the suboccipital cortex- again,

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:14.290 align:middle line:84%
electric potentials and
more biochemical changes.

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And then he left it there,
where, obviously, that's

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:19.020 align:middle line:90%
where the problem begins.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:23.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what is it that
is capable to create out

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:28.900 align:middle line:84%
of these suboccipital
changes, electric potentials,

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:35.750 align:middle line:84%
and biochemical changes, a
Technicolor sort of conscious

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.530 align:middle line:84%
in our experience of
the object out there

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.620 align:middle line:90%
that we are perceiving.

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:43.160 align:middle line:84%
So I suddenly had
the feeling that I

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.540 align:middle line:90%
was like in the Sufi story.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:48.635 align:middle line:84%
When there's a lamp
and under the lamp,

00:16:48.635 --> 00:16:51.080 align:middle line:84%
there's a guy sort of
looking for something.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Another guy comes and
says, what are you doing?

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:57.610 align:middle line:90%
Says, well, I lost a key.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:58.960 align:middle line:90%
Says, can I help you?

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.810 align:middle line:84%
So they both end up on their
knees looking for the key.

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And then the newcomer says,
well, I can't see anything.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.449 align:middle line:90%
Are you sure you lost it here?

00:17:08.449 --> 00:17:10.670 align:middle line:90%
He says, no over there.

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:11.710 align:middle line:90%
Says, over there?

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:13.160 align:middle line:90%
Why are we looking here?

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.619 align:middle line:84%
Says, we wouldn't have
a chance here, you know,

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:16.770 align:middle line:90%
because there's light here.

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:19.462 align:middle line:90%
Over there, there's dark.

00:17:19.462 --> 00:17:20.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:24.109 align:middle line:84%
So in this book, he covered
a lot of experiments

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:26.069 align:middle line:90%
of things that can be studied.

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And then he left,
absolutely unanswered,

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.750 align:middle line:84%
the question that really
cannot be answered.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:35.780 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen anybody in
any kind of scientific books

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:39.640 align:middle line:84%
or articles even beginning
to tackle that question-- how

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:44.240 align:middle line:84%
that gap between matter and
consciousness could be bridged.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.890 align:middle line:84%
How something that's inert,
that's reactive, that's dead

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:51.990 align:middle line:84%
could create a sense
of self awareness,

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.870 align:middle line:90%
a sense of consciousness.

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:59.060 align:middle line:84%
So I myself came into the
work with nonordinary states

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:02.550 align:middle line:84%
with a very firm conviction
that was kind of instilled

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:04.070 align:middle line:90%
in me by my medical training.

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:08.410 align:middle line:84%
That it's absolutely obvious
that somehow consciousness

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:11.080 align:middle line:84%
emerges out of the complexity
of the neurophysiological

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:15.960 align:middle line:84%
processes, until I became aware
of a category of experiences

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.020 align:middle line:84%
that we call transpersonal
now-- experiences in which

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:23.690 align:middle line:84%
in these nonordinary
states, we can

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:26.530 align:middle line:84%
experience the dissolution
of our boundaries

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:29.460 align:middle line:84%
and experience ourselves
as another person,

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.850 align:middle line:84%
or experience a
group consciousness,

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:35.910 align:middle line:84%
or experience extremely
authentic identification

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:38.930 align:middle line:84%
with other life
forms from primates

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:48.010 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to protozoan,
unicellular organisms.

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Experiences in which we can
and go into archetypal domains.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:56.560 align:middle line:84%
We can experience and
encounter archetypal figures

00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.270 align:middle line:84%
from different cultures, from
mythologies that we have never

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.855 align:middle line:84%
studied-- the Jungian idea of
the collective unconscious.

00:19:03.855 --> 00:19:06.710 align:middle line:90%


00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:middle line:84%
Now I'll just mention
one experience

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.370 align:middle line:84%
that everybody will know
that obviously showing

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:14.990 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness can do
things that the brain couldn't

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.710 align:middle line:90%
possibly do.

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:18.420 align:middle line:84%
At least, not the kind
of brain that we describe

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.160 align:middle line:90%
in our university studies.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's the famous experience
that thanatologists see.

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.880 align:middle line:90%
It's now absolutely obvious.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:33.390 align:middle line:84%
It has been confirmed many times
that it's possible for a person

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:37.430 align:middle line:84%
to have an experience
of clinical death.

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And as that person is
being resuscitated,

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.570 align:middle line:84%
the subjective experience
is that consciousness

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:45.970 align:middle line:84%
detaches from the
body and is freely

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:49.430 align:middle line:84%
moving in the environment
and maintaining

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:53.280 align:middle line:84%
the perception of the
environment without senses.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:56.990 align:middle line:84%
The person is lying in a
coma with the eyes closed.

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And this embodied consciousness
can perceive the environment--

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:01.385 align:middle line:90%
>>Flat EEG--

00:20:01.385 --> 00:20:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>>Flat EEG sometimes.

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:08.020 align:middle line:84%
This can be observing, for
example, the whole situation

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.650 align:middle line:90%
from the ceiling.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And then decides to check on
the situation and floats down

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:19.760 align:middle line:84%
and checks the gauges on
the defibrillation machine.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And then decides to
go for a little walk.

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.440 align:middle line:90%
Goes through the walls.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:29.272 align:middle line:84%
Check what's happening in
other parts of the building.

00:20:29.272 --> 00:20:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe
experience something

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:35.660 align:middle line:84%
that's happening 200
or 2,000 miles away.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And then when the person
comes back to consciousness--

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.860 align:middle line:84%
if there is a person who is
interested in this phenomenon

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:46.130 align:middle line:84%
and gets the
accounts and checks,

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.380 align:middle line:84%
the person finds out that
these things are really

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:52.580 align:middle line:84%
happening-- all these locations
the disembodied consciousness

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:56.430 align:middle line:84%
had the capacity
to see, to perceive

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:middle line:90%
without the sensory organs.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.250 align:middle line:84%
There's now a book
by Ken Ring, probably

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:05.130 align:middle line:84%
the most famous
thanatologist, which

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:08.750 align:middle line:84%
is called "Mindsight" where
he describes his recent study

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:11.800 align:middle line:84%
where people who are
congenitally blind

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:16.520 align:middle line:84%
were able to see at
the time when they had

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:19.570 align:middle line:84%
a near-death experience,
and their consciousness

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.760 align:middle line:84%
was out of their
body, and then lost

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.900 align:middle line:84%
the capacity to
see again when they

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.870 align:middle line:90%
reconnected with their body.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And he is particularly
interested in studying

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.400 align:middle line:84%
experiences that he calls
vertical out-of-body

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.850 align:middle line:84%
experiences, where these
people not only see something,

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:41.170 align:middle line:84%
but what they see is there
for other people in consensus

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:43.400 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:47.840 align:middle line:84%
So to me, this is a paradigm
challenge if I ever saw one.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
anybody could explain

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.090 align:middle line:84%
it was the kind of
conceptual framework

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:54.800 align:middle line:84%
that we are teaching
in our universities.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>>The question you're
asking is the very topic

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.870 align:middle line:84%
that was in at least the French
editions of TIME magazine

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:04.300 align:middle line:84%
last week, whether
or not consciousness

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:08.210 align:middle line:84%
is an artifact of
physiology or whether or not

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:17.040 align:middle line:84%
it's something that is around
us and has always existed.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.430 align:middle line:90%
So we're tossing out new ideas.

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:20.930 align:middle line:84%
There's a growing
body of research

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:25.254 align:middle line:84%
to suggest that consciousness,
for lack-- and the terms

00:22:25.254 --> 00:22:27.920 align:middle line:84%
and the semantics come into play
here because we haven't defined

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.490 align:middle line:84%
any of these words-- but
suggest that consciousness

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:34.410 align:middle line:84%
is the field of information,
the living body of information,

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:38.490 align:middle line:84%
that surrounds
physical dimensions.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:42.020 align:middle line:90%


00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's a growing
body of evidence

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.120 align:middle line:84%
to suggest-- let
me just ask you,

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.710 align:middle line:84%
how many of you
in your textbooks

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:53.750 align:middle line:84%
were taught that we remember
and hold memories in our brains?

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:54.650 align:middle line:90%
How many of you?

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:56.734 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that pretty much
what we've all been taught?

00:22:56.734 --> 00:22:58.191 align:middle line:84%
It was certainly
what I was taught.

00:22:58.191 --> 00:22:59.790 align:middle line:84%
There's a growing
body of research

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:02.560 align:middle line:84%
that suggests that we may not
actually remember in our brains

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:06.750 align:middle line:84%
the way we think we do--
that the neural circuits

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:11.250 align:middle line:84%
in our brains actually
function as a very

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:14.390 align:middle line:84%
specific form of
antenna that tune

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:18.860 align:middle line:84%
to the fields of information
that surround and are held

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:22.700 align:middle line:84%
in place, by some estimates,
in the magnetic fields

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:25.610 align:middle line:84%
of our Earth, much the
way computer circuits

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:30.730 align:middle line:84%
are held in place in magnetic
fields of memory and chips.

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And if that turns
out to be true,

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:35.620 align:middle line:84%
the implications to this
question, then, are vast.

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:38.800 align:middle line:84%
It means that we simply
have the ability to tune

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:43.880 align:middle line:84%
to the information in
creation and the ability

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.600 align:middle line:84%
to change the way that we
tune into that information.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.730 align:middle line:84%
I had the opportunity a
few years ago-- Michio,

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:53.380 align:middle line:84%
maybe you've seen
the thin sections

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.475 align:middle line:84%
they made of Dr. Einstein's
brain after he died.

00:23:56.475 --> 00:24:00.060 align:middle line:84%
The University of
Kansas freeze dried

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:01.930 align:middle line:84%
in thin section of
Albert Einstein's brain

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:03.388 align:middle line:84%
because they wanted
to see what was

00:24:03.388 --> 00:24:06.541 align:middle line:84%
so different about his
brain that allowed him to do

00:24:06.541 --> 00:24:07.790 align:middle line:90%
the things he did in his life.

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And they found it looked
like everyone else's brain.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.640 align:middle line:84%
With the exception of maybe a
few more folds in the frontal

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.340 align:middle line:84%
lobes, they said it really
looked pretty much like

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:18.750 align:middle line:90%
everyone else's.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And that is what we would expect
if, in fact, we're not holding

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:90%
the information in our brains.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.300 align:middle line:84%
So as a little adjunct
to this, if this is true,

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.130 align:middle line:84%
if our brains are simply
tuning the information

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:34.800 align:middle line:84%
in a nonphysical field
around our brain, then

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.970 align:middle line:84%
perhaps we can simulate
that in computer chips.

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And there's research
being done right now,

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:43.480 align:middle line:84%
with computer chips based
in water droplets instead

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:49.190 align:middle line:84%
of silicon, that hold memory
in fields surrounding the water

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:52.327 align:middle line:84%
droplet rather than
inside the chip itself.

00:24:52.327 --> 00:24:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And depending on where
this research and this kind

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:56.680 align:middle line:84%
of information
goes, I think it may

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.480 align:middle line:84%
be one of the great
physiological discoveries

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.330 align:middle line:90%
in consciousness of our time.

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:02.550 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I would like to really
connect this conversation

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:12.450 align:middle line:84%
a little with the one
that we started with.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And I want to take off from
this issue of awareness.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:24.290 align:middle line:84%
For me, as interesting as it is,
whether as so many people are

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:29.390 align:middle line:84%
positing now, the psi field,
all of these possible areas

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:31.950 align:middle line:84%
that we're exploring-- which
I think is fascinating.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's very important
that we're exploring these

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:37.840 align:middle line:84%
because what you're really
doing in all of this

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.930 align:middle line:84%
is what I talked about this
afternoon, re-imagining

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:43.330 align:middle line:90%
and reconfiguring reality.

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:47.970 align:middle line:84%
But for me, the basic question
isn't so much to find out.

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:51.070 align:middle line:84%
Because my answer
would be it's both.

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:54.060 align:middle line:84%
You know, that there
probably is a field outside.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And that certainly it
resides in our brains.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:02.050 align:middle line:84%
So for me, the issue
is very simply,

00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:08.090 align:middle line:84%
what are the implications
of the lack of awareness

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:11.300 align:middle line:84%
that we find today
among so many people,

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:15.710 align:middle line:84%
at a time when the world
is at such a crisis point?

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And so many people,
particularly policymakers,

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:25.440 align:middle line:84%
but people all around us, are in
total denial about the dangers.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, technology's
going to fix it.

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Or, there's no
population crisis.

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.930 align:middle line:90%
I mean, hello.

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:31.545 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:26:31.545 --> 00:26:33.510 align:middle line:84%
We're in the last year
before the last year

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:39.040 align:middle line:84%
when the pond is full with
exponential population growth.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And my interest
is, what conditions

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:47.890 align:middle line:84%
lead people to so constrict
their awareness so that they

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:51.430 align:middle line:84%
are in denial about
life threatening

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:53.499 align:middle line:84%
matters-- life
threatening to them

00:26:53.499 --> 00:26:55.290 align:middle line:84%
and their children and
their grandchildren,

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:58.110 align:middle line:90%
not just to mine and yours.

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
then I really would

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:02.460 align:middle line:84%
like to bring it
back to something

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.140 align:middle line:84%
that I spoke about
at some length

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:08.260 align:middle line:84%
today, but want to just
briefly touch base on with you.

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:12.500 align:middle line:84%
In what I've called
a dominator model--

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:16.470 align:middle line:84%
it is very constricted
awareness that

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:18.745 align:middle line:84%
is the product of,
first of all, the child

00:27:18.745 --> 00:27:25.350 align:middle line:90%
rearing of that kind of model.

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:28.180 align:middle line:84%
What begins to
happen to people is

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:31.710 align:middle line:84%
that they must go into
denial about the pain that

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:35.230 align:middle line:84%
is being caused to them
by those on whom they

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:38.970 align:middle line:90%
depend for survival.

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:43.500 align:middle line:84%
So they become
habituated to not even

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:48.540 align:middle line:84%
be in touch with what
their own senses tell them,

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:49.710 align:middle line:90%
even beyond this.

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Because of rote obedience
is part of that model.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:59.350 align:middle line:84%
The child, which is born
to freely move and to enjoy

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:04.440 align:middle line:84%
and to freely learn, becomes
more robotic, more conditioned

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:08.480 align:middle line:84%
to respond to
external authority.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to
have us consider here

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.360 align:middle line:84%
that this is a serious
matter, whether it's

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:18.150 align:middle line:84%
from outsiders or from
inside of the brain.

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:21.230 align:middle line:84%
We know, I mean there are
some very specific things

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:26.560 align:middle line:84%
we can do to break these cycles
of people who are habitually

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.750 align:middle line:84%
in denial-- because
that is how they

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:35.190 align:middle line:84%
have learned to cope with very
unpleasant dominator realities.

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:40.010 align:middle line:84%
We know that the
neuropsychology of the brain,

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:43.290 align:middle line:84%
the chemical pathways
of the brain,

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:47.950 align:middle line:84%
are affected by the quality of
child rearing on this planet,

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:50.790 align:middle line:90%
here, in this reality.

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:53.760 align:middle line:84%
We know that children
who are abused

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.220 align:middle line:84%
and who are violently
treated, and it can also

00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:01.340 align:middle line:84%
be severe psychological
abuse, lose their capacity

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:02.220 align:middle line:90%
for learning.

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:04.360 align:middle line:84%
Now what are we really
talking about, awareness?

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.460 align:middle line:84%
It's a capacity
to be fully aware

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and to really learn from the
feedback from your environment.

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:14.100 align:middle line:84%
That's a huge part
of it, isn't it?

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:18.830 align:middle line:84%
They also lose their
capacity to relate.

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And they lose their capacity,
to a very large extent--

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:25.660 align:middle line:84%
all of these are awareness
issues-- to be aware

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:30.810 align:middle line:84%
of their own pain or of the pain
that they're causing others.

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to suggest
to you that if we really

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:37.860 align:middle line:84%
want to have that
expanded consciousness

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:41.270 align:middle line:84%
and fulfill-- I mean, the
work that you are all doing

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:44.890 align:middle line:84%
is-- and my husband, I have
to say, Dr. David Lloyd,

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:47.740 align:middle line:84%
was one of the people who,
in the basement of the UCLA

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:52.220 align:middle line:84%
School of Medicine, was having
some of the first experiments

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.950 align:middle line:90%
in mental telepathy.

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:55.900 align:middle line:90%
He's a psychologist.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:57.500 align:middle line:90%
I mean, yes, it exists.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:01.650 align:middle line:84%
But to unleash and to
free these capacities,

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:04.570 align:middle line:84%
I think we also have
to create, again,

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:10.300 align:middle line:84%
the kind of child rearing,
the kind of human institutions

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:14.810 align:middle line:84%
that open us up to being
able to do something

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:19.630 align:middle line:84%
constructive with this
incredible knowledge,

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:21.570 align:middle line:90%
this incredible capacity.

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that
comes up again and again

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:29.730 align:middle line:84%
is our interconnection
from physics, from biology.

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:34.570 align:middle line:84%
So I really would like to really
bring it, I'm very practical,

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:37.755 align:middle line:84%
I would like to bring it
to the level at which I

00:30:37.755 --> 00:30:42.820 align:middle line:84%
so passionately believe
we must direct our work.

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:47.200 align:middle line:84%
How do we use all of this
to break these cycles,

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:52.120 align:middle line:84%
to break this dominator system,
and to apply all of this

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:56.930 align:middle line:90%
to the task ahead of freeing us?

00:30:56.930 --> 00:31:02.065 align:middle line:84%
And also, perhaps,
even saving us?

00:31:02.065 --> 00:31:05.502 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:05.502 --> 00:31:12.400 align:middle line:90%


00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm sometimes
asked a question.

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:18.470 align:middle line:84%
What does string theory
say about consciousness?

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, it
makes the problem worse.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:29.340 align:middle line:84%
We have problems
enough with cats,

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:30.930 align:middle line:90%
whether they are alive or dead.

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And when Einstein would
invite friends over,

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:36.945 align:middle line:84%
he would always point
them to the moon.

00:31:36.945 --> 00:31:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And he would ask
them a question.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Does the moon exist because
a mouse looks at the moon?

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:44.630 align:middle line:90%
Does a mouse have consciousness?

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:46.450 align:middle line:84%
The mouse can make
a measurement.

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:48.720 align:middle line:84%
The mouse, an observer,
looking at the moon.

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.350 align:middle line:84%
Does the moon spring
into existence

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:52.200 align:middle line:90%
when a mouse looks at it?

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:56.000 align:middle line:90%
And, well, yeah, in some sense.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.492 align:middle line:90%
You can make a case for that.

00:31:57.492 --> 00:31:59.575 align:middle line:84%
How much consciousness do
animals have, therefore?

00:31:59.575 --> 00:32:02.090 align:middle line:90%


00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:04.670 align:middle line:84%
It goes on forever,
as you can tell.

00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:07.600 align:middle line:84%
There's a play on
Broadway, "Copenhagen."

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Best play best Broadway
play of the year last year.

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:13.020 align:middle line:90%
I saw "Copenhagen."

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.742 align:middle line:84%
How many people here
have seen that play?

00:32:14.742 --> 00:32:16.700 align:middle line:84%
How many people here have
understood that play?

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:18.588 align:middle line:90%


00:32:18.588 --> 00:32:21.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, the best play
of the year, not only

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:26.100 align:middle line:84%
do they debate whether or
not Heisenberg willingly

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.650 align:middle line:84%
worked on the
atomic bomb or not,

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:31.020 align:middle line:84%
and whether he knew what
critical mass was, and, you

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:33.820 align:middle line:84%
know, why are we speaking
English here today

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:35.759 align:middle line:90%
and not Germany?

00:32:35.759 --> 00:32:38.300 align:middle line:84%
A small part of that reason why
I'm not speaking to you today

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.195 align:middle line:84%
in German, and there's
no swastika behind me,

00:32:41.195 --> 00:32:43.520 align:middle line:90%
is because Heisenberg goofed.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.371 align:middle line:84%
He made a mistake
on critical mass.

00:32:45.371 --> 00:32:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>>The question is, did
he make it intentionally?

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:47.995 align:middle line:90%
>>That's right.

00:32:47.995 --> 00:32:51.060 align:middle line:84%
That's what the play
"Copenhagen" does not fully

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:51.970 align:middle line:90%
answer.

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Did Heisenberg goof
intentionally or not?

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:56.470 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:58.640 align:middle line:84%
The other question
they debate is

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:01.380 align:middle line:84%
the question of consciousness,
dead cats, lives cats.

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:02.880 align:middle line:90%
They get into this question.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:05.595 align:middle line:84%
Does the moon exist when
a mouse looks at it?

00:33:05.595 --> 00:33:06.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, with string
theory, it gets

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:12.780 align:middle line:84%
worse because the smallest unit
of string theory is a universe.

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:15.430 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about a
theory of universes now.

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Each solution of string
theory is an entire universe.

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:21.720 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
cats and dogs anymore.

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.750 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about existence
itself, physical reality,

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:26.660 align:middle line:90%
everything there is.

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you write wave
functions of strings,

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:33.820 align:middle line:84%
which is what I do for a
living-- the psi of strings--

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:36.220 align:middle line:84%
in fact, I'm the co-founder
of string field theory,

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:37.580 align:middle line:90%
which is precisely that.

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.720 align:middle line:84%
I was able to write the
equations by which you

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.470 align:middle line:90%
write the fields of strings.

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:44.760 align:middle line:84%
These strings
describe universes.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.770 align:middle line:90%
Each solution is a universe.

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you have a
wave function of a universe.

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And the question is, who
looks at the universe?

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:01.190 align:middle line:84%
What observer can look
at an entire universe,

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:04.180 align:middle line:84%
an entire bubble
expanding in hyperspace?

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Can a mouse look at
an entire universe?

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Who decides which
universe is our universe

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:13.860 align:middle line:84%
if there's no when there to look
at that particular universe?

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:17.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you get headaches
thinking about this, OK?

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:20.060 align:middle line:84%
So starting with the
question of consciousness,

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:22.639 align:middle line:84%
whether or not the wave
functions really exist

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:25.237 align:middle line:84%
or not in a state if
you don't look at,

00:34:25.237 --> 00:34:26.820 align:middle line:84%
you get to the point
of whether or not

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.190 align:middle line:84%
universes can exist if
there's no one there

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:30.920 align:middle line:90%
to observe a universe?

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.120 align:middle line:90%
Because where are you sitting?

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.830 align:middle line:84%
If you are looking
at a wave function,

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:39.840 align:middle line:84%
where are you sitting if you
are outside physical reality?

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:44.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you get headaches
thinking about this thing.

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:51.449 align:middle line:84%
So in a short word, we
physicists don't got a clue.

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:54.320 align:middle line:84%
We're clueless as
to the final answer.

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.560 align:middle line:84%
Hawking, of course, has been
famous in the last few years

00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.360 align:middle line:84%
writing about wave
functions of universes.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.770 align:middle line:90%
He has psi of universe.

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:04.160 align:middle line:84%
He introduced something
called superspace, the space

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.800 align:middle line:90%
of all possible universes.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:10.430 align:middle line:84%
That's the space in which
his psi function lives.

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:14.120 align:middle line:84%
Not the wave function of x, y,
and z of ordinary three space,

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.110 align:middle line:84%
the space of universe
called superspace.

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:18.110 align:middle line:84%
That's the space that
Hawking lives in.

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:18.725 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:35:18.725 --> 00:35:20.100 align:middle line:84%
We don't know the
answer to that.

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.460 align:middle line:84%
However, let me bring
it down to earth.

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:26.170 align:middle line:84%
What I'm concerned
about, as a human,

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:30.620 align:middle line:84%
is whether or not we will
attain planetary consciousness.

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:34.010 align:middle line:84%
You see, we are on the verge
of attaining type one status.

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:36.050 align:middle line:84%
Like I said before,
many people put us

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:39.130 align:middle line:84%
100, 200 years
away from type one.

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:44.300 align:middle line:84%
But our brain is genetically
identical to the brains

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:48.420 align:middle line:84%
of people coming out of
Africa 100,000 years ago.

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:51.980 align:middle line:84%
You take people coming out
of Africa 100,000 years ago,

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:54.350 align:middle line:84%
you give them a shave,
three piece suit,

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and put them on a
Wall Street, and they

00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:59.840 align:middle line:84%
look like all the other
barbarians on Wall Street.

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Genetically the same, OK,
doing the same kind of antics

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.970 align:middle line:84%
that we see the
people on Wall Street.

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:08.220 align:middle line:90%
Let's do a science experiment.

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.053 align:middle line:84%
Let's all take a subway
train to Wall Street

00:36:10.053 --> 00:36:13.020 align:middle line:90%
and you'll see what I mean.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, now we have
nuclear weapons.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:20.470 align:middle line:84%
But the same primitive
tribal instincts

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:24.070 align:middle line:84%
that govern us throughout
most of existence,

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:28.410 align:middle line:84%
99.9% of our human exist--
we lived in small tribes.

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:31.350 align:middle line:84%
Small tribes of
maybe 100 people,

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:34.030 align:middle line:90%
led by some charismatic leader.

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:35.000 align:middle line:90%
100 people.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.840 align:middle line:90%
That was our universe.

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And what defined us
was the fact that we

00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:42.385 align:middle line:84%
were members of a tribe in
opposition to other tribes.

00:36:42.385 --> 00:36:44.440 align:middle line:90%
Well, that got us into war.

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And that got us into
a lot of mischief.

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:49.440 align:middle line:90%
Now we have nuclear weapons.

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.670 align:middle line:90%
Now we have global warming.

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And now we're truly, on a
cosmic scale, messing up

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.620 align:middle line:90%
the planet Earth.

00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And the question
is, can we extend

00:36:58.670 --> 00:37:03.340 align:middle line:84%
our definition of a tribe
to the entire planet?

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:05.760 align:middle line:84%
If we make the technical
transition to type one,

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:09.090 align:middle line:84%
are we going to make a
conscious decision to think,

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:12.110 align:middle line:84%
as a planetary civilization
with limited resources,

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:15.180 align:middle line:84%
with finite ability
to pollute the planet,

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.290 align:middle line:90%
it's not clear at all.

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:18.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:22.430 align:middle line:84%
One day, during the '80s,
Ronald Reagan met Gorbachev.

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And they had a
fascinating discussion.

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:26.980 align:middle line:84%
One thing you have to
hand it to Ronald Reagan,

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:31.330 align:middle line:84%
he was able to reduce everything
in terms of Hollywood.

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:33.300 align:middle line:90%
That was his world view.

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:34.530 align:middle line:90%
Hollywood.

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And Gorbachev asked
Reagan a question.

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Under what circumstances
can we work together?

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm a communist, he said.

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:43.770 align:middle line:90%
You're a capitalist.

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And Reagan scratched
his head a bit.

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And Reagan said, you
know, the only way

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:52.910 align:middle line:84%
he could possibly envision
us working together

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:54.500 align:middle line:84%
is if we were invaded
by the Martians.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:56.812 align:middle line:90%


00:37:56.812 --> 00:37:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And then Gorbachev
scratched his head and said,

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:01.590 align:middle line:84%
well, you may have
a point there.

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:04.350 align:middle line:84%
You see, if there's another
tribe out there that's hostile,

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:08.370 align:middle line:84%
the Martians, then us human
tribes have to get together.

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps we can
put aside the Cold War

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:14.354 align:middle line:84%
and all the animosities
of the '50s and the '40s.

00:38:14.354 --> 00:38:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, the question
that we ask ourselves

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:20.560 align:middle line:84%
today is, if we are
our own worst enemies,

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:23.580 align:middle line:84%
if our technology, the crowning
achievements of the human mind,

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:25.930 align:middle line:84%
is what could also
doom us, then will

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:27.750 align:middle line:90%
we have planetary consciousness?

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Will we begin to think of
the human race as a tribe?

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:33.440 align:middle line:90%
That's not clear to me.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:33.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't believe
me, go to the Balkans.

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Go to places on the Earth
where ethnic cleansing

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.800 align:middle line:90%
is the name of the game.

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And if we think, we're
above ethnic cleansing,

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:48.890 align:middle line:84%
what did we do with
the Native Americans?

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:51.460 align:middle line:84%
The Native Americans
were put on reservations.

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:53.873 align:middle line:84%
That's commonly called
ethnic cleansing.

00:38:53.873 --> 00:38:54.840 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:59.070 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, can we
enlarge our sense of tribe?

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:00.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, OK.

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:03.761 align:middle line:84%
It was mentioned here the
experiences of World War II.

00:39:03.761 --> 00:39:05.260 align:middle line:84%
During World War
II, my parents were

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:08.750 align:middle line:84%
put in a concentration
camp in California.

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:09.590 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:15.490 align:middle line:84%
We were not members of the tribe
of Californians back in 1942,

00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:17.591 align:middle line:90%
after Pearl Harbor.

00:39:17.591 --> 00:39:18.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:21.690 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, are we
going to attain type one status

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:23.200 align:middle line:84%
at a conscious
level, even though we

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.920 align:middle line:84%
may have the instruments of
a planetary civilization,

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:29.600 align:middle line:84%
a planetary internet,
a planetary television

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:33.190 align:middle line:84%
system, a planetary
way of exchanging

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:34.440 align:middle line:90%
personal experiences?

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:35.826 align:middle line:90%
It's not clear to me.

00:39:35.826 --> 00:39:36.700 align:middle line:90%
It's not clear to me.

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:39.940 align:middle line:84%
However, I will, with
every fiber of my body,

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:43.250 align:middle line:84%
try to build a
world where we will

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:45.630 align:middle line:84%
have that planetary
consciousness, where

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:50.310 align:middle line:84%
the smallest unit of our
existence is the entire earth.

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:54.101 align:middle line:84%
I will work with every fiber
of my body to see that happen.

00:39:54.101 --> 00:39:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Because I saw what happened
to my parents' generation.

00:39:56.350 --> 00:40:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want that to happen
in my children's generation.

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:04.120 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>>I totally agree with you
that that native empathy

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:11.870 align:middle line:84%
and that sense of connection
that we're all built with

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:13.570 align:middle line:90%
needs to come to the fore.

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:17.090 align:middle line:84%
But I have to disagree
with you about the view

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:20.910 align:middle line:84%
that you present about
tribal societies.

00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:25.550 align:middle line:84%
If you just look at some tribal
societies in recent history,

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:28.120 align:middle line:84%
without going into
prehistory even--

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm talking about
pre-prehistory.

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I'm talking about
pre-prehistory, too.

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:37.530 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at tribes today,
there were tribes, for example,

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:40.410 align:middle line:84%
when Columbus came
to the Americas.

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And some were horribly
dominator-oriented,

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:44.690 align:middle line:90%
like the Aztecs, OK?

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:46.900 align:middle line:84%
But others were much
more partnership-oriented

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:48.840 align:middle line:90%
and they welcomed these people.

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.830 align:middle line:84%
They did not have
that tribal mentality.

00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:52.750 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:55.520 align:middle line:90%
But the conquistadores sure did.

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:59.010 align:middle line:84%
I'd really like to
disengage, if we possibly

00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:03.190 align:middle line:84%
can, from this notion that we
have to achieve something that

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:06.440 align:middle line:84%
has never been achieved,
that somehow this

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:12.410 align:middle line:84%
is not something possible and
inherent in our prehistory.

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:15.880 align:middle line:84%
As I've said today,
the evidence is

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:19.690 align:middle line:84%
very compelling for a
multilinear rather than

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:23.530 align:middle line:84%
a unilinear theory of
cultural evolution.

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Very few things in our
planet are just one way, OK?

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:33.250 align:middle line:84%
There are very often
diversity, alternatives.

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And the evidence that is
beginning to come through to us

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:40.610 align:middle line:84%
is that while not
society is violence free,

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:43.580 align:middle line:84%
many of the assumptions
that we have

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:47.770 align:middle line:84%
made from social
biologists, for example,

00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:52.390 align:middle line:84%
who keep telling us a mythology,
a theoretical mythology that

00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:56.150 align:middle line:84%
really justifies a dominator
model that's not so very

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:58.060 align:middle line:90%
different from original sin.

00:41:58.060 --> 00:41:59.690 align:middle line:90%
Something's wrong with us.

00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:01.690 align:middle line:84%
We have to be controlled
kind of mythology.

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:04.370 align:middle line:90%


00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:05.840 align:middle line:90%
It's always been that way.

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:09.050 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, maybe, you
can dream about it,

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:10.280 align:middle line:90%
but it will never happen.

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:14.300 align:middle line:84%
There is compelling evidence
of earlier societies,

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:19.100 align:middle line:84%
both on the tribal level,
in the early Neolithic,

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:23.180 align:middle line:84%
possibly in the paleolithic--
although it's probably true,

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:24.710 align:middle line:84%
because we don't
see in their art

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:28.120 align:middle line:84%
the representations
of armed battles.

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And we even find
into the Bronze Age,

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:34.860 align:middle line:84%
where the Minoan
civilization-- archaeologists

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:37.830 align:middle line:84%
have gone crazy trying
to somehow prove

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:40.560 align:middle line:84%
that there was something
really wrong with the Minoans

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:44.160 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't have
fortifications or signs of war.

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.770 align:middle line:84%
It didn't fit into
their paradigm.

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And all I'm trying
to say, Michio,

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:52.890 align:middle line:84%
is there's a lot of evidence,
very interesting evidence

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:56.210 align:middle line:84%
out there that,
both biologically

00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:59.020 align:middle line:84%
and in terms of
cultural evolution,

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:04.430 align:middle line:84%
simply contradicts this view
that the tribalism is something

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:06.570 align:middle line:84%
that we've had and
all of these groups

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:09.600 align:middle line:90%
were always against each other.

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.950 align:middle line:84%
So I would like
to really suggest

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:16.360 align:middle line:84%
to that the issue is
the social structure.

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:17.160 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And we replicate
this tribalism, not

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:23.060 align:middle line:84%
under-- we can't change
it on the global level

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:24.590 align:middle line:84%
is the other thing
I want to say.

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:26.640 align:middle line:84%
If we're going to
change this, it's

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:29.820 align:middle line:84%
going to be in our
intimate relations first.

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.490 align:middle line:84%
If we're going to
change this, we're

00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:33.600 align:middle line:84%
going to change the
use of violence,

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:37.020 align:middle line:84%
to impose one's will, to
control another being,

00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:39.970 align:middle line:84%
on the intimate level,
in parent-child relations

00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:41.500 align:middle line:90%
and in gender relations.

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And if we really want
to have the basis

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:47.700 align:middle line:84%
for a peaceful society-- you
mention Bosnia-- the Yugoslav

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:50.100 align:middle line:84%
peninsula-- and there've been
interesting analysis done

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:54.540 align:middle line:84%
of this-- it is a total
dominator family structure

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.770 align:middle line:90%
in so many of these places.

00:43:56.770 --> 00:44:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And they're just playing
out the same drama.

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:03.227 align:middle line:90%
Well, anyway, I'm going to stop.

00:44:03.227 --> 00:44:04.181 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:04.181 --> 00:44:07.520 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:08.259 align:middle line:90%


00:44:08.259 --> 00:44:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>>I wanted to go back for a
moment to the question that

00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:13.950 align:middle line:84%
was raised earlier about
science and spirituality.

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:20.580 align:middle line:84%
I, as a Jew who didn't
just escape the Nazis

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:23.760 align:middle line:84%
but was aware of it
deeply as a child,

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:27.440 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in the most
intensely secular kind

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:33.020 align:middle line:84%
of German Jewish family
that you could imagine.

00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:34.720 align:middle line:84%
My father was an
English professor

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:38.270 align:middle line:84%
and the Bible was read strictly
as culture and literature.

00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:39.630 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing to it.

00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm reminded
of Huston Smith who

00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:45.560 align:middle line:84%
has-- you're going to
hear-- has critiqued

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:48.040 align:middle line:84%
the divinity schools
around the country

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:51.500 align:middle line:84%
because they talk about
comparative religion,

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:54.370 align:middle line:84%
analysis of religious beliefs,
the history of religion.

00:44:54.370 --> 00:44:58.740 align:middle line:84%
The only problem is they never
indicate it's about anything.

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:03.590 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
thing that distinguishes

00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:06.050 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual or the
religious-- and I

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:08.540 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of trouble talking
about God and spirituality,

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:11.410 align:middle line:84%
given, and I think there's a
certain shame about talking

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:14.410 align:middle line:84%
that way among
scientists or anybody

00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:20.030 align:middle line:84%
that's supposedly raised
in a clinical, scientific,

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:21.750 align:middle line:90%
objective, whatever it is.

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:24.290 align:middle line:84%
But it seems to me,
that's missing here.

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:27.770 align:middle line:84%
In other words, that in
the nonordinary state work

00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:30.680 align:middle line:84%
or when you blow
your Western mind,

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:33.370 align:middle line:84%
you are opened up to the
presence of the divine.

00:45:33.370 --> 00:45:36.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a palpable,
powerful, real experience.

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And from that place, you cannot
do these things we're talking

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:40.840 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:45.350 align:middle line:84%
You cannot treat the earth
and rape it as simply a thing.

00:45:45.350 --> 00:45:46.285 align:middle line:90%
You are part of it.

00:45:46.285 --> 00:45:49.410 align:middle line:90%
It is you.

00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:51.990 align:middle line:84%
We can talk and
entreat ourselves

00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:54.850 align:middle line:84%
in the most progressive,
liberal, empathic way.

00:45:54.850 --> 00:45:57.860 align:middle line:84%
But if we don't
do it in relation

00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:00.780 align:middle line:84%
to some kind of experience of a
higher conscious of the divine,

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:02.530 align:middle line:84%
of an intelligence
beyond ourselves,

00:46:02.530 --> 00:46:06.894 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to call
it as something real,

00:46:06.894 --> 00:46:08.310 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going
to be cosmetic.

00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it requires
a radical transformation

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:14.160 align:middle line:84%
of our relationship to
ourselves and ourselves

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:16.550 align:middle line:84%
as spiritual beings in
relation to the cosmos

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:19.810 align:middle line:84%
as a living, intelligent,
godlike, whatever

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:22.030 align:middle line:90%
you want to call it, entity.

00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:24.861 align:middle line:84%
>>But John, don't you think
that that divine is in us, too?

00:46:24.861 --> 00:46:25.360 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:26.230 align:middle line:90%
It's not out there.

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:27.105 align:middle line:90%
>>It's not out there.

00:46:27.105 --> 00:46:29.438 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's really been
part of my spiritual journey.

00:46:29.438 --> 00:46:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>>It's still where this opening
of consciousness that we're

00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:34.666 align:middle line:90%
talking about ultimately leads.

00:46:34.666 --> 00:46:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>>But I'm only
saying that for us

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:39.410 align:middle line:84%
to open that, because there
are plenty of religious people

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:43.050 align:middle line:84%
who are totally dominator,
bigoted, fanatic.

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:45.180 align:middle line:84%
For us to get there,
we have to deal

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:47.281 align:middle line:84%
with what are the things
that close us down.

00:46:47.281 --> 00:46:52.426 align:middle line:90%


00:46:52.426 --> 00:46:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>>And John mentioned
the consciousness,

00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:57.780 align:middle line:84%
so I would like to just describe
some of the experiences that

00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:00.180 align:middle line:90%
have bearing on this.

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:02.800 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned the
transpersonal experiences,

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:07.440 align:middle line:84%
where we can literally identify
in a very authentic way

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:08.360 align:middle line:90%
with other people.

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:10.200 align:middle line:84%
We can identify
with human groups.

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:14.930 align:middle line:84%
We can experience our selves
as different life forms.

00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
you see, quite regularly

00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:20.560 align:middle line:84%
as a result of
those experiences,

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:23.980 align:middle line:84%
is just a development of
a system of meta values

00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:30.190 align:middle line:84%
and meta motivations the
way Maslow talk about it.

00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:32.320 align:middle line:84%
You see very, very
profound changes--

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.406 align:middle line:90%
if it's done responsibly.

00:47:34.406 --> 00:47:36.830 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
that everybody who

00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:40.366 align:middle line:84%
gets into an unordinary state in
a rave somewhere or in a party

00:47:40.366 --> 00:47:41.740 align:middle line:84%
is going to have
that experience.

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:44.890 align:middle line:84%
But if it happens in the proper
context, with the proper set

00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:49.370 align:middle line:84%
and setting responsibly,
you see development.

00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:52.240 align:middle line:84%
You see changes in a
specific direction.

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:53.970 align:middle line:90%
For example, aggression.

00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:58.895 align:middle line:84%
Very, very deeply reduced after
those kinds of experiences.

00:47:58.895 --> 00:48:03.910 align:middle line:84%
A tremendous development of
tolerance, whether it's racial,

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:08.308 align:middle line:90%
cultural, you know, political.

00:48:08.308 --> 00:48:13.440 align:middle line:84%
A tremendous concern about
the planet, very much

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:15.150 align:middle line:90%
what Michio was talking about.

00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:20.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, feeling a sense
of planetary citizenship

00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:24.525 align:middle line:84%
rather than a commitment
to a particular culture,

00:48:24.525 --> 00:48:26.780 align:middle line:90%
a particular group.

00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:30.150 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
teach people ecology

00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:32.650 align:middle line:84%
because you can
experience what it feels

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:36.830 align:middle line:84%
like to be a fish somewhere
in Albania or Hamburg,

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:39.880 align:middle line:84%
when you get all
the toxic products

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:43.140 align:middle line:84%
from the German
industry and so on.

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:46.460 align:middle line:84%
So there is a very
specific direction.

00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:49.247 align:middle line:84%
>>You're basically
saying it's in us,

00:48:49.247 --> 00:48:50.330 align:middle line:90%
it just needs to be freed.

00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:52.204 align:middle line:84%
>>You see, I'm talking
about spirituality not

00:48:52.204 --> 00:48:53.000 align:middle line:90%
about religion.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.690 align:middle line:84%
I think that
religions actually add

00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:57.330 align:middle line:84%
to the problems
in the world today

00:48:57.330 --> 00:49:00.830 align:middle line:84%
because a typical mainstream
religion unites people

00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:03.990 align:middle line:84%
within its own range,
but automatically sets

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:05.800 align:middle line:90%
that group against another.

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:09.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's sort of partially
unitive, but ultimately

00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:13.520 align:middle line:84%
divisive-- all the terms
like pagans, goyim, infidels,

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:14.760 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:17.530 align:middle line:84%
In many parts of the
world, religion is,

00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:21.410 align:middle line:84%
if not the cause, then at
least an excuse for violence.

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>>You know that the leadership
in the dominator societies

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:25.320 align:middle line:90%
hate psychedelics.

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:28.130 align:middle line:84%
They're terribly threatened by
nonorderly states of conscious

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:32.210 align:middle line:84%
for just the reasons that
Stan's talking about.

00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:35.220 align:middle line:84%
>>--point that I think is so
exciting about some of this is

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:39.480 align:middle line:84%
that there are many avenues
to free us from this dominator

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:41.000 align:middle line:90%
overlay.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.560 align:middle line:90%
Because we've all carried.

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:44.660 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we all have acquired it.

00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And this, apparently, as
Terrance McKenna always

00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:50.400 align:middle line:84%
used to say, is
one of the avenues

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:55.560 align:middle line:90%
that we have to free this in us.

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:57.436 align:middle line:84%
>>What I see
happening here, this--

00:49:57.436 --> 00:49:59.060 align:middle line:84%
what's happening on
the panel, I think,

00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:03.375 align:middle line:84%
is a beautiful microcosm of
what we do in our world and life

00:50:03.375 --> 00:50:07.060 align:middle line:90%
with different walks of life.

00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:09.740 align:middle line:84%
This is where I think the
semantics is important.

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:14.530 align:middle line:84%
There's a single consciousness,
this field of information.

00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:17.590 align:middle line:84%
However, the human mind,
the collective mind,

00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:22.090 align:middle line:84%
is striving to understand our
role, and understand itself,

00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:23.890 align:middle line:84%
in the presence of
that consciousness.

00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're all talking
about precisely the same thing.

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:30.720 align:middle line:84%
The physics describes
the stuff out there

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:33.130 align:middle line:84%
that the ancients
said is the mirror

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:35.700 align:middle line:90%
of our reflected universe.

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:38.560 align:middle line:84%
So the physics now,
the quantum hologram,

00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:42.190 align:middle line:84%
the superstring theory
is describing the stuff

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:45.320 align:middle line:84%
that mirrors back to us
what you're now saying

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:47.730 align:middle line:84%
and what we're talking
about in our lives.

00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:52.340 align:middle line:84%
What we become from
within, the hologram

00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:54.250 align:middle line:90%
will mirror back to us.

00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:57.620 align:middle line:84%
So the answer to the
question is if we'd like

00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:59.050 align:middle line:90%
to see change in our world?

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:00.590 align:middle line:84%
I think we have
enough now that we

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:05.380 align:middle line:84%
can bring what we know to bear
on the condition of our lives.

00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And the one theme that
plays out over and over

00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:10.830 align:middle line:84%
again through the ancient
traditions, and now

00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:12.700 align:middle line:84%
it's playing out
in modern science,

00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:15.700 align:middle line:84%
is saying what we've
become from within

00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:17.940 align:middle line:90%
is what the world is showing us.

00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:20.020 align:middle line:84%
So if we'd like to see
change in our world,

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:24.060 align:middle line:84%
we're invited to
honor life all life.

00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Honor all the
possibilities of life.

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:29.370 align:middle line:90%
Honor the principles of unity.

00:51:29.370 --> 00:51:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And it begins, not just
within the family unit,

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.830 align:middle line:90%
it begins within the individual.

00:51:34.830 --> 00:51:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And what science is now
showing us again and again is

00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:40.310 align:middle line:84%
when we honor those
principles-- love, compassion,

00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:43.740 align:middle line:84%
understanding,
tolerance-- from within,

00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:45.840 align:middle line:84%
we can full well expect
that the world is going

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:47.180 align:middle line:90%
to mirror that back to us.

00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is
the one principle that

00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:53.670 align:middle line:84%
may be applied to the conditions
and the suffering of our world.

00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:55.107 align:middle line:90%
I see Cody closed his book.

00:51:55.107 --> 00:51:56.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, that was only
question number one.

00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Of all the questions Cody
was going to ask us tonight,

00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:00.940 align:middle line:90%
and he's closed the book.

00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:02.780 align:middle line:90%
So he gave up.

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:04.950 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's what
we're saying here--

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>>I think Russell has
something to say to this.

00:52:07.050 --> 00:52:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>>You know, I wanted to strongly
support John Mack's comments

00:52:11.770 --> 00:52:15.780 align:middle line:84%
on the importance of
spiritual experience,

00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:17.865 align:middle line:84%
which I would tend to
call expended awareness

00:52:17.865 --> 00:52:21.200 align:middle line:84%
because as a physicist,
I don't exactly

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:22.940 align:middle line:90%
know what consciousness is.

00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:25.390 align:middle line:84%
But I know what
expanded awareness is.

00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the feeling
of oceanic connection, the idea

00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:34.550 align:middle line:84%
that we're connected
to one another--

00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:36.360 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned
earlier, the Buddhists

00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.860 align:middle line:84%
say that there's
only one of us here.

00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And other disciplines
have other ways

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:46.260 align:middle line:84%
of describing that
we are all one

00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:49.270 align:middle line:90%
in various spiritual traditions.

00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:50.560 align:middle line:90%
I think that's critical.

00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:55.190 align:middle line:84%
I think no matter how much
recycling you get people to do,

00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:58.470 align:middle line:84%
how many cans you
squash, it's not

00:52:58.470 --> 00:53:07.610 align:middle line:84%
going to elevate the awareness
that limitless problems are

00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:11.206 align:middle line:84%
caused by our ego and our
sense of tribalization.

00:53:11.206 --> 00:53:14.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a little ego
that thinks that

00:53:14.850 --> 00:53:18.190 align:middle line:84%
who we are as our physical
body that is really

00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:19.830 align:middle line:90%
the cause of the trouble.

00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And that we all want
to save the planet,

00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:25.420 align:middle line:84%
but we want our house to look
nicer and our car to be bigger.

00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:28.040 align:middle line:90%


00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:33.960 align:middle line:84%
Hafez is a Persian poet who
was 100 years after Rumi.

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Hafez sort of wrote
telegraphic little poems

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:45.090 align:middle line:84%
summarizing the ideas of
the perennial philosophy.

00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:48.860 align:middle line:84%
One of Hafez's poems
asks, why are there so

00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:53.090 align:middle line:84%
few people sitting in the
hall of the great master?

00:53:53.090 --> 00:53:58.020 align:middle line:84%
The answer is, you have to
leave a little piece of your ego

00:53:58.020 --> 00:53:59.970 align:middle line:90%
with the hat check girl.

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:01.750 align:middle line:90%
And she won't give it back.

00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:04.280 align:middle line:90%
Ouch.

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's giving up that
little piece of our ego,

00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:13.642 align:middle line:84%
that feel of separateness,
really has to be overcome.

00:54:13.642 --> 00:54:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And as John said,
that is largely

00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:20.970 align:middle line:84%
overcome through any spiritual,
mind expanding discipline--

00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:25.820 align:middle line:84%
whether it's drug induced, or
prayer induced, or meditation

00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:27.210 align:middle line:90%
induced.

00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:30.940 align:middle line:84%
As Father Thomas Keating,
who's a mystical,

00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:35.890 align:middle line:84%
visionary, Catholic priest
talks about centering prayer,

00:54:35.890 --> 00:54:39.790 align:middle line:84%
surrendering your
ego, and experiencing

00:54:39.790 --> 00:54:43.530 align:middle line:84%
God in the same path that the
Buddhists talked about doing

00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:45.030 align:middle line:90%
the exact same thing.

00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:46.613 align:middle line:84%
So I think there are
many, many paths,

00:54:46.613 --> 00:54:50.110 align:middle line:84%
whether it's prayer,
meditation, drugs allow

00:54:50.110 --> 00:54:53.040 align:middle line:84%
a person to surrender
their ego and have

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:56.490 align:middle line:84%
this experience of
oceanic connection

00:54:56.490 --> 00:54:59.590 align:middle line:84%
that makes the saving
the planet possible.

00:54:59.590 --> 00:55:02.040 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:45.578 align:middle line:90%
