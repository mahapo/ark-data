00:00:18.426 --> 00:00:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Russell Targ is a physicist
and author who is a pioneer

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.850 align:middle line:90%
in the development of the laser.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And he was co-founder of the
Stanford Research Institute's

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.230 align:middle line:84%
investigation into
psychic abilities

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.820 align:middle line:90%
in the 1970s and 1980s.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Russell is co-author
of "Mind-Reach--

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Scientists look at Psychic
Abilities" and "The Mind Race--

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Understanding and Using
Psychic Abilities."

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Russell Targ and Dr.
Jane Katra co-authored

00:00:52.990 --> 00:01:00.482 align:middle line:84%
"The Heart of the Mind-- How to
Experience God Without Belief."

00:01:00.482 --> 00:01:04.430 align:middle line:84%
During the prophets conference
Mayaland, held in the Yucatan

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.020 align:middle line:84%
this last June, Russell Targ
joined with shaman teachers

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.700 align:middle line:84%
of ancient lineage to
explore and discuss

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.840 align:middle line:84%
the clear similarities
found between remote viewing

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.090 align:middle line:90%
and shamanic practices.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.530 align:middle line:84%
Let us give a warm
welcome to Russell Targ.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.694 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:26.694 --> 00:01:29.483 align:middle line:90%


00:01:29.483 --> 00:01:30.566 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSSELL TARG: Thank you.

00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:33.650 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.260 align:middle line:84%
This is really a
homecoming for me.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.610 align:middle line:84%
I grew up on the Upper
West Side in New York City.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.187 align:middle line:84%
I went to Columbia
University where

00:01:41.187 --> 00:01:45.130 align:middle line:84%
I was a graduate student
just across the street.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's really a great privilege
to be in the Cathedral of Saint

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.805 align:middle line:90%
John the Divine.

00:01:50.805 --> 00:01:54.480 align:middle line:84%
It's really a-- I'm always
writing about miracles.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that's a miracle

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.790 align:middle line:84%
is how is it that a Jewish
kid from the Upper West Side

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.595 align:middle line:84%
should be conducting the lesson
at Saint John the Divine.

00:02:02.595 --> 00:02:04.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.930 align:middle line:84%
They would say, it only happen
in a great city like New York,

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:15.300 align:middle line:84%
as our beloved mayor
LaGuardia would always say.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.470 align:middle line:90%
But I'm very happy to be here.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.370 align:middle line:84%
But I was concerned
about speaking

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.710 align:middle line:84%
on such spiritual matters
at Saint John the Divine.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.920 align:middle line:90%
So I live in California.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.130 align:middle line:84%
So I went to talk to my
teacher, Swami Beyondananda, who

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.610 align:middle line:84%
has his ashram in Los Angeles,
in Beverly Hills actually.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Swami, what am I
going to say to these people?

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm really not
qualified as a physicist

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.950 align:middle line:84%
to be talking about spiritual
things in the great cathedral.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.570 align:middle line:84%
After all, I'm not a
minister of course.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And he took a look at
me and said, it's true.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.280 align:middle line:90%
You're actually not qualified.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.930 align:middle line:84%
But as I look at your aura, I
can see that in your past life

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.567 align:middle line:90%
you were a rabbi.

00:03:00.567 --> 00:03:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, you can tell the
people you were preordained.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.460 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And what the Swami told
me is that everything

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.140 align:middle line:84%
will be all right
if I can just keep

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.700 align:middle line:84%
an opening at the top of my
head, the famous clown chakra,

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.779 align:middle line:84%
so that you can all experience
with me in the field of farce

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:21.320 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to
be talking about.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.520 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.640 align:middle line:90%


00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.380 align:middle line:84%
What I had promised to
describe in the program

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.520 align:middle line:84%
that I'm talking about the
scientific and spiritual

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.430 align:middle line:84%
implications of
psychic abilities.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.280 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
I'm going to describe

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.410 align:middle line:84%
is what psychic
abilities might be.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And then as a scientist, I will
show some evidence supporting

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.590 align:middle line:84%
the idea that it's
actually true that we

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.210 align:middle line:90%
do have psychic abilities.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And then the most important
part of the talk for me,

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.310 align:middle line:84%
what's been interesting me
for the past many years,

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.780 align:middle line:84%
is after you've discovered that
you have psychic abilities,

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.800 align:middle line:90%
why should you care?

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.670 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.310 align:middle line:84%
It's possible you can use
your psychic abilities

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.160 align:middle line:84%
to do mundane things like
locating your car keys

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.220 align:middle line:84%
and find parking places and
investing in the silver market.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.930 align:middle line:84%
But is there more to life
than the silver market?

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
I'm going to talk about

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.010 align:middle line:84%
is what the payoff
of becoming in touch

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.020 align:middle line:90%
with your psychic abilities are.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.780 align:middle line:84%
This is a really new for me
because for the previous 20

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.280 align:middle line:84%
years I was talking to
the government and NASA

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.610 align:middle line:84%
and the CIA trying to convince
them the psychic abilities

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.980 align:middle line:90%
are real.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And after having done that and
incorporated psychic abilities

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.370 align:middle line:84%
into my life, it has become
much more interesting

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.720 align:middle line:84%
to me to find out why
a person should bother.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Why a person should care that
you have psychic abilities.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Because after all, ESP is not
as good as vision or analysis

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.820 align:middle line:84%
of the other things that work
excellently in our lives.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.650 align:middle line:84%
The most interesting
aspect of psychic abilities

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.500 align:middle line:84%
is that they've been
known for millennia.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.900 align:middle line:84%
We haven't just discovered
ESP in the laboratory,

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.530 align:middle line:84%
although we had a
lot of attention

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.570 align:middle line:84%
during the '70s, '80s, and
'90s for the ESP research

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.370 align:middle line:84%
we did at Stanford Research
Institute in California.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.740 align:middle line:84%
We had a program that was
supported by NASA, CIA, Defense

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence Agency,
and all sorts

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.800 align:middle line:84%
of other people that I
would have gone to prison

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.790 align:middle line:84%
had I talked about before I
got the material released to me

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.800 align:middle line:90%
from Freedom of Information.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.890 align:middle line:84%
So we became very skillful not
in understanding how ESP works.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.240 align:middle line:84%
But we did become
skillful in helping people

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.495 align:middle line:84%
to become aware and acquainted
with the part of themselves

00:05:52.495 --> 00:05:53.970 align:middle line:90%
that's psychic.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.050 align:middle line:84%
So there is an
aspect of our selves

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.420 align:middle line:84%
that has psychic ability
that can describe

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.290 align:middle line:84%
and experience what's
going on in distant places.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.190 align:middle line:84%
We all have that ability
and we can learn to do it.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.560 align:middle line:84%
The ability derives
from the fact

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.130 align:middle line:84%
that we live in a
non-local world.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, non-locality, as I've
discovered at this conference,

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:22.070 align:middle line:84%
has become a almost
metaphysical prospect.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.000 align:middle line:84%
But actually,
non-locality as it's

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.590 align:middle line:84%
described today
in modern physics

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.500 align:middle line:90%
has a very specific meaning.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.510 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have any metaphysical
consequences at all,

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:39.810 align:middle line:84%
but in fact is something that
Einstein observed in 1935.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Einstein said, quantum
mechanics predicts

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.460 align:middle line:84%
that if photons go off
in opposite directions

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.550 align:middle line:84%
at the speed of light
and you polarize

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.480 align:middle line:84%
the photon on the left,
then the photon on the right

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.470 align:middle line:90%
will change or notice that.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.780 align:middle line:84%
That's a prediction
of quantum mechanics.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And Einstein said that
could not be right.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.130 align:middle line:84%
So he talked about
a spooky action

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:09.480 align:middle line:84%
at a distance that strongly
violated special relativity.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Relativity says that if things
are travelling away from each

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.770 align:middle line:84%
other at the speed of light,
they cannot be connected.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.940 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's the
essence of something

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.370 align:middle line:90%
that can't be connected.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, Einstein was correct that
quantum mechanics does indeed

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.290 align:middle line:84%
predict this spooky
connection at a distance.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.630 align:middle line:84%
But he was incorrect in that
starting in 1969 physicists

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.890 align:middle line:84%
were able to demonstrate
that these photons,

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.340 align:middle line:84%
born together,
these twin photons

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.760 align:middle line:84%
remained connected
across the laboratory

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.470 align:middle line:90%
and across the world.

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Experiments started at
University of California

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:50.080 align:middle line:84%
at Berkeley showing these
photons are connected.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And experiments have now been
done in France and Zurich.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:58.170 align:middle line:84%
So that you can have a
source of photons in Zurich.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:02.080 align:middle line:84%
One goes to Basel, the
other one goes to Geneva.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.900 align:middle line:84%
A physicist in Basel
turns his polarizer.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.900 align:middle line:84%
The photon in
Geneva notices that.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.980 align:middle line:84%
This is what we call a
non-local connection.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a connection that
transcends space and time.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:18.580 align:middle line:84%
It says that things can be
separated from one another

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.370 align:middle line:90%
by physical distances.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And even though
they're separated,

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:27.350 align:middle line:84%
they still are a part of
the same wave function.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.930 align:middle line:84%
They still are connected
to one another.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.549 align:middle line:84%
This is not a
metaphysical proposition,

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:36.090 align:middle line:84%
although it's been
understood for many years.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:41.280 align:middle line:84%
J.S. Bell, who was the
discoverer of non-locality

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.539 align:middle line:84%
in this current
formulation, said

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:47.500 align:middle line:84%
that no description
of modern physics

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:53.510 align:middle line:84%
compatible with
the quantum theory

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:58.590 align:middle line:84%
that we have today, no modern
physical theory can be local

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.080 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.470 align:middle line:84%
Now this is actually
a very old idea.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.060 align:middle line:84%
In the earliest teachings
of the Buddha written

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:11.800 align:middle line:84%
in Prajnaparamita 500 years
before Christ-- prajna

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.510 align:middle line:84%
is wisdom and paramita
is the highest wisdom.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:20.420 align:middle line:84%
So Prajnaparamita, which is
the written teachings of Buddha

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.870 align:middle line:90%
that have come down to us.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.450 align:middle line:90%
There are many versions.

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:28.430 align:middle line:84%
But Prajnaparamita is very
holographic in that every page

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:31.030 align:middle line:84%
says the same thing
in different words.

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:36.180 align:middle line:84%
But it's what it's saying is so
unintuitive you have hundreds

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.230 align:middle line:84%
and hundreds of pages to
eventually internalize

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:40.850 align:middle line:90%
what they're saying.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And the basic ideas in the
earliest Buddhist teachings

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:48.470 align:middle line:84%
is that separation
is an illusion.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.940 align:middle line:84%
That our consciousness
transcends space and time.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Our awareness is
able to experience

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.720 align:middle line:84%
what's in the region where
we are, what's in the region

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.000 align:middle line:84%
beyond where we are
physically, and indeed

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.490 align:middle line:90%
into the future and the past.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's the idea that
the earliest Hindus had.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.050 align:middle line:90%
The Hindus said, all is brahman.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Brahman is the totality of
consciousness and materiality

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:19.650 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Atman is our own
consciousness, our own soul,

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.620 align:middle line:90%
our own awareness.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And the fundamental teaching
of the Hindu philosophy

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.160 align:middle line:90%
is atman month equals brahman.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:37.620 align:middle line:84%
That is, our awareness is
one with all that there is.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:41.730 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhist teaching says
that separation is an illusion

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:45.970 align:middle line:84%
so that the-- as you know,
the basic teaching of Buddhism

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:47.440 align:middle line:90%
is compassion.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that
you're compassionate

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:53.560 align:middle line:84%
is not particularly
to help other people

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.560 align:middle line:90%
and be a good Boy Scout.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.580 align:middle line:84%
The reason you're compassionate
is that there is only one of us

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.010 align:middle line:90%
here in consciousness.

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.400 align:middle line:90%
That is, we are not bodies.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.110 align:middle line:90%
We each have a body.

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:07.890 align:middle line:84%
The bodies give us an
illusion of separateness

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:08.980 align:middle line:90%
without a doubt.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.235 align:middle line:84%
Bodies have all different
kinds of shapes.

00:11:11.235 --> 00:11:15.470 align:middle line:84%
They're sources of pleasure,
sources of discomfort.

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:20.050 align:middle line:84%
We have bodies but we are not
the body that you see here.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:22.980 align:middle line:84%
What we are is
the awareness that

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.700 align:middle line:84%
is able to transcend
space and time.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.810 align:middle line:84%
We can enjoy this
expanded awareness.

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And what we notice when you go
shopping is it there's only one

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:36.300 align:middle line:90%
of us here.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:40.970 align:middle line:84%
When you go to the grocery
store or go to Radio Shack

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:45.670 align:middle line:84%
and the salesperson does
not treat you exactly

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.520 align:middle line:84%
like you think you'd
like to be treated,

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.055 align:middle line:84%
that does happen sometimes
in New York I've noticed.

00:11:50.055 --> 00:11:51.070 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And what you notice is that
that person you're looking at

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.470 align:middle line:84%
is in fact a
reflection of yourself.

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:00.270 align:middle line:84%
That that encounter
is a holy encounter,

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:03.060 align:middle line:84%
that you are seeing
yourself in the mirror

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.160 align:middle line:84%
of the hard working
person that's struggling

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.210 align:middle line:90%
to understand what you want.

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:14.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's the idea that our ego
is a source of the separateness

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.530 align:middle line:84%
and that we get very
attached to what

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:19.782 align:middle line:84%
we're wearing, how our hair is
combed, who we think we are.

00:12:19.782 --> 00:12:22.450 align:middle line:84%
We all carry little
cards with us.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And what these cards actually
are, are story cards.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.480 align:middle line:90%
They're not business cards.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.701 align:middle line:84%
It's a story of who
we think we are today.

00:12:30.701 --> 00:12:32.450 align:middle line:84%
I look at my story
card, and it says today

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:36.240 align:middle line:84%
and I'm a physicist here talking
at Saint John the Divine.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.110 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow I may have a
totally different story.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And we get very attached
to these stories.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:48.080 align:middle line:84%
But what we discover
as we get increasingly

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.170 align:middle line:84%
in touch with the
psychic part of ourselves

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:55.700 align:middle line:84%
and that awareness can expand
through space and time,

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.885 align:middle line:84%
these stories surprisingly
become less interesting.

00:12:58.885 --> 00:13:01.570 align:middle line:90%


00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:05.020 align:middle line:84%
What the spiritual
teachers tell us

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:09.640 align:middle line:84%
is that we have the opportunity
for expanded awareness

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:15.740 align:middle line:84%
to describe different modes
being, different ways of being

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.330 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And we have a choice as to
how we're going to do that.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:23.630 align:middle line:84%
In psychic abilities,
for example,

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:27.270 align:middle line:84%
you have the opportunity
to inflow information

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.470 align:middle line:90%
from a distant place.

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:33.070 align:middle line:84%
This is called remote viewing,
where you can stand here

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:35.740 align:middle line:84%
and psychically or
clairvoyantly experience

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:39.100 align:middle line:84%
what's going on a
different distant place.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, you can outflow
your healing intention

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:49.550 align:middle line:84%
to heal people who are sick or
suffering in a distant place.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Between the inflow in the
outflow is a quiet place

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.360 align:middle line:84%
that you discover when you learn
to quiet the ongoing chatter.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And in that quiet place,
you have an opportunity

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:06.510 align:middle line:84%
to reside in a loving space
that the mystics talk about

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.940 align:middle line:90%
for millennia.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:13.990 align:middle line:84%
That quiet place has
many different names.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:17.420 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhists talk
about residing in love.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:20.940 align:middle line:84%
You have an opportunity
to experience

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:23.540 align:middle line:84%
the oceanic
connection to all that

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:27.310 align:middle line:84%
is, to all the forms
of consciousness

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:28.550 align:middle line:90%
that there is in the world.

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And you can experience
that directly

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.540 align:middle line:90%
in this loving, quiet state.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And have an opportunity to be
out of time and out of space

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:43.430 align:middle line:84%
and discover that you have
within you the love that you're

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:45.260 align:middle line:90%
looking for.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Now this experience can be found
in a variety of different ways.

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:53.500 align:middle line:84%
It could be found
through meditation,

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.940 align:middle line:84%
which is the traditional
Hindu or Buddhist way.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:00.490 align:middle line:84%
It can be found through
centering prayer.

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:03.045 align:middle line:84%
I had the privilege of sitting
with Thomas Keating, who

00:15:03.045 --> 00:15:07.350 align:middle line:84%
is a great Catholic mystic
who teaches centering prayer.

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:09.320 align:middle line:84%
You can choose a
word or a phrase

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:13.170 align:middle line:84%
or an idea to focus your
mind upon and achieve

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:16.900 align:middle line:84%
the same quietness that
the Buddhists talk about.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:22.210 align:middle line:84%
There's also drug experiences
that we heard about yesterday.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And there are many different
paths you can follow.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.230 align:middle line:84%
I've had an opportunity
to follow many of those.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:33.270 align:middle line:84%
I had the privilege of sitting
with Ram Dass a number of years

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:38.120 align:middle line:84%
ago just after he was
recovering from his stroke.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things--
he had a meeting

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:44.240 align:middle line:84%
with people on the West Coast
who think about these things

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:44.740 align:middle line:90%
and teach.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it's very important
that those of you who finally

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.830 align:middle line:84%
cracked open your
analytical mind

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:57.950 align:middle line:84%
and had an experience of God
or a transcendent experience,

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:00.990 align:middle line:84%
if you've had that
experience through drugs,

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:04.260 align:middle line:84%
it's a lie to pretend that
you had the experience

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.870 align:middle line:90%
from a lifetime of meditation.

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:08.750 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
things that he said

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:11.320 align:middle line:84%
is that it's time
the teachers who've

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:16.100 align:middle line:84%
had the benefit of a variety
of different mind opening

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.680 align:middle line:84%
chemicals, it's time
to tell the truth

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.330 align:middle line:84%
and describe that these
chemicals can give you

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:25.090 align:middle line:84%
an experience of
quieting your mind,

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:29.660 align:middle line:84%
residing in a loving state,
discovering that there is more

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.430 align:middle line:84%
to you than is on
your business card

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:39.170 align:middle line:84%
and that the awareness you have
transcends your physical body.

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:42.540 align:middle line:84%
So there are many paths
to this awareness.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And this has been taught
by mystics throughout ages.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.820 align:middle line:84%
That is, all the mystics
are teaching the same thing.

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.100 align:middle line:84%
The great surprise as
I became interested

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:59.090 align:middle line:84%
in this, that is the
teaching of oneness

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:01.450 align:middle line:84%
is the universal
teaching-- a mystical

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:04.260 align:middle line:84%
is a person who doesn't
ask you to believe a thing.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.060 align:middle line:90%
That's very important.

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:09.440 align:middle line:90%
There's the mystic Sufis.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.670 align:middle line:84%
So you have the direct
experience of God

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:12.470 align:middle line:90%
that's available.

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:16.490 align:middle line:84%
The Kabbalistic Jews say that
if you will study the Kabbalah

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:21.960 align:middle line:84%
you can go directly to Ein
Sof and be one with God.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:26.730 align:middle line:84%
In the Christian tradition,
the Gnostic Christians

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:31.400 align:middle line:84%
said that we are still receiving
the direct transmission

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.140 align:middle line:90%
of Jesus.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:36.650 align:middle line:84%
Jesus' physical body is
gone, but we, 100 years

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:39.890 align:middle line:84%
after the death of
Christ, do not need

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:43.250 align:middle line:90%
bishops or priests or deacons.

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is still
transmitting to us

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.460 align:middle line:84%
and we are still experiencing
the transmission.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:56.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's quite interesting
that the mystic Christians

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:58.580 align:middle line:84%
or like Gnostics
or the Kabbalistic

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:03.350 align:middle line:84%
Jews or the Buddhists or
the Hindus, they all agree.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:06.290 align:middle line:84%
There's no disagreement
about the fact

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:09.960 align:middle line:84%
that it's possible
to quiet your mind,

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:14.290 align:middle line:84%
reside in love as a
place to live your life.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:17.385 align:middle line:84%
This is not about
boyfriends and girlfriends.

00:18:17.385 --> 00:18:21.270 align:middle line:84%
It's actually beyond
relationships.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:22.690 align:middle line:90%
I know it's hard to believe.

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:28.320 align:middle line:84%
But it's possible to reside in
a loving space through your day.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And after you've discovered
that the love you're looking for

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:34.890 align:middle line:84%
is within you, it
is quite likely

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:38.080 align:middle line:90%
going to change your life.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.680 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I had this experience.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.130 align:middle line:90%
I was an aerospace engineer.

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And I had done that for many
years and I was well paid

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.280 align:middle line:84%
and what I was doing
was quite interesting.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And as I went through
this process putting

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:56.230 align:middle line:84%
lasers on spacecraft
simply became boring.

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:57.600 align:middle line:90%
Became absurd.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.040 align:middle line:84%
It no longer seemed
like an appropriate way

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.890 align:middle line:84%
to spend my time since I had the
feeling that other people could

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:05.930 align:middle line:90%
do that.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And there are fewer
people who were

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:11.510 align:middle line:84%
going to stand up
and say that you have

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:15.330 align:middle line:84%
the love within you that
you're looking for in a way

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:19.320 align:middle line:84%
to try and encourage
people to look inside

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:23.200 align:middle line:84%
through some kind of procedure,
whether it's meditation

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.410 align:middle line:84%
or prayer or some other
approach to discover

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:30.420 align:middle line:84%
that what all of the
mystics have been saying

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:34.390 align:middle line:84%
is something that's
available to us today.

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Now this experience
of oceanic connection,

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:42.210 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity to reside
in a kind of loving syrup,

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:45.655 align:middle line:84%
is an idea this common
to all traditions.

00:19:45.655 --> 00:19:48.350 align:middle line:90%


00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:52.750 align:middle line:84%
It could even be the
equivalent to saying,

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:56.225 align:middle line:84%
we are experiencing love
or we are experiencing God.

00:19:56.225 --> 00:19:58.750 align:middle line:90%


00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:03.030 align:middle line:84%
In my upbringing as
a Jewish physicist,

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:06.670 align:middle line:84%
I always would hear, in
the Christian theology

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:09.570 align:middle line:84%
on Sunday morning they
would say, God is love.

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And nobody ever
unpacked that for me.

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.306 align:middle line:84%
I thought that's something
that ministers say just

00:20:14.306 --> 00:20:15.430 align:middle line:90%
to annoy the non-believers.

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:18.690 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:21.070 align:middle line:90%


00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:24.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's quite interesting
is that what you have is

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:26.330 align:middle line:90%
a different spiritual writings.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:28.335 align:middle line:84%
You have the Koran
and the New Testament

00:20:28.335 --> 00:20:33.180 align:middle line:84%
and the Old Testament
and the Bhagavad Gita

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:36.200 align:middle line:90%
and the writings of Buddha.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.400 align:middle line:84%
They are all trying
to remind you

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:43.600 align:middle line:84%
that you are already connected
to a kind of psychic internet.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.100 align:middle line:84%
You have that
connection within you.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:50.800 align:middle line:84%
We all have this ability
to reside in love.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.340 align:middle line:84%
But each of the different
organized religion

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:59.260 align:middle line:84%
has different software
available to make

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:03.160 align:middle line:84%
you aware of the
connection between yourself

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.780 align:middle line:84%
and the psychic internet that
you're already connected to.

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.610 align:middle line:84%
The thing that's very amazing is
that all the religious strife,

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:12.590 align:middle line:84%
all the holy wars,
are over software.

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:16.220 align:middle line:84%
It's not over religious
differences at all.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.850 align:middle line:84%
It's over simply
what process are

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:21.750 align:middle line:84%
you going to use
to awaken yourself,

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:26.710 align:middle line:84%
to wake up to the fact that you
have this connection already

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:29.070 align:middle line:90%
hardwired in you.

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:31.560 align:middle line:84%
The Harvard philosopher
says that God

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.480 align:middle line:84%
is a testable
hypothesis, that we're

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:40.960 align:middle line:84%
hardwired for God, that we have
an innate desire and capability

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.630 align:middle line:84%
to have this
religious experience.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Herbert Benson is the one who
talked about the relaxation

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:48.990 align:middle line:90%
response.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Relaxation response is Harvard
code for quieting your mind

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:58.430 align:middle line:84%
and having a
transcendent experience.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:01.195 align:middle line:84%
God and Harvard have always
had a hard time together.

00:22:01.195 --> 00:22:02.250 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:10.160 align:middle line:84%
So they talk about relaxation
response, but in recent years

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Herbert Benson is
talking about the fact

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:14.360 align:middle line:90%
that we are hardwired for God.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:18.960 align:middle line:84%
We have an innate desire
to have this experience.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And the experience is something
that is part of a path.

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:24.870 align:middle line:90%
It shows up.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:30.530 align:middle line:84%
The Hindu teacher Patanjali,
who was 100 years after Buddha--

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Patanjali was a great teacher
and grammarian and logician.

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:38.980 align:middle line:90%
This is 400 years before Christ.

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:45.060 align:middle line:84%
Patanjali is leading us in
his book "How to Know God."

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.230 align:middle line:84%
You can tell that he's a
great teacher because his book

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:53.210 align:middle line:84%
written 2,400 years ago is still
available at Barnes & Noble's.

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:56.960 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
great enduring classic.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And Patanjali is
principally telling us

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:03.280 align:middle line:84%
how to quiet our minds
to experience God.

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And he says, along
the way you will

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.730 align:middle line:84%
have certain
interesting experiences.

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:11.680 align:middle line:84%
You will discover that you
can look into the distance,

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:15.560 align:middle line:84%
you can look into the future,
you can heal the sick,

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.550 align:middle line:90%
you can diagnose illnesses.

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And these abilities
will come to you.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And he describes
in great detail how

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:27.130 align:middle line:84%
you are able to do that and
the things that interfere

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:29.000 align:middle line:90%
with your ability to do that.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.040 align:middle line:84%
He talks about the
fact that your memory

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:36.340 align:middle line:84%
and your imagination and your
analysis and your guessing

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:39.500 align:middle line:84%
interfere with your
innate capacity

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:43.360 align:middle line:84%
to experience what's
hidden from view.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.310 align:middle line:84%
He says, but it's very
important to notice

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:50.780 align:middle line:84%
that as these abilities
begin to appear,

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.990 align:middle line:84%
the good news is that you are
learning to quiet your mind.

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:59.450 align:middle line:84%
You're learning to stop and
stifle the ongoing chatter.

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:01.130 align:middle line:84%
However, it's very
important not to get

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:03.580 align:middle line:90%
attached to this ability.

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:07.670 align:middle line:84%
These abilities are
just more phenomena.

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And what Patanjali
is trying to do

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:12.740 align:middle line:84%
is lead us to an experience
of transcendence.

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:15.690 align:middle line:84%
He's trying to lead
us to experience

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:18.250 align:middle line:90%
outside of ourselves.

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Now many people get attached
to the idea, my goodness,

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:26.190 align:middle line:90%
I can find parking places.

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:30.640 align:middle line:84%
I've learned to quiet my
mind and do a procedure that

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:35.400 align:middle line:84%
allows me to use my psychic
ability to forecast the stock

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.691 align:middle line:90%
market.

00:24:36.691 --> 00:24:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Now one of the interesting
things that you've probably

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:43.750 align:middle line:84%
heard is that it's like as if
God won't let you use your ESP

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:45.540 align:middle line:90%
to enrich yourself.

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:46.365 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

00:24:46.365 --> 00:24:52.032 align:middle line:90%


00:24:52.032 --> 00:24:56.010 align:middle line:84%
In the '80s, I did a long
series of experiments

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:59.370 align:middle line:84%
forecasting silver
commodity futures

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:00.945 align:middle line:90%
and was extremely successful.

00:25:00.945 --> 00:25:04.500 align:middle line:84%
I was working with an
enthusiastic investor.

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And we, not to dwell on it, we
made nine significant forecast

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:14.780 align:middle line:84%
where the silver market would
go up a little or up a lot

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.790 align:middle line:84%
of or down a little
or down a lot.

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And all nine of our
forecasts were correct.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And that supported
our group for a year.

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:26.583 align:middle line:84%
So it's definitely possible
to use your ability

00:25:26.583 --> 00:25:34.380 align:middle line:84%
to interact with the material
plane, even in the future.

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And as I moved
along in my path, I

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:43.150 align:middle line:84%
wrote another book recently
called "Miracles of Mind."

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And my co-author is a
healer, Jane Kantra.

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And our publisher
said, if you're

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.290 align:middle line:84%
going to tell people
how to develop

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:53.490 align:middle line:84%
their psychic
abilities, you really

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:56.990 align:middle line:84%
ought to demonstrate that
ordinary people can do that.

00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:02.810 align:middle line:84%
So Jane and I, together with two
other people who monitored us,

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:08.200 align:middle line:84%
we went out to recapitulate the
silver forecasting experiment.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And just sitting on the
floor in our living room

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:14.010 align:middle line:84%
across the coffee table
week after week, we

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:17.010 align:middle line:84%
made 12 forecasts for the
silver commodity future

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:19.700 align:middle line:90%
and 11 out of 12 were correct.

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So shows that even authors
and teachers and scientists

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:28.130 align:middle line:84%
can learn to get in touch
with psychic abilities

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:32.150 align:middle line:84%
with surprising accuracy
and reliability.

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:35.890 align:middle line:90%
And we describe how to do that.

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:42.790 align:middle line:84%
The idea of pre-cognition is
one of the great mysteries.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:47.300 align:middle line:84%
I will try only to tell you
true things today, the things

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:50.330 align:middle line:84%
that I've published
in the proceeding

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.520 align:middle line:84%
of the Electrical
Engineering Society

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:57.300 align:middle line:84%
or in "Nature" journal or the
American Academy of Sciences.

00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:03.697 align:middle line:84%
All of the miracles-- see, when
we publish scientific findings

00:27:03.697 --> 00:27:05.780 align:middle line:84%
what you do is you take
something that's basically

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:08.880 align:middle line:84%
a miracle and then
you wrap it up

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:14.000 align:middle line:84%
with the formalisms
and the introductions

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.610 align:middle line:84%
and the references that make it
look like a scientific paper.

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:21.450 align:middle line:84%
But it's basically
a miracle wrapped up

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:24.630 align:middle line:84%
in the academic apparatus
to make it look as though we

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:25.920 align:middle line:90%
understand what we're doing.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.800 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:32.920 align:middle line:84%
But it's important to have
your findings peer reviewed

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.540 align:middle line:84%
and published in a
bona fide journal

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:40.480 align:middle line:84%
so that if you say, why should
I believe this material you're

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.550 align:middle line:84%
telling me I can say,
well, we've published it

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:47.420 align:middle line:84%
and people have replicated
what we have found.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:50.830 align:middle line:84%
They replicated in laboratories
all over the world.

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:53.900 align:middle line:84%
We don't entirely
understand how it works.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And if we have
time at the end, I

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.940 align:middle line:84%
can tell you how
this might work.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:00.690 align:middle line:84%
What kind of reproach
might we make

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:05.040 align:middle line:84%
between what we see in the
laboratory and the nature

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.060 align:middle line:84%
of the physical
universe that allows

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:10.510 align:middle line:90%
us to transcend space and time?

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:13.760 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that we
can expand our awareness

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.410 align:middle line:84%
and have these
experiences has now

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:20.900 align:middle line:84%
been demonstrated very
reliably for more than 30 years

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:25.530 align:middle line:84%
after our-- we didn't invent
psychic abilities, obviously,

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:27.860 align:middle line:90%
at Stanford Research Institute.

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.660 align:middle line:84%
But we found a particular
way of teaching people

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:34.730 align:middle line:84%
how to get in touch with the
part of themself that's psychic

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:37.560 align:middle line:84%
so that they can have these
experiences of expanded

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.440 align:middle line:84%
awareness and incorporate
them into their lives.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, the teachers,
historically--

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:48.590 align:middle line:84%
the mystic teachers were
not interested in publishing

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:51.120 align:middle line:84%
their findings in the
Engineering Society

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.080 align:middle line:84%
or even forecasting
silver futures.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:57.800 align:middle line:84%
So there's a difference between
different kinds of things

00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.470 align:middle line:90%
that I could tell you about.

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Quieting your mind
certainly will help

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.410 align:middle line:90%
you lower your blood pressure.

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:06.920 align:middle line:84%
If you can learn to
go through your day

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:11.450 align:middle line:84%
and give up some
of your judgment

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:14.650 align:middle line:84%
and fear and attachment--
in New York judgment

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:18.630 align:middle line:84%
is particularly hard
to give up I noticed.

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Judgment is very
interesting in that

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.990 align:middle line:84%
as you discover-- because
we're very good analysts.

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:28.010 align:middle line:84%
All of us here a
very good analysts.

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:31.090 align:middle line:84%
We can tell with great
precision everything

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:33.830 align:middle line:84%
that's the matter with the
person sitting next to us.

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And we've gotten very
skillful at that.

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:38.420 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't serve us.

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.560 align:middle line:90%
It's like a trick.

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:44.340 align:middle line:84%
What you discover is that
when you give up judgment,

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:48.820 align:middle line:84%
not only are you a more pleasant
person, but you feel better.

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Because the person you're
judging is, in fact, yourself.

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:56.140 align:middle line:84%
You're comparing,
how am I compared

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:59.670 align:middle line:84%
with this person and that
person and the other person?

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:06.060 align:middle line:84%
So giving up judgment is a
surprising almost shocking way

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:08.590 align:middle line:90%
of giving up your own suffering.

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And after a while, you find
that your snappy friends

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:21.140 align:middle line:84%
who have a caustic,
correct, and astute word

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:25.010 align:middle line:84%
to say about everybody
else, those friends

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:29.950 align:middle line:84%
become very uninteresting
because they cause us pain.

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:33.400 align:middle line:84%
What we discover after a
while is that judgment,

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.940 align:middle line:84%
although is very
entertaining, actually causes

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:39.610 align:middle line:84%
pain for the person
who's doing the judging.

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And that really was a very
surprising thing for me

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:47.940 align:middle line:84%
to discover, that because
there is only one of us

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:52.390 align:middle line:84%
here in consciousness
whatever judging we do

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:54.240 align:middle line:90%
causes pain do our own selves.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.860 align:middle line:90%


00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:59.670 align:middle line:84%
It's like having
resentment about somebody

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:03.000 align:middle line:84%
and carrying that
resentment around with you.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.430 align:middle line:84%
It's equivalent to saying,
that person is really

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:09.930 align:middle line:84%
a no good person
and every day I'm

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:12.860 align:middle line:84%
going to drink a little
poison to show him

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:15.610 align:middle line:90%
what a lousy person he is.

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And many people do that
throughout their whole lives.

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:27.430 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of incorporating
some measure of forgiveness

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:31.120 align:middle line:84%
into your life is not
to say that you forget

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.950 align:middle line:90%
what somebody has done to you.

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:36.320 align:middle line:84%
But what you want to do
is get that person out

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.990 align:middle line:84%
of your backpack so you
don't have to carry them

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:40.830 align:middle line:90%
around every day with you.

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:45.765 align:middle line:84%
It feels amazing to lighten up
and give up the burden of who

00:31:45.765 --> 00:31:48.190 align:middle line:90%
you've been carrying around.

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:53.710 align:middle line:84%
Now these ideas
are very valuable.

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:56.040 align:middle line:84%
They've been part of the
perennial philosophy taught

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.570 align:middle line:90%
for years.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think of them in
the general category

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:02.150 align:middle line:90%
of self-improvement.

00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing the
matter with self-improvement.

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:07.570 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what I'm
talking about today.

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:10.300 align:middle line:84%
The difference between
self-improvement

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:13.690 align:middle line:90%
and self-realization.

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:19.452 align:middle line:84%
In self-realization
you, in addition

00:32:19.452 --> 00:32:25.720 align:middle line:84%
to becoming aware of the
desirability of forgiveness

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:31.080 align:middle line:84%
and a degree of surrendering
our judgments-- in addition

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:34.290 align:middle line:84%
to that self-realization
allows you

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:41.320 align:middle line:84%
to go through your day residing
in a loving space surrounded

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:45.310 align:middle line:84%
with your own
awareness that you have

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:49.260 align:middle line:84%
within you the love
that you're traveling

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:50.990 align:middle line:90%
around the city looking for.

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:52.730 align:middle line:90%
And that's a big surprise.

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:56.570 align:middle line:84%
The payoff for
expanded awareness

00:32:56.570 --> 00:33:00.110 align:middle line:84%
or quieting your mind
or meditation or drugs

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:03.540 align:middle line:84%
or centering prayer,
the payoff for that

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:07.770 align:middle line:84%
is not a cool
experience, but rather

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:11.350 align:middle line:84%
is to discover who you
are, to get in touch

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:15.490 align:middle line:84%
with the idea of who you
are in Christian terms

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:21.990 align:middle line:84%
as a child of God, in the
more mystical terms as one

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:23.330 align:middle line:90%
with the universe.

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:25.250 align:middle line:84%
Because Eisenstein
was often asked

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:27.190 align:middle line:90%
whether he believed in God.

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And what he said
is that he believes

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:31.590 align:middle line:84%
in the god of Spinoza,
which is the organizing

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:33.720 align:middle line:90%
principle of the universe.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:40.040 align:middle line:84%
So we are one with all
that there is available.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is not a
metaphysical principle

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:46.650 align:middle line:84%
because our evidence shows
that when you quiet your mind

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:51.860 align:middle line:84%
you have the opportunity to
be out of time, out of space,

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:54.340 align:middle line:90%
and reside in love.

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And just as a way of
manifesting that, say

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:00.540 align:middle line:84%
is this a metaphysical
principle?

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Is this a Sunday
school class or can

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:06.390 align:middle line:90%
we really expand our awareness?

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:10.179 align:middle line:84%
What we have found is
that in the laboratory

00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:14.500 align:middle line:84%
it is surprisingly easy to
show people how to do this.

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:15.889 align:middle line:84%
So if we can dim
the lights, I'll

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:19.750 align:middle line:84%
show you a little bit
about what we were up to

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:23.239 align:middle line:90%
at Stanford Research Institute.

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:25.520 align:middle line:84%
The way the story
got started is that I

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:29.159 align:middle line:84%
had a long time in
psychic abilities.

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:33.020 align:middle line:84%
At the same time I was a physics
student here at Columbia,

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:35.750 align:middle line:84%
I was also doing
magic on the stage.

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And what I discovered in
doing magic on the stage

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:43.080 align:middle line:84%
and doing mental magic
is that oftentimes I

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:47.177 align:middle line:84%
would have people put
questions in a jar

00:34:47.177 --> 00:34:49.010 align:middle line:84%
and then I would pretend
to read their mind,

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:50.520 align:middle line:90%
answer their questions.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.812 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I had
already read the questions.

00:34:52.812 --> 00:34:54.610 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:57.030 align:middle line:84%
So I would hold a piece
of paper up my forehead

00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:00.260 align:middle line:84%
and say, there's a
woman in the audience

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:02.972 align:middle line:90%
and she's lost her dog.

00:35:02.972 --> 00:35:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that
because I'd already

00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:07.700 align:middle line:84%
read that there's a woman in
the audience who'd lost her dog.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.750 align:middle line:84%
But with the light
shining in my eyes,

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:13.150 align:middle line:84%
I could go into this
wonderful hypnogogic state

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:15.130 align:middle line:90%
and see her house.

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And I could say-- I
would say first of all,

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:19.772 align:middle line:84%
is there a woman here
who has lost her dog?

00:35:19.772 --> 00:35:20.730 align:middle line:90%
And she'd say, oh, yes.

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:21.229 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:21.229 --> 00:35:22.350 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that amazing?

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And I would say,
well, I see your house

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.380 align:middle line:84%
and it's got a white
fence and a tree in front

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:30.260 align:middle line:84%
and you've got a patchwork
quilt on your bed.

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:32.330 align:middle line:90%
And that was real magic.

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Because that wasn't
on a piece of paper.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And what I discovered, much
to my 20-year-old amazement,

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:42.540 align:middle line:84%
is that I could
supplement my trickery

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.230 align:middle line:90%
by genuine psychic ability.

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Now you've got to
be aware that there

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:50.500 align:middle line:84%
are plenty of psychics
out on the street who

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:54.265 align:middle line:84%
supplement their ESP by whatever
trickery they can get away

00:35:54.265 --> 00:35:54.765 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:35:54.765 --> 00:35:55.740 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:58.210 align:middle line:90%
So that works both ways.

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:01.630 align:middle line:84%
But as a young magician,
as a young science student,

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:03.960 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was more
interesting to learn

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:08.710 align:middle line:84%
about these psychic ability than
to just go on deceiving people.

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:12.150 align:middle line:84%
So I became in contact
with J.B. Rhine

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:16.130 align:middle line:84%
at Duke University who was
a pioneer in parapsychology.

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And started
discovering for myself

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:25.330 align:middle line:84%
ways to teach people to get
in touch with the psychic part

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:27.340 align:middle line:90%
of themselves.

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:33.190 align:middle line:84%
So I formed together with
my colleague Hal Puthoff,

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:34.790 align:middle line:90%
another layer physicist.

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Coincidence that
two laser physicists

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:44.740 align:middle line:84%
were able to start a ESP program
at Stanford Research Institute.

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:48.930 align:middle line:84%
But we felt that
during the Cold War

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:51.670 align:middle line:84%
psychic abilities might
actually be useful.

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And of course the CIA is not
anybody's favorite customer.

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:59.170 align:middle line:84%
But as scientists, we
felt that intelligence

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:02.230 align:middle line:84%
is much to be
preferred to ignorance.

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:04.330 align:middle line:84%
So we went to the
CIA and said, we

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:07.730 align:middle line:84%
think we have the
ability to describe

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:11.470 align:middle line:84%
distant places in a way
that would be useful to you.

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And the CIA gave us some
demonstration of ability tasks

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:16.810 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And that was successful and
we then had a 20 year research

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.390 align:middle line:90%
activity.

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:25.910 align:middle line:84%
One of the many
things that-- evidence

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:28.630 align:middle line:84%
we can offer for the existence
of psychic abilities--

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:32.370 align:middle line:84%
if any of you have ever tried to
get money from the government,

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:36.475 align:middle line:84%
you can appreciate we had
an ESP program spending

00:37:36.475 --> 00:37:40.380 align:middle line:84%
a couple of million a
year that was renewed year

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:45.620 align:middle line:84%
after year for 20 years
for doing psychic research.

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:49.300 align:middle line:84%
So I would have to ask you to
consider that it must be pretty

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.440 align:middle line:84%
likely that we were
doing something

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:54.020 align:middle line:84%
useful for our sponsor
or they wouldn't

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:58.770 align:middle line:84%
keep renewing our program
year after year for 20 years.

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:04.290 align:middle line:84%
One of the very psychic people
we worked with a policeman

00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:06.110 align:middle line:90%
named Pat Price.

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Pat had heard of
our work and he said

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:13.380 align:middle line:84%
that he had been using
psychic abilities for years

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:16.300 align:middle line:90%
to catch criminals.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.675 align:middle line:84%
As he would sit
in the dispatch--

00:38:17.675 --> 00:38:20.299 align:middle line:84%
he was the police
commissioner of Burbank.

00:38:20.299 --> 00:38:21.965 align:middle line:84%
And he would sit in
his office and would

00:38:21.965 --> 00:38:25.130 align:middle line:84%
hear of a crime being committed
and would then send out

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:28.430 align:middle line:84%
a squad car in his
city to pick up

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:31.610 align:middle line:84%
a man who he sensed
as a frightened man

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:34.540 align:middle line:84%
at a particular
street intersection.

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And he came to us and with a
scrapbook full of testimonials

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:42.800 align:middle line:84%
to his psychic prowess showing
how he had used his ESP

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.770 align:middle line:90%
to catch criminals.

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:46.580 align:middle line:84%
So one of the picture--
I have six pictures

00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:49.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show you from
our many years of work

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:54.110 align:middle line:84%
to give you an idea of
what we had been up to.

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:56.810 align:middle line:84%
In this case, all
of these experiments

00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:58.750 align:middle line:84%
are a kind of psychic
hide and go seek.

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:01.630 align:middle line:84%
I had really found a
very entertaining way

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:04.075 align:middle line:84%
to employ myself for
this period of time.

00:39:04.075 --> 00:39:06.290 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:09.400 align:middle line:84%
The way this works is that I
would sit in the laboratory,

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:12.960 align:middle line:84%
usually in an electrically
shielded room,

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.230 align:middle line:90%
in Menlo Park, California.

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:17.320 align:middle line:84%
I would be sitting there
with the psychic du

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:19.380 align:middle line:90%
jour, whoever it was.

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:24.300 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a policemen or
a army officer or a cabinet

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:26.500 align:middle line:84%
level official from
the government.

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:30.020 align:middle line:84%
I would be sitting with this
person in the laboratory.

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And one or more
other people would

00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:37.720 align:middle line:84%
go and hide themselves someplace
in the San Francisco Bay Area.

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't know
where they had gone

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:43.190 align:middle line:84%
or even where they
might have gone.

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I can
tell you off to the side

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:51.040 align:middle line:84%
is that both the psychic and
the interviewer in this case

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:56.410 align:middle line:84%
don't want to know anything
about the psychic answer.

00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:59.050 align:middle line:84%
If you ever go to a
psychic-- if you ever

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:01.690 align:middle line:84%
go to Madame
Catherine on Broadway

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:06.420 align:middle line:84%
to find out who you're going
to marry and you sit down,

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:08.750 align:middle line:84%
if she's a genuine
psychic she'll say,

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:11.250 align:middle line:90%
don't tell me a thing.

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you
about who you are.

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And as you recognize the
truth of what I'm saying,

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:19.740 align:middle line:90%
I will drift into your future.

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:23.980 align:middle line:84%
If she says, well, I'd like to
know your name, your birthdate,

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:28.510 align:middle line:84%
and where you were born, pack
up and go someplace else.

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Because a true psychic
doesn't want to know anything.

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:36.190 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the things
that we do understand.

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:40.060 align:middle line:84%
Is that anything
you tell a psychic

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:45.430 align:middle line:84%
by way of analytical information
will cloud up and make dirty

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:47.300 align:middle line:90%
her mental slate.

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:51.190 align:middle line:84%
What she wants to do is sit
down with you, close her eyes,

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:54.590 align:middle line:84%
and experience the
images that come.

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So if you tell her your
name is Mary Greenberg

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:00.650 align:middle line:84%
and you live in
Brooklyn, she already

00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:03.190 align:middle line:84%
has a whole picture of
you and your grandmother

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:06.130 align:middle line:84%
and your borscht and
the synagogue you go to.

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And all of that
tremendously interferes

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:13.560 align:middle line:84%
with her ability to do what
you're asking her to do.

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:18.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's not as though somebody's
going to whisper in my ear,

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:21.114 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be in
northern California.

00:41:21.114 --> 00:41:22.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
know where they're

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:26.600 align:middle line:84%
going to go because everything
you tell me about the target

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:30.380 align:middle line:84%
interferes with my ability
to help the psychic describe

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:31.540 align:middle line:90%
the target.

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:34.560 align:middle line:84%
So in this case I'm
sitting with the policemen.

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And he would polish his
glasses and sit back

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:40.230 align:middle line:90%
and close his eyes.

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And what he said is that I see a
rectangular pool here 68 by 75,

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:47.470 align:middle line:90%
said he.

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And the round pool,
100 feet in diameter.

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And then there's this
little block house he drew.

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:57.560 align:middle line:90%
He said, that's what I get.

00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:00.780 align:middle line:84%
Now as we were
taken, an hour later,

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:03.520 align:middle line:84%
to the target where
they had actually gone,

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:06.740 align:middle line:84%
it turned out that our
laboratory director and one

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:10.840 align:middle line:84%
of the CIA visitors-- we had
a constant parade of visitors

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:14.040 align:middle line:84%
to see how we could
possibly be cheating.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:17.390 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, the CIA
guy chose the target.

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:20.130 align:middle line:84%
He said, let's drive it
I'll tell you where to stop.

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And they stopped at a
swimming pool complex

00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:26.640 align:middle line:84%
called Rinconada Pool about
five miles from SRI, Stanford

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.240 align:middle line:90%
Research Institute.

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And the pool was really
110 feet in diameter

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:35.040 align:middle line:84%
and this pool was,
I think, 75 by 100.

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:38.420 align:middle line:84%
So sitting in Menlo
Park five miles away,

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:41.860 align:middle line:84%
the policeman was able
to describe the target

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:45.569 align:middle line:84%
with accuracy of
greater than 90%.

00:42:45.569 --> 00:42:47.860 align:middle line:84%
That's good for another year's
renewal of the contract.

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:50.720 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:54.426 align:middle line:84%
But Price went on
to say, I know what

00:42:54.426 --> 00:42:55.550 align:middle line:90%
this is from my experience.

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:58.640 align:middle line:84%
This is a water
purification plant

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:03.140 align:middle line:84%
as we were still sitting back in
the electrically shielded room.

00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I see these
two big water tanks.

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:08.595 align:middle line:84%
That's how I know it's a
water purification plant.

00:43:08.595 --> 00:43:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And I should say, we're
in a shielded room

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:14.830 align:middle line:84%
because we wanted to make sure
that no confederate-- this is

00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:17.000 align:middle line:84%
from the days we were
working with Uri Geller.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.500 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to make sure
that no confederate would

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:26.370 align:middle line:84%
send a radio signal in to inform
the psychic covertly of what

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:27.740 align:middle line:90%
the target was.

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:29.940 align:middle line:84%
What we discovered
is the psychics

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:32.490 align:middle line:90%
liked being the shielded room.

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:35.260 align:middle line:84%
So we continued to work
there because it turned out

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:37.060 align:middle line:90%
to be a good environment.

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:39.910 align:middle line:84%
But Price saw these
two big water tanks.

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And when we got
to Rinconada Park

00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:44.070 align:middle line:84%
there were, in fact,
no water tanks at all.

00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:47.280 align:middle line:84%
It was a lovely public park with
green grass and two swimming

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.640 align:middle line:90%
pools.

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:52.600 align:middle line:84%
So my story had been
for about a decade

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:55.940 align:middle line:84%
that Price is a
prodigious psychic who

00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:59.440 align:middle line:84%
was able to describe this
thing with great accuracy.

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:07.370 align:middle line:84%
However, his analytical mind
created these water tanks out

00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:09.690 align:middle line:90%
of his memory and imagination.

00:44:09.690 --> 00:44:11.850 align:middle line:84%
So we call that
analytic overlay.

00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Ingo Swann was a great psychic
in New York and an artist

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:18.790 align:middle line:84%
who taught us how to
do remote viewing.

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:22.130 align:middle line:84%
Swann talked about the
problems of analytical overlay

00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:27.450 align:middle line:84%
that interfere with our
ability to clean our slate,

00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:29.340 align:middle line:90%
look for a psychic surprises.

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:33.450 align:middle line:84%
So we said that Price just
made up these water tanks.

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:36.240 align:middle line:84%
10 years later we
celebrated the centenary

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.350 align:middle line:90%
of the city of Palo Alto.

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And I was sent a picture
book of what the city looked

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:43.760 align:middle line:90%
like 50 and 100 years ago.

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And to our great surprise,
50 years ago Rinconada Park

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:52.440 align:middle line:84%
was a water purification
plant, just as Price described.

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And the tallest thing in the
city of Palo Alto at that time

00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:01.810 align:middle line:84%
were the two water tanks that
Price saw in the park right

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:03.900 align:middle line:90%
where he had drawn them.

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:07.470 align:middle line:84%
So what's a poor physicist
to make out of that?

00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:13.540 align:middle line:84%
What it appears is that
Price followed our travelers

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:16.780 align:middle line:84%
to their hiding place
in Rinconada Park,

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:19.010 align:middle line:84%
described what was
there, and then

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:21.980 align:middle line:84%
moved back along the
timeline 50 years

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:25.500 align:middle line:84%
to describe the most imposing
and interesting thing

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:26.050 align:middle line:90%
at the site.

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:32.720 align:middle line:90%


00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:37.060 align:middle line:84%
One of things that
Pat Price did for us

00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:42.280 align:middle line:84%
was a spectacular demonstration
of ability for the CIA.

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:45.950 align:middle line:84%
When we talked to the courageous
director of intelligence

00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:49.550 align:middle line:84%
at CIA, he said you guys
are wasting your time

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:52.920 align:middle line:84%
describing churches and
swimming pools in Palo Alto.

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:56.470 align:middle line:84%
We have places that
really need a description.

00:45:56.470 --> 00:46:02.730 align:middle line:84%
So he sent us a CIA physicist
with geographical coordinates

00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:06.200 align:middle line:84%
of latitude and longitude
with instructions

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:11.180 align:middle line:84%
to describe what was at
that latitude and longitude.

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And Price said that
he was psychically

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:17.890 align:middle line:84%
lying on a building
at those coordinates.

00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And as he lay
there, a giant crane

00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:22.970 align:middle line:84%
was rolling back and forth
over his body on the building.

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:24.467 align:middle line:90%
A big Gantry crane.

00:46:24.467 --> 00:46:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And he said, this crane
is so big I've never

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:27.770 align:middle line:90%
seen anything like it.

00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:30.560 align:middle line:84%
It has wheels on both
sides of the building.

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And Price drew this crane
here, which I hope you can see.

00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:35.880 align:middle line:90%
It has eight wheels.

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:38.580 align:middle line:84%
Four on one side, four
on the other side.

00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And we gave that to the CIA
operative who was with us

00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:47.160 align:middle line:84%
and said, does this look
anything like your target site?

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, I
think you're probably

00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:51.320 align:middle line:84%
looking at the right
place because this

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:56.470 align:middle line:84%
was a satellite photograph of
the crane that was at the site.

00:46:56.470 --> 00:47:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And at the top here we show
way an airbrushed version

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:04.880 align:middle line:84%
of the satellite
photograph containing

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.610 align:middle line:90%
the crane and the building.

00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And they said that your
drawing is so accurate

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:12.430 align:middle line:84%
that we have to assume you're
looking at the right building--

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:13.900 align:middle line:90%
at the right place.

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:16.410 align:middle line:84%
But of course, we
already knew that.

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:19.920 align:middle line:84%
What we'd like you to do
now is describe what's

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:22.510 align:middle line:90%
going on inside the building.

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And Price went on to
describe how the Soviets were

00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:29.500 align:middle line:84%
fabricating a 60
foot steel sphere,

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:33.690 align:middle line:84%
which they were welding together
out of orange peel slices

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:37.180 align:middle line:90%
to make the 60 foot chamber.

00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And the CIA were
able to conclude

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:42.720 align:middle line:84%
from that that what they
were building at this weapons

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:46.720 align:middle line:84%
factory 10,000 miles away in
Semipalatinsk what they were

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:51.120 align:middle line:84%
building was a particle
beam weapon for the purpose

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:52.695 align:middle line:84%
of shooting down
the satellites that

00:47:52.695 --> 00:47:53.820 align:middle line:90%
were taking these pictures.

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:57.770 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:57.770 --> 00:48:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And three years later,
this big steel sphere

00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:03.680 align:middle line:84%
was in fact rolled
out of the building.

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to verify,
with great precision,

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:10.540 align:middle line:84%
that the 60 foot sphere
that Price described

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:14.450 align:middle line:84%
under construction was,
in fact, exactly what was

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:16.640 align:middle line:90%
being built at that building.

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Now we don't have to
send you to prison

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:22.240 align:middle line:84%
for seeing these secret
slides because from Freedom

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:25.815 align:middle line:84%
of Information I was
able get these released.

00:48:25.815 --> 00:48:30.700 align:middle line:84%
It was 18 month effort with
two congressman, a senator,

00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:31.640 align:middle line:90%
and two lawyers.

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:33.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And eventually we-- with a
very entertaining prospect,

00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:40.320 align:middle line:90%
I became eager to go to court.

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:45.510 align:middle line:84%
I said, let's go to court and
you explain to the country

00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:47.810 align:middle line:84%
why national
security won't allow

00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:50.340 align:middle line:90%
you to reveal your ESP work.

00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And they said, it's
easier just to release it.

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:59.800 align:middle line:84%
So this was-- the whole
story of our CIA support

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:01.560 align:middle line:90%
was released to me.

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And in our book,
"Miracles of Mind,"

00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:07.870 align:middle line:84%
we describe how we became
involved with the CIA

00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:12.980 align:middle line:84%
and what we did for
them during that period.

00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Now as part of this
activity, we were

00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:17.460 align:middle line:84%
interested in seeing
if it's harder

00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:20.860 align:middle line:84%
to describe things that
are far away than things

00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:22.500 align:middle line:90%
that are nearby.

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:26.140 align:middle line:84%
So as part of this research,
my colleague Hal Puthoff

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:29.490 align:middle line:84%
traveled through Central
America and South America.

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And each day Pat Price would
describe where Hal was hiding.

00:49:34.850 --> 00:49:38.370 align:middle line:84%
He talked about
mountains and seaports

00:49:38.370 --> 00:49:42.224 align:middle line:90%
and churches and volcanoes.

00:49:42.224 --> 00:49:43.640 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of
different things like

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:47.240 align:middle line:84%
you would expect to find in
the South American seacoast.

00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
we got no feedback

00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:51.930 align:middle line:84%
because he was in
South America and we

00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:55.380 align:middle line:84%
didn't learn anything until
weeks later when he returned.

00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:59.270 align:middle line:84%
But one day during this
period, Price did not show up.

00:49:59.270 --> 00:50:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was in my little
shielded chamber

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:04.640 align:middle line:84%
and I said on the
tape recording,

00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:06.460 align:middle line:84%
this is a remote
viewing experiment

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:09.000 align:middle line:90%
with Russell Tag and Pat Price.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.980 align:middle line:90%
But Price didn't come.

00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:14.390 align:middle line:84%
So in the spirit that the
show must go on, I said,

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:15.255 align:middle line:90%
I'll do it myself.

00:50:15.255 --> 00:50:16.930 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And I had never done
anything like this,

00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:23.110 align:middle line:84%
though I had led people
in psychic experiments.

00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:25.990 align:middle line:84%
My vision is very poor as
you've probably caught on to,

00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:27.440 align:middle line:90%
so I don't drive.

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:30.780 align:middle line:84%
So I became a
psychic travel agent.

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:34.400 align:middle line:84%
I would sit-- I was
always the stay at home.

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:37.370 align:middle line:84%
These are like twin experiments
and I was always the stay

00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:43.070 align:middle line:84%
at home twin in the laboratory
helping somebody else

00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:46.500 align:middle line:84%
to describe what was going
on at a distant place.

00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:49.820 align:middle line:84%
But in this occasion, I
just sat down and I said,

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:52.500 align:middle line:84%
I see something that
looks like an island.

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And it looks to me like
a runway with ocean

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:56.660 align:middle line:90%
at the end the island.

00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:59.590 align:middle line:84%
I see sand and
grass on the right.

00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:02.904 align:middle line:84%
And I see a hangar
building on the left.

00:51:02.904 --> 00:51:03.820 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I see.

00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote my name on it
and said, Price isn't here.

00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:10.480 align:middle line:90%
Do the best we can.

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:12.790 align:middle line:90%
Well, Hal Puthoff came back.

00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And he had taken a side
trip that day to San Andreas

00:51:17.090 --> 00:51:18.980 align:middle line:90%
off the coast of Colombia.

00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And as I was drawing my airport,
he was at an island airport

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:25.530 align:middle line:90%
off the coast of Colombia.

00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And you see that
airport building

00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:31.625 align:middle line:84%
on the left and the grass
and the sand on the right.

00:51:31.625 --> 00:51:33.560 align:middle line:84%
So the very good-- I'm
not showing you this

00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:36.560 align:middle line:84%
to demonstrate my psychic
prowess particularly.

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:39.410 align:middle line:84%
But what it shows is
that even a scientist

00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:42.730 align:middle line:84%
can be psychic if a necessity
level is high enough.

00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:45.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:49.830 align:middle line:84%
So somebody with a
training in atomic physics

00:51:49.830 --> 00:51:52.220 align:middle line:84%
can sit down and do
a remote viewing,

00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:54.660 align:middle line:84%
you should consider
that an inspiration

00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:57.650 align:middle line:84%
that you should go home and
see if you can incorporate this

00:51:57.650 --> 00:51:58.700 align:middle line:90%
into your own lives.

00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:02.670 align:middle line:90%


00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:06.070 align:middle line:84%
In the course of our work,
we did remote viewings

00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:07.420 align:middle line:90%
with all sorts of people.

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Scientists,
government officials,

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:13.680 align:middle line:84%
right up to the
Undersecretary of Defense.

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And one of the many
people we worked with

00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:20.120 align:middle line:84%
was a Army intelligence
officer, Joe McMoneagle.

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And Joe had had psychic
experiences in his life,

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:27.340 align:middle line:84%
but he'd never done
remote viewing.

00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And he came to SRI
and I had a chance

00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:32.930 align:middle line:84%
to show him how to
do remote viewing.

00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out to be the
most prodigious remote viewer

00:52:37.830 --> 00:52:39.205 align:middle line:84%
that we've had in
our laboratory.

00:52:39.205 --> 00:52:42.140 align:middle line:90%


00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:46.550 align:middle line:84%
So I'm always happy to say,
I showed Joe how to do this.

00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Because my wife was the
sister of Bobby Fischer,

00:52:51.550 --> 00:52:53.310 align:middle line:90%
the great chess player.

00:52:53.310 --> 00:52:54.790 align:middle line:90%
World chess champion.

00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:57.465 align:middle line:84%
And of course, she taught
Bobby how to play chess.

00:52:57.465 --> 00:52:59.200 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:01.210 align:middle line:90%
So she said, there he is.

00:53:01.210 --> 00:53:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Champion of the world and
I taught him how to play.

00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean I taught
him everything he knows.

00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:09.190 align:middle line:84%
I did have the
privilege of showing Joe

00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:11.670 align:middle line:84%
how to do remote
viewing, and he then

00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:15.380 align:middle line:84%
went flying away for
the next many years.

00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:19.220 align:middle line:84%
So as we sat in our laboratory,
Joe drew a number of pictures

00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:21.730 align:middle line:84%
and said basically,
I see this thing

00:53:21.730 --> 00:53:23.270 align:middle line:90%
of a building in two parts.

00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:25.720 align:middle line:84%
There's a horizontal
part and a vertical part.

00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And there seems to be a
little fountain in front.

00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And by and by, our
travelers, which

00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:38.130 align:middle line:84%
was the colonel in charge
of his intelligence unit

00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:40.030 align:middle line:84%
together with one
of the SRI people,

00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:42.820 align:middle line:84%
came back from the
Stanford Art Museum.

00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the strong
resemblance between what

00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Joe drew in his
very first effort

00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:51.605 align:middle line:84%
and the remote viewing site
were the people were located.

00:53:51.605 --> 00:53:54.930 align:middle line:90%


00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:57.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm showing you two
more slides that are

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:02.540 align:middle line:84%
interesting because it's
in evidence that people

00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:05.920 align:middle line:84%
learn to get better
at psychic abilities.

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:09.805 align:middle line:84%
They learn to perfect
this intellectual task.

00:54:09.805 --> 00:54:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Psychic abilities is not
a metaphysical activity.

00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:17.390 align:middle line:90%
It's a intellectual activity.

00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And you can learn to quiet the
mental noise that interferes

00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:24.580 align:middle line:90%
with psychic abilities.

00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:28.950 align:middle line:84%
You can learn to quiet down
the imagination and memory

00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:34.750 align:middle line:84%
and analysis and guessing so
that you can not necessarily

00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:38.640 align:middle line:84%
become more psychic, but we do
know how to quiet the noise.

00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:41.910 align:middle line:84%
So an engineer talks about
the signal to noise ratio

00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:45.440 align:middle line:84%
and what we become very good
at is quieting the noise.

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:48.650 align:middle line:84%
So 10 years later,
Joe McMoneagle

00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:51.900 align:middle line:84%
is doing experiments with
another physicist, Ed May.

00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:54.150 align:middle line:90%
I had left the program.

00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:58.140 align:middle line:84%
But we wanted to see 10 years
later how was Joe doing.

00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:00.990 align:middle line:84%
So each year the CIA would
come and visit us just

00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:02.905 align:middle line:90%
to make sure ESP still exists.

00:55:02.905 --> 00:55:04.760 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:09.180 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, a new CIA
operative came and said,

00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:12.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to drive for
an hour and be someplace

00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:15.310 align:middle line:84%
and I haven't decided
yet where I'm going.

00:55:15.310 --> 00:55:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And then an hour after that,
I'll go somewhere else.

00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to
describe both places.

00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:22.860 align:middle line:90%
And then I'll come back.

00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:25.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, first picture that Joe
drew, we show at the bottom

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:28.810 align:middle line:84%
here, is a kind of
architectural sketch.

00:55:28.810 --> 00:55:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I think the guy
is at this six story t-shaped

00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:34.810 align:middle line:90%
building covered with glass.

00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:37.500 align:middle line:90%
And I see a row of trees here.

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like some kind of
industrial complex, laboratory,

00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:45.080 align:middle line:90%
R&D facility.

00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:47.860 align:middle line:84%
But the guy is hiding
at this building.

00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And indeed he is hiding at
the administration building

00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:56.520 align:middle line:84%
of Lawrence Livermore, which
is our very own atomic bomb

00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:02.260 align:middle line:84%
laboratory in California about
100 miles east of Stanford

00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:03.360 align:middle line:90%
Research Institute.

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that Joe,
who's a fine artist also,

00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:10.890 align:middle line:84%
was able to make this three
dimensional projective

00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:15.030 align:middle line:84%
sketch of a t-shaped
six story building.

00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's just what
we had at the site.

00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:19.700 align:middle line:90%


00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Last slide I'll show you is the
next place the CIA person went,

00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:28.730 align:middle line:84%
which is the Altamont
Windmill Farm in the foothills

00:56:28.730 --> 00:56:29.980 align:middle line:90%
of the Sierras.

00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And you have all these
attractive windmills

00:56:32.290 --> 00:56:34.980 align:middle line:90%
spinning on a hilltop.

00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:39.280 align:middle line:84%
Joe said that he senses an
electrical grid of some sort

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:42.390 align:middle line:84%
and there's an aura that
you can't see around

00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:46.430 align:middle line:84%
the top of all these
poles in the hills.

00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And he said, there's something
electrical about this place.

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:52.060 align:middle line:90%
And he made this sketch.

00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Now in the work that J.B.
Rhine had done for many years

00:56:57.090 --> 00:57:03.820 align:middle line:84%
at Duke University he had
people guessing cards.

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Circle, square, stars,
cross, and wavy lines.

00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And although some people
were very, very good

00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:11.950 align:middle line:84%
at that over a period
of many, many months,

00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:14.360 align:middle line:90%
inevitably they declined.

00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:19.080 align:middle line:84%
So the decline effect became
one of the most robust features

00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:20.070 align:middle line:90%
of psychic ability.

00:57:20.070 --> 00:57:23.490 align:middle line:84%
It's as though Rhine had
discovered a way to extinguish

00:57:23.490 --> 00:57:25.770 align:middle line:90%
ESP in the laboratory.

00:57:25.770 --> 00:57:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's, of course, not
all what he intended to do,

00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:31.640 align:middle line:84%
but he basically bored
people into a decline--

00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:34.090 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:36.240 align:middle line:90%
--by giving them targets.

00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And you all know why this
experiment didn't work.

00:57:40.530 --> 00:57:43.900 align:middle line:84%
It didn't work because each
day you would sit down you

00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:46.960 align:middle line:84%
would know in advance
that when you quiet

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:50.690 align:middle line:84%
your mind somebody's going
to be psychically sending you

00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:54.610 align:middle line:84%
a square, a circle, a
wavy line, and so forth.

00:57:54.610 --> 00:57:57.560 align:middle line:84%
So your mental noise,
your mental slate,

00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:59.670 align:middle line:90%
is dirty at the very start.

00:57:59.670 --> 00:58:05.780 align:middle line:90%


00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:11.140 align:middle line:84%
If psychic functioning
in order to exist

00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:12.990 align:middle line:84%
requires that you
be able to read

00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:15.960 align:middle line:84%
the serial number of a
dollar bill in my wallet,

00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:18.000 align:middle line:90%
then there isn't any ESP.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Because that's a task
as analytical in nature.

00:58:21.450 --> 00:58:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is filled
with numbers.

00:58:23.730 --> 00:58:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And you have an extremely
hard time reading numbers.

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:31.200 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, it is
much easier and in fact

00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:34.920 align:middle line:84%
possible if I tell you that I'm
thinking of a place anywhere

00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:38.580 align:middle line:84%
on the planet out of an
infinitude of possible places

00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:42.990 align:middle line:84%
that you've never seen,
that task is easy to do.

00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:45.840 align:middle line:84%
So a paradox is
that out of-- it's

00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:50.280 align:middle line:84%
easier to describe, one, out
of infinitely many places

00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:52.980 align:middle line:84%
in the planet that you
haven't seen than it is

00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:56.010 align:middle line:90%
to guess a number from 1 to 10.

00:58:56.010 --> 00:58:58.785 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
slides we have here.

00:58:58.785 --> 00:59:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Can we have the
lights up, please?

00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:04.512 align:middle line:90%
That's part one.

00:59:04.512 --> 00:59:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And that pertains to the
inflow of psychic information.

00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:12.470 align:middle line:84%
That's about remote viewing,
it's about the psychic ability

00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:17.120 align:middle line:84%
that all of us have and can
incorporate into our lives.

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:18.760 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that's
very interesting

00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:23.150 align:middle line:84%
is that the outflow of
healing intention we have.

00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:26.500 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability
to quiet our minds

00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:31.180 align:middle line:84%
and affect the physiology of
people at a distant location.

00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in
recent years, there

00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:37.100 align:middle line:84%
have been more and
more papers published

00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:41.740 align:middle line:84%
about the work of healers
throughout the country,

00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:45.320 align:middle line:84%
throughout the United States,
being able to help people

00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:49.250 align:middle line:90%
with heart disease and AIDS.

00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:54.860 align:middle line:84%
Recently a paper was published
in the "Western Medical

00:59:54.860 --> 00:59:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Journal" describing a
series of experiments

00:59:58.310 --> 01:00:01.840 align:middle line:84%
that were done at California
Pacific Medical Center.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:04.565 align:middle line:84%
In this case, the experimenter
was my daughter, Elisabeth

01:00:04.565 --> 01:00:06.620 align:middle line:90%
Targ, who is a psychiatrist.

01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:10.150 align:middle line:84%
So there's a second
generation troublemaker.

01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And what she was
interested in seeing

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:18.010 align:middle line:84%
is whether healers of various
types throughout the country

01:00:18.010 --> 01:00:20.420 align:middle line:90%
could help her AIDS patients.

01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:23.110 align:middle line:84%
So this was an
experiment with 60 men

01:00:23.110 --> 01:00:27.610 align:middle line:84%
who were very sick at California
Pacific Medical Center.

01:00:27.610 --> 01:00:31.380 align:middle line:84%
She divided them into two
groups randomly matched

01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:34.690 align:middle line:90%
for age and degree of illness.

01:00:34.690 --> 01:00:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And then had a number of
different experienced healers

01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:38.670 align:middle line:90%
throughout the country.

01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:41.550 align:middle line:84%
These would be
Catholic prayer groups,

01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:47.310 align:middle line:84%
American Indian healers, Reiki
healers, followers of Barbara

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:48.750 align:middle line:90%
Brennan who are energy healers.

01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:50.620 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of
different healers.

01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:54.790 align:middle line:84%
She had 20 healers
in this group.

01:00:54.790 --> 01:01:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And each person who was sick
had 10 healers assigned to him.

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:05.700 align:middle line:84%
So each sick man in
the pray for group

01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:08.090 align:middle line:90%
had 10 people praying for them.

01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:10.560 align:middle line:84%
The end of 10 weeks,
what she found

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.420 align:middle line:84%
was that people in
the pray for group

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:18.340 align:middle line:84%
had much better health,
statistically significantly

01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:21.830 align:middle line:84%
fewer opportunistic illnesses,
fewer trips to the hospital,

01:01:21.830 --> 01:01:27.180 align:middle line:84%
fewer days in the hospital, and
much better robust self-esteem

01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:29.580 align:middle line:90%
and feeling about themselves.

01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:34.100 align:middle line:84%
So it was crystal
clear that the people

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:37.080 align:middle line:84%
who are being prayed
for significantly

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:40.770 align:middle line:84%
benefited from the prayers
of these distant people

01:01:40.770 --> 01:01:42.700 align:middle line:90%
all over the country.

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:47.210 align:middle line:84%
That's not to say that their
AIDS were cured by any means.

01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:50.990 align:middle line:84%
But in a double blind balanced
study-- of course everybody,

01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:53.230 align:middle line:84%
all the patients
wished that they

01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:55.370 align:middle line:90%
were in the prayed for group.

01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:57.740 align:middle line:84%
But only half of
them actually were.

01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:00.850 align:middle line:84%
But the finding was very strong
so that it was immediately

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:03.260 align:middle line:84%
published in a mainstream
medical journal.

01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And the moral of the story is
that even if you don't believe

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:09.500 align:middle line:84%
in prayer and somebody
offers to pray for you,

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:12.280 align:middle line:90%
you should accept the prayers.

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And this work has
now been replicated

01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:19.600 align:middle line:84%
in two other laboratories
where the physicians were heart

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:23.500 align:middle line:84%
doctors and had people
around the country praying

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.800 align:middle line:90%
for their cardiac patients.

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And these papers have now
been published in the "Annals

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:30.510 align:middle line:90%
of Internal Medicine."

01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:33.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost a
paranormal occurrence.

01:02:33.890 --> 01:02:36.548 align:middle line:84%
Doctors are generally the
last to catch on, even

01:02:36.548 --> 01:02:37.423 align:middle line:90%
after the physicists.

01:02:37.423 --> 01:02:38.660 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:42.290 align:middle line:84%
But even the
medical community is

01:02:42.290 --> 01:02:46.990 align:middle line:84%
becoming cognizant of the
idea that distant prayer,

01:02:46.990 --> 01:02:49.560 align:middle line:84%
distant mental
influence, actually

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:52.860 align:middle line:84%
improves the medical
care of their patient.

01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:54.350 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that this says

01:02:54.350 --> 01:02:57.830 align:middle line:84%
to us is the old idea
of bedside manner

01:02:57.830 --> 01:03:00.830 align:middle line:90%
is really critically important.

01:03:00.830 --> 01:03:04.260 align:middle line:84%
What we're showing
here is that the mind

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:07.350 align:middle line:84%
to mind connection
between a healer, which

01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:09.890 align:middle line:84%
is any person with
healing intent,

01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:13.250 align:middle line:84%
directly affects the
physiology of the person he's

01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:15.260 align:middle line:90%
attending to.

01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:17.860 align:middle line:84%
So if your doctor
simply treats you

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:22.360 align:middle line:84%
as a undressed illness
sitting on a table,

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:25.990 align:middle line:84%
you are not getting the medical
care that could cure you.

01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying that
that's unfriendly or cold or

01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:34.910 align:middle line:90%
impersonal.

01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:38.800 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is that if
your doctor is treating you

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:41.390 align:middle line:84%
as a sick body
sitting on the table,

01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:44.120 align:middle line:84%
you are not getting
the healing that's

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:47.940 align:middle line:84%
capable from the interaction
between the person with healing

01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:49.990 align:middle line:90%
intent and yourself.

01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:53.700 align:middle line:90%
Bedside manner is not a nicety.

01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:58.970 align:middle line:84%
It's not a politeness that
makes for good feelings

01:03:58.970 --> 01:04:00.860 align:middle line:90%
between a doctor and a patient.

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Bedside manner is
a critical part

01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:05.860 align:middle line:84%
of what allows
you to get better.

01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And if your doctor is
treating you with a sick body,

01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:11.590 align:middle line:84%
you're not getting
good medical care.

01:04:11.590 --> 01:04:15.170 align:middle line:90%
It's crystal clear.

01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:18.150 align:middle line:84%
Now what we find
is that people have

01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:23.810 align:middle line:84%
an idea that there is
a conflict of some kind

01:04:23.810 --> 01:04:28.960 align:middle line:84%
between the spirituality
and the metaphysical things

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:31.600 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking
about and science.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:36.570 align:middle line:84%
There's somehow an idea as
you read the news magazines.

01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:41.740 align:middle line:84%
There is an ongoing discussion
of science versus religion.

01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that's a
dichotomy that doesn't exist.

01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:50.770 align:middle line:84%
If you talk about
science and spirituality,

01:04:50.770 --> 01:04:55.450 align:middle line:84%
spirituality is just
another aspect of life

01:04:55.450 --> 01:04:58.940 align:middle line:84%
that we can incorporate into
our day to day activities.

01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And there's no conflict with
the scientific approach at all.

01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:06.620 align:middle line:84%
As we discussed in
the panel last night,

01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:09.860 align:middle line:84%
entering upon a
spiritual life is

01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:12.230 align:middle line:90%
like a laboratory experiment.

01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:16.130 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhists described
2,500 years ago

01:05:16.130 --> 01:05:20.590 align:middle line:84%
that certainly experiences
of peace and transcendence

01:05:20.590 --> 01:05:24.760 align:middle line:84%
and expanded awareness
and one with God

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:27.010 align:middle line:84%
and the ability
to reside in love,

01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:29.500 align:middle line:84%
those experiences
are available to you.

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:32.520 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
believe a thing.

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:35.096 align:middle line:84%
If you will find a
way or a practice

01:05:35.096 --> 01:05:40.040 align:middle line:84%
or a prayer or a meditation
to quiet your mind

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:42.110 align:middle line:84%
and you follow
that practice, you

01:05:42.110 --> 01:05:45.950 align:middle line:84%
will discover that these
experiences are available.

01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:47.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's very much
like what I was

01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:49.650 align:middle line:90%
doing 40 years ago at Columbia.

01:05:49.650 --> 01:05:52.800 align:middle line:90%
It's a lab report.

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:55.530 align:middle line:84%
You can find any one of a
number of different products

01:05:55.530 --> 01:05:58.840 align:middle line:84%
that talk about centering
prayer or meditation,

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:03.530 align:middle line:84%
follow that practice, and
then at the end of six weeks

01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:05.950 align:middle line:84%
write down what
you've experienced.

01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:10.680 align:middle line:84%
You'll discover
that you can start

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:15.820 align:middle line:84%
on a path of expanding your
awareness in the direction

01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:19.400 align:middle line:84%
of self-realization,
which is to say

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:22.450 align:middle line:90%
discovering who you might be.

01:06:22.450 --> 01:06:24.250 align:middle line:90%
So there's no conflict there.

01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:29.790 align:middle line:84%
Nothing I've said today is an
invitation to believe a thing.

01:06:29.790 --> 01:06:32.850 align:middle line:84%
This is a direct
experience that's available

01:06:32.850 --> 01:06:36.730 align:middle line:90%
and there is no conflict at all.

01:06:36.730 --> 01:06:39.590 align:middle line:84%
But you do have to take
some steps to find a way

01:06:39.590 --> 01:06:41.490 align:middle line:90%
to quiet your mind.

01:06:41.490 --> 01:06:44.410 align:middle line:84%
The last actual
job that I held I

01:06:44.410 --> 01:06:48.130 align:middle line:84%
was working for the second
richest man in the world.

01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:52.485 align:middle line:84%
And he's probably now down
to his bottom $20 billion

01:06:52.485 --> 01:06:56.190 align:middle line:84%
with the collapse of
the internet market.

01:06:56.190 --> 01:06:58.710 align:middle line:84%
But he came one day and
talked to us and said,

01:06:58.710 --> 01:07:00.540 align:middle line:90%
I have a vision.

01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:03.340 align:middle line:84%
This is the second
richest man in the world.

01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:04.210 align:middle line:90%
He has a vision.

01:07:04.210 --> 01:07:06.510 align:middle line:84%
He could do anything
in the world.

01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And what his vision
is, is that you

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:12.190 align:middle line:84%
should have a large
television screen on the wall

01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:13.650 align:middle line:90%
of your living room.

01:07:13.650 --> 01:07:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And on the screen,
you have access

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:18.560 align:middle line:84%
to the internet and
the worldwide web.

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:20.180 align:middle line:90%
You can read your email.

01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:21.620 align:middle line:90%
You can watch television.

01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And you can play video
games all at the same time

01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:27.800 align:middle line:90%
without ever leaving your couch.

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:31.740 align:middle line:84%
So his vision of the world is
a world in which you need never

01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:33.610 align:middle line:90%
have another quiet moment.

01:07:33.610 --> 01:07:37.239 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:37.239 --> 01:07:39.110 align:middle line:90%


01:07:39.110 --> 01:07:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And as you watch
television, you see

01:07:41.010 --> 01:07:45.150 align:middle line:84%
that CNN and all the networks
and all the cable companies

01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:50.800 align:middle line:84%
have exactly the same
prescription in mind for you.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're sitting home
quietly in love experiencing

01:07:55.330 --> 01:07:57.940 align:middle line:90%
God, nobody's making any money.

01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:00.600 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:03.470 align:middle line:90%
But the experience is available.

01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's an opportunity that you
can incorporate into your life.

01:08:08.290 --> 01:08:13.430 align:middle line:90%
And it's not difficult to do.

01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:17.960 align:middle line:84%
You just have to decide that
it's an important part of what

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:19.830 align:middle line:90%
you want to experience.

01:08:19.830 --> 01:08:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And the steps that are
often talked about.

01:08:23.810 --> 01:08:27.830 align:middle line:84%
There are four steps that
could be described as going

01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:29.950 align:middle line:90%
on that particular path.

01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:32.750 align:middle line:84%
The really tough
one is to find a way

01:08:32.750 --> 01:08:36.290 align:middle line:84%
to quiet your mind so that
you wake up each morning

01:08:36.290 --> 01:08:39.310 align:middle line:90%
in gratitude rather than fear.

01:08:39.310 --> 01:08:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's an opportunity
to make a choice.

01:08:42.270 --> 01:08:45.880 align:middle line:84%
Every morning you wake
up, you open your eyes.

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very familiar--
the aerospace engineer.

01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:52.960 align:middle line:90%
You open your eyes in fear.

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:55.029 align:middle line:84%
Say, how am I gonna
pay my mortgage?

01:08:55.029 --> 01:08:57.109 align:middle line:90%
My kid's college tuition?

01:08:57.109 --> 01:08:58.609 align:middle line:90%
I've got this crazy job.

01:08:58.609 --> 01:09:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Or I don't have enough
money to finish the project.

01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And I certainly don't
have enough time.

01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's technically
probably impossible.

01:09:05.890 --> 01:09:10.910 align:middle line:84%
So I'd wake up immediately
running the tape filled

01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:13.600 align:middle line:84%
with all the things that
I'm concerned about,

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.720 align:middle line:90%
frightened about.

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not feeling
too good either.

01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:20.340 align:middle line:84%
There's just a multitude
of different things

01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:22.390 align:middle line:90%
that I can experience.

01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:24.550 align:middle line:90%
That's one opportunity.

01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:27.100 align:middle line:90%
Very easy, familiar opportunity.

01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:31.279 align:middle line:84%
Or you can wake up your mind
and say, what do you know?

01:09:31.279 --> 01:09:32.275 align:middle line:90%
Here I am again.

01:09:32.275 --> 01:09:35.050 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:35.050 --> 01:09:39.439 align:middle line:84%
Can wake up in gratitude
for your intelligence,

01:09:39.439 --> 01:09:40.903 align:middle line:90%
your good health.

01:09:40.903 --> 01:09:43.069 align:middle line:84%
These are all things that
are given to you by grace.

01:09:43.069 --> 01:09:46.374 align:middle line:84%
You don't get any credit for
living in the United States

01:09:46.374 --> 01:09:50.720 align:middle line:84%
instead of living in
Bosnia or South Africa.

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:52.710 align:middle line:84%
There are all sorts
to dreadful places

01:09:52.710 --> 01:09:56.560 align:middle line:84%
you could live where you're
starving and malnourished,

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:59.910 align:middle line:84%
tortured, hunted
down by the police.

01:09:59.910 --> 01:10:01.490 align:middle line:90%
You're none of those things.

01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:02.580 align:middle line:90%
You live in New York.

01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:05.895 align:middle line:84%
Enjoy the benefits of
peace and democracy.

01:10:05.895 --> 01:10:06.395 align:middle line:90%
And--

01:10:06.395 --> 01:10:10.180 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Does WNYC still
say that every day?

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:17.590 align:middle line:84%
8 million people live together
in peace and harmony enjoying

01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:19.000 align:middle line:90%
the benefits of democracy.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.040 align:middle line:90%
I remember it well.

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:21.700 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, you have a
multitude of things

01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:26.180 align:middle line:84%
to be grateful for,
particularly your good health

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:29.600 align:middle line:84%
and your intelligence
and where you live.

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And you have this interesting
opportunity to open your eyes

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.680 align:middle line:90%
and say, thank you, God.

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:36.850 align:middle line:90%
Or thank you, universe.

01:10:36.850 --> 01:10:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Or give thanks to the organizing
principles of the universe that

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:43.780 align:middle line:90%
led you here.

01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And just an interesting
choice you can make.

01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:49.570 align:middle line:84%
What's the very first thing
you do when you open your eyes

01:10:49.570 --> 01:10:52.460 align:middle line:84%
and you have an opportunity
to open your eyes

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:54.840 align:middle line:90%
and reside in gratitude?

01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And the really
surprising thing is

01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:01.350 align:middle line:84%
that that can change the
whole direction your day goes.

01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Physicists are always
interested in what's

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:04.610 align:middle line:90%
called boundary conditions.

01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And you've heard the story
that the butterfly flapping

01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:13.710 align:middle line:84%
his wings in India is what
determines whether or not

01:11:13.710 --> 01:11:16.000 align:middle line:84%
the next northeaster
comes through New York

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.220 align:middle line:90%
or stops in Boston.

01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:21.360 align:middle line:84%
The smallest thing at
the edge of the periphery

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:23.520 align:middle line:90%
changes what the outcome is.

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:25.260 align:middle line:84%
If you can open
your eyes-- and this

01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:28.420 align:middle line:90%
is very easy to do experiment.

01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:29.880 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't cost a thing.

01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:31.660 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have
to write it up.

01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:35.810 align:middle line:84%
What you discover is that
if you open your eyes

01:11:35.810 --> 01:11:39.410 align:middle line:84%
in thanksgiving
instead of in fear,

01:11:39.410 --> 01:11:41.260 align:middle line:90%
it will change your entire day.

01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:43.605 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to do
a single other thing.

01:11:43.605 --> 01:11:49.780 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the free
gifts that's available.

01:11:49.780 --> 01:11:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So that if you can
wake up in gratitude,

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:59.510 align:middle line:84%
go through your day surrendering
your judgments, which

01:11:59.510 --> 01:12:01.560 align:middle line:90%
is even-- that's really tough.

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:04.200 align:middle line:90%
But it's worth pursuing.

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And also finding a way to
surrender your attachments

01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:10.820 align:middle line:90%
to your cherished outcomes.

01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:14.150 align:middle line:84%
You continue to
teach your classes

01:12:14.150 --> 01:12:18.560 align:middle line:84%
or do whatever you
do for a living.

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:21.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying you
should drop out.

01:12:21.290 --> 01:12:24.610 align:middle line:84%
But if you can do that
in a surrendered way

01:12:24.610 --> 01:12:27.830 align:middle line:84%
so that you're
flowing in your work

01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:31.990 align:middle line:84%
and doing your work in love
rather than feeling that you're

01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:34.690 align:middle line:84%
a failure if you don't
accomplish this, that,

01:12:34.690 --> 01:12:37.790 align:middle line:84%
and the other thing,
you have an opportunity

01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:41.970 align:middle line:84%
to reside in a much
more peaceful state

01:12:41.970 --> 01:12:44.650 align:middle line:84%
than if you're considering
that each thing you

01:12:44.650 --> 01:12:48.170 align:middle line:84%
do each step of the way is
a live or die consideration.

01:12:48.170 --> 01:12:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm proposing is that
the first step towards stepping

01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:56.580 align:middle line:84%
in the stream of a
peaceful existence

01:12:56.580 --> 01:13:01.410 align:middle line:84%
is to give up this judgment
and attachment to the outcome

01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:06.860 align:middle line:90%
and awaken in a thankful state.

01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:12.360 align:middle line:84%
A second step that's critical
is to find some kind of practice

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:14.550 align:middle line:90%
to quiet the ongoing chatter.

01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Some kind of
meditative practice.

01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:19.965 align:middle line:84%
And there are a multitude
of meditation and prayer

01:13:19.965 --> 01:13:23.970 align:middle line:84%
and other things you can
do to stop the chatter.

01:13:23.970 --> 01:13:30.410 align:middle line:84%
It's critical that you don't
let-- basically that there

01:13:30.410 --> 01:13:32.080 align:middle line:90%
are resentments that you have.

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And you give people
an opportunity

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:38.950 align:middle line:84%
to run around in your
mind and live there

01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:40.540 align:middle line:90%
with no rent being charged.

01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:44.860 align:middle line:84%
You're giving people free rent
to run around and make noise

01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:45.820 align:middle line:90%
in your mind.

01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's critical
to find a way get

01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:52.250 align:middle line:84%
rid of that resentment
and quiet your mind

01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:54.410 align:middle line:90%
through some kind of practice.

01:13:54.410 --> 01:13:58.710 align:middle line:84%
So the first step is a
way of living your life.

01:13:58.710 --> 01:14:01.620 align:middle line:84%
This is a general
self-improvement model

01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:06.480 align:middle line:84%
which is the first step to
take charge of your activity.

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:09.650 align:middle line:84%
The second step is to
take charge of your mind.

01:14:09.650 --> 01:14:14.580 align:middle line:84%
To find a way to stop the
ongoing chatter so even when

01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:17.670 align:middle line:84%
you're sitting on the
subway, riding the subway

01:14:17.670 --> 01:14:19.660 align:middle line:90%
can be a meditation.

01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:21.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure some of you know that.

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:25.110 align:middle line:84%
For others it may
seem very far fetched.

01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:27.650 align:middle line:84%
But what you discover
as you develop

01:14:27.650 --> 01:14:30.290 align:middle line:84%
some kind of meditation
practice that you're

01:14:30.290 --> 01:14:33.246 align:middle line:90%
no longer ever bored.

01:14:33.246 --> 01:14:34.870 align:middle line:84%
You go to the doctor
and he said you're

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:38.370 align:middle line:84%
going to have to sit
there for 45 minutes.

01:14:38.370 --> 01:14:39.490 align:middle line:90%
Just sit in that chair.

01:14:39.490 --> 01:14:42.670 align:middle line:84%
You say, what a
wonderful opportunity.

01:14:42.670 --> 01:14:46.470 align:middle line:84%
I can just sit and meditate
and be in bliss for 45 minutes

01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:49.620 align:middle line:84%
and there's not any other
damn thing I should be doing.

01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:51.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing exactly
the right thing.

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's given me
a gift of 45 minutes.

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:58.100 align:middle line:84%
You can have that
experience if you're sitting

01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:00.780 align:middle line:90%
at a red light on Broadway.

01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:02.670 align:middle line:84%
You can pound your
steering wheel waiting

01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:05.970 align:middle line:84%
for the damn light to
change or you can say,

01:15:05.970 --> 01:15:09.030 align:middle line:84%
I've just been given
two minutes of free time

01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:11.900 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing I
should be doing other

01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:14.800 align:middle line:90%
than sitting here in love.

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:15.850 align:middle line:90%
It's a gift.

01:15:15.850 --> 01:15:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing is nothing changes.

01:15:18.590 --> 01:15:20.510 align:middle line:84%
You just get to
choose what you're

01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:23.660 align:middle line:90%
going to do with your mind.

01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Now the third thing
along the path

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:29.910 align:middle line:84%
to finding a way
to residing in love

01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:32.730 align:middle line:84%
is that you have to
really want to do it.

01:15:32.730 --> 01:15:37.820 align:middle line:84%
It has to surface as the most
important thing in your life.

01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Because there will always
be something else to do.

01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:47.020 align:middle line:84%
So you have to make a
commitment that finding a way

01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:50.240 align:middle line:84%
to reside in this peaceful
state is an important part

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:52.350 align:middle line:90%
of your activity.

01:15:52.350 --> 01:16:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And finally, an important, and
for me critical, thing to do

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:05.720 align:middle line:84%
is to find a teacher who can
propel you into this state,

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:06.810 align:middle line:90%
into this condition.

01:16:06.810 --> 01:16:09.050 align:middle line:90%
And that's harder to do.

01:16:09.050 --> 01:16:11.150 align:middle line:84%
I've been very blessed
in that I found

01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:15.870 align:middle line:84%
a teacher who is an American
mystic woman named Gangaji.

01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:17.470 align:middle line:90%
She was an acupuncturist.

01:16:17.470 --> 01:16:23.260 align:middle line:84%
She went to India and became
the American lineage bearer

01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:27.270 align:middle line:84%
for Ramana Maharshi that
Ram Dass was talking about.

01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And what a spiritual teacher
can do for you is at one level,

01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:34.890 align:middle line:84%
she will talk to you
and answer questions,

01:16:34.890 --> 01:16:37.560 align:middle line:90%
much as I have done today.

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And for most of the
people in her audience,

01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:44.630 align:middle line:84%
they say this is a very
attractive, intelligent woman

01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:46.600 align:middle line:84%
who really
understands the dharma

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:52.690 align:middle line:84%
and has explained a variety
of helpful things to know.

01:16:52.690 --> 01:16:54.720 align:middle line:84%
There are another
group of people

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:59.490 align:middle line:84%
who have fallen off their chairs
and are residing in a loving,

01:16:59.490 --> 01:17:04.820 align:middle line:84%
blissful state because a
powerful transmitting teacher

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:11.440 align:middle line:84%
such as Gangaji or Jesus
or Buddha or Ramakrishna

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:15.510 align:middle line:84%
or for other powerful
teachers can allow

01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:18.210 align:middle line:90%
you to resonate with them.

01:17:18.210 --> 01:17:23.060 align:middle line:84%
An awakened teacher
resides in a loving state,

01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:27.300 align:middle line:84%
in what Ram Dass was
describing as his state two.

01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:31.290 align:middle line:84%
They reside at the
steady in love.

01:17:31.290 --> 01:17:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a
unguarded, quiet moment,

01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:38.450 align:middle line:84%
you can resonate
with that teacher

01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:42.730 align:middle line:84%
and find yourself
in love with them.

01:17:42.730 --> 01:17:47.090 align:middle line:84%
It is because Gangaji is an
attractive woman-- frequently

01:17:47.090 --> 01:17:51.100 align:middle line:84%
some man will stand up and
say, you've changed my life.

01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:52.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what to do.

01:17:52.170 --> 01:17:53.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm in love with you.

01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And she'll say,
well, good for you.

01:17:57.410 --> 01:17:59.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm in love all the time.

01:17:59.470 --> 01:18:02.900 align:middle line:84%
How nice for you that
you have found a way

01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:05.540 align:middle line:90%
to reside in love as well.

01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:07.280 align:middle line:90%
Remember that experience.

01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And people who have had the
experience of residing in love,

01:18:11.790 --> 01:18:17.400 align:middle line:84%
whether through meditation,
prayer, drugs, quieting

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:21.370 align:middle line:84%
their mind, is a
life-changing experience

01:18:21.370 --> 01:18:25.610 align:middle line:84%
that they can carry with them
throughout their entire lives.

01:18:25.610 --> 01:18:26.390 align:middle line:90%
No charge.

01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:28.170 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
believe a thing.

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:32.830 align:middle line:84%
It's something to do rather
than something to believe.

01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And the rewarding part of
that is that what you discover

01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:39.700 align:middle line:84%
is that you have within
yourself the love

01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:43.180 align:middle line:90%
that you're looking for.

01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:44.380 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:47.730 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:18:47.730 --> 01:19:32.117 align:middle line:90%
