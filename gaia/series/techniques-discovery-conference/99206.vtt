00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.140 align:middle line:10%
>>Dr. Metzner is co-founder and
president of the Green Earth

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.400 align:middle line:10%
Foundation, an educational
organization devoted

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.590 align:middle line:10%
to healing and harmonizing the
relationships between humanity

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.549 align:middle line:10%
and the Earth.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Psychotherapist and professor
at the California Institute

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.170 align:middle line:84%
of Integral Studies who
has been exploring states

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.260 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness,
entheogens, shamanism,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.200 align:middle line:84%
and transformational
practices for over 30 years.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Ever since he helped found
the Harvard Psilocybin Project

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.190 align:middle line:84%
in 1960 with Timothy
Leary and Ram Dass.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.199 align:middle line:84%
Let us give a warm
welcome to Ralph Metzner.

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.143 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:02.143 --> 00:01:13.000 align:middle line:90%


00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.540 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I am very
happy to be here.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.025 align:middle line:84%
There are some very old
friends of mine here

00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:25.805 align:middle line:84%
who've been friends for a long
time and some new friends.

00:01:25.805 --> 00:01:30.030 align:middle line:90%


00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Actually my work and
consciousness research

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.350 align:middle line:84%
and exploration
started 40 years ago.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And 1961 was the
year I first took

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.480 align:middle line:84%
a psychoactive
psychedelic substance

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.100 align:middle line:84%
at Harvard University, where
I was a graduate student.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.830 align:middle line:90%
So that's 40 years ago.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that it
was a kind of a rebirth.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.470 align:middle line:84%
It changed my life from
that point on completely.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And I might describe
it in this way.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.330 align:middle line:84%
That it turned my mind
inside out and outside

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.770 align:middle line:90%
in at the same time.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And the astrologers
among you might

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:30.340 align:middle line:84%
be interested to know that it
coincided with my progressed

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Mercury turning direct
from being retrograde.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, what that meant
was, I'll give you

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.605 align:middle line:90%
a scene from that experience.

00:02:41.605 --> 00:02:44.210 align:middle line:90%


00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.810 align:middle line:84%
I took it at the house that
Tim Leary was living in.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And the occasion
was that we were

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.410 align:middle line:84%
going to start this project
working with prisoners, giving

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.360 align:middle line:84%
them psilocybin to produce
inside experiences.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And Leary said, well, in
order to give this experience

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.130 align:middle line:84%
to people, you have
to have it first.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And so we tried it out and
several of us were there.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And at one point it was an
amazing experience, which

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.330 align:middle line:90%
I won't go into the details.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.510 align:middle line:84%
But this one little incident
kind of encapsulated

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.483 align:middle line:90%
what I'm trying to say.

00:03:18.483 --> 00:03:21.240 align:middle line:90%


00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.510 align:middle line:84%
I walked out of the
house, actually,

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.385 align:middle line:90%
to get some fresh air.

00:03:26.385 --> 00:03:27.790 align:middle line:84%
As I went out of
the house, there

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.135 align:middle line:84%
was a garbage can sitting right
next to the entrance door.

00:03:33.135 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And I sort of glanced at
it and then I walked on.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment
I stopped in my mind

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.710 align:middle line:90%
and I thought, wait a minute.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.070 align:middle line:90%
Why did I just walk on?

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.150 align:middle line:84%
I realized I had a program
in my mind of that's garbage,

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.290 align:middle line:84%
you don't look at
it, you just go.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.570 align:middle line:90%
You don't look at it.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized
that that was

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.570 align:middle line:84%
a completely automatic
reaction and that I

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.180 align:middle line:90%
didn't have to do that.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.640 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have to think that
automatic thought which

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.240 align:middle line:84%
automatically
controlled my behavior.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.520 align:middle line:84%
I could in fact choose
to look at the garbage

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.497 align:middle line:90%
and then go on or not.

00:04:08.497 --> 00:04:09.580 align:middle line:90%
And that was a revelation.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.640 align:middle line:84%
It might seem like
a small thing.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:18.050 align:middle line:84%
But from that point, I realized
that my mind was completely

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:22.390 align:middle line:84%
conditioned It was
completely automatic.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.290 align:middle line:90%
And that could change.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise I could choose
how to direct my mind.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.290 align:middle line:84%
I could choose what to look
at and what not to look at.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.410 align:middle line:84%
I could choose what to
think and what not to think.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And that would make a
tremendous difference.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And I've been practicing
that ever sense.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And Buddhist
mindfulness meditation

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.210 align:middle line:84%
tries to teach people
the same thing.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.799 align:middle line:84%
Is the sound
working OK this way?

00:04:52.799 --> 00:04:55.270 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:01.910 align:middle line:84%
So I said I would talk about
shamanic entheogenic cosmology

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.650 align:middle line:84%
and visionary
experience, but I'd

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.580 align:middle line:90%
like to change that slightly.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And I said some things about
cosmology in the little

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:12.970 align:middle line:90%
write up.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.130 align:middle line:84%
What I'd like to talk about
instead, which is related,

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.630 align:middle line:84%
is visionary experience
and divination.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.540 align:middle line:90%


00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And you could say that visionary
experiences are experiences

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.015 align:middle line:84%
beyond the realm, the ordinary
realm of time and space,

00:05:34.015 --> 00:05:39.480 align:middle line:84%
of conventional thinking,
that occur to us spontaneously

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.550 align:middle line:90%
or in certain situations.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.010 align:middle line:90%
It could happen in dreams.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Divination is a practice,
intentional purpose

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:57.560 align:middle line:84%
of practice, to bring about
access to nonordinary reality

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.187 align:middle line:84%
and expanded state
of consciousness.

00:06:00.187 --> 00:06:01.270 align:middle line:90%
What does divination mean?

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.250 align:middle line:84%
It means communication
with the divine world.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Also called traditionally
the spirit world.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:15.430 align:middle line:84%
Or anthropologists might
call it nonordinary reality.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.610 align:middle line:84%
In some of the
European traditions,

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.370 align:middle line:90%
it was called the other world.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.170 align:middle line:90%
And it is another world.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And you enter into the other
world in an altered state

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.940 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.790 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean it's
purely a subjective experience.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the experience
is subjective,

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.740 align:middle line:90%
but the world actually exists.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:43.600 align:middle line:90%


00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And I would say there are
two primary differences

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:53.120 align:middle line:84%
between shamanic cosmology,
which arises naturally

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.940 align:middle line:84%
out of psychedelic and
entheogenic experiences

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:05.020 align:middle line:84%
and others, and the traditional
worldview that we have,

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.270 align:middle line:84%
which is the worldview
of materialist science.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And I agree with
Robert Patrick Wilson

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.410 align:middle line:84%
who said, well, science actually
doesn't believe that Newtonian

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.280 align:middle line:90%
Cartesian worldview anymore.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.820 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is
that we still do.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most of us brought
up having high school science

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:30.290 align:middle line:84%
and living in a world
of material objects

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.280 align:middle line:84%
in which material
objects are regarded

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.780 align:middle line:90%
as the only real thing.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:38.570 align:middle line:90%


00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:44.830 align:middle line:84%
So the one main difference
between a shamanic worldview,

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.190 align:middle line:84%
cosmology, and this
modernistic worldview,

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.870 align:middle line:84%
which we're trying
to get beyond,

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:55.945 align:middle line:84%
is that in the traditional
view, there are many worlds.

00:07:55.945 --> 00:07:58.360 align:middle line:84%
There is not just
one level of reality.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.890 align:middle line:84%
This material physical
substance of level

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:04.030 align:middle line:90%
that you can touch and weigh.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:09.750 align:middle line:84%
But there are many, equally
real, not merely subjective,

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:15.533 align:middle line:84%
not merely fantasy,
not merely mystical.

00:08:15.533 --> 00:08:22.970 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And some scientists
have tried to find

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.830 align:middle line:84%
ways to describe this
multi-dimensionality

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.472 align:middle line:90%
in scientific language.

00:08:30.472 --> 00:08:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Traditional shamanism,
for example,

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.270 align:middle line:84%
says there's upper world,
middle world, and lower world.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:36.870 align:middle line:90%


00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:40.600 align:middle line:84%
So you could say, it
would be true to say

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:45.660 align:middle line:84%
that the traditional shamanic
animistic worldview is

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.960 align:middle line:90%
larger and more comprehensive.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't say that
the material world is not real

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.300 align:middle line:84%
and say the other
worlds are more real.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.160 align:middle line:90%
It says they're equally real.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:02.650 align:middle line:90%


00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:09.770 align:middle line:84%
The other big difference between
the traditional indigenous

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:13.430 align:middle line:84%
shamanic animistic worldview
and the modern worldview

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:19.820 align:middle line:84%
is that in these many worlds,
including this material world,

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:24.666 align:middle line:84%
there are many beings
besides human beings.

00:09:24.666 --> 00:09:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we know animals
and plants and so forth.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.330 align:middle line:90%
We recognize them as beings.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.520 align:middle line:84%
Traditional people
recognize all beings

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.150 align:middle line:90%
as having a spiritual essence.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.960 align:middle line:90%
That's called animism.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.280 align:middle line:84%
Everything has a
spiritual essence.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:45.182 align:middle line:84%
Trees, mountains, rivers,
animals, plants, places.

00:09:45.182 --> 00:09:48.321 align:middle line:90%
They're called spirits.

00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:51.480 align:middle line:90%
Not a symbol.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.950 align:middle line:84%
Within a materialist worldview,
including the worldview

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:57.750 align:middle line:84%
of modern psychology,
including Jungian psychology,

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:03.320 align:middle line:84%
these beings are
regarded as symbols.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps archetypal
symbols, which

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.715 align:middle line:84%
is kind of more grand
than ordinary symbols.

00:10:07.715 --> 00:10:10.400 align:middle line:90%
But what does that really mean?

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.625 align:middle line:84%
Or it'll say it's part
of the unconscious,

00:10:12.625 --> 00:10:14.667 align:middle line:84%
or part of the
collective unconscious.

00:10:14.667 --> 00:10:16.250 align:middle line:84%
So let me give you
a little story that

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.610 align:middle line:84%
illustrates the difference
between shamanism

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.920 align:middle line:90%
and psychology.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.390 align:middle line:90%
Little scenario.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:23.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm a psychologist.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:24.280 align:middle line:90%
I do psychotherapy.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Supposing a person comes into
the psychotherapist office

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:32.450 align:middle line:84%
and says, well, I had
this dream about a bear.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And the psychologist,
if he's a Freudian,

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:39.210 align:middle line:84%
he might say, well, that's
probably a father complex

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.820 align:middle line:84%
and we'll work with
that and analyze it.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.740 align:middle line:84%
If he goes to a
Jungian, the Jungian

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.420 align:middle line:84%
might say well,
that's great mother.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.480 align:middle line:90%
Great mother bear.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.270 align:middle line:90%
Archetypal like that.

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.230 align:middle line:84%
If it's a gestalt
therapist he'd say,

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.910 align:middle line:84%
well, it's clearly
a part of your mind,

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.860 align:middle line:84%
so let's do a gestalt
dialogue with it.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.320 align:middle line:84%
Put the bear on a chair,
talk back and forth with it.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.296 align:middle line:90%
It's a part of your mind.

00:11:01.296 --> 00:11:03.120 align:middle line:90%
Always a part of your mind.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.236 align:middle line:90%
Unconscious mind maybe.

00:11:05.236 --> 00:11:08.900 align:middle line:84%
If you went to a
shamanic practitioner,

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.780 align:middle line:90%
you might not say that.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:17.380 align:middle line:84%
He might say, well, you
had an encounter with bear.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:20.410 align:middle line:90%
Great Bear, capital B Bear.

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:24.820 align:middle line:84%
The spirit of Bear,
the deity of Bear.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the case,
the shamanic practitioner

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:36.490 align:middle line:84%
certainly would admit there are
symbolic dreams and fantasies.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:41.190 align:middle line:84%
But if it's a being and
you treat it as a symbol,

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:42.900 align:middle line:90%
you could be in trouble.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.403 align:middle line:84%
It will be considered
disrespectful.

00:11:44.403 --> 00:11:47.080 align:middle line:90%


00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.500 align:middle line:84%
If I meet you in the
street and I treat you

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:53.350 align:middle line:84%
as a symbol of something in
my mind, that's disrespectful,

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:54.675 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:11:54.675 --> 00:11:55.550 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't like it.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.590 align:middle line:90%
You'd be offended.

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Women are offended if
they're treated as a symbol,

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:00.895 align:middle line:90%
as an object.

00:12:00.895 --> 00:12:04.010 align:middle line:90%
It's called objectification.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:05.780 align:middle line:84%
So part of a
shamanic practice is

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:09.990 align:middle line:84%
to learn to distinguish between
the real beings that you might

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:15.910 align:middle line:84%
encounter and which you can
have a real communication with

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:19.500 align:middle line:84%
and those fantasies
and imaginings

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.520 align:middle line:84%
that we ordinarily have,
which we all have plenty of.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:28.050 align:middle line:90%


00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:31.580 align:middle line:90%
Let me tell you a joke.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:36.750 align:middle line:84%
Actually a cartoon from The New
Yorker that's about prophecy.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And it shows a man on the
street wearing a sandwich board

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.040 align:middle line:90%
with signs.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.320 align:middle line:90%
And it said, "Jesus is coming."

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And then behind him was
another man, Oriental looking,

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.080 align:middle line:84%
also had a sandwich board
that said "Buddha, here now."

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.570 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:04.550 align:middle line:90%


00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:08.015 align:middle line:84%
It gets better the longer
you think about it.

00:13:08.015 --> 00:13:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And it reminds me of a
story about be here now.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And Ram Dass, who is
here now, as we all are.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:27.525 align:middle line:84%
And a couple years ago we
were in a meeting together.

00:13:27.525 --> 00:13:30.800 align:middle line:90%


00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And I had this insight or
understanding about the phrase

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:45.800 align:middle line:84%
the hereafter to describe
the afterlife existence.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.550 align:middle line:84%
There's an old
fashioned English phrase

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:49.250 align:middle line:90%
which isn't much used anymore.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.714 align:middle line:84%
But the hereafter, you
talk about somebody

00:13:51.714 --> 00:13:52.630 align:middle line:90%
when they're deceased.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.160 align:middle line:90%
They're in the hereafter.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.430 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of a nice phrase.

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:58.160 align:middle line:90%
I kind of like it.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.060 align:middle line:84%
So then I was thinking about
the phrase be here now.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And then I really thought,
well, as a maxim of philosophy,

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:11.690 align:middle line:84%
maybe one should extend it to
say, be here now and hereafter.

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:14.015 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:14.015 --> 00:14:17.270 align:middle line:90%


00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:19.336 align:middle line:90%
Be here now and hereafter.

00:14:19.336 --> 00:14:23.190 align:middle line:90%


00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I actually had this
with my friend Ram Dass.

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And he laughed, he
thought it was cute.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, well, I think
be here now actually covers it.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.890 align:middle line:90%


00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:40.670 align:middle line:90%
Which is true.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:43.720 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.234 align:middle line:84%
Because it covers both
the here and the after.

00:14:46.234 --> 00:14:48.650 align:middle line:84%
When you're in the hereafter,
you want to be here now too.

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:54.550 align:middle line:90%


00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:59.140 align:middle line:84%
OK so I want to talk
about divination.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And then if you're willing, I'd
like to do a method divination

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.450 align:middle line:90%
practice with you.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And I want to leave some time
at the end for questions.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:16.300 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to try very hard
to stay within my time frame.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:20.830 align:middle line:84%
So very, very
briefly, I distinguish

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:24.560 align:middle line:84%
between two main
kinds of divination.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Divinations relating to the
past, which relate to healing.

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.830 align:middle line:90%


00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.780 align:middle line:84%
Healing, it seems to
me, always involves

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:38.430 align:middle line:84%
going into the past in some
way, both in modern therapy

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:41.890 align:middle line:84%
and traditional
methods of healing.

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And then visioning,
which is future oriented.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.680 align:middle line:90%


00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And I've actually come
to think of-- well,

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.997 align:middle line:84%
so healing, going into the
past, you use regression.

00:15:57.997 --> 00:15:59.830 align:middle line:84%
The kind of therapy I
do, I call regression.

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:03.120 align:middle line:90%


00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.570 align:middle line:84%
You start with an
existing problem.

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.130 align:middle line:90%
Many therapists work this way.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And you find the
origin of the problem.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And it may be in
childhood or it may

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:20.940 align:middle line:84%
be in pare-natal
or prenatal issues.

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.385 align:middle line:84%
Or even going all the
way back to conception.

00:16:23.385 --> 00:16:32.040 align:middle line:90%


00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.910 align:middle line:84%
It may involve
ancestral patterns.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.870 align:middle line:90%


00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.605 align:middle line:84%
What family system
therapists call

00:16:40.605 --> 00:16:46.910 align:middle line:84%
transgenerational influences,
inherited patterns

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:50.980 align:middle line:84%
of behavioral plot
as well as genetic.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.705 align:middle line:84%
Or it may be past
life, karmic patterns.

00:16:54.705 --> 00:16:59.260 align:middle line:90%


00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:04.869 align:middle line:84%
And shamanic healing practices,
it's not that different.

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:06.470 align:middle line:90%
You do a regression.

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:12.240 align:middle line:84%
You find either there's been an
intrusion or, like we would say

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.319 align:middle line:84%
an infection by a bacteria,
virus, or microbe, or something

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:17.599 align:middle line:90%
like that, and you find that.

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:19.797 align:middle line:84%
Or in traditional societies,
you might say, well,

00:17:19.797 --> 00:17:20.630 align:middle line:90%
there was a sorcery.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:24.220 align:middle line:84%
There was something
that was put into you

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.560 align:middle line:84%
and then you have
to take that out.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Or the other kind of
regression, healing regression

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:32.050 align:middle line:84%
that people might
do, would be where

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.000 align:middle line:84%
they feel like a part
of their identity

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.730 align:middle line:84%
has been split off or due
to shock or trauma there's

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:40.090 align:middle line:90%
been a kind of a freezing.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And people who've
been traumatized

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:49.340 align:middle line:84%
feel that a part of them has
been locked up in that event.

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And then with healing practices,
you were to undo that.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And shamanism is
called soul retrieval.

00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Like a split off part of one's
sense of identity is retrieved.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:04.390 align:middle line:90%


00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And that often
involves catharsis.

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:10.410 align:middle line:90%


00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:13.610 align:middle line:84%
But one conclusion
that I've come to,

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:24.220 align:middle line:84%
in terms of healing regressions,
is that catharsis by itself

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.200 align:middle line:90%
isn't enough.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Catharsis is the kind of purging
of the negative stuff that's

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:33.340 align:middle line:90%
associated with that event.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And then you are
understanding of that event.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Your perception, your
knowing and feeling of it,

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.050 align:middle line:84%
has to be integrated
into who you are.

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:44.860 align:middle line:84%
That's how you know
that you're healed

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:49.480 align:middle line:84%
from a traumatic past event
or a traumatic unfinished past

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.060 align:middle line:84%
entanglement is when
you can recognize it

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:58.660 align:middle line:84%
as part of your history, but not
long anything that blocks you

00:18:58.660 --> 00:18:59.680 align:middle line:90%
from moving ahead.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.340 align:middle line:90%


00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.830 align:middle line:84%
I have to tell you a
little story about therapy

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:10.010 align:middle line:84%
that I learned from a German
therapist called Bert Hellinger

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:11.730 align:middle line:90%
that I like very much.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:13.740 align:middle line:90%
He tells this story.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:21.030 align:middle line:84%
He says, a polar bear
was kept by a circus.

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And since he moved around
a lot and they kept him

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:29.920 align:middle line:84%
in a very small cage with
very limited movement,

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:33.910 align:middle line:84%
we could take two steps
forward and two steps back.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:36.080 align:middle line:84%
That's all the
movement he could do.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:42.210 align:middle line:84%
So that's what he did, day
in and day out, for 20 years.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Then the circus
decided they didn't

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:46.245 align:middle line:84%
want the polar bear anymore
and they sold him to a zoo.

00:19:46.245 --> 00:19:50.770 align:middle line:90%


00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:56.530 align:middle line:84%
In the zoo, the bear had a
large area to roam around in.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:59.600 align:middle line:84%
But he walked two steps
forward and two steps back.

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.360 align:middle line:90%


00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Another bear came to him and
said, "Why are you doing that?"

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And the bear said, "Well, I
lived in a cage for 20 years

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.860 align:middle line:84%
where I could only
walk two steps forward

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:20.260 align:middle line:90%
and two steps back."

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.030 align:middle line:90%
That's the story.

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:31.300 align:middle line:90%


00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:34.780 align:middle line:90%
See, he did have a choice.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:38.250 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't
exercise the choice.

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:49.700 align:middle line:84%
So what I observe and what
I believe to be true, maybe,

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:56.030 align:middle line:84%
mostly, is that in
addition to catharsis,

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:59.090 align:middle line:84%
the re-experiencing
of something painful,

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:01.310 align:middle line:84%
there needs to be
an integration.

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And the integration for complete
healing, the integration

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:10.150 align:middle line:84%
involves bringing
that understanding

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:14.370 align:middle line:84%
into your present
sense of who you are so

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:16.530 align:middle line:84%
that he can then
say, OK, that event

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:19.450 align:middle line:90%
was in my past in my history.

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm going to go get
on with the rest of my life

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:23.580 align:middle line:90%
the way I choose to.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:36.774 align:middle line:90%


00:21:36.774 --> 00:21:39.230 align:middle line:84%
OK, before going to
talk about visioning,

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:40.880 align:middle line:84%
I guess I want to
say a little bit more

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:44.500 align:middle line:90%
about healing regression.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:47.600 align:middle line:84%
So there's this
twofold movement.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.980 align:middle line:84%
You may go back
to childhood, you

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:52.205 align:middle line:84%
may go back to pre
and para-natal.

00:21:52.205 --> 00:21:58.900 align:middle line:84%
You may go back to past
karma, karmic reincarnations,

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.852 align:middle line:90%
past lives.

00:22:01.852 --> 00:22:03.726 align:middle line:84%
People can go all the
way back to conception.

00:22:03.726 --> 00:22:08.970 align:middle line:90%


00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Our old friend,
Timothy Leary, he

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:14.210 align:middle line:84%
wrote about the experience
of your conception.

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:18.710 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a chapter in
his book "Flashbacks,"

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:21.710 align:middle line:90%
my conception of my conception.

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:24.570 align:middle line:84%
People can re-experience
that conception.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
at conception is

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:30.570 align:middle line:84%
that all the imprints--
well of course

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:35.929 align:middle line:84%
the genetic chromosomal
genetic fusion of the mother

00:22:35.929 --> 00:22:37.470 align:middle line:84%
line and the father
line takes place.

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:39.300 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.480 align:middle line:84%
But in addition, there's
a psychological imprinting

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.630 align:middle line:90%
that takes place.

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Everything that the mother
and father with thinking,

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:48.680 align:middle line:84%
feeling, experiencing about
themselves, about their bodies,

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.290 align:middle line:90%
about their sexuality.

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:52.110 align:middle line:90%
Because conception is a sex act.

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.960 align:middle line:90%


00:22:54.960 --> 00:23:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And I've had experiences
working with people,

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.370 align:middle line:84%
taking them back to
their conception,

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:04.930 align:middle line:84%
where it was a revelation
for them to think that they

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:06.930 align:middle line:90%
arose out of an act of love.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:09.930 align:middle line:90%


00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:13.280 align:middle line:90%
To really take that in.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.310 align:middle line:84%
Because it had not been part
of their conscious experience

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:22.345 align:middle line:84%
of feeling their parents
being in an act of love.

00:23:22.345 --> 00:23:27.700 align:middle line:90%


00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Leary found that his
conception was his parents

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.244 align:middle line:90%
were both drunk.

00:23:35.244 --> 00:23:38.136 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:38.136 --> 00:23:42.920 align:middle line:84%
His father was a dentist
on a military base.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.550 align:middle line:90%
It's not implausible at all.

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:47.609 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I would venture to
guess in a certain generation

00:23:47.609 --> 00:23:48.525 align:middle line:90%
it was quite frequent.

00:23:48.525 --> 00:23:54.370 align:middle line:90%


00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:56.380 align:middle line:84%
You'd have to wonder
what effect that

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.030 align:middle line:84%
might have on the conception,
what kind of an imprint

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:02.210 align:middle line:90%
that would leave.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:10.580 align:middle line:84%
In terms of teachings of
the spiritual and mystical

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:16.190 align:middle line:84%
tradition where conception is
a place where a soul enters

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:25.880 align:middle line:84%
into human form,
biological form and starts

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:31.570 align:middle line:84%
forgetting and starts losing the
connection to the spirit world,

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:34.610 align:middle line:90%
to the soul world.

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:37.130 align:middle line:84%
The wonderful poem
by Wordsworth where

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:41.600 align:middle line:84%
it talks about a child coming
in being born, trailing

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.734 align:middle line:90%
clouds of glory.

00:24:43.734 --> 00:24:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And then progressively
forgetting,

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:46.480 align:middle line:90%
forgetting, forgetting.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Starting at conception,
the earliest.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.570 align:middle line:84%
Veils come in and
massive forgetting

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:55.060 align:middle line:90%
at the time of birth.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And there's always the
possibility of remembering.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.390 align:middle line:90%
Remembering.

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:01.716 align:middle line:90%
See, what is remembering?

00:25:01.716 --> 00:25:04.176 align:middle line:84%
Re-connecting back which
has been dismembered.

00:25:04.176 --> 00:25:07.800 align:middle line:90%


00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.440 align:middle line:84%
So when you regress,
you may go back

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.075 align:middle line:84%
to the origin of--
so as you go back,

00:25:12.075 --> 00:25:16.780 align:middle line:84%
you can go back all the way to
the origin, your own origin,

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:18.105 align:middle line:90%
the source of your beginning.

00:25:18.105 --> 00:25:20.960 align:middle line:90%


00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.175 align:middle line:90%
The Buddhists have this koan.

00:25:23.175 --> 00:25:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And a koan is a question
you don't really answer.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.060 align:middle line:90%
You just keep asking it.

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:31.490 align:middle line:84%
What was your original
face before you were born?

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:36.370 align:middle line:84%
What was your original
face before you were born?

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:38.340 align:middle line:84%
I have a new version
of that koan.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.125 align:middle line:90%


00:25:41.125 --> 00:25:42.450 align:middle line:90%
It's the same koan.

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:45.290 align:middle line:90%
It goes like this.

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:51.960 align:middle line:84%
What was your soul's vision
for this incarnation?

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.310 align:middle line:90%
I should correct that.

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:58.956 align:middle line:84%
What is your soul's vision
for this incarnation?

00:25:58.956 --> 00:26:03.320 align:middle line:90%


00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:10.134 align:middle line:84%
Which is still
happening, isn't it?

00:26:10.134 --> 00:26:11.340 align:middle line:90%
It's not over.

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:16.150 align:middle line:90%


00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:19.140 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately regression
may be regression

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:23.520 align:middle line:84%
to the source of your being,
the core of your being.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.400 align:middle line:84%
That's a metaphor
for mystic quest.

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.170 align:middle line:90%


00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And then there's an original
vision, the original face.

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:35.920 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the
forgetting that comes on.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Prenatally,
perinatally, childhood.

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Progressive
forgetting, forgetting.

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:47.040 align:middle line:84%
I want to share with you
a poem by David Whyte that

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.410 align:middle line:90%
talks about vision.

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:53.810 align:middle line:84%
The soul's vision and forgetting
thereof and the remembering

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:54.310 align:middle line:90%
thereof.

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:58.660 align:middle line:90%


00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:01.211 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Vision
on the Hills."

00:27:01.211 --> 00:27:01.710 align:middle line:90%


00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:05.890 align:middle line:84%
"That full view of the world
seeing as a child, barely

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:08.750 align:middle line:84%
understood, a flight
of half remembered

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:12.130 align:middle line:84%
doves and red leaves
and violent rustle

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:15.520 align:middle line:90%
from the wind that followed.

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:19.200 align:middle line:84%
Stone walls climbed the hilltops
through thunder and sleeping

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:23.390 align:middle line:84%
rain, entering the mist
that drew me on paths where

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:29.570 align:middle line:84%
everyone, every stone stood
single, opening like eyes

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:30.440 align:middle line:90%
to other worlds.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.960 align:middle line:90%


00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:39.020 align:middle line:84%
The black-faced sheep snaking
out of moss and the stone barns

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:44.090 align:middle line:84%
buttressed by old stones
and an older time,

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:50.110 align:middle line:84%
to which I knew by seeing
this, by seeing now,

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:53.130 align:middle line:90%
belong to me as I to them.

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Welded by the heat of full
attention, sustained by time,

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:04.140 align:middle line:84%
held up for all by youth, too
caught in the ordinary miracle

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:09.750 align:middle line:84%
to worry what was past and
what was present or beyond it.

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Whether the bright
vision itself could fade.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.140 align:middle line:90%
It could.

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.180 align:middle line:90%
It did.

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:19.575 align:middle line:84%
It seems we slide
down the long curve

00:28:19.575 --> 00:28:23.640 align:middle line:84%
of years falling through
time until we wake or dream

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.060 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:31.700 align:middle line:84%
The window open to find us
brazen miracle momentary fresh

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:34.490 align:middle line:90%
before we lose our faith again.

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Almost desperate, searching
through the crowded years,

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:41.040 align:middle line:90%
we meet ourselves a final time.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Trying to touch him, hold
him by the shoulders,

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:48.560 align:middle line:90%
teach us how to see again.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Hands climbed
bewildered to our eyes.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Too late we see everything,
we ask everything.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:59.120 align:middle line:90%
Who lost that vision?

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.335 align:middle line:90%
Who?

00:29:00.335 --> 00:29:11.460 align:middle line:90%
Who lost that vision?"

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:14.420 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the
wonderful mixture

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:22.895 align:middle line:84%
of poignancy and longing
and hope in that poem.

00:29:22.895 --> 00:29:25.670 align:middle line:90%


00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:29.040 align:middle line:84%
So now I want to talk a little
bit about the other main class

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:32.410 align:middle line:90%
of divination.

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:37.910 align:middle line:90%


00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And divination in
relationship to healing

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:42.340 align:middle line:90%
is also what we call diagnosis.

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:47.780 align:middle line:84%
The other main kind
looks towards the future.

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:56.040 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I've come to think
of memory and visioning

00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:00.080 align:middle line:84%
as the same basic
function, but looking

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.250 align:middle line:90%
in different directions.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Or another way of saying
is that memory relates us

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:11.550 align:middle line:84%
to the past the way visioning
relates us to the future.

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And you might say, in
addition, awareness

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:17.970 align:middle line:90%
relates us to the present.

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And I've actually come to use
the image of the Roman deity

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:29.230 align:middle line:84%
Janus as a symbol of that
bi-directional perception.

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Janus is a deity of
doorways in ancient Rome.

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:34.490 align:middle line:90%
Doorways and passageways.

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And he has two faces facing
in opposite directions.

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:43.762 align:middle line:84%
Memory and imagination
or imagery or visioning.

00:30:43.762 --> 00:30:45.720 align:middle line:84%
Or intuition might be
another way of saying it,

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.390 align:middle line:90%
or precognition, prophecy.

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:50.750 align:middle line:84%
These are all different ways
of looking at perception

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:51.970 align:middle line:90%
directed into the future.

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:54.720 align:middle line:90%


00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.930 align:middle line:84%
In the Nordic
dramatic myth complex,

00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:03.020 align:middle line:84%
there's also the story
of the Odin, the shaman

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:04.470 align:middle line:90%
god, the knowledge seeking god.

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And he's accompanied
by two ravens that

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:09.970 align:middle line:84%
sit on his shoulders, flying
around the world every day,

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:13.230 align:middle line:84%
bringing him news
of what's happening.

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:16.980 align:middle line:84%
They're called Huginn and
Munin, and those names

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:20.840 align:middle line:90%
mean thought and memory.

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:25.350 align:middle line:84%
So one raven memory flies around
the world and the other one

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:28.550 align:middle line:84%
also flies all the way around
the world, anticipating.

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:31.150 align:middle line:84%
See, anticipating
the future, I think,

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:34.640 align:middle line:84%
is a function that evolved
just like memory did.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.305 align:middle line:84%
It's as essential
to our survival.

00:31:36.305 --> 00:31:39.050 align:middle line:90%


00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:44.640 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I now, taking
Janus and the Huginn, Munin,

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:49.780 align:middle line:84%
Odin's raven as my cue, have
a sort of a working hypothesis

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:56.250 align:middle line:84%
that I'm working on, which says
that of our dreams at night,

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:58.910 align:middle line:84%
I would say about half
of them are precognitive

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and the other half past,
relate with the past.

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you how
I first came upon this.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:11.410 align:middle line:84%
When I used to work as an
administrator at the school,

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:14.817 align:middle line:84%
I used to have dreams
all the time of meetings

00:32:14.817 --> 00:32:15.900 align:middle line:90%
with other administrators.

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And I would have
meetings all the time

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:18.773 align:middle line:90%
with other administrators.

00:32:18.773 --> 00:32:21.150 align:middle line:90%


00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:22.870 align:middle line:90%
It's what administrators do.

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:25.890 align:middle line:90%
They sit in meetings.

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And I would write
down the dreams

00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:32.220 align:middle line:84%
and then I would look at
my date book as I went off.

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed
something very strange,

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:39.160 align:middle line:84%
which is that I seem to be
dreaming about meetings that

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:42.440 align:middle line:84%
were already scheduled,
maybe about three or four

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.694 align:middle line:84%
days in advance of a meeting
with person A and B then

00:32:45.694 --> 00:32:47.110 align:middle line:84%
I would have a
dream about meeting

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:50.630 align:middle line:84%
with the person A and B.
And it was almost like

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:54.324 align:middle line:84%
as if I was already kind of
working out on some level what

00:32:54.324 --> 00:32:55.240 align:middle line:90%
the meeting was about.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:59.660 align:middle line:90%


00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And then would notice that
I was already scheduled.

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:05.630 align:middle line:90%


00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Something made me
think that it was,

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:11.810 align:middle line:84%
that it occurred often
enough, and that I

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:14.915 align:middle line:84%
could see that there was even
like a time lag, a typical time

00:33:14.915 --> 00:33:16.490 align:middle line:90%
lag.

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And revelation
occurred to me when

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:24.310 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I would never
have hit upon the notion

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:28.610 align:middle line:84%
that they were precognitive
if I hadn't by chance

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:34.420 align:middle line:84%
noticed the correlation in
my date book with my dreams.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Because, and this
is very significant,

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:40.590 align:middle line:84%
the precognitive
prophetic future visions

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:42.500 align:middle line:84%
don't come with a
label attached saying,

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.850 align:middle line:90%
"This is a future vision."

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:46.980 align:middle line:90%
They don't.

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:49.380 align:middle line:84%
So you might think, well,
this is just some past vision.

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:50.921 align:middle line:84%
This is just something
I'm making up.

00:33:50.921 --> 00:33:53.950 align:middle line:90%


00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:56.340 align:middle line:84%
The only time you know
when it's a future vision

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:59.600 align:middle line:84%
is these are usually events
that psychologists have reported

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:05.300 align:middle line:84%
anecdotally where
that a woman may have

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:09.130 align:middle line:84%
a dream that the plane that
her husband is about to go on

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:10.130 align:middle line:90%
is going to crash.

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:12.929 align:middle line:84%
So she calls him up and
says, don't go on that plane.

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And she knows it's
the future because he

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:17.780 align:middle line:90%
hasn't gone on that plane yet.

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:20.270 align:middle line:84%
But ordinary events
you wouldn't know.

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:23.790 align:middle line:90%


00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:26.825 align:middle line:84%
So if you have the
hypothesis, as I now do,

00:34:26.825 --> 00:34:29.980 align:middle line:84%
that maybe dreams
are about the future,

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:33.830 align:middle line:84%
then it makes you look at things
in dreams in a different way,

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:36.210 align:middle line:90%
because dreams might be visions.

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:38.489 align:middle line:90%
Now so what are visions?

00:34:38.489 --> 00:34:40.500 align:middle line:84%
The word vision is
itself not that good,

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.719 align:middle line:84%
because it suggests
something passively.

00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:45.409 align:middle line:84%
Like televisions just sit
there and you take it in.

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:46.810 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not really.

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:48.994 align:middle line:90%
Guidance is a much better word.

00:34:48.994 --> 00:34:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Or in Portuguese, the Santo
Daime people who use ayahuasca,

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:55.900 align:middle line:84%
their word for
vision in Portuguese

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:58.600 align:middle line:84%
is miracao, which is a
combination with mira,

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.570 align:middle line:84%
having to do with seeing, and
cao, having to do with acting.

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:03.300 align:middle line:84%
You see yourself
doing something.

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:07.420 align:middle line:90%


00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:09.930 align:middle line:90%
Like I saw myself doing meeting.

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Or a classical vision experience
from the Bible, the New

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Testament, is Joseph
the father of Jesus

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:24.920 align:middle line:84%
as a dream in which the angel
comes to him and says, look,

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.090 align:middle line:84%
Herod is killing
all the baby boys.

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:31.330 align:middle line:84%
Take the wife and child,
saddle a donkey, go to Egypt.

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:32.470 align:middle line:90%
Marching orders.

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Instructions.

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:34.290 align:middle line:90%
Do this.

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:36.665 align:middle line:90%
This is the way to go.

00:35:36.665 --> 00:35:37.165 align:middle line:90%
Guidance.

00:35:37.165 --> 00:35:44.060 align:middle line:90%


00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:50.070 align:middle line:84%
So the symmetry between
visioning and remembering

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:51.010 align:middle line:90%
goes even further.

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:53.960 align:middle line:84%
I said that in memory,
healing memory,

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.630 align:middle line:90%
you regress to the past.

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:57.230 align:middle line:84%
You re-experience
something and then

00:35:57.230 --> 00:36:00.070 align:middle line:84%
you integrate it into yourself,
into your present sense

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:03.320 align:middle line:84%
of where you are, which
tends to an expansion

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.460 align:middle line:90%
of your sense of who you are.

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:07.355 align:middle line:90%
Visioning is exactly the same.

00:36:07.355 --> 00:36:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Think of a young person
who has a vision,

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:12.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be a doctor.

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:15.090 align:middle line:84%
Somehow he gets that vision,
I'm going to be a doctor.

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:22.610 align:middle line:84%
So then he or she is
going to start taking

00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:26.320 align:middle line:90%
the steps to make that real.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.700 align:middle line:90%
Like go to medical school.

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:32.052 align:middle line:84%
Iroquois said many
of our problems,

00:36:32.052 --> 00:36:33.760 align:middle line:84%
particularly mental
psychiatric problems,

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:37.820 align:middle line:84%
stem from having a vision,
having had a vision,

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.745 align:middle line:90%
and ignoring or neglecting it.

00:36:40.745 --> 00:36:42.250 align:middle line:90%
Or even going against it.

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:47.340 align:middle line:90%


00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And Native American people
put a lot of emphasis

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:52.540 align:middle line:90%
on a vision quest.

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Vision quest.

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:54.790 align:middle line:90%
Seeking a vision.

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:59.820 align:middle line:84%
Seeking, you might say, to
remember the soul's vision.

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:03.020 align:middle line:90%
Why am I really on this Earth?

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:06.740 align:middle line:84%
If you can know
that, then that helps

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.530 align:middle line:84%
make all kinds of
other decisions

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:11.390 align:middle line:84%
as to what's important
and what's not important.

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:14.970 align:middle line:90%


00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:19.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, very kind of subcategory
of visions about the future

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:20.670 align:middle line:90%
also relate to the past.

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:23.070 align:middle line:90%
And they go like this.

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:26.680 align:middle line:84%
I call them change
of course visions.

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And the subjects in a
study done by Charles Grob,

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Dennis McKenna, and
Callaway in Brazil,

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:38.435 align:middle line:84%
with members of the
UDB church, which

00:37:38.435 --> 00:37:40.860 align:middle line:84%
is a Brazilian church
which uses ayahuasca,

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:44.810 align:middle line:84%
what they call huasca, in
the religious services.

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And they did interviews
with them and medical tests

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:48.470 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And a characteristic of
stories that many of them told

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:54.960 align:middle line:84%
was that when they
drank the ayahuasca

00:37:54.960 --> 00:38:03.300 align:middle line:84%
they had a vision
on themselves either

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:11.750 align:middle line:84%
sick in a hospital or
destitute or in prison or dead

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:13.920 align:middle line:90%
from illnesses.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:17.045 align:middle line:84%
And that vision caused them
to change their direction.

00:38:17.045 --> 00:38:19.920 align:middle line:84%
The vision was showing
them, if you continue

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:25.180 align:middle line:84%
on this path of say, addiction
or abuse or criminality,

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:27.090 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
end up in this way.

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Sick or dead or
crazy or in jail.

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:35.817 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like OK, so
then they don't go there.

00:38:35.817 --> 00:38:36.900 align:middle line:90%
Then they had that choice.

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:39.530 align:middle line:84%
This is like running
out the scenario.

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:42.500 align:middle line:84%
This is what will happen if
you continue on this path.

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So then that gives you
that moment of choice.

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:45.963 align:middle line:84%
And say, OK, I'm not
going to do that.

00:38:45.963 --> 00:38:47.650 align:middle line:84%
I want to choose
a different path.

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:48.560 align:middle line:90%
This is a change of.

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:55.370 align:middle line:90%
Direction

00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:58.520 align:middle line:84%
I actually want to go back and
give you an additional example

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.360 align:middle line:84%
of the kind of dream
that I mentioned where

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:02.460 align:middle line:90%
you're anticipating something.

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:05.320 align:middle line:84%
You can think of it as I
have a dream of a meeting.

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:09.570 align:middle line:84%
I like rehearsing the dream,
rehearsing the meeting.

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And I told this story,
this observation

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:15.690 align:middle line:84%
that I'd made in a
group not too long ago.

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
surgeon in the group.

00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And he said that he himself and
other surgeon colleagues of him

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:29.850 align:middle line:84%
quite frequently dream a
complete surgery the night

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:31.547 align:middle line:84%
before they're
going to perform it.

00:39:31.547 --> 00:39:34.750 align:middle line:90%


00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And I really felt
good about that.

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:39.650 align:middle line:84%
I hope that my surgeon,
if I ever have surgery,

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:41.660 align:middle line:84%
dreams the entire
surgery the night before.

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:46.880 align:middle line:84%
I want him to know it that well
and to practice it in his head

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.390 align:middle line:90%
before he actually does it.

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And I actually kind
of have a theory

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:53.560 align:middle line:84%
which one could
research that I think

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:55.640 align:middle line:84%
athletes and
performers, musicians,

00:39:55.640 --> 00:40:00.475 align:middle line:84%
actors may very well
do the same thing.

00:40:00.475 --> 00:40:01.725 align:middle line:90%
So it's a kind of a rehearsal.

00:40:01.725 --> 00:40:04.620 align:middle line:90%


00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Now here's a general observation
about visioning and prophecy

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:15.340 align:middle line:90%
that I've also made.

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And this will be relevant to
the exercise we're going to do.

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's see how we're
doing on the time thing.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:29.070 align:middle line:84%
So when you start seeking a
vision and getting a vision,

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:33.777 align:middle line:84%
your first task is to get
your own vision for yourself,

00:40:33.777 --> 00:40:34.360 align:middle line:90%
for your life.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And it can be then
more specific.

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:42.140 align:middle line:84%
You can ask for a vision
of your creative field

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:44.090 align:middle line:90%
or at your work, your career.

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:48.310 align:middle line:84%
You can ask revision and seek
the vision of a relationship.

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:50.740 align:middle line:84%
What's the future of a
relationship going to be?

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And people in the business
in the corporate world

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.792 align:middle line:84%
are very interested in
visioning, much more

00:40:55.792 --> 00:40:56.583 align:middle line:90%
so than therapists.

00:40:56.583 --> 00:40:58.540 align:middle line:84%
Therapists are more
interested in the past.

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.706 align:middle line:84%
But people in the corporate
and organizational world

00:41:00.706 --> 00:41:02.310 align:middle line:84%
are very interested
in the future,

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:03.860 align:middle line:90%
much more than the past.

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:07.279 align:middle line:84%
They want to get a vision of
what the company's going to do.

00:41:07.279 --> 00:41:08.570 align:middle line:90%
Is it going to succeed or fail?

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:15.210 align:middle line:90%


00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:26.150 align:middle line:84%
So after you have a vision
of your personal future,

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:27.480 align:middle line:90%
that's a core practice.

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:29.810 align:middle line:84%
People who practice
this kind of thing

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:32.490 align:middle line:84%
also develop the
ability to have visions

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:38.820 align:middle line:84%
of the more general kind for
a collective or for others.

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:41.390 align:middle line:90%
And this is called prophecy.

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And professional, you might
say, forecasting divination.

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Shamanic divination differs
from what people call futurism.

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:54.810 align:middle line:90%
Futurist is poor forecasting.

00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Only in the sense that if
you go into an altered state

00:41:57.470 --> 00:42:00.380 align:middle line:84%
and you use nonordinary
means to attain

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:04.690 align:middle line:84%
that vision, that view, that
perception of the future.

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:05.856 align:middle line:90%
Which is always probability.

00:42:05.856 --> 00:42:09.240 align:middle line:84%
It is not ever
certainty, as we know.

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:16.630 align:middle line:90%


00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's clear also
why that is so,

00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:24.131 align:middle line:84%
why you have to be clear about
your own vision and purpose

00:42:24.131 --> 00:42:24.630 align:middle line:90%
first.

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're
not, you're going

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:29.580 align:middle line:84%
to get your own wishes and
fears and anxieties that

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:35.880 align:middle line:84%
are going to interfere with
your clear perception of larger

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.100 align:middle line:90%
scale phenomena.

00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:40.300 align:middle line:90%


00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:44.180 align:middle line:84%
Because emotions
like fear, desire,

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:46.675 align:middle line:84%
they will tend to cloud
and distort perception.

00:42:46.675 --> 00:42:51.170 align:middle line:90%


00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:52.720 align:middle line:90%
And that's prophecy.

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:54.720 align:middle line:84%
Among the ancient
dramatic people,

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:57.930 align:middle line:84%
there was a class of
professional seeresses,

00:42:57.930 --> 00:43:00.870 align:middle line:90%
women seers called verbas.

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And they would go around and
do prophecy professionally

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:09.590 align:middle line:84%
for people that they would
go into an altered state

00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:12.230 align:middle line:90%
and somebody would ask them.

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:13.820 align:middle line:84%
A chieftain might
ask them, well,

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:15.860 align:middle line:84%
what's going to be the
outcome of this battle

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:17.100 align:middle line:90%
that I have planned?

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Or a couple might ask, is
this a favorable marriage

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:22.020 align:middle line:90%
to be involved in?

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Or people might ask,
are my sons coming back

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:27.670 align:middle line:84%
from the sea, a
fishing expedition

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:29.260 align:middle line:90%
that they're on and so forth.

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And she would go into an altered
state by chanting and singing

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:38.060 align:middle line:84%
and then she may cast the runes
or she would have a seeing.

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And it was documented
that, for example,

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:45.700 align:middle line:84%
in things like war that
people who would not do it.

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:47.840 align:middle line:84%
If the verbas said no,
this is not a good outcome,

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:49.430 align:middle line:90%
they would cancel it.

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:53.550 align:middle line:90%


00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:57.314 align:middle line:84%
And there were these verbas,
they had this special gift.

00:43:57.314 --> 00:43:58.730 align:middle line:84%
The Daime people
actually believed

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:02.920 align:middle line:84%
that women have this seership
gift more naturally than men.

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:07.608 align:middle line:84%
But anyone can to learn to
develop it, including men.

00:44:07.608 --> 00:44:11.280 align:middle line:90%


00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:15.451 align:middle line:84%
And when you're doing healing
regressions into the past,

00:44:15.451 --> 00:44:19.325 align:middle line:84%
if you go far enough, you get
to birth and then conception,

00:44:19.325 --> 00:44:21.370 align:middle line:90%
your soul's origin.

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:25.190 align:middle line:90%


00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:26.910 align:middle line:84%
You do healing visions
about your future.

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:31.580 align:middle line:90%


00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:36.332 align:middle line:90%
You come to death, don't you?

00:44:36.332 --> 00:44:37.040 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.373 align:middle line:90%
The future is all probabilities.

00:44:38.373 --> 00:44:41.330 align:middle line:90%


00:44:41.330 --> 00:44:43.520 align:middle line:84%
But there's one
thing that's certain.

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:46.227 align:middle line:84%
All the roads into the
future, the different roads

00:44:46.227 --> 00:44:48.560 align:middle line:84%
that you might choose, that
each one of us might choose,

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:49.880 align:middle line:90%
they all have the same ending.

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:53.121 align:middle line:90%


00:44:53.121 --> 00:44:54.747 align:middle line:84%
Death and taxes
was the only thing

00:44:54.747 --> 00:44:55.830 align:middle line:90%
was certain was once said.

00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:57.180 align:middle line:90%
But it's really death.

00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Even taxes are not really
that certain as death is.

00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:04.200 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain
shamanic process

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:09.910 align:middle line:84%
where they have you
choose the road that

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:11.200 align:middle line:90%
leads to your own dying.

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:15.250 align:middle line:90%


00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:18.090 align:middle line:84%
To actually choose it
rather than not choose it.

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Just find yourself staggering
along it unconsciously,

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:29.515 align:middle line:84%
blindly, wondering
where you're going.

00:45:29.515 --> 00:45:32.560 align:middle line:90%
Now that's not morbid at all.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.380 align:middle line:90%
It's actually very liberating.

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:38.470 align:middle line:84%
I can feel you're actually
doing it as I'm suggesting it.

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Maybe many of you
have done it before.

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:44.360 align:middle line:84%
It's good to do
it over and over.

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Socrates reputedly
said, philosophers

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.666 align:middle line:84%
are those who
practice dying daily.

00:45:48.666 --> 00:45:49.166 align:middle line:90%
Daily.

00:45:49.166 --> 00:45:53.880 align:middle line:90%


00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And I've worked a lot
with people getting

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:00.252 align:middle line:90%
a vision of their dying.

00:46:00.252 --> 00:46:04.360 align:middle line:90%


00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And then I re-found
a passage in a text

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:11.475 align:middle line:84%
by Bernardo de Sahagun who
was a Franciscan friar who

00:46:11.475 --> 00:46:15.060 align:middle line:84%
wrote about the mushroom
cults, Mexican magic mushroom

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:18.590 align:middle line:84%
cults of the Aztecs that they
reported in the 16th century.

00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:22.860 align:middle line:90%


00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:26.315 align:middle line:84%
He wrote in detail and had
informants describe to him

00:46:26.315 --> 00:46:27.190 align:middle line:90%
mushroom teonanácatl.

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:31.270 align:middle line:90%


00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:35.080 align:middle line:84%
The Spanish, by and large,
thought that the mushroom cult

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:36.650 align:middle line:90%
was devil's worship.

00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Clearly anything that wasn't
Christian was devil's worship.

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:45.100 align:middle line:84%
But Bernardo de Sahagun was
sort of in his reporting,

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:46.940 align:middle line:84%
you could see, it's
kind of interesting,

00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:49.250 align:middle line:84%
he was sort of
partially sympathetic.

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:51.650 align:middle line:84%
He became partially sympathetic
to what they were doing.

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:55.580 align:middle line:84%
So his informant, this gathering
where people took mushrooms,

00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:58.050 align:middle line:84%
and they said they
foresee their own death.

00:46:58.050 --> 00:46:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
see that they're

00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:01.490 align:middle line:84%
going to fall off a
roof and die and others

00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:02.573 align:middle line:90%
see that they're drowning.

00:47:02.573 --> 00:47:05.110 align:middle line:90%


00:47:05.110 --> 00:47:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And then some of
them see that they're

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:10.100 align:middle line:84%
going to die really
peacefully and happily.

00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:13.230 align:middle line:84%
He had to admit
that at first it's

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:16.520 align:middle line:84%
like, what a nutty thing to
do, think about your own death

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:19.230 align:middle line:84%
and have hallucinations
about your own death.

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:21.030 align:middle line:90%
And clearly devil's thing.

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:23.830 align:middle line:84%
But then some of
them died happily.

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And some of them had visions
that they would be slave owners

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:34.230 align:middle line:84%
or that they would do successful
at one thing or another.

00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:36.230 align:middle line:90%
Even non death, dying visions.

00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:44.020 align:middle line:90%


00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:46.540 align:middle line:84%
So through the visioning
and divination process,

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:50.390 align:middle line:84%
you can come to have a deeper
sense of your own origin

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:53.700 align:middle line:84%
and why we're even
here in this lifetime.

00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:57.030 align:middle line:90%


00:47:57.030 --> 00:48:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And the entry of the
soul into the human form

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:04.320 align:middle line:84%
and then the exit of the
soul from the human form

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:06.570 align:middle line:90%
continue on in other forms.

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:10.971 align:middle line:90%


00:48:10.971 --> 00:48:12.470 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you another
problem that's

00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:16.366 align:middle line:90%
a vision like that, end vision.

00:48:16.366 --> 00:48:19.870 align:middle line:84%
It's by someone called
Ralph Metzner, who

00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:22.010 align:middle line:84%
was a psychologist who
lived in the second half

00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:23.520 align:middle line:90%
of the 20th century.

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:27.140 align:middle line:90%


00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:31.420 align:middle line:84%
I call it "Shaman Song." "During
the first half of my life

00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:34.810 align:middle line:84%
I wove the threads and
textures of my experience

00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:38.750 align:middle line:84%
into a multi-colored
tapestry that

00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:41.250 align:middle line:84%
in the ending half
of this journey

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:46.630 align:middle line:84%
has become a magical carpet
in which I shall sail away

00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:59.050 align:middle line:84%
over the mountains into
the worlds of the mystery."

00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:05.070 align:middle line:84%
So one last point I want to
make about future visions

00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:08.730 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll do a
divination practice.

00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And I've become very
interested, as many of us are,

00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:16.475 align:middle line:90%
in collective visions.

00:49:16.475 --> 00:49:23.430 align:middle line:90%


00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Meaning not only our
personal visions, but what's

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:29.747 align:middle line:90%
happening to us as a society.

00:49:29.747 --> 00:49:31.080 align:middle line:90%
What's happening to this planet.

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:33.740 align:middle line:90%


00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:36.500 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this is a time
when many, many visions,

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:40.220 align:middle line:84%
collective visions, visions
of our collective future

00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:45.370 align:middle line:84%
are being produced
by the scientists,

00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:48.425 align:middle line:84%
by visionaries of all kinds,
using all kinds of methods.

00:49:48.425 --> 00:50:00.040 align:middle line:90%


00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:01.920 align:middle line:90%
Let me make a point about that.

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:08.570 align:middle line:84%
So you get the vision and
then you integrate it.

00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:12.930 align:middle line:84%
You do a healing, and
then you integrate it.

00:50:12.930 --> 00:50:14.330 align:middle line:90%
That's called realization.

00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Integrating the vision is called
realization, making it real.

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:22.180 align:middle line:84%
The child who had the
vision of being a doctor,

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:23.695 align:middle line:90%
he then makes it real.

00:50:23.695 --> 00:50:27.420 align:middle line:90%


00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:31.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's a homeostatic
feedback system, isn't it?

00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:35.370 align:middle line:84%
People say the change
of course vision.

00:50:35.370 --> 00:50:37.490 align:middle line:84%
You are giving feedback
by your own future,

00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:39.470 align:middle line:90%
by your own guiding spirit.

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:45.832 align:middle line:84%
If you go on that route, that's
not where you want to be.

00:50:45.832 --> 00:50:47.040 align:middle line:90%
So then you change direction.

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:50.980 align:middle line:90%


00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:54.560 align:middle line:84%
Here's a fact that is
one of the facts that

00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:58.950 align:middle line:84%
leads many people increasingly
to say that this civilization

00:50:58.950 --> 00:51:00.420 align:middle line:90%
is going to collapse.

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:04.400 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it is
collapsing, actually.

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:05.460 align:middle line:90%
It's not impending.

00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:09.520 align:middle line:90%


00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And a few years ago, a panel of
2,800 international scientists,

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:22.800 align:middle line:84%
American international
Nobel Prize winners,

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:26.040 align:middle line:84%
issued a scientist warning to
humanity on global morning.

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:27.420 align:middle line:90%
Remember that?

00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:31.580 align:middle line:84%
They said burning
of fossil fuels,

00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:34.390 align:middle line:84%
global warming,
catastrophic, changes.

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:36.740 align:middle line:84%
If we don't make certain
changes and corrections,

00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:38.857 align:middle line:84%
reducing carbon
emissions, we're going

00:51:38.857 --> 00:51:44.020 align:middle line:84%
to get massive flooding,
weather instability.

00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:49.859 align:middle line:84%
Huge impacts on life in
all parts of the globe.

00:51:49.859 --> 00:51:51.150 align:middle line:90%
So the scientists had a vision.

00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:53.160 align:middle line:90%
They ran out the scenarios.

00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:54.690 align:middle line:90%
They said this is a thing.

00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:58.120 align:middle line:84%
What was supposed to happen
was a change of course.

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, if there's a
change of course,

00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:04.480 align:middle line:84%
then the system moves in
a different direction.

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:06.940 align:middle line:84%
A self correction
is supposed to work.

00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Now we have leaders
who ignore the warning

00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:12.850 align:middle line:90%
and actually do the opposite.

00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:16.480 align:middle line:90%
Now what's that going to do?

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Our leaders, the leaders of
the so-called American empire.

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:24.080 align:middle line:90%


00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Not the people universally
against the scientists,

00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:31.650 align:middle line:84%
ignoring them,
ignoring the warnings

00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:33.610 align:middle line:90%
of their own scientists.

00:52:33.610 --> 00:52:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Ignore the warnings
of other governments

00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:40.060 align:middle line:84%
who want to follow the warnings
and adjust their policies.

00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:42.004 align:middle line:84%
Saying no, we're not
going to do that.

00:52:42.004 --> 00:52:43.920 align:middle line:84%
We're going to continue
doing the other, which

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:47.440 align:middle line:84%
is going to increase the
instability even more.

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:48.630 align:middle line:90%
That means collapse.

00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:50.800 align:middle line:90%
There's no two ways about it.

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Now you can still try to
make corrections later,

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:58.440 align:middle line:84%
but every delay means you're
further down that road.

00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:02.160 align:middle line:90%


00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:05.530 align:middle line:84%
In the Eddas, the ancient
poems of the nomadic people

00:53:05.530 --> 00:53:08.009 align:middle line:84%
which were written down
in about the 10th century,

00:53:08.009 --> 00:53:10.550 align:middle line:84%
they had this vision of the end
of the world called Ragnarok.

00:53:10.550 --> 00:53:13.130 align:middle line:90%


00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:17.501 align:middle line:84%
And this end time vision has
many aspects and many levels

00:53:17.501 --> 00:53:18.250 align:middle line:90%
of interpretation.

00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:20.640 align:middle line:84%
You can interpret
it psychologically,

00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:24.320 align:middle line:84%
socially, globally,
meteorologically.

00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Climate changes, all
those things are in it.

00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And they're kind of
mingled together.

00:53:30.370 --> 00:53:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And the core of it is that
there are these world destroying

00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:40.470 align:middle line:90%
monsters.

00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:46.040 align:middle line:90%
And gods that are bound.

00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:49.760 align:middle line:84%
These world destructive
monsters are bound.

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And the gods and
certain human warriors,

00:53:56.060 --> 00:54:00.200 align:middle line:84%
they have a final battle where
these monsters come loose

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.590 align:middle line:90%
from their bindings.

00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
battle between the gods

00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:09.900 align:middle line:84%
and the heroes on one side
and the monsters on the other.

00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And the world
destroying monsters

00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:16.390 align:middle line:84%
include Midgard,
which is a water

00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:23.760 align:middle line:90%
serpent that floods the Earth.

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:27.070 align:middle line:90%


00:54:27.070 --> 00:54:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And it includes Surtr, who is
a fire giant, a volcanic fire

00:54:32.170 --> 00:54:34.530 align:middle line:84%
giant, accompanied
by many other fire

00:54:34.530 --> 00:54:38.610 align:middle line:90%
giants, who burns the Earth.

00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:45.800 align:middle line:90%


00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And it includes this
wolf, gigantic wolf

00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:59.080 align:middle line:84%
called Fenris wolf who
has this gigantic jaw.

00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And the upper jaw of the
Fenris wolf scrapes this sky.

00:55:03.330 --> 00:55:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And the lower jaw of the
Fenris wolf scrapes the Earth.

00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:10.060 align:middle line:90%


00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:14.200 align:middle line:84%
Scraping the sky,
shredding the ozone layer.

00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:17.979 align:middle line:84%
Scraping the Earth, gouging
minerals and oil out

00:55:17.979 --> 00:55:18.520 align:middle line:90%
of the earth.

00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:22.780 align:middle line:90%


00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:27.411 align:middle line:84%
Poison drips from the
fangs of the Fenris wolf.

00:55:27.411 --> 00:55:27.910 align:middle line:90%
Acid rain.

00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:31.760 align:middle line:90%


00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:34.430 align:middle line:84%
This is a picture of what's
happening on the planet.

00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And yet we're here in
the beautiful cathedral

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:37.910 align:middle line:90%
on a beautiful summer day.

00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:42.232 align:middle line:90%


00:55:42.232 --> 00:55:46.260 align:middle line:84%
We're living in the midst of
a civilizational and global

00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:48.190 align:middle line:90%
collapse, catastrophic collapse.

00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:53.570 align:middle line:90%


00:55:53.570 --> 00:55:57.090 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
there's no villagers

00:55:57.090 --> 00:56:02.750 align:middle line:84%
on the fangs of the Fenris wolf
as it's scraping the Earth.

00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:06.490 align:middle line:90%


00:56:06.490 --> 00:56:09.250 align:middle line:90%
So there's this gigantic battle.

00:56:09.250 --> 00:56:12.220 align:middle line:90%
The monsters do get killed.

00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:12.980 align:middle line:90%
Who are the gods?

00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:15.730 align:middle line:84%
The gods are the forces
of the principles

00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:20.210 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge, justice, courage,
compassion, generosity.

00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:22.850 align:middle line:90%


00:56:22.850 --> 00:56:25.520 align:middle line:90%
All the things we value.

00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:26.970 align:middle line:90%
They're our allies.

00:56:26.970 --> 00:56:28.935 align:middle line:84%
They're our guides
and ancestors.

00:56:28.935 --> 00:56:31.690 align:middle line:90%


00:56:31.690 --> 00:56:34.330 align:middle line:90%
And they're all defeated.

00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:39.210 align:middle line:84%
The monsters are defeated
and the gods are defeated.

00:56:39.210 --> 00:56:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And recently I've been working
with this notion coming

00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:46.430 align:middle line:90%
from that vision.

00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And I've come to
allow the thought

00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:53.530 align:middle line:84%
to really sink in
that we are being,

00:56:53.530 --> 00:56:55.940 align:middle line:90%
we will be defeated actually.

00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:59.310 align:middle line:90%


00:56:59.310 --> 00:57:02.750 align:middle line:84%
Now you may say, Metzner,
you've taken too many drugs

00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:07.400 align:middle line:84%
and turned into a doom
and gloom prophet.

00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:09.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean it
in that way at all

00:57:09.330 --> 00:57:11.360 align:middle line:90%
and I hope you understand that.

00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:13.750 align:middle line:84%
I find that actually
a liberating thought.

00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:19.008 align:middle line:90%


00:57:19.008 --> 00:57:20.930 align:middle line:84%
To accept the fact
that we will be

00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:24.810 align:middle line:84%
defeated, that the
forces of destruction

00:57:24.810 --> 00:57:26.260 align:middle line:90%
will play themselves out.

00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:27.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't say have
to play themselves,

00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:29.720 align:middle line:84%
but they will play
themselves out.

00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:32.580 align:middle line:84%
That actually
frees up the energy

00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:36.030 align:middle line:84%
to do whatever it is that
you're going to do and give it

00:57:36.030 --> 00:57:36.909 align:middle line:90%
your best shot.

00:57:36.909 --> 00:57:41.600 align:middle line:90%


00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:47.660 align:middle line:84%
I learned that from also that
teaching from Captain Paul

00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Watson, who was the founder of
the Sea Shepherd Society, who

00:57:51.310 --> 00:57:56.870 align:middle line:84%
takes boats out to confront
these huge sailing whaling

00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:59.025 align:middle line:90%
vessels and others.

00:57:59.025 --> 00:58:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And he says, when
you work in that way,

00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:06.390 align:middle line:84%
you have to recognize that
you won't actually stop

00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:07.930 align:middle line:90%
the destruction of the world.

00:58:07.930 --> 00:58:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Because these monsters
include our own corporations.

00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:15.390 align:middle line:84%
The collaborations of the
design that we've created.

00:58:15.390 --> 00:58:17.160 align:middle line:84%
We've created many of
these monsters that

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:18.250 align:middle line:90%
are destroying the world.

00:58:18.250 --> 00:58:20.920 align:middle line:90%


00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they're designed to do.

00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:25.460 align:middle line:84%
They're designed to
rip everything out

00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:28.140 align:middle line:84%
of the earth that can
be modified and sold.

00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:33.030 align:middle line:90%


00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:36.900 align:middle line:84%
But the Ragnarok ends
with a vision of renewal.

00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:41.580 align:middle line:84%
After the gods are defeated
and then a new generation

00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:45.420 align:middle line:84%
of gods and a new generation
of human beings comes.

00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:46.905 align:middle line:90%
And they say--

00:58:46.905 --> 00:58:50.820 align:middle line:90%


00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:54.656 align:middle line:84%
They say that a new green
Earth arises from the sea.

00:58:54.656 --> 00:58:57.200 align:middle line:84%
A new green Earth
rises from the sea.

00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:00.150 align:middle line:84%
The eagle flies across
the mountain again hunting

00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:02.440 align:middle line:90%
for fish.

00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And the humans sit together
and tell the stories,

00:59:05.970 --> 00:59:07.100 align:middle line:90%
remember the stories.

00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:15.370 align:middle line:90%


00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:18.530 align:middle line:84%
The eagle flies across the
mountain, hunting the fish.

00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:20.800 align:middle line:90%


00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and they say also
another part of the vision

00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:27.850 align:middle line:84%
is the grasses grow
again without being sown.

00:59:27.850 --> 00:59:31.460 align:middle line:84%
That's a vision of
restoring wilderness.

00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:34.195 align:middle line:90%
Pre-agriculture.

00:59:34.195 --> 00:59:37.385 align:middle line:84%
The nourishing herbs grow
again without being sown.

00:59:37.385 --> 00:59:40.170 align:middle line:90%


00:59:40.170 --> 00:59:44.980 align:middle line:84%
OK, now if you like, we
can do a little divination.

00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:47.560 align:middle line:90%


00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:49.400 align:middle line:90%
And one thing.

00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:53.060 align:middle line:84%
You can do divinations
in an altered state.

00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:55.840 align:middle line:84%
What you want to do is
you need to generate

00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:57.535 align:middle line:90%
a certain amount of energy.

00:59:57.535 --> 01:00:00.870 align:middle line:90%


01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:02.990 align:middle line:84%
In psychedelic work,
that energy is generated

01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:04.280 align:middle line:90%
with taking a psychedelic.

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.010 align:middle line:84%
In breath work,
holotropic breath worth

01:00:06.010 --> 01:00:08.380 align:middle line:90%
is generated through breathing.

01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:13.110 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to have us experiment
with generating it with sound.

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And so we'll do some
group chanting together

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:19.882 align:middle line:90%
with this sound box.

01:00:19.882 --> 01:00:21.740 align:middle line:90%
I've got to watch the time here.

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:26.800 align:middle line:90%


01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:29.993 align:middle line:84%
Well, we'll do that
anyway and going

01:00:29.993 --> 01:00:32.100 align:middle line:84%
to leave some time at
the end for sounding.

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:45.580 align:middle line:90%


01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:49.580 align:middle line:84%
So if you breathe into
your heart's center

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:52.044 align:middle line:84%
and then let the
breath of awareness

01:00:52.044 --> 01:00:54.502 align:middle line:84%
and the light fire from the
heart center expand from there.

01:00:54.502 --> 01:00:58.360 align:middle line:90%


01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And then let the
vibratory quality

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:04.500 align:middle line:84%
of the heart center
come up to your throat

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:08.330 align:middle line:84%
and be expressed out through
the throat as a sound.

01:01:08.330 --> 01:01:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll gradually
find the sounds

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:13.330 align:middle line:84%
harmonizing themselves,
like the om sound,

01:01:13.330 --> 01:01:15.130 align:middle line:84%
harmonizing themselves
with each other.

01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And with this ground
tone being produced here,

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:23.997 align:middle line:84%
creating a kind of a harmonious,
clear space of sound.

01:01:23.997 --> 01:01:27.989 align:middle line:90%
[CHANTING]

01:01:27.989 --> 01:03:18.982 align:middle line:90%


01:03:18.982 --> 01:03:23.419 align:middle line:84%
OK, as you're centered
in your heart's center.

01:03:23.419 --> 01:03:28.842 align:middle line:90%


01:03:28.842 --> 01:03:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Think of it as a
kind of a cave filled

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:33.750 align:middle line:90%
with warmth and compassion.

01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:38.115 align:middle line:90%
And your breath, your awareness.

01:03:38.115 --> 01:03:39.085 align:middle line:90%
A clear space.

01:03:39.085 --> 01:03:43.450 align:middle line:90%


01:03:43.450 --> 01:03:46.057 align:middle line:84%
And we'll look into
the well of memory.

01:03:46.057 --> 01:03:49.039 align:middle line:84%
And the well of memory is at
the foot of the world tree.

01:03:49.039 --> 01:03:53.512 align:middle line:90%


01:03:53.512 --> 01:03:58.979 align:middle line:84%
So you can think that
the well is at your feet.

01:03:58.979 --> 01:04:03.949 align:middle line:84%
At the foot of your
tree of life axis.

01:04:03.949 --> 01:04:05.440 align:middle line:90%
And you're looking into it.

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:10.907 align:middle line:90%


01:04:10.907 --> 01:04:12.398 align:middle line:90%
You're gazing into it.

01:04:12.398 --> 01:04:15.380 align:middle line:90%


01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:21.841 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at
your childhood.

01:04:21.841 --> 01:04:24.823 align:middle line:90%


01:04:24.823 --> 01:04:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Just getting a sense
of the whole arc

01:04:28.810 --> 01:04:33.701 align:middle line:84%
of your life as a child,
the formative years.

01:04:33.701 --> 01:04:41.151 align:middle line:84%
The place where you
lived, where you grew up.

01:04:41.151 --> 01:04:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Your mother and father, how
they looked to you then.

01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:48.606 align:middle line:84%
Different than
what they look now.

01:04:48.606 --> 01:04:50.097 align:middle line:90%
Brother or sister if any.

01:04:50.097 --> 01:04:53.079 align:middle line:90%


01:04:53.079 --> 01:04:55.067 align:middle line:90%
How it was.

01:04:55.067 --> 01:05:00.534 align:middle line:84%
Just getting an overall
sense of the quality,

01:05:00.534 --> 01:05:03.516 align:middle line:90%
the mood of your childhood.

01:05:03.516 --> 01:05:06.995 align:middle line:84%
Also how you related
to the natural world.

01:05:06.995 --> 01:05:09.977 align:middle line:90%
Animals, plants.

01:05:09.977 --> 01:05:10.971 align:middle line:90%
The great outdoors.

01:05:10.971 --> 01:05:18.923 align:middle line:90%


01:05:18.923 --> 01:05:21.252 align:middle line:84%
Then let your gaze
go even further down

01:05:21.252 --> 01:05:26.800 align:middle line:84%
into the well of memory to
earliest childhood, even

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:27.300 align:middle line:90%
infancy.

01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:32.690 align:middle line:90%


01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:40.926 align:middle line:84%
See if you can remember
lying in your mother's arms.

01:05:40.926 --> 01:05:43.878 align:middle line:90%


01:05:43.878 --> 01:05:47.814 align:middle line:90%
Or other caretaker.

01:05:47.814 --> 01:05:53.718 align:middle line:84%
And that place of complete
safety and nurturance.

01:05:53.718 --> 01:05:58.146 align:middle line:90%


01:05:58.146 --> 01:06:01.126 align:middle line:84%
You're not actually leaving
your awareness of the here now.

01:06:01.126 --> 01:06:03.758 align:middle line:84%
A strand of your
awareness stays anchored

01:06:03.758 --> 01:06:06.238 align:middle line:90%
in your heart's center.

01:06:06.238 --> 01:06:10.702 align:middle line:90%
You're sending a strand down.

01:06:10.702 --> 01:06:13.678 align:middle line:90%
An eye, a seeing eye.

01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:24.590 align:middle line:90%


01:06:24.590 --> 01:06:28.935 align:middle line:84%
And then go further back to
the time of your conception.

01:06:28.935 --> 01:06:35.058 align:middle line:90%


01:06:35.058 --> 01:06:39.645 align:middle line:84%
Where mother and father came
together in an act of love.

01:06:39.645 --> 01:06:50.579 align:middle line:84%
When you began the vertiginous
journey towards you.

01:06:50.579 --> 01:06:56.046 align:middle line:90%


01:06:56.046 --> 01:06:58.560 align:middle line:90%
The soul.

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:01.998 align:middle line:84%
Again, its journey
into human form.

01:07:01.998 --> 01:07:02.498 align:middle line:90%
Again.

01:07:02.498 --> 01:07:10.964 align:middle line:90%


01:07:10.964 --> 01:07:13.952 align:middle line:84%
What was your original
face before you were born?

01:07:13.952 --> 01:07:18.932 align:middle line:90%


01:07:18.932 --> 01:07:23.414 align:middle line:90%
And what was your soul's vision?

01:07:23.414 --> 01:07:32.378 align:middle line:84%
What is your soul's vision
for this incarnation?

01:07:32.378 --> 01:07:50.804 align:middle line:90%


01:07:50.804 --> 01:07:54.795 align:middle line:84%
And you may even ask
the further question,

01:07:54.795 --> 01:07:58.620 align:middle line:84%
the further divination
questions as to why you

01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:03.048 align:middle line:90%
chose these particular parents.

01:08:03.048 --> 01:08:04.536 align:middle line:90%
Your soul chose.

01:08:04.536 --> 01:08:07.512 align:middle line:90%


01:08:07.512 --> 01:08:10.984 align:middle line:90%
The personality forgets.

01:08:10.984 --> 01:08:15.944 align:middle line:90%


01:08:15.944 --> 01:08:17.432 align:middle line:90%
But it can remember.

01:08:17.432 --> 01:08:20.404 align:middle line:90%


01:08:20.404 --> 01:08:20.904 align:middle line:90%
Remember.

01:08:20.904 --> 01:08:28.859 align:middle line:90%


01:08:28.859 --> 01:08:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And then you bring that feeling,
that knowing and the feeling

01:08:31.710 --> 01:08:36.175 align:middle line:84%
and the sensing of
your soul's purpose,

01:08:36.175 --> 01:08:42.224 align:middle line:84%
you think of that as
coming down, coming

01:08:42.224 --> 01:08:47.174 align:middle line:84%
through, through the
mind, the mental body,

01:08:47.174 --> 01:08:49.649 align:middle line:84%
through the emotions,
emotional body.

01:08:49.649 --> 01:08:55.589 align:middle line:84%
Through the perceptions,
perceptual body.

01:08:55.589 --> 01:08:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Into the physical body,
into the cave of the heart.

01:08:59.090 --> 01:09:04.760 align:middle line:90%


01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:08.820 align:middle line:84%
In this way, the
prodigal child can

01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:15.499 align:middle line:84%
remember why you left the
divine world which was your home

01:09:15.499 --> 01:09:23.387 align:middle line:84%
and is your home to
which you will return.

01:09:23.387 --> 01:09:25.852 align:middle line:90%
When this journey is over.

01:09:25.852 --> 01:09:35.250 align:middle line:90%


01:09:35.250 --> 01:09:36.925 align:middle line:84%
So bring that
knowing and feeling

01:09:36.925 --> 01:09:44.118 align:middle line:84%
and sensing of
your soul's vision

01:09:44.118 --> 01:09:49.108 align:middle line:84%
into your present
sense of who you are.

01:09:49.108 --> 01:09:51.104 align:middle line:90%
Into the here now place.

01:09:51.104 --> 01:09:54.098 align:middle line:90%


01:09:54.098 --> 01:10:01.084 align:middle line:84%
Here we are on a May
Day in New York City.

01:10:01.084 --> 01:10:04.577 align:middle line:90%
In this gathering of seekers.

01:10:04.577 --> 01:10:07.072 align:middle line:90%
In this body.

01:10:07.072 --> 01:10:11.064 align:middle line:84%
These arms and legs,
these hands and feet.

01:10:11.064 --> 01:10:49.100 align:middle line:90%


01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:55.910 align:middle line:84%
It can be helpful to share
the visions that you've

01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:56.870 align:middle line:90%
had with someone else.

01:10:56.870 --> 01:11:00.510 align:middle line:84%
But we don't need to take
the time to do that now.

01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:04.830 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to suggest
that you maybe share it

01:11:04.830 --> 01:11:06.600 align:middle line:90%
or record it at least.

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:09.020 align:middle line:90%
Write it down.

01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:11.512 align:middle line:84%
Notes from it, anything
that came to you.

01:11:11.512 --> 01:11:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>>You spoke about
integrating the vision.

01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:17.620 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any
distinctions about how

01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:20.744 align:middle line:90%
to integrate our visions?

01:11:20.744 --> 01:11:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>>How to integrate a vision?

01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:34.810 align:middle line:90%


01:11:34.810 --> 01:11:41.080 align:middle line:84%
The intention is the crucial
factor in obtaining a vision

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:46.931 align:middle line:84%
and obtaining healing and
moving into an altered state

01:11:46.931 --> 01:11:47.555 align:middle line:90%
for divination.

01:11:47.555 --> 01:11:50.730 align:middle line:90%


01:11:50.730 --> 01:11:52.950 align:middle line:84%
In the Harvard
project, we called

01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:55.600 align:middle line:90%
it this phrase set and setting.

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:58.417 align:middle line:84%
That the content of an
expanded consciousness

01:11:58.417 --> 01:12:00.500 align:middle line:84%
experiences a function of
the set and the setting.

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:01.317 align:middle line:90%
Set is intention.

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:05.987 align:middle line:90%


01:12:05.987 --> 01:12:07.620 align:middle line:90%
Or question.

01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:08.900 align:middle line:90%
Question or intention.

01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Divination takes place by
questioning, getting an answer.

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:19.220 align:middle line:84%
So then the key to
integrating is also

01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:21.305 align:middle line:84%
to have the intention
towards integration.

01:12:21.305 --> 01:12:24.150 align:middle line:90%


01:12:24.150 --> 01:12:26.250 align:middle line:90%
Because that then is the choice.

01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Intention determines where
you direct your attention,

01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:32.030 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:34.750 align:middle line:84%
If you have the
intention of healing,

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:38.170 align:middle line:84%
then that's what you're
going to attend to.

01:12:38.170 --> 01:12:40.270 align:middle line:84%
If you have the
intention, if you

01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:42.160 align:middle line:84%
have a vision you're
going to be a doctor

01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:45.337 align:middle line:84%
or you're going
to be a musician,

01:12:45.337 --> 01:12:47.420 align:middle line:84%
then you would also then
would have the intention,

01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:49.530 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm going to
make that vision.

01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:52.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to
realize that vision.

01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:53.630 align:middle line:90%
It would be your choice.

01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Vision is guidance,
but it's not commands.

01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:59.280 align:middle line:90%
It's not certain.

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:04.056 align:middle line:84%
You still have the
choice, as we know.

01:13:04.056 --> 01:13:05.680 align:middle line:84%
The people, the gang
in the White House

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:10.170 align:middle line:84%
is choosing not to listen to
the visions that are suggested

01:13:10.170 --> 01:13:13.050 align:middle line:90%
a different course.

01:13:13.050 --> 01:13:13.930 align:middle line:90%
People can do that.

01:13:13.930 --> 01:13:16.190 align:middle line:84%
People can choose to go
against their vision.

01:13:16.190 --> 01:13:18.680 align:middle line:84%
They can choose to commit
crimes and horrible things

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:19.260 align:middle line:90%
that they do.

01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:22.350 align:middle line:90%


01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:25.942 align:middle line:84%
But they can also
choose otherwise.

01:13:25.942 --> 01:13:29.300 align:middle line:90%
That's what I would say to that.

01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:34.680 align:middle line:84%
>>My question is, if you
feel our defeat is necessary,

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:38.090 align:middle line:84%
what do you do to not abandon
the current situation,

01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:41.570 align:middle line:84%
the children of this time with
the Green Earth Foundation?

01:13:41.570 --> 01:13:45.820 align:middle line:84%
What is your action
for the present?

01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>>I don't feel
defeat is necessary.

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:51.260 align:middle line:90%


01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.930 align:middle line:84%
I accept the fact that
we will be defeated.

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:56.460 align:middle line:90%


01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:57.722 align:middle line:90%
I acknowledge that fact.

01:13:57.722 --> 01:14:00.950 align:middle line:90%


01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And that fact frees me
up from worrying about

01:14:09.710 --> 01:14:15.680 align:middle line:84%
whether what I do will
make any difference.

01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:22.790 align:middle line:84%
It allows me to focus on doing
what my vision tells me to do,

01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:26.430 align:middle line:84%
which is preserve life as
much as possible and those

01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:29.220 align:middle line:84%
of my children and those of the
people I come into contact with

01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:31.341 align:middle line:90%
and life, non-human life.

01:14:31.341 --> 01:14:40.930 align:middle line:90%


01:14:40.930 --> 01:14:43.400 align:middle line:84%
It's hard for people to get
that thing about defeat.

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Because we're living in a part
of the globe that's doing OK.

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:52.490 align:middle line:84%
But we could be living on a dump
heap, a trash heap in Manila

01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:54.580 align:middle line:84%
where 10,000 families
are trying to raise

01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:57.170 align:middle line:90%
their children on a trash heap.

01:14:57.170 --> 01:14:59.860 align:middle line:90%
Now, is that civilization?

01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Or is that a collapse
of civilization.

01:15:03.450 --> 01:15:08.480 align:middle line:90%


01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:12.920 align:middle line:90%
Does that answer your question?

01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:16.240 align:middle line:84%
>>How can you peel away
the levels of the self

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:18.810 align:middle line:84%
and become more
authentic and real

01:15:18.810 --> 01:15:22.888 align:middle line:84%
and yet still develop your ego
in a healthy, authentic way?

01:15:22.888 --> 01:15:28.199 align:middle line:90%


01:15:28.199 --> 01:15:30.115 align:middle line:84%
>>That's one of those
psychological questions.

01:15:30.115 --> 01:15:31.805 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:15:31.805 --> 01:15:33.394 align:middle line:90%


01:15:33.394 --> 01:15:34.435 align:middle line:90%
If I were a psychologist.

01:15:34.435 --> 01:15:39.830 align:middle line:90%


01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:43.220 align:middle line:90%
It's a complicated question.

01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:47.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I
have any easy answers.

01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:49.960 align:middle line:84%
The question, as I
understand it, is about well,

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:52.912 align:middle line:84%
psychologists say you have to
develop strong ego boundaries.

01:15:52.912 --> 01:15:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And then you have these
people called borderlines who

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:56.850 align:middle line:90%
don't have any ego boundaries.

01:15:56.850 --> 01:15:59.660 align:middle line:84%
But then I'm talking about
having a vision and expanded

01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:00.940 align:middle line:90%
sense of self.

01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:03.084 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that going in
the opposite direction?

01:16:03.084 --> 01:16:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And some psychiatrists
and psychologists

01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:06.472 align:middle line:90%
have actually written that.

01:16:06.472 --> 01:16:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
people who have borderline

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:10.680 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't practice
mystical practices.

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:12.540 align:middle line:90%
And that may be true.

01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:13.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:14.820 align:middle line:90%
That may be true.

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>In another words,
with taking drugs,

01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:24.181 align:middle line:84%
a borderline taking drugs,
that would be self-destructive?

01:16:24.181 --> 01:16:24.680 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:28.220 align:middle line:84%
But then so are a lot of
other things that people do.

01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:31.034 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it could
help sometimes.

01:16:31.034 --> 01:16:32.950 align:middle line:84%
See, it all depends on
the set and the setting

01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:34.500 align:middle line:90%
and the inclinations.

01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:39.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm very disinclined to make
general rules for people.

01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:41.080 align:middle line:84%
As somebody who
works with people,

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:43.600 align:middle line:84%
all I go with is
somebody comes to me

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.970 align:middle line:84%
and says they would
like help in something.

01:16:45.970 --> 01:16:47.560 align:middle line:90%
Then I try to address that.

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:50.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really interested
in building up a system

01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:53.740 align:middle line:90%
or making generalities.

01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And all the things I say,
I don't really expect you

01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:00.590 align:middle line:84%
to or even want you to really
believe them or take them

01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:02.254 align:middle line:90%
on faith because I've said them.

01:17:02.254 --> 01:17:03.920 align:middle line:84%
They're like observations
that I've made

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:05.290 align:middle line:90%
and they may be true for you.

01:17:05.290 --> 01:17:07.940 align:middle line:90%


01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:08.740 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:10.450 align:middle line:90%
And that's for you to find out.

01:17:10.450 --> 01:17:11.180 align:middle line:90%
That's for you.

01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:13.880 align:middle line:90%


01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:17.630 align:middle line:84%
So I would be reluctant
to say to people,

01:17:17.630 --> 01:17:20.560 align:middle line:90%
doing that is destructive.

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:23.560 align:middle line:84%
But if I encountered
a particular person,

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:26.740 align:middle line:84%
and I have said that to some
people that I've worked with,

01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:29.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's a good idea
for you to be taking drugs.

01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:32.000 align:middle line:90%


01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Basically it's
still that choice.

01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:34.846 align:middle line:90%
And you have to respect that.

01:17:34.846 --> 01:17:37.820 align:middle line:90%


01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:41.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that
teachings if you often

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:43.660 align:middle line:84%
hear that you have
to kill the ego

01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:47.680 align:middle line:84%
and you have to overcome the
ego in order to become mystical

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:49.080 align:middle line:90%
or spiritual.

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:51.090 align:middle line:90%
I think that's nonsense.

01:17:51.090 --> 01:17:54.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the ego
is like your hand.

01:17:54.890 --> 01:17:56.570 align:middle line:90%
Actually, there are many egos.

01:17:56.570 --> 01:17:58.022 align:middle line:90%
The hand is one.

01:17:58.022 --> 01:17:59.030 align:middle line:90%
Hand has an ego.

01:17:59.030 --> 01:18:01.404 align:middle line:84%
The eye has another ego,
the heart has an ego,

01:18:01.404 --> 01:18:02.320 align:middle line:90%
the genitals have ego.

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:07.170 align:middle line:90%


01:18:07.170 --> 01:18:11.480 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] said
every atom has an ego.

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:13.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how many atoms
are there in a body?

01:18:13.850 --> 01:18:17.110 align:middle line:90%
That's billions and trillions.

01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:20.100 align:middle line:84%
So you don't want to
chop off your hand.

01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:21.680 align:middle line:90%
That's ridiculous.

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:24.980 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand,
the truth in that saying

01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:30.910 align:middle line:84%
is you want your hand to be
functioning under your control

01:18:30.910 --> 01:18:32.570 align:middle line:90%
how you choose.

01:18:32.570 --> 01:18:35.597 align:middle line:84%
Not your hand to be doing
its own thing, which is

01:18:35.597 --> 01:18:36.430 align:middle line:90%
called manipulation.

01:18:36.430 --> 01:18:41.230 align:middle line:90%


01:18:41.230 --> 01:18:44.040 align:middle line:90%
Good question though, thank you.

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:46.860 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's 11:15.

01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:48.960 align:middle line:90%
So I think I should end.

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:51.657 align:middle line:84%
But I want to end with a
poem, a visionary column.

01:18:51.657 --> 01:18:56.750 align:middle line:84%
A short one by D.
H. Lawrence, which

01:18:56.750 --> 01:19:01.880 align:middle line:84%
is about the relationship
between individual visionary

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:11.864 align:middle line:84%
experience and the collective
madness of our social system.

01:19:11.864 --> 01:19:16.590 align:middle line:90%


01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:19.752 align:middle line:84%
"When we get out of the
glass bottles of our ego.

01:19:19.752 --> 01:19:23.060 align:middle line:90%


01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:26.620 align:middle line:84%
When we get out of the
glass bottles of our ego

01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:29.370 align:middle line:84%
and when we escape
like squirrels turning

01:19:29.370 --> 01:19:36.000 align:middle line:84%
in the cages of our personality
and get into the forests again,

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.358 align:middle line:84%
we shall shiver with
cold and fright.

01:19:38.358 --> 01:19:41.262 align:middle line:90%


01:19:41.262 --> 01:19:45.600 align:middle line:84%
But things will happen to us so
that we don't know ourselves.

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:48.310 align:middle line:90%


01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Cool, unlying life will rush
in, and passion will make

01:19:54.010 --> 01:19:56.990 align:middle line:90%
our bodies taut with power.

01:19:56.990 --> 01:20:00.400 align:middle line:84%
We shall stamp our
feet with new power

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:03.620 align:middle line:90%
and old things will fall down.

01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:12.280 align:middle line:84%
We shall laugh and institutions
will curl up like burnt paper."

01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:13.780 align:middle line:90%
So thank you very much.

01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:17.130 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:20:17.130 --> 01:21:03.034 align:middle line:90%
