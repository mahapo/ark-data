00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.640 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.660 align:middle line:84%
>>The last time we were here
in the Cathedral of Saint

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.430 align:middle line:84%
John, the Divine Senate
Hall, was in 1996

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.390 align:middle line:84%
when we facilitated Terence
McKenna's final tour,

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.220 align:middle line:84%
his Timewave Zero tour,
during which he explained

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.310 align:middle line:84%
his mathematical formulation for
the end of history, this coming

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.400 align:middle line:84%
about through
increasingly novel events,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.360 align:middle line:84%
leading to a zero-point
on December 21, 2012.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.330 align:middle line:84%
A date also called for
by Mayans and Hopis,

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.360 align:middle line:84%
but prophecies unknown to
Terence during his punch card

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.440 align:middle line:84%
computer formulations
using the "I Ching" back

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.810 align:middle line:84%
in his early Berkeley
days in the 1960s.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.690 align:middle line:90%
So perhaps Terence was correct.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.970 align:middle line:84%
We must admit to the dramatic
increase in novel events

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.320 align:middle line:84%
taking place on our
planet, many of which

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.560 align:middle line:90%
appear to be contrary to life.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.410 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, we
must admit to the many novel

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.210 align:middle line:84%
events, discoveries,
insights, and dramatically

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.060 align:middle line:84%
shifting perceptions that add
credence to the McKenna theory

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.400 align:middle line:84%
that a new cycle, a new
reality may be in the offing.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.140 align:middle line:84%
So that is why we're
here in this place.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.500 align:middle line:90%


00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.140 align:middle line:84%
We are about the business
of exploring, finding,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.470 align:middle line:90%
and being novelty.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.770 align:middle line:84%
We are here to bring our
techniques of discovery

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.190 align:middle line:84%
together and to possibly
assist in creating

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.700 align:middle line:84%
what awaits humanity
just around the corner.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.990 align:middle line:84%
We are here to
seek understandings

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.850 align:middle line:84%
and to bridge our souls,
our science, and our art

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.730 align:middle line:90%
into novel explanations.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.090 align:middle line:84%
We are here to look
at what went before

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.890 align:middle line:84%
and find new definitions
of ourselves in so doing.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.860 align:middle line:84%
We are here to find
fresh ideas of religion

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.400 align:middle line:90%
and then to question them.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.900 align:middle line:84%
We are here to become
shamanic and poetic as well

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.220 align:middle line:90%
as inquisitive and proving.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.970 align:middle line:84%
We are here to talk of
possibilities for the future

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.490 align:middle line:90%
beyond 2012.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.370 align:middle line:84%
We are here to become the
prophets of a new creation.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.495 align:middle line:84%
We are here creating
the post new age.

00:02:48.495 --> 00:02:51.100 align:middle line:90%


00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.970 align:middle line:84%
So Terrence, whether you are
with your magnificent DMT

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.580 align:middle line:84%
machine elves or in
some dimension made up

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.480 align:middle line:84%
of colorful wordsmiths
talking to one another,

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.180 align:middle line:84%
know that we are a novel
and rapidly growing meme.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.930 align:middle line:84%
The two panel
discussions this weekend

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.276 align:middle line:84%
bring together
interpretations of realities.

00:03:14.276 --> 00:03:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And although they range from
Dr. Kaku's multiple dimensions

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.550 align:middle line:84%
and superstrings to the
religions and entheogens

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.630 align:middle line:84%
of Dr. Smith, they
all point well

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.565 align:middle line:84%
beyond conventional
perspectives.

00:03:27.565 --> 00:03:30.280 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>>We were having a
discussion at dinner,

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.710 align:middle line:90%
two perspectives about reality.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.110 align:middle line:10%
One was that we are so small
that what we do doesn't matter.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.400 align:middle line:84%
We're simply specks,
instants in a vast cosmos.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.280 align:middle line:84%
The other is that we
are one with the cosmos,

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.120 align:middle line:84%
and what we do might
actually determine

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.434 align:middle line:90%
how the cosmic future goes.

00:03:53.434 --> 00:03:54.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
the right answer

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.539 align:middle line:84%
is, but at least the second
one, you don't feel so

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:59.830 align:middle line:90%
foolish trying to do something.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.980 align:middle line:90%


00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.840 align:middle line:84%
During one of the breaks earlier
today, Russell asked me, well,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.210 align:middle line:84%
how do you know that these
experiences aren't just

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.490 align:middle line:84%
emanating from the
unconscious of the people?

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.070 align:middle line:84%
How do you know it's
coming from outside?

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And as you can expect
of a psychiatrist,

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to give a straight
answer to that question.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.630 align:middle line:90%
But I want to use it.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.320 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I think it
is not one or the other.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.780 align:middle line:84%
I think the question reflects
an either or dichotomy.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.470 align:middle line:84%
I believe there
is a way to think

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.750 align:middle line:84%
of it as part of the
collective unconscious

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.695 align:middle line:84%
but also as some kind
of intelligent entities

00:04:40.695 --> 00:04:43.820 align:middle line:90%
reaching us.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.560 align:middle line:84%
But in that
discussion and now, I

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.620 align:middle line:84%
would turn the question
around and look

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.880 align:middle line:84%
at the question from the
standpoint of the worldview

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:59.290 align:middle line:84%
that we have that has voided the
cosmos of all entities, beings,

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.300 align:middle line:84%
except-- well, treating them
as imagination, which again,

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.920 align:middle line:90%
is a projection our own ideas.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.810 align:middle line:84%
But that the burden of proof
is to show that something

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.730 align:middle line:84%
is on the outside rather
than asking ourselves,

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.500 align:middle line:84%
how is it that we
have so rid the cosmos

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.700 align:middle line:84%
of all other intelligent
life that we should even

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.540 align:middle line:90%
be asking that question?

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.100 align:middle line:90%


00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And that relates to the
question of worldviews

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.401 align:middle line:84%
and how powerful
they are, and how

00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:29.150 align:middle line:84%
even though we're
trying to open them up--

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.170 align:middle line:84%
and I have a great
deal of, again,

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.880 align:middle line:84%
I never know whether to
thank Stan because sometimes,

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.115 align:middle line:84%
when your life
changes radically,

00:05:37.115 --> 00:05:39.530 align:middle line:84%
you have mixed
feelings about it.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.950 align:middle line:84%
But through the non-ordinary
state work, the Holotropic

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.360 align:middle line:84%
Breathwork, and Stan's
work, my whole worldview

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.650 align:middle line:84%
fell apart beginning
quite a few years ago,

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.180 align:middle line:90%
and it continues to fall apart.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.490 align:middle line:84%
But I have very great respect
for the tenacity with which

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.020 align:middle line:84%
worldviews hold on in the
face of all kinds of evidence,

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.170 align:middle line:84%
like Rianne Eisler
was saying, that they

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.220 align:middle line:84%
don't work, that we have
to do something different,

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.414 align:middle line:84%
that the dominator model
is a total failure.

00:06:10.414 --> 00:06:12.330 align:middle line:84%
It's leading to the
destruction of the planet.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.960 align:middle line:90%
Still, it holds on.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And I came across a story that I
thought illustrated this really

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.410 align:middle line:90%
beautifully.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.840 align:middle line:84%
This is from a book
called "The Hiram Key"

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.300 align:middle line:84%
by Chris Knight
and Robert Lomas.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.665 align:middle line:90%
The story goes like this.

00:06:24.665 --> 00:06:26.670 align:middle line:84%
"At a gathering of
rabbis, the wisemen

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.760 align:middle line:84%
were debating a section of
holy law, and one of them

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.990 align:middle line:84%
found himself at odds
with the rest of the group

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.900 align:middle line:90%
on a point of interpretation.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.330 align:middle line:84%
He was coming under great
pressure to concede.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.810 align:middle line:84%
But he knew that he was right
and that God would therefore

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.400 align:middle line:90%
be on his side.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.570 align:middle line:84%
So he called upon the Almighty
to help him prove his case.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.140 align:middle line:84%
Please, God, if I am right,
let the streams of Israel flow

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.010 align:middle line:90%
uphill, the rabbi begged.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.080 align:middle line:84%
Immediately, the waters of
the land changed direction.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, his
adversaries were unmoved.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.700 align:middle line:84%
Please, God, the
exasperated rabbi

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.630 align:middle line:84%
said again, if I am right, may
the trees bend to the ground.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:01.310 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.970 align:middle line:90%


00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.030 align:middle line:84%
But still, his followers
were intransigent.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Dear God, he called out
in rising frustration,

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.160 align:middle line:84%
may you speak aloud
and support me.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.570 align:middle line:84%
The clouds promptly parted
and a great voice from heaven

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.480 align:middle line:84%
boomed forth, my friends, I
have to tell you are wrong

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.580 align:middle line:90%
and he is right.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.450 align:middle line:90%
This is what I intended.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.760 align:middle line:84%
The lone elder
smiled in triumph,

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.810 align:middle line:84%
but the group
remained unimpressed.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Oh, they said, we pay no
attention to heavenly voices

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.190 align:middle line:84%
because the correct
determination on this point

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:37.720 align:middle line:90%
was written down long ago."

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:42.760 align:middle line:84%
This extraordinary
writer, Seyyed Nasr,

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.180 align:middle line:84%
he said, "it is a
fact to ponder upon

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.500 align:middle line:84%
that while men considered
the earth as their mother

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.150 align:middle line:84%
and heaven as their father,
the earth managed to feed

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.540 align:middle line:90%
the children it had begotten.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And that since men
ceased to regard

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.190 align:middle line:84%
the earth as their mother but
rather as a female captured

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.950 align:middle line:84%
in war to be
prostituted and raped,

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:07.030 align:middle line:84%
the earth can no longer
feed all her progeny.

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:12.790 align:middle line:84%
The person who speaks for the
life of the spirit today cannot

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:15.710 align:middle line:84%
remain indifferent to the
destruction of that primordial

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.130 align:middle line:84%
cathedral which
is virgin nature,

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.240 align:middle line:84%
nor maintain silence concerning
the harm that man does

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:25.060 align:middle line:84%
to himself as an immortal
being by absolutizing

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.050 align:middle line:84%
the 'kingdom of man.'
" That's in quotes.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:30.180 align:middle line:84%
"And as a consequence,
brutalizing and destroying

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.760 align:middle line:84%
everything else in the name of
the earthly welfare of members

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.530 align:middle line:90%
of that kingdom."

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:40.500 align:middle line:84%
So I think the worldview
we have of reality,

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.100 align:middle line:84%
this restriction
of consciousness,

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.840 align:middle line:84%
and with all that science
may have brought us,

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.690 align:middle line:84%
it also has been accompanied
by a literalness,

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.170 align:middle line:84%
a materialization of
the notion of reality

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:54.000 align:middle line:84%
to the point where we are
completely cut off from so

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.250 align:middle line:90%
many dimensions of reality.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And here, I would
argue with Michio

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.160 align:middle line:84%
that, he's speaking again,
I think, of excitement

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.921 align:middle line:84%
at the idea we're going
to conquer nature.

00:09:02.921 --> 00:09:03.920 align:middle line:90%
We're going to move out.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.620 align:middle line:84%
We're going to move out to other
planets and other galaxies.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And again, I have two
problems with that.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:16.000 align:middle line:84%
One is I think it still
hints to me of domination

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.230 align:middle line:84%
but now extending it
out into space, which

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.237 align:middle line:90%
we're hearing all too much of.

00:09:21.237 --> 00:09:23.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure he doesn't
mean it that way at all.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:27.730 align:middle line:84%
But all too much of in terms of
this militarization of space.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And also, to me,
conveys again the notion

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.420 align:middle line:84%
that reality is
really restricted

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.590 align:middle line:84%
to this three-dimensional
world, however vast it may be.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Whereas that might be just the
most immediate element reality

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:43.720 align:middle line:90%
that our senses can see.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.820 align:middle line:84%
But that there are
vast domains of reality

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.420 align:middle line:84%
that we can reach through
non-ordinary states from which,

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.040 align:middle line:84%
again, we have been cut
off by the restriction

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.840 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that has
been the Western habit.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.740 align:middle line:90%
So those are my remarks.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.010 align:middle line:10%
>>Like John, I experienced
a major initiation

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:06.530 align:middle line:10%
that tore apart my worldview,
my image of reality.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.250 align:middle line:10%
It happened in 1954.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:10.810 align:middle line:84%
When I was a beginning
psychiatrist,

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:14.730 align:middle line:84%
I was fully committed to
Freudian psychoanalysis.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:19.050 align:middle line:84%
But I started experiencing
a conflict in relation

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:24.970 align:middle line:84%
to psychoanalysis, being
constantly surprised

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.120 align:middle line:84%
by the findings
of psychoanalysis

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.830 align:middle line:84%
along theoretical lines into
how many different areas

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:35.280 align:middle line:84%
psychoanalysis has
penetrated and given

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.250 align:middle line:84%
seemingly brilliant
interpretations

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.380 align:middle line:84%
for various obscure
areas like symbolism

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:44.150 align:middle line:84%
of dreams, neurotic
symptoms, psychopathology

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:46.140 align:middle line:90%
of everyday life.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Every slip of the tongue had
deep meaning, content of art,

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.740 align:middle line:84%
sociopolitical
events, and so on.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.500 align:middle line:84%
But I was also becoming
aware of psychoanalysis

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:02.390 align:middle line:84%
as a clinical tool,
when you use that system

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:06.280 align:middle line:84%
with people who have emotional
psychosomatic problems.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.865 align:middle line:84%
And that was a very
different story.

00:11:08.865 --> 00:11:12.060 align:middle line:84%
There was a very narrow
indication range.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:16.050 align:middle line:84%
You had to meet special
criteria to be a good candidate.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you were considered
a good candidate,

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:22.580 align:middle line:84%
you had to prepare yourself,
not for months but for years.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:28.810 align:middle line:84%
My own training took seven
years, three times a week.

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And so I was
experiencing a conflict,

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.450 align:middle line:90%
a crisis within myself.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:37.120 align:middle line:84%
I started regretting
that I studied

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.630 align:middle line:90%
medicine and psychiatry.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:42.230 align:middle line:84%
My original intention was
to go to animated movies.

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And I started nostalgically
thinking back.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:49.590 align:middle line:84%
I thought this whole thing
was a major, major error.

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And then we got a box of ampules
from Sanders, which was LSD.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And they asked us if we would
experiment with this substance

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:07.200 align:middle line:84%
and let them know if there
was any legitimate use for it

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.660 align:middle line:90%
in psychiatry.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And they suggested
two different uses.

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:17.140 align:middle line:84%
One was using LSD as
a model psychosis,

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.870 align:middle line:84%
to give it to quote
unquote "normal people"

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:24.780 align:middle line:84%
and study all kinds of things
before, during, and after.

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And to get some
insight about what

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:30.910 align:middle line:84%
might be causing these
mental aberrations

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:33.100 align:middle line:90%
in psychotic patients.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And the second
suggestion was maybe

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.570 align:middle line:84%
this could be a training
tool where psychiatrists,

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.860 align:middle line:84%
psychologists could
spend a few hours

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.790 align:middle line:90%
in the world of their patients.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of it,
be able to understand

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.480 align:middle line:84%
them better, to communicate
with them better,

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.400 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully, to be more
effective in treating them.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.004 align:middle line:84%
So I became one of
the early volunteers.

00:12:54.004 --> 00:12:56.170 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have missed that
opportunity for anything

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:56.740 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.640 align:middle line:90%


00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And had this very, very powerful
transforming experience.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.100 align:middle line:90%


00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:11.160 align:middle line:84%
My perceptor, the
man who got the LSD,

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.810 align:middle line:90%
was also interested in EEG.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And he was interested
in, at that time,

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:19.810 align:middle line:84%
what's called entrainment,
or driving the brain waves,

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:23.310 align:middle line:84%
exposing people to
powerful stroboscopic light

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:28.480 align:middle line:84%
and studying if the brain waves
in the corresponding areas

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.700 align:middle line:84%
of the brain would pick up
somehow the frequency that

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.232 align:middle line:90%
was being fed in.

00:13:33.232 --> 00:13:38.150 align:middle line:84%
So I had to agree to having
my EEG done before, during,

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and after, but also to
have my brain waves driven

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.640 align:middle line:90%
on top of that.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:48.760 align:middle line:84%
So when I was peeking in about
the second and the third hour

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.360 align:middle line:84%
of this experiment,
a research assistant

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.200 align:middle line:84%
came and said, it's time
to drive the brain waves,

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.560 align:middle line:84%
took me into a
little cell, pasted

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.730 align:middle line:90%
is the electrodes on my head.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:03.830 align:middle line:84%
I closed my eyes, and she
brought this gigantic strobe,

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:06.900 align:middle line:84%
put it above my head,
and turned it on.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And in the next
moment, there was light

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.570 align:middle line:84%
like I had never
seen in my life.

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.269 align:middle line:84%
I thought, initially,
this is what

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:14.810 align:middle line:84%
it must have looked
like in Hiroshima

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:16.930 align:middle line:90%
when the bomb went off.

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Today, I think it was
more like the dharmakaya,

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:23.940 align:middle line:84%
the primary, clear light from
the Tibetan Book of the Dead.

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, as a result of it, I
lost the research assistant.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:28.670 align:middle line:90%
I lost the clinic.

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:29.920 align:middle line:90%
I lost Prague.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.750 align:middle line:90%
Then I lost the planet.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And then I had the feeling
that my consciousness

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.060 align:middle line:84%
had absolutely no
boundaries left,

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.930 align:middle line:84%
that I became commensurate
with the entire universe

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:44.710 align:middle line:84%
and experienced this fantastic,
astronomical kind of adventure

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:48.825 align:middle line:84%
of cosmic consciousness and
came back very, very impressed.

00:14:48.825 --> 00:14:51.500 align:middle line:90%


00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.990 align:middle line:84%
I had the feeling, since I
was stuck with psychiatry,

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:56.730 align:middle line:84%
this was by far the
most interesting thing

00:14:56.730 --> 00:15:00.312 align:middle line:84%
you can do if you
are a psychiatrist,

00:15:00.312 --> 00:15:03.810 align:middle line:84%
it's to study non-ordinary
states of consciousness.

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.760 align:middle line:84%
So in the last about
45 years, I have really

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:10.370 align:middle line:84%
done, professionally, very
little else but different

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.590 align:middle line:84%
things that in
one way or another

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:16.050 align:middle line:84%
were related to these
non-ordinary states.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:19.800 align:middle line:84%
About half of the 45
years was clinical work

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:24.450 align:middle line:84%
with psychedelics in Prague
and then in the United States

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:28.890 align:middle line:84%
at the Maryland Psychiatric
Research Center.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:31.870 align:middle line:84%
The second half of the time,
my wife Christina and I

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:35.220 align:middle line:84%
developed what we call
Holotropic Breathwork, where

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:39.140 align:middle line:84%
similar kinds of experiences can
be induced by faster breathing,

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:42.710 align:middle line:84%
by music, by certain
of body work.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And then I had a lot of
contact with anthropologists

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.620 align:middle line:84%
and shamans from
different cultures,

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:54.630 align:middle line:84%
with Thanatologists, and people
who had near death experiences.

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.440 align:middle line:84%
I have also worked
with people who

00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:00.810 align:middle line:84%
had UFO abduction experiences
in psychedelic sessions,

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:06.660 align:middle line:84%
and in the breathwork, and also
as part of spiritual emergency.

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Christina and I have
done work with people

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.750 align:middle line:84%
who had spontaneous episodes
of non-ordinary states.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:15.120 align:middle line:90%


00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.640 align:middle line:84%
I've been interested
in meditation, anything

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.740 align:middle line:84%
that in one way or another is
related to non-ordinary states.

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And during this work, I
came to the conclusion

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:29.840 align:middle line:84%
that if we take seriously
and study systematically

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.970 align:middle line:84%
what happens in these states,
that we would end up not only

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:37.550 align:middle line:84%
with a radically different
concept of psychology,

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:41.180 align:middle line:84%
psychiatry, psychotherapy,
but that it would radically

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:45.550 align:middle line:84%
change the Western
philosophy of science,

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:49.900 align:middle line:84%
that it would move us out of the
monistic, materialistic, narrow

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:54.090 align:middle line:84%
worldview toward a worldview
that would integrate

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:56.985 align:middle line:84%
the best of science and the
best of the mystical traditions.

00:16:56.985 --> 00:17:06.280 align:middle line:90%


00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.329 align:middle line:84%
>>As a physicist, I think
we are in the best of times

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:11.060 align:middle line:90%
and the worst of times.

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:13.790 align:middle line:10%
When I got my PhD At the
University of California

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:18.230 align:middle line:10%
at Berkeley back in the
late '60s, early '70s,

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:20.540 align:middle line:10%
physics was at a standstill.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:24.730 align:middle line:84%
The reductionist philosophy had
pretty much played itself out.

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:27.030 align:middle line:84%
We were drowning in
subatomic particles.

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:29.700 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know what
the hell we were doing.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:30.780 align:middle line:90%
It stalled.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.920 align:middle line:90%
Einstein's theory also stalled.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.830 align:middle line:84%
We had all these
fantastic predictions

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:37.050 align:middle line:84%
of Einstein's
theory, none of which

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:39.320 align:middle line:84%
could be tested
with the technology

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.130 align:middle line:90%
of that period of time.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And we physicists were
reduced to simply giving

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Greek names to all these
subatomic particles.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.130 align:middle line:90%
That's all we did.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:51.630 align:middle line:84%
So physics was pretty
much playing itself out.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.390 align:middle line:84%
The reductionist philosophy
had been fantastic.

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:57.510 align:middle line:84%
We had a mechanistic
view of the world,

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.330 align:middle line:84%
but we had so many quarks we
didn't know what to do with it.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:03.190 align:middle line:84%
We're up to 36 quarks
now, by the way.

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Then we had this explosion
taking place in the last 10

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:09.050 align:middle line:90%
years or so.

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:11.080 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, the
Hubble Space Telescope

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:14.550 align:middle line:84%
has given us gorgeous
photographs of 39 black holes

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:16.020 align:middle line:90%
in outer space.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.810 align:middle line:84%
We can now begin to
ask the questions

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:21.830 align:middle line:84%
that Einstein could only dream
up back in the '40s and '50s.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Is there an
Einstein-Rosen Bridge?

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Is there a spinning ring at
the center of a black hole?

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:30.700 align:middle line:84%
What lies on the other
side of a black hole

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:34.800 align:middle line:84%
if your rocket ship is
not torn apart as you

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.900 align:middle line:90%
pass through the event horizon?

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.820 align:middle line:84%
All these questions were
pretty much academic

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:40.890 align:middle line:90%
at the time of Einstein.

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:41.990 align:middle line:90%
Now we see it.

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:43.470 align:middle line:90%
We see these things out there.

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.220 align:middle line:90%
It's a fantastic era.

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Just last week, like
I said, front page

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.190 align:middle line:84%
of "The New York
Times," new confirmation

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:54.070 align:middle line:84%
of dark energy, which Nikola
Tesla could only dream about.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And now we find that dark energy
is one of the main driving

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:59.400 align:middle line:84%
force behind the
entire universe,

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.490 align:middle line:90%
driving the galaxies apart.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And then in physics,
in particle physics,

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:06.810 align:middle line:90%
we now have string theory.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And it gives me
great gratification

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:10.630 align:middle line:84%
knowing that when I
write down equations

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:13.340 align:middle line:84%
on my sector of the
galaxy, that perhaps

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:16.830 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
of the galaxy, there

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:19.210 align:middle line:84%
is a gentleman,
or a gentlewoman,

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:24.720 align:middle line:84%
or a gentlething
that is writing down

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:28.580 align:middle line:84%
the same equations with
a different notation.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a thrill.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:33.260 align:middle line:84%
I have friends of mine that
write essays on Shakespeare.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And I have tremendous
reverence for Shakespeare,

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:37.740 align:middle line:84%
but if you don't
understand English,

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.500 align:middle line:84%
Shakespeare is
not that relevant.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.100 align:middle line:84%
But we're now talking about
the fundamental nature

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.200 align:middle line:90%
of reality itself.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And this theory is
not reductionist.

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:50.090 align:middle line:84%
This is a holistic
theory, because we now go

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:53.480 align:middle line:90%
from the quarks to hyper space.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Einstein, in the last
three decades of his life,

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:59.940 align:middle line:84%
we don't like to admit this,
but people laughed at him.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.610 align:middle line:90%
People said that he was senile.

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:03.660 align:middle line:90%
He was over the hill.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.490 align:middle line:84%
That he was trying
to be God, he was

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:09.200 align:middle line:84%
trying to unite all the physical
forces into one equation.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And all we see today are broken
symmetries, broken worlds.

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:15.370 align:middle line:84%
We don't see the
symmetry of the Big Bang.

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And Wolfgang Pauli,
winner of the Nobel Prize

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:22.240 align:middle line:84%
himself, once said, quote,
what God has torn asunder

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:26.090 align:middle line:90%
let no man put together.

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.320 align:middle line:84%
But that's what Einstein
was trying to do

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:30.910 align:middle line:90%
in his unfinished manuscript.

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And today, we think
we're so close, so

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:36.190 align:middle line:84%
close to having such
a unified framework.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And it has very little to do
with the reductionism that

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:43.550 align:middle line:84%
allowed us to go from quarks
into the 10th dimension.

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it's a
great time to be alive.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:49.180 align:middle line:84%
However, it's also
the worst of times.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Because we physicists also
stare into outer space.

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And we dream of the
energy consumption

00:20:55.850 --> 00:21:00.440 align:middle line:84%
of civilizations perhaps a
million years ahead of ours.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:04.330 align:middle line:84%
We are on the threshold of
attaining type one status.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Freeman Dyson at
Princeton estimates

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:10.990 align:middle line:84%
that we are 100, maybe 200 years
away from attaining type one

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:14.860 align:middle line:84%
status, but we are in the
most dangerous transition

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.980 align:middle line:90%
period of all time.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.990 align:middle line:84%
The generation now alive
walking the face of the Earth

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:22.870 align:middle line:84%
is the most important
generation that

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:25.780 align:middle line:84%
has ever walked the
face of the Earth

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:29.665 align:middle line:84%
since modern humans emerged from
Africa about 100,000 years ago,

00:21:29.665 --> 00:21:31.470 align:middle line:84%
or since we separated
from the apes

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:33.310 align:middle line:90%
about five million years ago.

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:38.610 align:middle line:84%
This generation now
alive has the power

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:41.460 align:middle line:84%
to either obliterate
the planet or to create

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:45.780 align:middle line:84%
planetary global warming, in
which case all life on Earth

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.440 align:middle line:90%
could be destroyed.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.080 align:middle line:84%
65 million years ago,
a comet or meteor

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:54.390 align:middle line:84%
hit the Yucatan of Mexico,
wiping out the dinosaurs.

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:58.890 align:middle line:84%
A new comet has hit the
Earth, a new comet just

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:00.960 align:middle line:84%
as dangerous as the
one that wiped out

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.800 align:middle line:84%
the dinosaurs and about
60, 70% of all life

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.370 align:middle line:90%
forms 65 million years ago.

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:10.820 align:middle line:84%
That new comet is
called Homo Sapien,

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:14.980 align:middle line:84%
and we are creating enormous
destruction in our path.

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:19.540 align:middle line:84%
We are a new comet that has hit
the planet Earth, destroying

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:23.570 align:middle line:84%
life forms probably at the rate
at which the comet destroyed

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:27.310 align:middle line:84%
life forms perhaps
65 million years ago.

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:30.120 align:middle line:84%
However, there is
some hope in all this.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.060 align:middle line:84%
People ask what is our
place in the universe?

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.250 align:middle line:90%
Where do we fit into things?

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, when you look at
night and you see the stars,

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.860 align:middle line:84%
you realize the
stars are perhaps

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:42.290 align:middle line:90%
10 to 100 light years away.

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And then you see the
Milky Way Galaxy.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:47.000 align:middle line:84%
You see light coming
from perhaps 50,000

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.390 align:middle line:90%
light years away.

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:51.010 align:middle line:84%
There's a black hole out
there, a black hole that

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:53.150 align:middle line:90%
blazes in Sagittarius.

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:56.740 align:middle line:84%
It is the center all
of the galaxy itself,

00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:01.510 align:middle line:84%
a huge black hole weighing
the mass of two million suns.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's very easy
to feel small.

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:06.810 align:middle line:84%
It's very easy to
feel irrelevant.

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:08.860 align:middle line:84%
It's very easy to
feel as if you're

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.320 align:middle line:90%
some kind of cosmic mistake.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't feel
that way at all.

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:15.670 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I know that
the elements of my body

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:17.850 align:middle line:84%
were forged in the
heat of a supernova.

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:20.720 align:middle line:84%
We are literally
made out of stardust.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.601 align:middle line:84%
We are made out of
the stuff of stars.

00:23:23.601 --> 00:23:25.600 align:middle line:84%
We have a right to be
here, just like the trees.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.130 align:middle line:84%
We are part of the
fabric of existence.

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And realize that
consciousness is perhaps

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:34.140 align:middle line:84%
one of most precious of all
things produced in nature.

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Believe it or not, what
rests on your shoulder,

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.920 align:middle line:84%
what sits on your shoulder
is the most complex object

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.900 align:middle line:84%
that nature has created
out to four light years

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.390 align:middle line:90%
from the planet Earth.

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:48.440 align:middle line:84%
I repeat, you have to
go to Alpha Centauri,

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.830 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps even beyond to
our quadrant of the galaxy

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:54.200 align:middle line:84%
to find an object
more complex than what

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.710 align:middle line:90%
sits on your shoulder.

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And the question that
we physicists ask

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:01.660 align:middle line:90%
is, was it ordained?

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:03.360 align:middle line:90%
Was it foretold?

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Was it written that it
should come out this way?

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:08.010 align:middle line:84%
There's another
problem in physics

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:09.360 align:middle line:90%
that we don't understand.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.320 align:middle line:84%
It is called the
anthropic principle.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.580 align:middle line:84%
It has been the subject of
many rip roaring debates

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.670 align:middle line:90%
between Nobel laureates.

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Did the universe
know we were coming?

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:23.480 align:middle line:90%


00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.960 align:middle line:90%
Some say yes.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Nobel laureate Steve
Weinberg writes at length

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:29.390 align:middle line:90%
about the anthropic problem.

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:32.315 align:middle line:84%
You see, in order to
have life on Earth,

00:24:32.315 --> 00:24:35.240 align:middle line:84%
in order to have
consciousness, you

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.870 align:middle line:84%
have to have an enormous
series of accidents

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:41.780 align:middle line:84%
at the fundamental
realm of nature.

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:45.060 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
nuclei that are stable,

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.460 align:middle line:84%
nuclei that condense
after the Big Bang.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.990 align:middle line:84%
You have protons that are
stable for at least three

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:52.710 align:middle line:84%
billion years to get
DNA off the ground.

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:55.110 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a chemistry
based on carbon with four

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:58.390 align:middle line:84%
bonds sufficient enough to get
the amino acids, and proteins,

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:00.410 align:middle line:84%
and nucleic acids
off the ground.

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:03.930 align:middle line:84%
It goes on, and on,
and on-- the charge

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:07.300 align:middle line:84%
of the electron, the mass
of the proton, the lifetime.

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:11.040 align:middle line:84%
You write down all the
accidents that take place,

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.560 align:middle line:84%
and then you realize
that all of them

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:18.710 align:middle line:84%
had to have taken place in
order to create consciousness.

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:21.250 align:middle line:90%
This is fantastic.

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:22.500 align:middle line:90%
This is incredible.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that so many
constants of nature

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:28.767 align:middle line:84%
are so fine tuned to within
a fraction of a percent

00:25:28.767 --> 00:25:30.600 align:middle line:84%
that if you change the
mass of the electron,

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.020 align:middle line:84%
change a charge of the
proton, all hell breaks

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.750 align:middle line:84%
loose and physical
reality dissolves?

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness cannot exist
unless we have an enormous

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.310 align:middle line:84%
series of miracles
that take place.

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:45.680 align:middle line:84%
This is the anthropic
problem, and we physicists

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.230 align:middle line:90%
have no answer for it.

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:51.840 align:middle line:84%
Some people say it approves
the existence of God.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.190 align:middle line:84%
Other people say there are
parallel universes out there,

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:58.810 align:middle line:84%
dead universes, universes
where the proton did decay,

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:00.862 align:middle line:90%
where DNA is not stable.

00:26:00.862 --> 00:26:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And then we have to ask
ourselves the question,

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.270 align:middle line:90%
is our universe special?

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:07.910 align:middle line:84%
It's been stable for at
least 15 billion years,

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:10.900 align:middle line:84%
sufficient for DNA to
get off the ground,

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:12.580 align:middle line:84%
sufficient for neural
networks to create

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:14.860 align:middle line:84%
what we call consciousness
to get off the ground.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:16.290 align:middle line:90%
Was it all an accident?

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:18.860 align:middle line:84%
If it was, it's a
fantastic accident

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:23.310 align:middle line:84%
for which we physicists
have no answer whatsoever.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:26.675 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you want
to start doing physics,

00:26:26.675 --> 00:26:29.110 align:middle line:84%
and you want to start with
evidence that gives you

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:32.240 align:middle line:84%
a wealth of scientific
information,

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:37.620 align:middle line:84%
your first statement would
be consciousness exists.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:43.240 align:middle line:84%
That statement alone has an
incredible, fantastic number

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.480 align:middle line:90%
of consequences.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.960 align:middle line:84%
You have to assume the nature
of subatomic particles,

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.720 align:middle line:84%
the nature of atoms, the
nature of carbon bonds,

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.600 align:middle line:84%
the nature of auto-catalytic
molecules-- all of that

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:57.320 align:middle line:84%
to get 10 pounds of tissue
that sits on your shoulders

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.340 align:middle line:90%
off the ground.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:02.380 align:middle line:84%
The meaning of life, is
there an equation up there,

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:05.130 align:middle line:84%
an equation like e
equals mc squared,

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:08.080 align:middle line:84%
which will change the
nature of reality itself?

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, I
like to think of myself

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:13.920 align:middle line:84%
as an alien who came to
Earth to watch a chess game.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.530 align:middle line:84%
If you see two people playing
stress-- and you're alien.

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:19.400 align:middle line:84%
You're he'd never seen it happen
before-- you can gradually

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.380 align:middle line:84%
figure out the rules,
but does that mean

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:24.850 align:middle line:90%
you're a grandmaster in chess?

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:26.200 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.200 align:middle line:90%
We will figure out the rules.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.666 align:middle line:84%
We're so close at
the press time.

00:27:30.666 --> 00:27:33.620 align:middle line:90%
It could happen any day now.

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:37.590 align:middle line:84%
We're so close to figuring
out the rules of the game.

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:40.680 align:middle line:84%
But does that mean
we are grandmasters?

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.250 align:middle line:90%
The answer is no.

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:46.590 align:middle line:84%
This is just the beginning--
the beginning, not the end.

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And second of all, what
about the meaning of life?

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Is there an equation out
there that'll suddenly

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:56.840 align:middle line:84%
answer all our cosmic questions
about love, and hatred,

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.300 align:middle line:90%
and why we're here?

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, that may be
asking too much.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:08.400 align:middle line:84%
I think we have to find
our own meaning in life.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.890 align:middle line:90%
It's too easy.

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:13.060 align:middle line:84%
It's too easy if just
this one equation

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.930 align:middle line:84%
is going to explain
all physical reality,

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:19.690 align:middle line:84%
give us joy, fill our lives
with singing and rapture.

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:21.270 align:middle line:90%
It's too easy.

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:23.610 align:middle line:84%
We have to find our
own meaning in life.

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:27.340 align:middle line:84%
For me, meaning of
life means at least

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:29.800 align:middle line:84%
to fulfill whatever
talents you were

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:34.610 align:middle line:84%
born with-- a knack for music,
a knack for mathematics,

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:37.250 align:middle line:84%
a knack for dance-- whatever
we were blessed with,

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:40.020 align:middle line:84%
to develop that to the
best of our ability.

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And second, to make the
world a better place

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:45.170 align:middle line:90%
than when we first entered.

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:49.100 align:middle line:84%
That's one reason why I like
to get on radio and television

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.490 align:middle line:90%
and talk to people.

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Because when I was a kid,
it was so frustrating

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.540 align:middle line:84%
going to the library,
asking the librarian

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:58.300 align:middle line:84%
about the unified field
theory in the fourth dimension

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:03.980 align:middle line:84%
and getting this blank
stare, this look.

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:08.480 align:middle line:84%
I've seen that look so
many times in my life now.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'm
trying to tell you is,

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.920 align:middle line:84%
we should leave the
world a better place

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.820 align:middle line:90%
than where we started.

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And on one last note,
let me say that there

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:19.870 align:middle line:84%
are other physicists who
don't think the same way I do.

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:22.860 align:middle line:90%


00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:25.600 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned in
my talk, my mentor,

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:29.470 align:middle line:84%
the person who created
me was Edward Teller.

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:32.830 align:middle line:84%
He's the father of the hydrogen
bomb and father of the Star

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:34.780 align:middle line:90%
Wars program.

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:38.970 align:middle line:84%
He wanted me to go to Los Alamos
and develop third generation

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:41.340 align:middle line:90%
hydrogen warheads.

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:45.540 align:middle line:10%
He wanted me to help develop
the Star Wars program.

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:48.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I did instead was
I went on a slightly different

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:51.000 align:middle line:90%
career path.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And some friends of mine
decided to organize a Star Wars

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:56.160 align:middle line:90%
boycott.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.320 align:middle line:84%
We decided to send
out a petition

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:01.820 align:middle line:84%
among scientists, nuclear
physicists like ourselves,

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:05.750 align:middle line:84%
stating that we will never
accept one dime for Star Wars

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:09.449 align:middle line:84%
research, saying that we will
never accept a single dime.

00:30:09.449 --> 00:30:17.350 align:middle line:90%


00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:19.720 align:middle line:84%
The way to attain
type one status

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.610 align:middle line:84%
is not to be the biggest
gun on the block.

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:25.380 align:middle line:84%
That's not where
the world is headed.

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:29.085 align:middle line:84%
However, James Ionson, who was
head of university research

00:30:29.085 --> 00:30:29.900 align:middle line:90%
for Star Wars.

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:31.430 align:middle line:90%
Wars, stung by our boycott.

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:36.250 align:middle line:84%
We got 8,000 nuclear
scientists to sign our pledge.

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:40.940 align:middle line:84%
We had an absolute majority of
the top 20 schools in physics.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:45.860 align:middle line:84%
We got 19 Nobel laureates
to sign our pledge.

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.247 align:middle line:90%
Well, James Ionson was--

00:30:47.247 --> 00:30:49.732 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:49.732 --> 00:30:53.220 align:middle line:90%


00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, Mr. Ionson, head
of university research,

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:58.460 align:middle line:84%
was stung by our boycott
pledge, and he got on television

00:30:58.460 --> 00:30:59.750 align:middle line:90%
to refute it.

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yes,
these physicists

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:06.090 align:middle line:84%
have the top people
signed up on this boycott.

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:10.820 align:middle line:84%
But-- but two second
rate nuclear physicists

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:16.540 align:middle line:84%
are worth just as much as one
top rate nuclear physicist.

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, now you know why the
Star Wars program doesn't work.

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:23.181 align:middle line:84%
It's being built by second
rate nuclear physicists.

00:31:23.181 --> 00:31:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>>You mean it would work
if they were first rate

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:25.971 align:middle line:90%
nuclear physicists?

00:31:25.971 --> 00:31:26.780 align:middle line:90%
>>Maybe.

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And our next goal is to
sign up the second rate

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:32.040 align:middle line:90%
nuclear physicists as well.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.093 align:middle line:90%
That's our next goal.

00:31:33.093 --> 00:31:33.926 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:31:33.926 --> 00:31:36.406 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:36.406 --> 00:31:42.370 align:middle line:90%


00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:45.210 align:middle line:10%
>>John and Michio have
spoken very movingly

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:50.950 align:middle line:10%
about their concern about the
world today, the world right

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:53.790 align:middle line:10%
here that we're living in.

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And Stan has spoken about
his own personal journey.

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And since I managed
this afternoon

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.470 align:middle line:84%
to go through 30,000 years,
actually more than that,

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:08.390 align:middle line:84%
of history with you
in about 35 minutes,

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:10.800 align:middle line:84%
I think in 10 minutes
I'm going to go through

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.750 align:middle line:90%
with you a combination of both.

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:15.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk to
you just very briefly

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:18.190 align:middle line:84%
about my own spiritual
journey, but I'm

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:23.040 align:middle line:84%
going to start with
this issue that we're

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:26.830 align:middle line:84%
addressing here, which is
the issue of techniques

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:28.620 align:middle line:90%
for discovery.

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're all born
with one such technique,

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:35.400 align:middle line:90%
and it's our intuition.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:40.340 align:middle line:84%
It's that intuition that
we all come equipped with.

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And those of us who have had
the joy and the opportunity

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:54.740 align:middle line:84%
to really go deeply and to try
to access our own inner wisdom,

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:58.120 align:middle line:84%
very, very often, we've come
to the same conclusions,

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:03.890 align:middle line:84%
that we're interconnected,
that that striving for oneness

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:07.010 align:middle line:84%
that we all have, for
connection with one another,

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:10.260 align:middle line:84%
with those that we love,
as well as with that which

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:13.190 align:middle line:84%
we call the divine,
that this is really

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:16.750 align:middle line:90%
intrinsic to our humanity.

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And that our destiny,
to use a term

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:24.520 align:middle line:84%
that you've used here in
your brochures, on this Earth

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:28.760 align:middle line:90%
is not to destroy but to create.

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Because we're equipped with this
incredible, incredible capacity

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:37.510 align:middle line:84%
as human beings to create and
with this incredible capacity

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:38.570 align:middle line:90%
to love.

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And by love, I really
mean the giving

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:47.610 align:middle line:84%
of love, the nurturing capacity,
the caregiving capacity

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:50.750 align:middle line:84%
for which, by the
grace of evolution,

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:57.680 align:middle line:84%
we humans receive biochemical
rewards of immense pleasure.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Our brains are so
wired that we get

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:08.480 align:middle line:84%
these biochemical rewards that
we feel euphoric, don't we?

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Somebody with a
little baby, if you've

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:17.100 align:middle line:84%
ever really held a little
baby or nursed a little baby,

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:21.460 align:middle line:84%
you know the euphoria of
that caring connection.

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
exclusive to mothers.

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:26.570 align:middle line:84%
I see so many of
the fathers today

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:29.860 align:middle line:84%
who are breaking through
the psychic armoring,

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:31.870 align:middle line:84%
this terrible psychic
armoring that's

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:35.330 align:middle line:84%
imposed on men through what
I've identified as a dominator

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:39.080 align:middle line:84%
model, and the joy
that they experience.

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And of course we
experience it with a lover.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.920 align:middle line:90%
We experience it with a friend.

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Even when we take care of a dog
or a cat that we care about.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.710 align:middle line:90%
So we're equipped with this.

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:55.350 align:middle line:84%
So my questions then
has been, for me,

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:59.680 align:middle line:84%
why, if we are equipped
with this, if intuitively we

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:04.730 align:middle line:84%
have through the eons
wanted-- I mean what do we

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:06.000 align:middle line:90%
human beings really want?

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.900 align:middle line:90%
They want to live in peace.

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:09.600 align:middle line:90%
They want love.

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.950 align:middle line:90%
They want security.

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:14.030 align:middle line:90%
They want pleasure.

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And if we're equipped with these
tremendous capacities for all

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:18.800 align:middle line:90%
of this?

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:21.770 align:middle line:90%
What is the problem?

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And of course that led
to me from an inquiry

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:30.569 align:middle line:90%
into biological matters.

00:35:30.569 --> 00:35:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And I should say
something very interesting

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:35.360 align:middle line:84%
to you, because some of the
most interesting work that

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:41.130 align:middle line:84%
has come out from biology about
this striving for connection

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:46.660 align:middle line:84%
has come from women--
Lynn Margulis, Mae-Wan Ho.

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's not that
women are better about things,

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:54.260 align:middle line:84%
but women are brought up
in a dominator culture

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:58.350 align:middle line:84%
to be interested in
connection, in relationships,

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:00.350 align:middle line:84%
whereas men in that
kind of culture

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:04.590 align:middle line:84%
are much more brought
up for achievement.

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:05.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do this.

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's not, by the way,
at all gender specific.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Because my dear friend Humberto
Maturana, who is a man,

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:20.450 align:middle line:84%
writes movingly and beautifully
about the biology of love.

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:22.930 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that's built into us,

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:26.740 align:middle line:84%
but it takes some escaping
from the gender programming

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:28.350 align:middle line:90%
to really recognize this.

00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:28.850 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:31.890 align:middle line:84%
So my work then--
and my work came out

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:37.360 align:middle line:84%
of some very personal,
emotional, and spiritual events

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.105 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:36:38.105 --> 00:36:40.750 align:middle line:90%


00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the most profound
spiritual crisis for me

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:48.210 align:middle line:90%
came after the Second World War.

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:52.480 align:middle line:84%
I was a little kid, and
every night my father and I

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.510 align:middle line:90%
used to pray the Shemah Yisrael.

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And then after that-- and
it was a wonderful ritual

00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:59.990 align:middle line:90%
of bonding between us.

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And after that,
as children will,

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:06.290 align:middle line:84%
very carefully, I prayed
for every single member

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:09.610 align:middle line:84%
of our family that
had been left behind

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:12.490 align:middle line:90%
in Nazi Europe-- everyone.

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:14.560 align:middle line:90%
I was terrified to forget one.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.900 align:middle line:10%
You know how kids
are about that.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:22.580 align:middle line:10%
And then I saw the newsreels
of the concentration camps.

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And I-- well, it was
extremely painful,

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.870 align:middle line:90%
because God died for me.

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:33.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was very
painful for me.

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Because it was like, OK.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:38.520 align:middle line:90%
Is God crazy or just evil?

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:40.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, those seemed to me
to be the only alternatives.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Because if this creature
who is all powerful,

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:48.070 align:middle line:84%
that I had been taught, all
knowing, could let this happen,

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:51.340 align:middle line:84%
then something was very
wrong with the perspective

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:55.620 align:middle line:84%
that I had been given about
what the heck reality is about.

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And I went through a long and
very painful spiritual journey.

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was really,
in many ways--

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:04.890 align:middle line:84%
and this takes me right back
to my research-- inextricably

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:08.260 align:middle line:84%
connected with another
technique for discovery.

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Because every scientist knows
that science and intuition

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.710 align:middle line:90%
are not separate.

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:18.730 align:middle line:84%
A scientist has an intuition,
and then the scientist

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:20.740 align:middle line:84%
sets out there to
figure out, hey,

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:24.610 align:middle line:84%
is there any empirical
evidence for this intuition?

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:29.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do I have something that
can either verify it or forget

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:30.780 align:middle line:90%
it?

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:35.170 align:middle line:84%
So my intuition that there had
to be alternatives to this,

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:38.390 align:middle line:84%
but that it wasn't going to
come from God, that it would

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:42.270 align:middle line:90%
come from right here, from us.

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:43.430 align:middle line:90%
Right here.

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:47.430 align:middle line:84%
To shift then from
biological issues-- I mean,

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:48.680 align:middle line:90%
we're prewired.

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:49.440 align:middle line:90%
We're prewired.

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:53.830 align:middle line:10%
We can be very, obviously,
very cruel world,

00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:55.710 align:middle line:10%
but we can be so kind.

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:59.720 align:middle line:10%
And it is not true, as some
of these new evolutionary

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:01.770 align:middle line:10%
psychologists and
social biologists

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:06.260 align:middle line:10%
would have it, that love and
altruism are purely based

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:08.590 align:middle line:10%
on wanting to pass on our genes.

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Because I know of people
in Nazi Europe who

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.380 align:middle line:84%
risked-- because the
Nazis were very clear.

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:16.490 align:middle line:84%
They said you're going
to die if you help a Jew

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:19.010 align:middle line:90%
and so is your entire family.

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:21.550 align:middle line:84%
So there goes your
gene pool, right?

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:23.000 align:middle line:90%
And they did it.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And when you ask them
afterwards why did you do it?

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.930 align:middle line:90%
They said, well, I just had to.

00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:29.500 align:middle line:90%
It was in me.

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:32.550 align:middle line:84%
So I know that we all
have this capacity.

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:34.990 align:middle line:84%
So the question then
is-- and that led me

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:37.420 align:middle line:84%
to the study of
cultural evolution,

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:39.760 align:middle line:84%
and I shared with
you earlier some

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.830 align:middle line:84%
of my technique for
discovery, which was really

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:45.850 align:middle line:84%
looking at a much larger
database that includes

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:48.310 align:middle line:84%
the whole of history,
including prehistory,

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:50.320 align:middle line:84%
that includes the
whole of humanity,

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.050 align:middle line:84%
both its female and
male halves, and that

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:56.830 align:middle line:84%
also includes the spheres
of life where we all live,

00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:58.890 align:middle line:84%
not just politics,
economics, you know,

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:03.330 align:middle line:84%
the abstract things that
are up there somewhere.

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:06.750 align:middle line:84%
But how do we relate
as human beings

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:09.670 align:middle line:84%
in our intimate relations, in
our parent-child relations,

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:11.120 align:middle line:90%
in our gender relations?

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:13.500 align:middle line:10%
And I saw these patterns then.

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:18.270 align:middle line:10%
And what I can tell you
is that analytic lens

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:22.400 align:middle line:10%
that came out of my research
of what I call the partnership

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:26.770 align:middle line:10%
dominator continuum has been
an invaluable tool for me

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:31.940 align:middle line:10%
for my own spiritual
and emotional healing.

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And I can only
tell you that being

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:39.970 align:middle line:84%
able to see that we have these
possibilities, that there

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:44.890 align:middle line:84%
is a wider lens, that we can
look at, and that, really,

00:40:44.890 --> 00:40:48.250 align:middle line:84%
gene expression-- I don't
know how many of you

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:51.900 align:middle line:84%
are familiar with that
term, but we haven't really

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:56.660 align:middle line:84%
changed our genes that we know
of for a goodly period of time,

00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:57.660 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:59.860 align:middle line:84%
So the issue here
is not biological.

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:02.580 align:middle line:84%
The issue is what of
our genetic repertoire,

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:08.400 align:middle line:84%
from caring to cruelty, is going
to be expressed or inhibited?

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And so the issue for
us-- and I just really

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:13.510 align:middle line:84%
feel so passionately
about this--

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:16.800 align:middle line:84%
is to create the
conditions beginning

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.830 align:middle line:90%
with partnership child care.

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Because dominator
child care replicates

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:27.550 align:middle line:84%
this misery, this misery from
generation to generation.

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:30.490 align:middle line:90%
Secondly, gender relations.

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:35.600 align:middle line:84%
How can we possibly talk
about valuing diversity

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:39.700 align:middle line:84%
if, for example, we have a
school curriculum, still,

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:43.330 align:middle line:84%
at this day and age, where
the female half of the species

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:46.800 align:middle line:90%
is practically invisible?

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.340 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't make sense.

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Because when you make the
female half invisible,

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.630 align:middle line:90%
guess what you also do?

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:56.260 align:middle line:84%
You not only do
value women, but you

00:41:56.260 --> 00:42:00.130 align:middle line:84%
devalue those traits
and characteristics

00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:04.790 align:middle line:84%
that are stereotypically in the
dominator mindset associated

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:06.990 align:middle line:90%
with women and femininity.

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:08.920 align:middle line:90%
And what are those qualities?

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:13.940 align:middle line:84%
You've got it-- caring,
non-violence, empathy,

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:14.900 align:middle line:90%
caregiving.

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:19.200 align:middle line:84%
So if we really want
to see gene expression

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.060 align:middle line:84%
of this incredible
capacity-- and I want

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:23.650 align:middle line:90%
to see it as a grandmother.

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:26.390 align:middle line:84%
I look at my little
grandchildren.

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:30.990 align:middle line:84%
They are born with this
joy, with this thirst

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:33.820 align:middle line:90%
for learning, for love.

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:36.240 align:middle line:90%
And they can give it to you.

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:38.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they just
give so much love.

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:41.550 align:middle line:84%
It's so natural if they get if
they get partnership parenting

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:45.320 align:middle line:84%
and partnership care, if we
don't take it away from them,

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:48.420 align:middle line:90%
if we don't make them adapt.

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Because learning can be our
downfall too as a species.

00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:56.000 align:middle line:84%
If we don't make them
learn dominator behaviors

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.330 align:middle line:84%
by the way that we treat
them and by the stories

00:42:58.330 --> 00:42:59.970 align:middle line:90%
that we tell them.

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's so much
more I could say to you,

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:05.900 align:middle line:84%
but I do want to
say that, for me,

00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:08.400 align:middle line:84%
if we're talking about
techniques of discovery,

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:09.780 align:middle line:90%
we've got them.

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:11.620 align:middle line:90%
We've got our intuition.

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:13.280 align:middle line:90%
We've got our brain.

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And we've got the
capacity to get

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:18.970 align:middle line:84%
rid of a lot of the
blinkers that we've

00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:22.520 align:middle line:84%
been brought up with with
which to look at reality.

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And really that's what this is
all about, isn't it right now?

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:32.150 align:middle line:84%
It's opening up the lens wider,
opening up our human capacity

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:35.680 align:middle line:84%
wider, and beginning
to sort out-- because I

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:38.090 align:middle line:90%
want to end with this.

00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:43.230 align:middle line:10%
I believe that we can talk
about healing ourselves

00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:46.740 align:middle line:10%
from here to eternity,
but if we only

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:51.630 align:middle line:10%
focus on healing ourselves,
and the context of the society

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:54.280 align:middle line:10%
continues to be a
dominator context,

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:59.510 align:middle line:10%
it is literally like going
up on a down escalator.

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:04.950 align:middle line:84%
You simply spend all your
time just trying, trying, to

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:07.240 align:middle line:90%
not really sink.

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And you can't break
free from this.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:14.210 align:middle line:84%
But only if we change the
institutions-- family,

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:19.310 align:middle line:84%
education-- and then politics
and economics actually follow.

00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Because if we give value
to caring and caregiving

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.970 align:middle line:84%
in our schools, we're
not going to have such

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:28.820 align:middle line:90%
an uncaring economic system.

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:33.080 align:middle line:84%
If we get rid of myths that
one kind of person, a woman,

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:36.890 align:middle line:84%
is put on Earth just to
serve another kind, which

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:40.610 align:middle line:84%
is a terrible model for
inequitable economics,

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:43.750 align:middle line:84%
If we get rid of
that, well, we can

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:45.950 align:middle line:84%
realize all this
tremendous yearning

00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:48.460 align:middle line:84%
for oneness, the
tremendous capacity

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:53.152 align:middle line:84%
that we have for caring,
for creativity, for love.

00:44:53.152 --> 00:44:55.632 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:55.632 --> 00:45:01.090 align:middle line:90%


00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>>My path has been
from the hard sciences.

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:05.030 align:middle line:10%
My degree's in the
earth sciences.

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:07.250 align:middle line:10%
I'm a geologist by
trade, although I

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:11.850 align:middle line:10%
haven't been a geologist,
technically, for quite a while.

00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I moved into the
aerospace sciences, and then

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:17.135 align:middle line:84%
the communications sciences,
with a little startup company

00:45:17.135 --> 00:45:18.260 align:middle line:90%
out of Stanford University.

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:22.320 align:middle line:84%
It became Cisco Systems
in the early '90s.

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm hearing on the
panel here this evening,

00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:30.130 align:middle line:84%
I think, is a beautiful example
of what happened in my life

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:30.630 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:35.200 align:middle line:84%
When I was working in the Earth
sciences back in the mid 1970s,

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:37.430 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing data
come across my desk,

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:41.857 align:middle line:84%
real time, saying to me that the
Earth is changing very rapidly,

00:45:41.857 --> 00:45:43.440 align:middle line:84%
that the magnetic
fields of the Earth,

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:47.280 align:middle line:84%
for example, are declining
very, very quickly right now,

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.870 align:middle line:84%
and that base resonant
frequencies were increasing.

00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'd see this on
the computer every day,

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:55.950 align:middle line:84%
and I'd go to the people in the
offices next to me and I'd say,

00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:57.280 align:middle line:90%
Earth magnetics are changing.

00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:59.020 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean to us?

00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And they would
almost predictably,

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:05.730 align:middle line:84%
what I would get was, they
would say don't ask me.

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:06.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm an Earth scientist.

00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Go ask somebody that
knows about life science.

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:12.270 align:middle line:84%
So I would ask my
life science friends

00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:14.990 align:middle line:84%
what it means to a human
body or to human cells when

00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:18.670 align:middle line:84%
the planetary magnetics decline
as rapidly as they are right

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:19.174 align:middle line:90%
now?

00:46:19.174 --> 00:46:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And they'd say, we were
never trained in that.

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:22.580 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:24.047 align:middle line:90%
Go ask someone else.

00:46:24.047 --> 00:46:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's an example
of what we're seeing here.

00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Because what we're
speaking about tonight,

00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:32.100 align:middle line:84%
to find the kinds of answers
that we're asking ourselves,

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:35.360 align:middle line:84%
we have to move to an
interdisciplinary science.

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:38.960 align:middle line:84%
We've got to move out the boxes
that we placed ourselves into.

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:40.850 align:middle line:90%
And of course, that's happening.

00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:43.260 align:middle line:84%
It's happening very
quickly right now.

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:47.120 align:middle line:84%
So as we're moving toward
these kinds of questions,

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:52.360 align:middle line:84%
and as Michio so beautifully
and eloquently summarized,

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:56.420 align:middle line:84%
this generation, we take for
granted so often the power

00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:59.420 align:middle line:90%
that we have in this generation.

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:01.920 align:middle line:84%
The end of 1999, just
before the millennium,

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:06.650 align:middle line:84%
there was a group of some of
the leading minds in our world--

00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:09.970 align:middle line:84%
spiritual leaders, scientists,
researchers, philosophers,

00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:11.470 align:middle line:84%
medical people--
that came together.

00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:13.345 align:middle line:84%
And they were asked what
we could expect over

00:47:13.345 --> 00:47:16.330 align:middle line:84%
these next few years
of our new millennium.

00:47:16.330 --> 00:47:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And almost universally,
without having discussed

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:25.810 align:middle line:84%
this among themselves, these
researchers and the panel,

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:27.960 align:middle line:84%
the faculty, said
that they expected

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:31.340 align:middle line:84%
within the first 15 to 20
years of the new millennium,

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:34.700 align:middle line:84%
humankind would be faced with
the greatest challenges ever

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:39.920 align:middle line:84%
posed to our kind, and that
we have at our fingertips

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:42.560 align:middle line:84%
a technology now
unlike any technology

00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:43.935 align:middle line:84%
that we have in
recorded history.

00:47:43.935 --> 00:47:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to be very
careful about how I say that.

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:49.720 align:middle line:84%
As far as we know, we've never
had the kind of technology

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:50.800 align:middle line:90%
that we have right now.

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.930 align:middle line:84%
It's the technology
for the first time

00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:56.750 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to create a
permanent change in our world,

00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:59.310 align:middle line:84%
whether that change
is obliterating all

00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:02.650 align:middle line:84%
that we love and hold dear, or
whether that change is forever

00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:07.130 align:middle line:84%
healing and relieving the
suffering of the masses.

00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:10.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a choice that's being made
by this generation right now.

00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And many of the people we've
worked with in the past

00:48:14.650 --> 00:48:18.390 align:middle line:84%
have felt that science is to
blame for many of the problems

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:19.780 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:22.660 align:middle line:84%
What we know is that it is
technology that is actually

00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:28.570 align:middle line:84%
pushing us to the place
where we must define

00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:31.910 align:middle line:84%
the very parameters that allow
us to answer the questions

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:32.650 align:middle line:90%
we're asking.

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Technology is pushing
us to understand

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:39.100 align:middle line:84%
what the human soul is all
about and where it comes from,

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:43.030 align:middle line:84%
what consciousness means,
what our mind is all about.

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the technology
that's racing so quickly.

00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:48.800 align:middle line:84%
For example, when we
clone another human being,

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.915 align:middle line:90%
does that clone have a soul?

00:48:50.915 --> 00:48:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Or when we clone an organ,
does that organ have a soul?

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:57.610 align:middle line:84%
The epidemics of disease
that are expected

00:48:57.610 --> 00:48:59.290 align:middle line:84%
in the next 15 or
20 years, there

00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:03.400 align:middle line:84%
are predictions that as much of
2/3 of the world's population

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:06.460 align:middle line:84%
will be lost primarily
in third world countries

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:10.420 align:middle line:84%
due to diseases, some of them
we haven't even recognize yet.

00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And all of these things that
the science researchers were

00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:15.880 align:middle line:84%
saying, they expect
to see happen.

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:18.050 align:middle line:90%
The interesting thing.

00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:20.770 align:middle line:84%
As they were voicing their
concerns, was every one of them

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:24.150 align:middle line:84%
suggested that our
technology will fail us

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:25.960 align:middle line:84%
in the presence of
these great challenges.

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:28.190 align:middle line:84%
They said that the
technology we have now

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:32.390 align:middle line:84%
will not know what to
do with the conditions,

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:35.500 align:middle line:84%
with the challenges
that we're faced with.

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, in my years
as a geologist,

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:41.520 align:middle line:84%
I began going into the
oldest texts of humankind

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:43.065 align:middle line:84%
in search for another
kind of answer

00:49:43.065 --> 00:49:46.540 align:middle line:84%
that I believe we'll bring
to bear this weekend.

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And many people
believe, and I know

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:51.194 align:middle line:84%
you've heard from some
of the previous speakers,

00:49:51.194 --> 00:49:53.110 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes we see a
disparity between what

00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:55.180 align:middle line:84%
we call science and
spiritual traditions,

00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:56.840 align:middle line:90%
or science and religion.

00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:59.109 align:middle line:84%
How many of you in this
audience-- this is the quiz--

00:49:59.109 --> 00:50:01.150 align:middle line:84%
how many of you believe
that science and religion

00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:03.030 align:middle line:90%
are saying the same thing?

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:04.320 align:middle line:90%
How many of you believe that?

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:05.736 align:middle line:84%
Don't say that
just because you're

00:50:05.736 --> 00:50:07.260 align:middle line:90%
in the Prophets Conference.

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:09.360 align:middle line:90%
You really believe that?

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:14.380 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe so much so
that perhaps some of our most

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:16.270 align:middle line:84%
ancient traditions
may hold the keys

00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:18.700 align:middle line:84%
to some of our greatest
scientific and technical

00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:19.230 align:middle line:90%
discoveries?

00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:20.820 align:middle line:90%
Do you believe that?

00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:22.160 align:middle line:90%
That's my belief as well.

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So my path has been
to go into the most

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:28.070 align:middle line:90%
ancient records of our kind.

00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Because here's what I
believe has happened.

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:32.334 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere between 6
and 8,000 years ago,

00:50:32.334 --> 00:50:34.750 align:middle line:84%
the ancients are very clear
that the wisdom of the heavens

00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:36.620 align:middle line:84%
was given to the
people of this world.

00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:38.802 align:middle line:84%
That's what my talk
is about tomorrow.

00:50:38.802 --> 00:50:40.260 align:middle line:84%
The wisdom of the
heavens was given

00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:43.700 align:middle line:84%
to the people of the Earth
in a language of their time

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:46.010 align:middle line:90%
6,000 years ago.

00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:49.880 align:middle line:84%
That wisdom was passed
down in that same language.

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.880 align:middle line:84%
It's a language that
means less to us

00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:55.630 align:middle line:84%
today than it did 6,000 years
ago, although the wisdom is

00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:58.500 align:middle line:90%
more complete on the one hand.

00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:01.620 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
science, modern science

00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:04.710 align:middle line:84%
and the scientific method,
within the last 500 or 600

00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:08.980 align:middle line:84%
years has now begun to
rediscover principles

00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:11.810 align:middle line:84%
that were handed in
that original wisdom,

00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:14.390 align:middle line:84%
although they are
not continuous.

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:16.200 align:middle line:90%
They're little bits and pieces.

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And as we strive to unify the
scientific principles, what

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:23.490 align:middle line:84%
I believe we're seeing is
that if we have the wisdom

00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:25.730 align:middle line:84%
to recognize the
language, there's

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:28.680 align:middle line:84%
an ancient wisdom that's
giving us those principles.

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:31.470 align:middle line:90%
We can translate back and forth.

00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:34.340 align:middle line:84%
So what I'll say this
evening-- and this

00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:36.972 align:middle line:84%
is in response to
what you were saying.

00:51:36.972 --> 00:51:39.180 align:middle line:84%
It's no accident that we
had the conversation the way

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:43.880 align:middle line:84%
we had it-- is that those most
ancient traditions say that it

00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:47.470 align:middle line:84%
is within each of you,
within each of us,

00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:52.430 align:middle line:84%
that we have the power to unify
the four forces of creation,

00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:57.190 align:middle line:84%
that within each of us, we
touch the power of gravity,

00:51:57.190 --> 00:52:00.200 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetics, and the strong
and the weak nuclear forces.

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And the only way that we
can touch those forces

00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:06.620 align:middle line:84%
is to attain a level
of consciousness

00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:09.800 align:middle line:84%
that we call, by various
names-- love, compassion,

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:12.290 align:middle line:84%
understanding,
forgiveness, tolerance.

00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Those are the names that we give
to the feeling in our bodies

00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:18.160 align:middle line:84%
that creates the biological
and the physical effects

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:20.280 align:middle line:84%
that we're now
seeing mirrored back

00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:22.600 align:middle line:90%
to us in the world around us.

00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:25.600 align:middle line:84%
So some of those texts, some
of the most fascinating to me,

00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:28.350 align:middle line:84%
say we ask this question,
why are we here?

00:52:28.350 --> 00:52:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And of the many reasons we're
here, there appears to be--

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:34.980 align:middle line:84%
and this is from the ancient
Essenes, those who transcribed

00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:36.680 align:middle line:90%
the Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:39.800 align:middle line:84%
What they say to us is
that we came to this world

00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:42.810 align:middle line:84%
intentionally for one reason
above all other reasons.

00:52:42.810 --> 00:52:48.300 align:middle line:84%
We came here to love and to find
the love in this world greater

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:51.900 align:middle line:84%
than the love of the
angels of the heavens.

00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:54.140 align:middle line:84%
It's the language
that they're using.

00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And they go on to say that
every time-- and this may

00:52:56.890 --> 00:53:00.590 align:middle line:84%
help to explain, although
not justify, your question--

00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:03.760 align:middle line:84%
that every time
we push ourselves

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:09.232 align:middle line:84%
to the very edge of who we
believe we are in this world--

00:53:09.232 --> 00:53:11.190 align:middle line:84%
has anybody ever been
pushed to the edge of who

00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:12.627 align:middle line:90%
you believe you are?

00:53:12.627 --> 00:53:14.460 align:middle line:84%
See, now I always have
to ask the questions.

00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:18.030 align:middle line:90%
Anybody over the edge right now?

00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:21.070 align:middle line:84%
Is anybody too shy to tell us
you're over the edge right now?

00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:22.470 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:24.300 align:middle line:84%
They say that every
time we push ourselves

00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:27.050 align:middle line:84%
to the very edge of
who we believe we are,

00:53:27.050 --> 00:53:29.890 align:middle line:84%
that the only way
that we can survive

00:53:29.890 --> 00:53:34.280 align:middle line:84%
is through our power to love
as individuals and as masses.

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at our history,
and we look at the culture,

00:53:37.090 --> 00:53:40.080 align:middle line:84%
and what we've done unto
ourselves, what we know

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:42.640 align:middle line:84%
is we have a tremendous
capacity to love.

00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:47.180 align:middle line:84%
It may be that by understanding
the inner technology that

00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:48.950 align:middle line:84%
brought each of
us into this room

00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:52.360 align:middle line:84%
this evening, that
we then have the keys

00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:57.770 align:middle line:84%
for the outer technology that
science so strives to unify,

00:53:57.770 --> 00:54:00.780 align:middle line:84%
and that as we discover the
language is one and the same,

00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:05.100 align:middle line:84%
what we find is that our
capacity, our ability to love,

00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:06.850 align:middle line:84%
is the common theme
that runs through so

00:54:06.850 --> 00:54:08.250 align:middle line:84%
many of those
ancient traditions,

00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:09.820 align:middle line:84%
that, in fact,
they were giving us

00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:15.470 align:middle line:84%
the keys to changing our
biology, to changing our DNA.

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:17.440 align:middle line:90%
And now we know.

00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:19.180 align:middle line:84%
They said that the
world around us

00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:22.830 align:middle line:84%
is simply a mirror of what
we have become from within,

00:54:22.830 --> 00:54:25.210 align:middle line:84%
through the stuff that
the superstrings create,

00:54:25.210 --> 00:54:28.200 align:middle line:84%
through what we now call
the quantum hologram,

00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.650 align:middle line:90%
the mirror of creation.

00:54:29.650 --> 00:54:32.580 align:middle line:84%
Creation simply
shows back to us what

00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:33.860 align:middle line:90%
we have become from within.

00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:36.180 align:middle line:84%
If we have the wisdom
to recognize that,

00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:39.750 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we have honored
our kind, of our species,

00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:41.100 align:middle line:90%
our history.

00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that's where
we're going with this discussion

00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.530 align:middle line:90%
tonight.

00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's where
we're going with our lives

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:47.577 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:54:47.577 --> 00:54:49.410 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for the
opportunity to share this.

00:54:49.410 --> 00:54:50.110 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:50.110 --> 00:54:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:52.160 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

00:54:52.160 --> 00:55:00.337 align:middle line:90%
