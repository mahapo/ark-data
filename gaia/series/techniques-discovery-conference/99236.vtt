00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>And it's, indeed, for
me a pleasure to be here

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.000 align:middle line:84%
with you at this conference,
particularly since,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.880 align:middle line:84%
as those of you who are
familiar with my work know,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.870 align:middle line:84%
what I'll be talking about
is partnership spirituality,

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.890 align:middle line:84%
reimaging and
reconfiguring reality,

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.840 align:middle line:84%
which have been themes in my
work for over three decades.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of what you are
here doing, in many ways,

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.150 align:middle line:84%
relates to what I call
partnership spirituality,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.250 align:middle line:84%
the search for
spirituality that is

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:08.280 align:middle line:84%
both imminent and transcendent,
a spirituality that isn't just

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.310 align:middle line:84%
off in some otherworldly
realm, but that

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.440 align:middle line:84%
can inform our
lives here on Earth

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.240 align:middle line:84%
with love and with
purpose and with meeting,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.970 align:middle line:84%
and yes, a spirituality
that we don't have

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.900 align:middle line:84%
to seek by going through
this priestly hierarchy,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.620 align:middle line:84%
but that we can access directly
through what we call gnosis,

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.400 align:middle line:84%
through our own ability to
access what is really part

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.860 align:middle line:84%
of our human capacity,
the capacity to access

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.770 align:middle line:90%
what we call the spiritual.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And as for this idea of
reimaging and reexamining

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.470 align:middle line:84%
reality and
reconfiguring reality,

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.590 align:middle line:84%
by reexamining both
spirituality and science,

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.262 align:middle line:84%
that's something that
you are here doing also.

00:01:57.262 --> 00:01:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, I
don't have to tell you,

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.000 align:middle line:84%
because you know from
your own observations

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.560 align:middle line:84%
that what we call
reality, that that's

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.190 align:middle line:84%
different in different
places and different times.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.870 align:middle line:84%
For example, not so
very long ago-- well,

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.930 align:middle line:84%
not so very long ago in
terms of the long span

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.020 align:middle line:84%
of cultural evolution that
I've been looking at-- reality,

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.660 align:middle line:84%
for most people,
was that the Earth

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.860 align:middle line:84%
is flat with God and the
angels above in the heavens.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And that was just
believed, even though long

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.110 align:middle line:84%
before then, Greek
scientists had already

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.080 align:middle line:84%
suggested that the Earth
is actually spherical.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.160 align:middle line:84%
But one of the reasons
that that, quote, "reality"

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.750 align:middle line:84%
wasn't challenged is because
it was very dangerous

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.400 align:middle line:84%
in those days to
challenge anything

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.820 align:middle line:84%
that the official
powers, very much also

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.400 align:middle line:84%
the religious hierarchies, said
to be so, because if you did,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.140 align:middle line:84%
you risked being burned
alive at the stake.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.320 align:middle line:84%
So that was one reason that
that reality maintained itself

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.650 align:middle line:90%
in people's consciousness.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.040 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going to
really be talking about here

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.450 align:middle line:84%
is that neither
spirituality, nor what

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.890 align:middle line:84%
we call reality, the way that
it is socially constructed,

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.160 align:middle line:84%
that is something that doesn't
just arise in a vacuum.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not an absolute.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.440 align:middle line:84%
It is something
that is related--

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.050 align:middle line:84%
isn't it-- to the kind of
society, the kind of culture

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.980 align:middle line:90%
that we live in.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.560 align:middle line:84%
So it reflects it,
but at the same time--

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.820 align:middle line:84%
and this is very,
very important--

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.740 align:middle line:84%
our beliefs, and as we begin
to reexamine our beliefs,

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.570 align:middle line:84%
our myths, our stories about
what is and is not reality,

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.640 align:middle line:84%
we can also alter,
quote, "reality,"

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.300 align:middle line:84%
the social institutions
from the family

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.320 align:middle line:84%
and education to
politics and economics,

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.470 align:middle line:84%
out of which many of
these beliefs arise,

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.810 align:middle line:84%
because it requires
different kinds of beliefs

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.710 align:middle line:84%
to maintain different
kinds of social systems.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.839 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going
to suggest to you

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:19.899 align:middle line:84%
is that the search
that so many of you

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:22.660 align:middle line:84%
here are passionately
engaged in,

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.630 align:middle line:84%
the search for a
new spirituality,

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.220 align:middle line:84%
that this is part of a larger
change in consciousness,

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.220 align:middle line:84%
a consciousness that
many of the old ways

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.990 align:middle line:84%
that we have been
taught to look at,

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.170 align:middle line:84%
quote, "reality," to look
at ourselves and our world,

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.080 align:middle line:84%
that these are not adaptive,
and that we urgently

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.170 align:middle line:84%
need to reimage and
reconfigure reality.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And very specifically, I'm going
to suggest to you that what

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.020 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing in our world
today underneath all

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.700 align:middle line:84%
of the complex currents
and cross-currents,

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.400 align:middle line:84%
seemingly random things that
are happening around us,

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.530 align:middle line:84%
is really the tension
between two very different,

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.460 align:middle line:84%
underlying possibilities,
alternatives

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.710 align:middle line:84%
for structuring relations,
whether it's relations

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.420 align:middle line:84%
with ourselves, with
others, or with our Mother

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.870 align:middle line:84%
Earth, relations that over
the course of now about three

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.480 align:middle line:84%
decades of multi-disciplinary
research, as those of you

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.820 align:middle line:84%
familiar with my
work know, I have

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:37.890 align:middle line:84%
identified as the partnership
model and the dominator model.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And you will also see that
the way that spirituality

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.390 align:middle line:84%
is configured and imaged is
very different, depending

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.050 align:middle line:84%
on the degree to which a
particular time or society

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.630 align:middle line:84%
orients to one or the
other of these models.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also going to suggest
to you something that many of us

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:05.450 align:middle line:84%
really know inside of us that
we may not call it the dominator

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.030 align:middle line:84%
model, but that this
whole conquest of nature,

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.690 align:middle line:84%
the conquest of other people,
of the whole ranking of one

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:17.140 align:middle line:84%
race over another or of one
people over another, that

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.810 align:middle line:84%
at our level of
technological development,

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:25.020 align:middle line:84%
when we have technologies not
only of communication that

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.430 align:middle line:84%
span the globe in a
matter of minutes,

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.640 align:middle line:84%
but also technologies
of destruction that

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:35.430 align:middle line:84%
span the globe in a minute, that
this dominator model is just

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:41.870 align:middle line:84%
not adaptive and that part of
this new emerging consciousness

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:47.160 align:middle line:84%
is the consciousness that
we really need to shift more

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.770 align:middle line:90%
towards the partnership model.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, we've
already done some shifting.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.942 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't be at a
conference like this.

00:06:54.942 --> 00:06:56.650 align:middle line:84%
The things that we're
talking about here,

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you'd all get burned
for heresy, wouldn't you?

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Not so very long ago, just
a few hundred years ago when

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.990 align:middle line:84%
society still
oriented more to what

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:10.000 align:middle line:90%
I've called the dominator model.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going to be
doing in the short time

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.000 align:middle line:84%
that we have together
today, well, it's a lot.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.160 align:middle line:84%
We're going to,
first of all, explore

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.980 align:middle line:84%
some of the very ancient
roots of what we today

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.120 align:middle line:84%
think of as a, quote,
"new spirituality."

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to do this by
taking a journey through myth

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.950 align:middle line:90%
and reality over 30,000 years.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And we're even going
to take a little side

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:48.260 align:middle line:84%
trip to very briefly explore the
biology, the biology of love,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.640 align:middle line:84%
part of our biological evolution
that is still in so much

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.850 align:middle line:90%
of the science of today ignored.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And then we're
going to come back

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:02.020 align:middle line:84%
to present time and look at
the implications of all of this

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:06.500 align:middle line:84%
for us today and
what kind of actions

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:11.610 align:middle line:84%
can we really take to really
accelerate this shift,

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:15.190 align:middle line:84%
not only towards a new
more partnership-oriented

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:20.210 align:middle line:84%
spirituality, but towards the
kinds of social structures

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and culture that
will support what

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:27.750 align:middle line:84%
we're searching for-- a more
partnership-oriented society.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:30.870 align:middle line:84%
So we've got a great
deal to cover here,

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.620 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
have to go at something

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:35.000 align:middle line:90%
like the speed of light.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.590 align:middle line:84%
But before I even
start, I thought

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:39.730 align:middle line:84%
that I would just
tell you a little bit

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:44.340 align:middle line:84%
about my own
journey, because this

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:48.070 align:middle line:84%
was the journey that
eventually led me

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:51.000 align:middle line:84%
to the new method
of inquiry that

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.550 align:middle line:84%
made it possible to discover
the partnership and dominator

00:08:55.550 --> 00:09:00.280 align:middle line:84%
models as to underlying
human possibilities.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.150 align:middle line:84%
I was born in Vienna
during a time that,

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:08.480 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the conceptual
framework that I've introduced

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.110 align:middle line:84%
of the tension between the
partnership and dominator

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:14.450 align:middle line:84%
models being something that
you see all through history,

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:19.320 align:middle line:84%
was a time of very, very
tremendous dominator

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.910 align:middle line:90%
regression.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.740 align:middle line:84%
It was the time of
the rise of the Nazis

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:28.890 align:middle line:84%
to power, and my
parents and I just

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:33.270 align:middle line:84%
barely escaped with
our lives from Austria

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.980 align:middle line:90%
when I was a little girl.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And actually we really escaped
by just a hair's breath,

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.470 align:middle line:84%
because we were on
one of the last ships

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.850 align:middle line:84%
before one that was turned back
from Cuba, where we eventually

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:51.280 align:middle line:84%
went, a shift that some of
you may have heard about,

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.360 align:middle line:84%
because there was a
movie made about it

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.610 align:middle line:84%
called "The Voyage of the
Damned," the St. Louis.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And it was a ship of 1,000
Jewish refugees-- women,

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.380 align:middle line:84%
children, men-- who had
to return to Nazi Europe.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Most of them died in
Nazi concentration camps.

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:13.140 align:middle line:84%
So we were on one of the last
ships shortly before that one,

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:17.390 align:middle line:84%
and that really--
well, very early, I

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:22.380 align:middle line:84%
started to have to ask myself
some fundamental questions,

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:26.060 align:middle line:84%
questions that I think most of
us here have asked at one time

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:30.030 align:middle line:84%
or another in our lives--
does it have to be this way?

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Does there have to be all this
cruelty, all this violence,

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:39.520 align:middle line:84%
when we humans have such an
incredible capacity for caring,

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.250 align:middle line:90%
for creativity?

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:47.220 align:middle line:84%
What is it that has chronically
pushed us back towards cruelty,

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.550 align:middle line:90%
towards uncaring?

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Does it have to be that
way, as we are often told?

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:56.240 align:middle line:90%
Or are there alternatives?

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Now over the research
of three decades,

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:03.310 align:middle line:84%
what has been coming out ever
more clearly in ever more

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:08.150 align:middle line:84%
detail is that, indeed,
there are alternatives,

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:11.960 align:middle line:84%
but that we cannot see
these alternatives,

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:17.250 align:middle line:84%
unless we widen our lands
of scientific inquiry.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And to radically condense,
because we are here also

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:24.950 align:middle line:84%
talking about methods of
discovery, of the new method

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:28.540 align:middle line:84%
of inquiry that I
developed, the study

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.880 align:middle line:84%
of what I call
relational dynamics,

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.080 align:middle line:84%
it looks at a much
larger database,

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.520 align:middle line:84%
at the whole of our
history, including

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.230 align:middle line:84%
our prehistory, at the
whole of our lives,

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:43.400 align:middle line:84%
not just what so
many studies focus

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:47.230 align:middle line:84%
on-- the political,
economic sphere--

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:51.970 align:middle line:84%
but where we all live,
our intimate, private,

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:55.580 align:middle line:84%
parent-child,
woman-man relations.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And also yes, at the
whole of humanity,

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:03.490 align:middle line:90%
both its female and male halves.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have to tell you
that this is an approach that

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.530 align:middle line:84%
is very different from
most studies that are quite

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:11.525 align:middle line:90%
aptly called the study of man.

00:12:11.525 --> 00:12:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, we're
then told, don't worry.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.810 align:middle line:90%
Man, it includes woman.

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:17.410 align:middle line:90%
Actually, woman includes man.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:18.950 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the word.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:26.440 align:middle line:84%
But aside from that, if you
really look at the books,

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.440 align:middle line:84%
if they've got about
20, 30 pages out

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.660 align:middle line:84%
of a 300-page book on the
female half of humanity,

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.200 align:middle line:84%
oh, it's already a
progressive book.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:42.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, we all know that if we
look at only part of a picture,

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:46.010 align:middle line:84%
we can't see the connections
between the different parts

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:47.530 align:middle line:90%
of the picture, can we?

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.170 align:middle line:90%
We can't connect the dots.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:53.790 align:middle line:90%
We can't see the patterns.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And so using this
method of inquiry

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:02.030 align:middle line:84%
was like the pieces of a
puzzle coming together.

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And I began to see these
connections, these patterns

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:07.590 align:middle line:84%
that transcend all of these
conventional differences

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:09.810 align:middle line:84%
that we're so used
to-- east versus

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:14.170 align:middle line:84%
west or capitalist versus
communist or industrial

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:19.770 align:middle line:84%
versus post-industrial
or secular or religious.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And the findings from this study
differ in very fundamental ways

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.300 align:middle line:84%
from many other findings
about our cultural evolution.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And for me, the study of
our cultural evolution

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.030 align:middle line:84%
is not just the
study of our past.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:36.430 align:middle line:84%
It's really the issue,
for me, is what can we

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:39.200 align:middle line:84%
learn that that's
important for our present

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.640 align:middle line:84%
and for the possibilities
for our future?

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Unlike most stories, but like
some of the newer approaches

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:51.030 align:middle line:84%
that we're beginning to
emerge today-- for example,

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:55.160 align:middle line:84%
like chaos theory--
my work shows

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.110 align:middle line:84%
that societies are
living systems,

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:01.920 align:middle line:84%
and they're self-organizing
and self-maintaining.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.170 align:middle line:84%
But they are capable
during periods

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:08.610 align:middle line:84%
of great disequilibrium,
such as ours--

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:11.630 align:middle line:84%
we are living in a period
of great disequilibrium--

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.560 align:middle line:84%
and also, such as
the period that we'll

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.480 align:middle line:84%
look at in a few minutes
in our pre-history

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:21.195 align:middle line:90%
of transformative change.

00:14:21.195 --> 00:14:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And another thing
that it shows is

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:28.300 align:middle line:84%
that unlike the model that we've
been taught about evolution

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.740 align:middle line:84%
as this straight line upward
progression from, quote,

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.250 align:middle line:84%
"barbarism" to civilization,
which, of course,

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:38.060 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the Nazis, for
example, or the Khomeini's Iran

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.880 align:middle line:84%
or at the Taliban, you have
to say, well, wait a minute.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.950 align:middle line:90%
Where'd they get that idea?

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:46.420 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, that
it's not linear.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
from our own lives.

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Change, especially
transformative change,

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.130 align:middle line:90%
is not linear.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:56.720 align:middle line:84%
There are periods of regression,
and really what I saw

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.870 align:middle line:84%
is that, as I said,
all of history

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:02.000 align:middle line:84%
has been punctuated by this
tension between these two

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.390 align:middle line:84%
possibilities as to underlying,
if you will, attractors,

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:11.630 align:middle line:84%
if you use the language
of non-linear dynamics.

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And another thing
that I saw and that's

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.160 align:middle line:84%
going to take us straight
into this journey

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:22.380 align:middle line:84%
that I promised you that we'd
take through myth and reality

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.560 align:middle line:84%
is that much that is
happening in our time,

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:30.110 align:middle line:84%
including the search
for a new spirituality,

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:33.840 align:middle line:84%
is not new, it's
not radical, but it

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:39.070 align:middle line:84%
has very ancient roots in
traditions that we are now

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:42.820 align:middle line:84%
against much opposition,
because remember, living systems

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.690 align:middle line:84%
and systems of belief are
part of living systems.

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:47.490 align:middle line:84%
They seek to
maintain themselves.

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:51.470 align:middle line:84%
But we're beginning to
reclaim this information.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, we're all
familiar with the stories

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:59.310 align:middle line:84%
about, well, quote,
"reality," that

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:02.920 align:middle line:84%
make it seem as if the
dominator model, this ranking,

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.960 align:middle line:84%
whether it's man over woman, man
over man, nation over nation,

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.730 align:middle line:84%
or man over nature, this
conquest of nature that,

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:14.830 align:middle line:84%
at our level of technology,
is unsustainable.

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:16.460 align:middle line:90%
But that's just how it is.

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:17.660 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.120 align:middle line:90%
That's just human nature.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.650 align:middle line:84%
We have stories, for
example, original sin, right?

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.260 align:middle line:90%
We're bad.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:28.600 align:middle line:84%
We're evil, so we have to be
strictly controlled, right?

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.700 align:middle line:84%
You can see how these stories
have some relationship

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.250 align:middle line:90%
to social structures, can't you?

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Because it's very
convenient to have stories

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:40.190 align:middle line:84%
that say that humans are
innately evil and that

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:44.640 align:middle line:84%
therefore, the people on
top have to control us.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.690 align:middle line:84%
Then there are theories--
not just religious stories--

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:51.120 align:middle line:84%
but scientific stories,
theories such as selfish genes.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And I sometimes
wonder why they argue

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.590 align:middle line:84%
with each other, because
basically, it's the same story,

00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:58.040 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:01.540 align:middle line:84%
Something is wrong
with us, and they

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:07.540 align:middle line:84%
tell oh, male dominance,
the controlled domination

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:11.359 align:middle line:84%
of one half of humanity
by the other, violence.

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:12.960 align:middle line:90%
That's just how it is.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.079 align:middle line:90%
It's in your genes.

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:17.030 align:middle line:84%
Really, you didn't know, but
according to this theory,

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:18.040 align:middle line:90%
you have no choice.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.060 align:middle line:84%
You are being run by these
selfish little genes who

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:24.380 align:middle line:84%
are trying to
perpetuate themselves.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.619 align:middle line:90%
Well, same story, isn't it?

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:29.020 align:middle line:90%
Something wrong with us.

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.010 align:middle line:84%
Got to be controlled,
and why bother even

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:35.140 align:middle line:84%
trying to change anything
if that's reality, right?

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:35.710 align:middle line:90%
No point.

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:39.230 align:middle line:84%
You might as well just say,
OK, that's the way it is.

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:41.486 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just have
to live with it.

00:17:41.486 --> 00:17:43.110 align:middle line:84%
But there are many,
many other stories,

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:47.180 align:middle line:84%
including, for example, the
story that we think nothing

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:50.180 align:middle line:84%
actually of showing
to children, the story

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:53.990 align:middle line:84%
in that caveman cartoon
that I think most of us

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:55.080 align:middle line:90%
know all to well.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.850 align:middle line:84%
There's this hominid creature,
and in one hand, what has

00:17:57.850 --> 00:17:58.350 align:middle line:90%
he got?

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:01.720 align:middle line:84%
He's got a club-- a way
to dominate, to destroy,

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.686 align:middle line:90%
to hurt somebody.

00:18:03.686 --> 00:18:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And with the other hand, he's
pulling a woman by the hair.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, same story--
violence, male dominance.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.160 align:middle line:84%
That's the way things
have always been,

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.850 align:middle line:84%
and then by implication,
always have to be.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And yes, we're all also
familiar with religious dogmas

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:29.440 align:middle line:84%
about angry and punitive
deities, whether they're

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Eastern or Western, who
capriciously inflict pain,

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:39.630 align:middle line:84%
hideous pain on us for
the slightest disobedience

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:44.370 align:middle line:84%
of the men who represent
them here on Earth.

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:47.930 align:middle line:84%
So small wonder
then, since this is

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:51.330 align:middle line:84%
part of our heritage from
earlier times that oriented

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:54.180 align:middle line:84%
more to the dominator
model that so many of us

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:58.680 align:middle line:84%
are today searching
for a new spirituality.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:03.150 align:middle line:84%
But then we're told,
well, this is radical.

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:09.700 align:middle line:84%
This is new and, yes, sinful--
that this so-called new age

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.200 align:middle line:84%
movement is the
work of the devil,

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:18.600 align:middle line:84%
and that it's your job if you're
a God-fearing Christian or Jew

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:26.480 align:middle line:84%
or Hindu or Muslim to suppress
this radical new heresy.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, it's not a
question of religion, is it?

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.710 align:middle line:84%
It's a question of maintaining
an old system, a dominator

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:34.930 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:37.430 align:middle line:84%
So what do we really
see if we actually

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:43.080 align:middle line:84%
embark on this journey going
back about 30,000 years?

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.680 align:middle line:84%
What kind of
spirituality do we see?

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:50.870 align:middle line:84%
What kind of imaging and
configuring of reality

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:53.110 align:middle line:90%
do we see?

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first thing that we
see if we go to the Stone Age,

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:02.020 align:middle line:84%
to the paleolithic, there
isn't a single image, not one

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:06.510 align:middle line:84%
image that even
remotely suggests

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:10.670 align:middle line:84%
the kind of relationship that
all these other stories suggest

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:15.170 align:middle line:84%
between women and men,
between men and men.

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:19.210 align:middle line:84%
On the contrary,
instead of images

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:22.860 align:middle line:84%
that we're so used to
glorifying, idealizing

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.810 align:middle line:84%
the power to take life,
to dominate, to destroy,

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:31.930 align:middle line:84%
we see image after image
that is part of the sacred--

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:33.670 align:middle line:84%
because the art,
it was sacred art.

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:38.440 align:middle line:84%
All art was sacred in those
times-- celebrating the power

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.590 align:middle line:90%
to give and nurture life.

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And yes, celebrating
very specifically

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:50.000 align:middle line:84%
the power to give and nurture
life inherent in a woman's

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.580 align:middle line:84%
body, as in those very
mislabeled so-called Venus

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.250 align:middle line:90%
figurines.

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:00.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, take, for example, the
so-called Venus of Laussel,

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:04.380 align:middle line:84%
which is totally ignored in
most discussions of paleolithic

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.460 align:middle line:90%
or Stone Age art.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Here, at the entrance
of a cave sanctuary--

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:11.740 align:middle line:84%
and we know these
were sanctuaries--

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:15.290 align:middle line:84%
is an engraving of
a female figure.

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:16.780 align:middle line:90%
She is nude.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:20.430 align:middle line:84%
In one hand, she
holds a crescent moon

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:24.770 align:middle line:84%
with 13 markings--
the lunar calendar.

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:27.940 align:middle line:84%
With the other hand,
she is pointing down

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:31.710 align:middle line:90%
to a clearly etched vulva.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Now this probably indicates
an understanding not only

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:41.910 align:middle line:84%
of the link between
women's menstrual cycles

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:45.430 align:middle line:84%
and the lunar cycles, because,
of course, they're linked,

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:52.240 align:middle line:84%
but also an understanding of
the link between woman's power

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:57.290 align:middle line:84%
to give life and
the power of nature

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:01.880 align:middle line:84%
to give and sustain
and nurture life.

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:07.823 align:middle line:84%
So what we see then is
a focus on the rebirth--

00:22:07.823 --> 00:22:12.340 align:middle line:84%
it's a cyclical view of
reality-- the rebirth of nature

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:13.710 align:middle line:90%
every year.

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:16.745 align:middle line:84%
And it's very interesting,
because you know those animals

00:22:16.745 --> 00:22:18.800 align:middle line:90%
that you see on the caves?

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And we've been told,
oh, that's prey.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Those are the
animals they hunted.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, archaeologists
now are telling us,

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.910 align:middle line:84%
which most of the
animals on those caves

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:33.520 align:middle line:84%
were not animals
these people hunted.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.110 align:middle line:84%
Moreover, most of
them come in pairs.

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:37.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And very often, those
pairs are female and male.

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:45.910 align:middle line:84%
So as the French archaeologist,
Andre Leroi-Gourhan,

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:50.480 align:middle line:84%
pointed out, again, this
points out an understanding

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.920 align:middle line:84%
of the relationship
between sex and rebirth

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:59.395 align:middle line:84%
as part of a nature-based
spirituality,

00:22:59.395 --> 00:23:02.930 align:middle line:84%
as do the many
phalluses and vulvas

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:07.310 align:middle line:84%
that 19th century
scholars simply labeled,

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:10.111 align:middle line:90%
"unidentified symbols."

00:23:10.111 --> 00:23:13.550 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:14.910 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:21.390 align:middle line:84%
So you begin to see already very
early in our cultural history

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:27.886 align:middle line:84%
evidence of a belief system that
saw the earth as our mother.

00:23:27.886 --> 00:23:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And I told you we were going
to go at the speed of light,

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.040 align:middle line:84%
so we're going to
jump about 10,000--

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.310 align:middle line:84%
well, about 20,000 years,
from about 30 to 20,000 years

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:39.120 align:middle line:84%
ago to 10,000 years
ago-- to the Neolithic,

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.980 align:middle line:90%
to the first agrarian societies.

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And, again, if we really look
at the art of the early part

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:48.920 align:middle line:84%
of the Neolithic-- because
there's a shift later,

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.970 align:middle line:84%
and I'll get to
that-- if you look

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:54.150 align:middle line:84%
at the art of the early
part of the Neolithic,

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:56.450 align:middle line:84%
you see something
very interesting.

00:23:56.450 --> 00:24:00.000 align:middle line:84%
You see an absence of
the kinds of images

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.380 align:middle line:84%
that we're so used to
seeing of men killing

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:07.830 align:middle line:84%
each other in heroic battles, of
men killing other people, women

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:10.860 align:middle line:84%
and children, of so-called
hallowed conquerors

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:14.770 align:middle line:84%
dragging back people in chains,
of rape, the kind of stuff

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:18.170 align:middle line:84%
that all the big museums,
even the old masters, right?

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:21.580 align:middle line:84%
How many scenes do we have
of Zeus raping everybody?

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:25.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean not just women, but
cows and swans, and, of course,

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:28.220 align:middle line:84%
the message is rape
is a godly sport.

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:29.800 align:middle line:90%


00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:33.212 align:middle line:84%
But again, if you don't
see this kind of imagery,

00:24:33.212 --> 00:24:35.670 align:middle line:84%
you sort of have
to ask yourself,

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:38.910 align:middle line:84%
could it possibly be
that this reflects

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:44.370 align:middle line:84%
a different way of imaging
and configuring reality,

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:47.500 align:middle line:90%
what we call reality?

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.900 align:middle line:84%
But then later in the
Neolithic, and in some places,

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.900 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't happen
until the Bronze Age,

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.670 align:middle line:90%
you see evidence of a shift.

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's very interesting,
because already,

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:04.060 align:middle line:84%
Gordon Childe, who was an early
archaeologist in the '60s,

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:07.330 align:middle line:84%
and he idealized the
Indo-European invaders,

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:10.240 align:middle line:84%
who brought with them
the dominator model.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.830 align:middle line:84%
But he pointed out,
now we're beginning

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:16.510 align:middle line:84%
to see an absence
of female figures.

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:19.070 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing also
something else.

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:23.230 align:middle line:84%
We're beginning to
see signs of warfare.

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And we're beginning to
see weapons everywhere.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And as the archaeologist,
Marija Gimbutas, points out,

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:35.090 align:middle line:84%
you also begin to see
a very radical change

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:37.710 align:middle line:90%
in burial practices.

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Instead of primarily
communal graves,

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:43.930 align:middle line:84%
you now begin to see
these chieftain graves,

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and these are
graves where you see

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:52.030 align:middle line:84%
the chieftain and his
skeleton, but you also

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:57.039 align:middle line:84%
see sacrificed women
and children and horses,

00:25:57.039 --> 00:25:58.830 align:middle line:84%
because the horse was
one of the bit things

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:00.850 align:middle line:84%
that the Indo-Europeans
brought with them

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:06.590 align:middle line:84%
that made it possible for
them to basically take over.

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And one other thing that you
see-- lots and lots of weapons,

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.930 align:middle line:84%
all of these reflecting now
something very interesting,

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:17.455 align:middle line:84%
because in the
earlier burials, you

00:26:17.455 --> 00:26:21.030 align:middle line:84%
had a few what they
call grave gifts.

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:25.924 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes a priestess, she's
buried with an obsidian mirror.

00:26:25.924 --> 00:26:28.660 align:middle line:84%
But here, you see
all of this stuff,

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:31.000 align:middle line:84%
and obviously what
has happened is

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.940 align:middle line:84%
it reflects a different belief
system, no longer a recycling

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:39.870 align:middle line:84%
rebirth of life, but a
one-way journey here.

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And this guy better
have with him

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:46.480 align:middle line:84%
all the stuff that he's going to
need to maintain his lifestyle,

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:53.130 align:middle line:84%
I guess, of killing and
enslaving on the other side.

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And so the emphasis
really begins

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:02.875 align:middle line:84%
to shift towards a whole
new way of seeing reality,

00:27:02.875 --> 00:27:05.000 align:middle line:84%
and one of the other things
that we see, of course,

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.540 align:middle line:90%
is a real cultural regression.

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:10.840 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the sophisticated,
really beautiful pottery

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:15.740 align:middle line:84%
of the earlier time
begins to disappear.

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Now one of the most interesting
things about these two ways

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.530 align:middle line:84%
that we're beginning
to look at of imaging

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:28.250 align:middle line:84%
and configuring reality has to
do with basic issues, issues

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:30.910 align:middle line:90%
of pain and of pleasure.

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:35.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to tell you that if
you have a system that depends

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.600 align:middle line:84%
on pain to maintain
itself, whether it's

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:42.280 align:middle line:84%
emotional pain-- we're all most
of us familiar with that one

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.360 align:middle line:84%
from dominator
child-rearing, aren't we?

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.660 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the hurts
we carry, our parents

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.180 align:middle line:90%
didn't invent that stuff.

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:52.090 align:middle line:84%
It's stuff that we've inherited
from earlier times, earlier

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:55.370 align:middle line:84%
times when people
really were educated

00:27:55.370 --> 00:28:00.530 align:middle line:84%
to absolutely obey
orders in societies where

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:03.820 align:middle line:84%
if you didn't obey
the absolute monarch,

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:05.950 align:middle line:90%
it was off with your head.

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And families reflected
this, but I'm

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.050 align:middle line:84%
going to really stay
with you in prehistory,

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:13.560 align:middle line:84%
but I also want to show
you how this really all

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:18.110 align:middle line:84%
relates in terms of these two
social systems to what we're

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:20.765 align:middle line:84%
really trying to move
toward today, not

00:28:20.765 --> 00:28:25.390 align:middle line:84%
only in spirituality, but
in our lives, and our world,

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:29.410 align:middle line:84%
for ourselves, for our children,
and for our grandchildren.

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:31.610 align:middle line:84%
But one of the most
interesting things

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:34.220 align:middle line:84%
that you see in
this earlier part

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:37.980 align:middle line:84%
is, as I said, instead of an
emphasis being on the capacity

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.170 align:middle line:84%
to take life-- I mean,
consider, Jehovah,

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:42.360 align:middle line:90%
he's got a thunderbolt, right?

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.866 align:middle line:84%
Zeus actually has both a
thunderbolt and a sword,

00:28:45.866 --> 00:28:47.490 align:middle line:84%
so if you didn't get
it the first time,

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:49.200 align:middle line:90%
you've got it the second time.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:54.520 align:middle line:84%
The highest power is the
power to dominate and destroy.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:57.340 align:middle line:90%
Very graphic lessons here.

00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:00.120 align:middle line:84%
What you'll see in
these earlier societies

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:03.870 align:middle line:84%
is a very different
representation of deity.

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:09.670 align:middle line:84%
You don't see either female
or male deities with weapons.

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Quite the contrary and this
was something that when

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:15.105 align:middle line:84%
I was working on my
book, "Sacred Pleasure,"

00:29:15.105 --> 00:29:19.050 align:middle line:84%
I was just so struck by it,
by the absence of these kinds

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:21.470 align:middle line:90%
of images in our art.

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:26.640 align:middle line:84%
You see as part of the sacred
art, images of birth-giving

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.490 align:middle line:90%
as part of the sacred.

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:32.750 align:middle line:84%
In Catalhoyuk, for
example-- and Catalhoyuk

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:35.340 align:middle line:84%
is one of the largest
Neolithic sites ever found,

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.940 align:middle line:84%
ever excavated-- there's
a goddess figurine,

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:42.020 align:middle line:84%
and she's sitting on a
throne-- a chair, a throne--

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:44.136 align:middle line:90%
flanked by two feline animals.

00:29:44.136 --> 00:29:45.010 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting.

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:49.180 align:middle line:84%
You remember the cat, and it
became the symbol of the witch?

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.280 align:middle line:84%
But here it was
still a good thing,

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.530 align:middle line:90%
the cat, the feline animal.

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And she's sitting,
because it's easier

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:58.790 align:middle line:84%
to push when you're giving
birth when you're sitting,

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:01.830 align:middle line:90%
and she's giving birth.

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:06.510 align:middle line:84%
It's really not only
birth-giving, but sex.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Sex is part of the
sacred imagery.

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.840 align:middle line:84%
So you're beginning
to make a connection,

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:15.360 align:middle line:84%
because so much in the
so-called new age spirituality

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.020 align:middle line:84%
is, again, about
resacrilizing sexuality.

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:23.820 align:middle line:84%
But it had nothing really
to do with spirituality per

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:27.930 align:middle line:84%
se, but a lot with the
movement toward a partnership

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:31.275 align:middle line:84%
way of living, because if
that hadn't been happening,

00:30:31.275 --> 00:30:35.780 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't be able to even
image this kind of an idea.

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And yet it has such
very ancient roots.

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:42.290 align:middle line:84%
For example, in
Catalhoyuk, you find

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:46.160 align:middle line:84%
a plaque of a woman and a
man-- a goddess and a god--

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:50.280 align:middle line:84%
embracing, and right next to it,
you see the woman with a child.

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:54.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's a holy family, but
it's a natural holy family.

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:58.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a woman and man,
and then a holy child.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:02.410 align:middle line:84%
There are other representations
like the so-called [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:03.350 align:middle line:90%
lovers.

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Again, very clearly, a
very clear phallic imagery,

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:12.220 align:middle line:84%
very clear vulva-- I mean
these are sexual images

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:14.740 align:middle line:90%
that we're seeing.

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:19.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's really fascinating,
but it isn't just

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.900 align:middle line:90%
spirituality and sexuality.

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And I want to really
broaden this a little.

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:25.220 align:middle line:90%
It's power.

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:28.420 align:middle line:90%
Power is imaged differently.

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:31.390 align:middle line:84%
You don't find in
these societies

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:35.920 align:middle line:84%
the kinds of images that we
see in later antiquity of these

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.700 align:middle line:84%
either deities or
kings or whatever

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:42.410 align:middle line:84%
sitting on these elevated
thrones with people

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:44.852 align:middle line:90%
sort of groveling under them.

00:31:44.852 --> 00:31:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And very often,
the people are even

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:48.940 align:middle line:84%
represented as
being smaller, just

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:53.370 align:middle line:84%
in case, again, you didn't get
it, that you are not important.

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:58.950 align:middle line:84%
Only this being that
controls you is important.

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And if we really go very
quickly now to a Bronze Age

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:06.230 align:middle line:84%
civilization, the Minoan
civilization, that

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:11.630 align:middle line:84%
lasted on the island of Crete
until about 3,500 years ago,

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:13.370 align:middle line:84%
we see something
very interesting

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:14.690 align:middle line:90%
to illustrate this point.

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:17.590 align:middle line:84%
We see the so-called
Procession Fresco.

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And here you have the figure in
the center of this procession

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:25.490 align:middle line:84%
is a goddess but high
priestess figure,

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:28.050 align:middle line:90%
hands raised in the benediction.

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:31.180 align:middle line:84%
I call it the chalice position,
because if you hold your hands

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.400 align:middle line:84%
like this, and you
breathe, sometimes

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.710 align:middle line:90%
you really get a lot of energy.

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we can try it at
some point, but not right now,

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:43.690 align:middle line:84%
because I want to stay
on our journey with you.

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:44.760 align:middle line:90%
So fine.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.950 align:middle line:84%
She's the same level
as a group of priests

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:52.510 align:middle line:84%
who are bringing to her gifts
of the earth-- fruit and wine.

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Very different representation
of power than the one

00:32:56.970 --> 00:32:59.320 align:middle line:90%
that we're used to.

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing, one
of the most fascinating things

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:05.590 align:middle line:84%
about all of this
is actually, even

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:07.270 align:middle line:84%
if you don't look
at the archaeology,

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:12.980 align:middle line:84%
we have long had clues
about these earlier times

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:17.030 align:middle line:84%
in most of the world's
oldest legends.

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:18.710 align:middle line:90%
Think about it for a moment.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:22.879 align:middle line:84%
In the Tao De Ching,
we read about--

00:33:22.879 --> 00:33:24.420 align:middle line:84%
and the clues are
very specific, very

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:27.050 align:middle line:84%
specific clues--
we read of a time

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:29.530 align:middle line:84%
when the Yin, or
feminine principle,

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:33.740 align:middle line:84%
was not yet considered
subservient to the Yang,

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:35.330 align:middle line:90%
or male principle.

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:39.360 align:middle line:84%
We're told specifically it was
a more peaceful and just time,

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.540 align:middle line:84%
and we're also told
very specifically

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:45.070 align:middle line:84%
that it was a time when
the wisdom of the mother

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:47.020 align:middle line:90%
was still honored.

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:49.770 align:middle line:84%
So what does that tell you
about social organization?

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:51.150 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
I should tell you

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:55.930 align:middle line:84%
that the evidence that's
beginning to come to the fore

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:59.210 align:middle line:84%
is not only, because I
focused my work on the West,

00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:02.350 align:middle line:84%
because that's the area that
I know, but, for example,

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:05.700 align:middle line:84%
us scholars at the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:09.429 align:middle line:84%
tested my cultural
transformation theory in China.

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And they found the same pattern
of an earlier direction,

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:16.000 align:middle line:84%
more in the
partnership direction,

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.050 align:middle line:84%
towards pleasure
rather than pain.

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:25.494 align:middle line:84%
It makes sense, and the shift,
and they wrote a book actually

00:34:25.494 --> 00:34:30.260 align:middle line:84%
that came out in 1995 in
time for the Beijing Women's

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:33.409 align:middle line:84%
Conference called "The
Chalice and the Blade

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:35.469 align:middle line:84%
in Chinese Culture,"
which you can

00:34:35.469 --> 00:34:39.370 align:middle line:84%
get if you're interested through
the Center for Partnership

00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:41.370 align:middle line:90%
Studies.

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:44.949 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, let's get
back to the legends.

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:50.199 align:middle line:84%
Hesiod, a Greek poet who wrote
about the same time as Homer--

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:53.080 align:middle line:90%
he writes of a golden race.

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Things got very idealized,
because what came later

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.090 align:middle line:90%
was so brutal.

00:34:57.090 --> 00:35:02.060 align:middle line:84%
But he writes of a golden race
who lived in peaceful ease

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:06.690 align:middle line:84%
before a lesser race came in
and brought with them Ares,

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:10.540 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, Ares is
the Greek god of war.

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:15.498 align:middle line:84%
And think of the best known
story in Western civilization,

00:35:15.498 --> 00:35:20.260 align:middle line:84%
the story of Adam and Eve
and the fall from Paradise.

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:22.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what does
it really tell you?

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't it tell
you that there was

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:30.750 align:middle line:84%
a time when woman and man lived
in harmony with one another

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:33.970 align:middle line:90%
and with nature?

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:35.960 align:middle line:90%
And then there came a shift.

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:39.440 align:middle line:84%
Now very interestingly,
why did this shift come,

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:41.280 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, it's
the woman's fault. Oh,

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.190 align:middle line:90%
and it's also the snake's fault.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Many of the Minoan
goddess figures,

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:48.150 align:middle line:84%
for example-- a very
interesting thing,

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:51.480 align:middle line:84%
and I forgot to tell you,
because it's so fascinating.

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:55.070 align:middle line:84%
You see many priestess
figures with snakes

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:58.100 align:middle line:84%
intertwined on their
arms, basically

00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:59.650 align:middle line:90%
in an oracular trance.

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:03.520 align:middle line:84%
In other words, gnosis, the
direct access to the divine.

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And if you actually think
of the Oracle of Delphi,

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:10.460 align:middle line:84%
even in later Greek times, which
were already dominator times,

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:14.100 align:middle line:84%
still, that was a place where
a priestess, a pythoness,

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:19.600 align:middle line:84%
worked with a snake to give
people of the day oracular

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.600 align:middle line:90%
wisdom.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:24.570 align:middle line:84%
So in the story of
the Garden, the snake

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:27.670 align:middle line:84%
is still somebody that
Eve asks for wisdom,

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:31.920 align:middle line:84%
for advice, because
that's an old tradition.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.610 align:middle line:84%
But now, of course,
she presumably

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:37.960 align:middle line:84%
gets terrible advice,
and what's the advice?

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:41.140 align:middle line:90%
Seek knowledge directly.

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:44.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the worst crime in
a dominator system, isn't it?

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't be worse, and
it's all woman's fault,

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.660 align:middle line:84%
of course, because how else
are you going to justify this,

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Henceforth woman will
be subservient to man?

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:59.210 align:middle line:84%
When I was a little
girl-- it's a long story.

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:02.600 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in Cuba, and it
was a Catholic country,

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.940 align:middle line:84%
and I went to this
mess Methodist school.

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:08.139 align:middle line:84%
And every day we
had to go to chapel,

00:37:08.139 --> 00:37:10.430 align:middle line:84%
and they would always ask
who believes in Jesus Christ.

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And I got tired of
being the only kid who

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:14.220 align:middle line:90%
didn't raise her hand.

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:15.670 align:middle line:90%
So I would raise my hand.

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:18.050 align:middle line:84%
My parents found out,
and they hired this rabbi

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:20.210 align:middle line:90%
to teach me that I'm Jewish.

00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:22.431 align:middle line:84%
And this man had a
terrible time with me,

00:37:22.431 --> 00:37:23.680 align:middle line:90%
because I would ask questions.

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, what was it like
before the Henceforth?

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:30.042 align:middle line:84%
And he was not happy
with me, I can tell you.

00:37:30.042 --> 00:37:33.160 align:middle line:90%


00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:36.530 align:middle line:84%
What we're beginning to find
out today is, of course--

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:40.600 align:middle line:84%
and I've just very briefly,
briefly shared this with you--

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:44.550 align:middle line:84%
is that before the Henceforth--
and the Henceforth, by the way,

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:48.500 align:middle line:84%
happened a long time before
the Judeo-Christian religions.

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.200 align:middle line:84%
I want to be very
clear about that.

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:54.180 align:middle line:84%
This is not something
invented by the Hebrews

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.630 align:middle line:90%
or by the Christians.

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:58.550 align:middle line:84%
This happened in our
prehistory, this shift.

00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And we already see it
in Greece, for example.

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:02.204 align:middle line:90%
My goodness.

00:38:02.204 --> 00:38:04.120 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want to go
there, because I really

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:07.720 align:middle line:84%
want to stay with you,
because some of the clues

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.090 align:middle line:90%
are so fascinating.

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:10.790 align:middle line:90%
It's not just legends.

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:14.350 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the traces
of a spirituality

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:16.680 align:middle line:84%
that has erotic
elements is right there

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:20.800 align:middle line:84%
in the Bible in
the Song of Songs.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.670 align:middle line:90%
What's it about?

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:24.382 align:middle line:90%
It's not about God.

00:38:24.382 --> 00:38:26.090 align:middle line:84%
It's not even about
Solomon, because they

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:28.110 align:middle line:90%
call it the Song of Solomon.

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:29.270 align:middle line:90%
He's not even there.

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:31.520 align:middle line:84%
It's about the
beautiful Shulamite,

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.660 align:middle line:84%
and she sings to her lover
about how he will lie

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:36.540 align:middle line:90%
all night betwixt her breasts.

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:41.470 align:middle line:84%
It's obviously a remnant of
a tradition of spirituality

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:42.820 align:middle line:90%
that is erotic.

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, once we no
longer look at, quote,

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:48.980 align:middle line:84%
"reality" through these
dominator blinkers

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:52.880 align:middle line:84%
that we've all been issued
in school, in university,

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.930 align:middle line:84%
but broaden our
lens of inquiry, you

00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:59.890 align:middle line:84%
see that the very first writings
in Western civilization,

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:05.430 align:middle line:84%
the Hymns of Inanna, cuneiform
tablets, the very first known

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:08.640 align:middle line:84%
deciphered writings in
Western civilization.

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:12.130 align:middle line:84%
In the Hymns of Inanna, Inanna
was the Sumerian goddess

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:13.540 align:middle line:90%
of love and procreation.

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:18.180 align:middle line:84%
We read of her sacred marriage
with the king god, Dumuzi,

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:19.510 align:middle line:90%
and another erotic song.

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And again, we see
the cyclical part.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:26.090 align:middle line:84%
They also go into the underworld
to, again, return from death.

00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:34.996 align:middle line:84%
So it's sex, birth, death,
and rebirth-- the same cycle.

00:39:34.996 --> 00:39:36.370 align:middle line:84%
There's really
much more to tell,

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:40.000 align:middle line:84%
and you can read
about it in my books,

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.600 align:middle line:84%
but let's get to
present time here,

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:47.770 align:middle line:84%
because if you now have this
background, this picture,

00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:50.910 align:middle line:84%
you can see that a lot
of what's happening today

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:54.243 align:middle line:84%
is, of course, a reconnection
with partnership where it's not

00:39:54.243 --> 00:39:58.880 align:middle line:84%
to go back, but to
go forward, which

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:03.120 align:middle line:84%
is what we need to do using
the technology that we have,

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:07.380 align:middle line:84%
but using it guided by
an ethos of partnership,

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:09.000 align:middle line:90%
rather than domination.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.650 align:middle line:84%
For example, consider
the reappearance

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:16.050 align:middle line:84%
of images of the
deity in female form.

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:16.810 align:middle line:90%
There you have it.

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:19.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every
connection, isn't it,

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:23.610 align:middle line:84%
with this earlier
spirituality and reality.

00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:27.880 align:middle line:84%
The struggle of women to
enter the priesthood-- part

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:31.490 align:middle line:84%
of the same reconnection
with earlier roots.

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Consider if men were
barred from the priesthood.

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:41.280 align:middle line:84%
They would be deprived of
moral authority, the authority

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:44.100 align:middle line:84%
to say what is right
and what is wrong,

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:46.500 align:middle line:90%
including what is done to them.

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.990 align:middle line:84%
So it is very,
very, very important

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:52.130 align:middle line:84%
for women to reclaim
that authority

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:54.560 align:middle line:84%
and for men to
help women do this,

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.450 align:middle line:90%
because we're in this together.

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:59.780 align:middle line:84%
This is not a question of
women against men or men

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:00.670 align:middle line:90%
against women.

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:03.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a question of, do
we live in partnership,

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:05.800 align:middle line:84%
or do we live in
a dominator way?

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:08.590 align:middle line:84%
Because consider one of
the first mental maps

00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:11.920 align:middle line:84%
we get about what's
normal, what's

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:15.970 align:middle line:84%
reality in human relations,
is whether the two

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:18.930 align:middle line:84%
halves of humanity, which
is what women and men are,

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:22.060 align:middle line:84%
relate more in partnership,
or whether one is supposed

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.260 align:middle line:84%
to be in control,
and the other one

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:28.320 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to serve
and to be dominated.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.890 align:middle line:84%
You can generalize that mental
map to a different race,

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:35.650 align:middle line:84%
to a different religion,
to a different human,

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:38.690 align:middle line:84%
so you have a system where
difference, beginning

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:41.330 align:middle line:84%
with the most fundamental
difference in our species

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:46.040 align:middle line:84%
between female and male, is
equated either with inferiority

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:49.540 align:middle line:84%
or superiority, with being
dominated or dominating,

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:52.870 align:middle line:84%
or with human rights, with
respect for each other,

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:56.550 align:middle line:84%
with mutually beneficial and
caring, and truly loving,

00:41:56.550 --> 00:42:00.160 align:middle line:84%
and yes, truly
spiritual relations.

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
struggle today in religion

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality, the struggle
between so-called religious

00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:10.860 align:middle line:84%
fundamentalism, and I
have to say "so-called,"

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:14.360 align:middle line:84%
because it is really
dominator fundamentalism.

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:18.910 align:middle line:84%
It is not-- I mean, religion,
look at what Isaiah preached.

00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:24.630 align:middle line:84%
Look at what Jesus preached--
caring, nonviolence, empathy.

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:27.710 align:middle line:84%
These are not the
teachings that are

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:31.670 align:middle line:84%
being taught by the
fundamentalist leaders who

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:36.590 align:middle line:84%
are capitalizing on
fear, on fear of change,

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:40.210 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, on scapegoating,
because in the dominator model,

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:45.450 align:middle line:84%
you can't go and express
your pain and your anger

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:48.330 align:middle line:84%
and you're upset against those
who are causing you pain.

00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:51.140 align:middle line:84%
You do it against those
that you consider weak,

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:54.030 align:middle line:84%
that you perceive as weak,
or, quote, "feminine,"

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:57.590 align:middle line:84%
which in the dominator
mind is the same thing.

00:42:57.590 --> 00:43:00.910 align:middle line:84%
So if you start looking
at, quote, "reality,"

00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:middle line:84%
and forget about capitalism
and religious and secular

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:05.920 align:middle line:84%
and east and west,
because you see

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.160 align:middle line:90%
the same problem in the east.

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Being a refugee to the east,
in terms of spirituality,

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:13.490 align:middle line:90%
is not a good plan.

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:15.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, fascinating
traditions there,

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.210 align:middle line:84%
mind you, but some
horrible ones.

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:21.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, consider that one of
the stories in Hindu religion

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:26.806 align:middle line:84%
is how the great god Vishnu, his
father was going to kill him.

00:43:26.806 --> 00:43:28.180 align:middle line:84%
Have you noticed
how many stories

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:32.120 align:middle line:84%
we have about the older
dominator afraid of the younger

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:34.460 align:middle line:90%
one coming and killing him?

00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:37.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's even tense
for those on top.

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:39.820 align:middle line:90%
It's not a pleasant system.

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:43.940 align:middle line:84%
But the story is that,
fortunately, he was saved.

00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Vishnu was saved from his
father when a little girl

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:52.120 align:middle line:84%
baby was substituted
to be killed instead.

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:53.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:57.800 align:middle line:84%
So let's not really
look for east or west.

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's begin to sort in terms
of partnership and dominator

00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:05.720 align:middle line:84%
traditions in our religious
and spiritual heritage.

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is really what I
want to emphasize with you.

00:44:11.110 --> 00:44:15.700 align:middle line:84%
We need to understand that
we have many partnership

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:19.180 align:middle line:84%
elements in society
already, thank goodness.

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:20.760 align:middle line:84%
There are many at
the core, the core

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.090 align:middle line:84%
of all the world
of spiritual things

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:29.030 align:middle line:84%
are the partnership values of
caring, nonviolence, empathy,

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:34.240 align:middle line:84%
and yes, of a spirituality that
inform our day-to-day lives.

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Because look, in
the dominator model,

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:41.760 align:middle line:84%
the best you can get from
spirituality is escape.

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:42.570 align:middle line:90%
So what do you do?

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:45.680 align:middle line:84%
You just escape from
this miserable reality,

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:48.510 align:middle line:84%
but you don't change anything,
because to try to change

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:51.320 align:middle line:90%
anything is too dangerous.

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:56.910 align:middle line:84%
In a partnership spirituality,
you embrace the opportunity

00:44:56.910 --> 00:45:00.010 align:middle line:84%
to transform not only
yourself, because

00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:02.180 align:middle line:84%
personal transformation,
I'll tell you,

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:04.050 align:middle line:84%
you can keep transforming
and transforming,

00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:07.430 align:middle line:84%
but it's like going
up on a down escalator

00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:10.970 align:middle line:84%
if you are in a
dominator environment.

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:15.510 align:middle line:84%
So we have to really look
at this interactive process.

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:18.970 align:middle line:84%
So we need to change
not only spirituality,

00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:22.270 align:middle line:84%
and this is really my
main message to you.

00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:25.300 align:middle line:84%
We need to change, well,
just about everything,

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:27.990 align:middle line:84%
and the good news is we don't
have to start from scratch.

00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Our families are beginning to
move more towards a partnership

00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:32.430 align:middle line:90%
direction.

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:34.610 align:middle line:84%
Lots of backlash,
but you see it.

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:36.700 align:middle line:84%
You see it in the
men who are beginning

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:40.890 align:middle line:84%
to do the fathering like the
mothering used to be done.

00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:42.530 align:middle line:84%
You see it in the
women who are also

00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:45.599 align:middle line:84%
rejecting these rigid
straitjackets of gender roles,

00:45:45.599 --> 00:45:47.390 align:middle line:84%
and who are becoming
more assertive instead

00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:48.570 align:middle line:90%
of manipulative.

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:50.800 align:middle line:84%
If you don't want to have
a manipulative relationship

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.990 align:middle line:84%
with someone, they
can't be disempowered,

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:55.610 align:middle line:84%
because when someone
is disempowered,

00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:57.120 align:middle line:90%
what else are they going to do?

00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:58.315 align:middle line:90%
They're going to manipulate.

00:45:58.315 --> 00:46:01.143 align:middle line:90%
It's a miserable way of living.

00:46:01.143 --> 00:46:03.430 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing the
tension everywhere.

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:07.220 align:middle line:84%
We happen to be in a period of
massive dominator regression,

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:09.125 align:middle line:84%
if you haven't
noticed, the widening

00:46:09.125 --> 00:46:11.410 align:middle line:84%
of the gap between
haves and have-nots,

00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:14.700 align:middle line:84%
the recent realization of
economic control, of media

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:16.276 align:middle line:90%
control.

00:46:16.276 --> 00:46:20.390 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, we're see
this very powerful partnership

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:22.550 align:middle line:84%
movement on the
grassroots level,

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:24.050 align:middle line:84%
and I'd like to
suggest to you, this

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:26.470 align:middle line:84%
is not a time to
give up and escape

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:29.450 align:middle line:84%
into an otherworldly
spirituality.

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:32.490 align:middle line:84%
It's a time for
spiritual courage,

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:38.180 align:middle line:84%
to change the institutions,
not just ourselves.

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And yes, to change the beliefs,
the myths, and the stories.

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:44.950 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things we've
got to change is education.

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:46.720 align:middle line:84%
My last book--
and unfortunately,

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:50.930 align:middle line:84%
they don't have any here-- is
called "Tomorrow's Children."

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's a book in which
I proposed a blueprint

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:59.430 align:middle line:84%
for partnership education
in the 21st century.

00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't forget about
that side trip I promised you

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:04.610 align:middle line:90%
into the biology of love.

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:09.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go there very
briefly right now, because see,

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:12.200 align:middle line:84%
let's look at how we teach
evolution, for example,

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:14.120 align:middle line:84%
because part of
partnership education

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:19.180 align:middle line:84%
is providing for young people
a more accurate, more complete,

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:23.590 align:middle line:84%
and yes, more hopeful picture
of what being human can mean.

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:26.180 align:middle line:84%
So kids will still learn
about natural selection,

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:28.660 align:middle line:84%
random variation,
but they would also

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:31.260 align:middle line:84%
learn about the new
scholarship that

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:36.740 align:middle line:84%
emphasizes cooperation, not
just competition in evolution.

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:38.820 align:middle line:84%
They would learn about
the new scholarship that

00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:43.590 align:middle line:84%
emphasizes, yes,
mother-child bonds as one

00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:47.240 align:middle line:84%
of the most important
aspects in evolution,

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:50.292 align:middle line:90%
in the evolution of love.

00:47:50.292 --> 00:47:53.410 align:middle line:84%
They would learn-- and
the absence of women

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:55.070 align:middle line:84%
is fascinating,
because you can see

00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:58.220 align:middle line:84%
that by having an absence
of women in these stories,

00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:02.930 align:middle line:84%
you also have an absence of the
caring, care-giving, nurturing,

00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:06.200 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes if I look
at some of these dioramas,

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:07.720 align:middle line:90%
it's like we weren't there.

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:09.030 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we weren't there.

00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Maybe men just did
parthenogensis or something.

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:14.800 align:middle line:90%
Well, we've got to change that.

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:19.340 align:middle line:84%
It has to be gender
balanced, not only for girls,

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:20.510 align:middle line:90%
but for boys.

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:24.030 align:middle line:84%
But consider that young people
through partnership education

00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:25.680 align:middle line:84%
would learn something
that we are today

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:29.910 align:middle line:84%
learning from neuroscience,
that by the grace of evolution,

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:35.010 align:middle line:84%
we humans receive biochemical
rewards of enormous pleasure.

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:36.450 align:middle line:90%
You've all experienced it.

00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:39.340 align:middle line:84%
Not only when we are
loved and cared for,

00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:42.160 align:middle line:84%
but when we love and
care for another,

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:46.910 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a child, a
lover, a friend, even a pet.

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:48.760 align:middle line:90%
That's part of our biology.

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:51.070 align:middle line:90%
That's part of our evolution.

00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:55.565 align:middle line:84%
So the biology of love is
a very-- in other words,

00:48:55.565 --> 00:48:58.680 align:middle line:84%
we need to put
back into education

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:02.030 align:middle line:84%
the missing pieces,
not only in biology,

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:03.640 align:middle line:90%
but in our cultural revolution.

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Not just in biological evolution
so that's a more balanced view,

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:09.360 align:middle line:90%
but also in cultural evolution.

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what a lot
of my work has been about.

00:49:13.070 --> 00:49:14.620 align:middle line:90%
So what can you do?

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:16.390 align:middle line:90%
Well, you can do a lot.

00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:19.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can participate
in every one of these things,

00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:20.430 align:middle line:90%
can't you?

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:23.360 align:middle line:84%
You can introduce partnership
education in your schools.

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:27.220 align:middle line:84%
You can begin to work on
really working together

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:30.030 align:middle line:84%
to transform the
social institutions,

00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:32.510 align:middle line:90%
not only focusing on yourself.

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And yes, one of the
things that you can

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:38.390 align:middle line:84%
do, and I really want to
end on that, and it's hard.

00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:43.070 align:middle line:84%
You can really begin to look
at your own religious and

00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:47.700 align:middle line:84%
spiritual traditions, and
begin to sort the partnership

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:52.280 align:middle line:84%
elements, the core elements,
those wonderful teachings

00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:56.110 align:middle line:84%
from this dominator overlay,
this encrustment that happened

00:49:56.110 --> 00:49:59.700 align:middle line:84%
during history that
was superimposed

00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:02.160 align:middle line:84%
on these true
spiritual teachings.

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Now that's very hard
to do, very hard.

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:07.090 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
hardest things to do.

00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:12.260 align:middle line:84%
We learned these stories, these
beliefs, this, quote, "reality"

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:17.840 align:middle line:84%
very early, and it's also loaded
with so much fear, isn't it?

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:19.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we think,
my gosh, if we're

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:22.360 align:middle line:84%
going to challenge some of
this, something terrible

00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:23.720 align:middle line:90%
will happen to us.

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.380 align:middle line:84%
We're not just going
to burn in hell

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:28.670 align:middle line:84%
for all eternity, which
is a long time when

00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:30.680 align:middle line:90%
you think about it.

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:33.720 align:middle line:90%
But it makes us scared.

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:36.180 align:middle line:84%
But if we understand that
all of these teachings

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:39.070 align:middle line:84%
were part of a system,
a system that we've

00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:42.320 align:middle line:84%
been trying to struggle
to leave behind,

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:46.390 align:middle line:84%
then we begin to see
something very interesting.

00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:50.760 align:middle line:84%
We begin to see that
we can, you and I

00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:55.915 align:middle line:84%
can begin to sort out
what we want to keep.

00:50:55.915 --> 00:50:57.930 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to
throw out everything.

00:50:57.930 --> 00:51:01.510 align:middle line:84%
We want to strengthen those
elements that will really

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:03.490 align:middle line:84%
serve us, and we
want to start leaving

00:51:03.490 --> 00:51:07.200 align:middle line:90%
behind those that will not.

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to even
suggest to you--

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:13.300 align:middle line:84%
and I will close on
this-- that not only love,

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:18.205 align:middle line:84%
but actually spirituality is
rooted in human evolution.

00:51:18.205 --> 00:51:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Not just human
evolution, in evolution.

00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:24.320 align:middle line:84%
Consider this yearning
for connection

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:27.950 align:middle line:84%
for oneness, which is really
at the core of so much

00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:30.160 align:middle line:90%
of the spiritual experience.

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's how the first
multi-celled organisms

00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:35.910 align:middle line:90%
formed, didn't they?

00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:37.950 align:middle line:90%
By connecting.

00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:41.030 align:middle line:84%
But when you get
to the human level,

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:45.590 align:middle line:84%
when you get to the level
of consciousness now,

00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:49.595 align:middle line:84%
something happens, something
very, very interesting happens.

00:51:49.595 --> 00:51:54.450 align:middle line:84%
You begin to see
that we are really

00:51:54.450 --> 00:51:59.390 align:middle line:84%
integrally interconnected,
not only with one another,

00:51:59.390 --> 00:52:05.430 align:middle line:84%
but with all that is so
incredible in this universe

00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:07.720 align:middle line:90%
into which we have been born.

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And we begin to see that the
mystery of the universe, we

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:19.930 align:middle line:84%
are part of this, and that
our yearning for oneness,

00:52:19.930 --> 00:52:24.860 align:middle line:84%
for caring connection
is really the impetus

00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:27.570 align:middle line:90%
behind spirituality.

00:52:27.570 --> 00:52:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to see that
if we understand literally

00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:38.430 align:middle line:84%
our interconnection, that
we cannot continue in this

00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:41.360 align:middle line:84%
dominator way, because
it's dangerous.

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:47.260 align:middle line:84%
It's dangerous not only to us,
but to all life on this planet.

00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So I feel very
passionately about this,

00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:52.620 align:middle line:84%
not only as a scholar
and educator, but as

00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:55.640 align:middle line:84%
a mother and
grandmother, that we

00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:58.390 align:middle line:84%
have to have the
spiritual courage-- yes,

00:52:58.390 --> 00:53:01.610 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual courage--
to also challenge

00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:07.550 align:middle line:84%
traditions of domination in
our own spiritual and religious

00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:10.950 align:middle line:84%
traditions, as well as
in all other traditions,

00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and consider that when we do,
we will be able to break free.

00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:21.640 align:middle line:84%
We will be able to break free
from the fetters of this system

00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:26.140 align:middle line:84%
that has literally suppressed
our inherent spirituality,

00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:28.890 align:middle line:84%
our inherent
capacity for oneness

00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:31.470 align:middle line:84%
with that which we
call the divine,

00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:34.180 align:middle line:84%
and that if we have
this spiritual courage,

00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:40.180 align:middle line:84%
we can open up a new area
in evolution, an era where

00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:45.510 align:middle line:84%
spirituality can inform our
lives right here on Earth,

00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:50.160 align:middle line:84%
an era that can help us
bring back not only the joy

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:54.760 align:middle line:84%
and pleasure to spirituality,
but to all aspects

00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:56.050 align:middle line:90%
of our lives.

00:53:56.050 --> 00:53:57.090 align:middle line:90%
I thank you.

00:53:57.090 --> 00:53:59.190 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:02.490 align:middle line:90%


00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:03.090 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:06.690 align:middle line:90%


00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:09.390 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:11.290 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:11.790 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:21.390 align:middle line:90%


00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:21.990 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:25.290 align:middle line:90%


00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:27.390 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:29.540 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:55.834 align:middle line:90%
