00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to House
of Well-Being.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.890 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the
kindness mindful audio.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.280 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the hypnosis will
begin, but before it does,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.310 align:middle line:84%
I'd just like to remind you that
the following audio contains

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.150 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic suggestions
that aim to help you reach

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.800 align:middle line:90%
a deep level of relaxation.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.910 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to the audio,

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.610 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.543 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:39.543 --> 00:00:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.490 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.878 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:49.878 --> 00:00:51.420 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.240 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.380 align:middle line:84%
relax, lie back, and let go, and
enjoy all the peaceful feelings

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.140 align:middle line:84%
and all the benefits
that come with it.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:07.980 align:middle line:90%


00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.530 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now
to make yourself

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.280 align:middle line:84%
as comfortable as
possible and listen

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.630 align:middle line:90%
to the sound of my voice.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.940 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And as you do so, you may be
aware of other sounds going on

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.630 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.900 align:middle line:84%
You know that they're
not important.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.650 align:middle line:84%
They don't matter at all,
and you can dismiss them out

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.660 align:middle line:84%
of your awareness and
focus your mind entirely

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.495 align:middle line:90%
on what I'm saying.

00:01:39.495 --> 00:01:42.620 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.910 align:middle line:84%
This is your time, and
you make the most of it.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.580 align:middle line:90%


00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.050 align:middle line:84%
No one needs or wants
anything from you at all.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.620 align:middle line:90%


00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to
take in a deep breath,

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.585 align:middle line:84%
filling your lungs as much as
you can, and let it out slowly.

00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:11.740 align:middle line:90%


00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And again take in a
long, slow breath.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.560 align:middle line:90%


00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready,
let it out slowly.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.480 align:middle line:90%


00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Now you can allow your
breathing to return to normal.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Gentle breaths in
and out, returning

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.920 align:middle line:84%
to your normal gentle
breathing pace.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.730 align:middle line:90%


00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now
to imagine yourself

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.920 align:middle line:84%
outside in your favorite
place in nature.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.240 align:middle line:90%


00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.860 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a peaceful
tropical beach,

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.700 align:middle line:84%
or it could be a
beautiful garden.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.990 align:middle line:90%


00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can
imagine lying back

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.730 align:middle line:84%
on a boat which is sailing
on a tranquil river.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.730 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't
matter where you are as

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.700 align:middle line:90%
long as it feels good to you.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.960 align:middle line:90%


00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.100 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful day.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:32.300 align:middle line:84%
The sky is a special
shade of blue, so clear,

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.460 align:middle line:90%
and it's a warm summer's day.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.200 align:middle line:90%


00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.000 align:middle line:84%
There's a breeze gently
blowing over you,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.110 align:middle line:84%
and the temperature is
just how you like it.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:53.320 align:middle line:90%


00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And in the sky is
a dazzling sun,

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.940 align:middle line:84%
so bright that you just
want to close your eyes

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.490 align:middle line:84%
and feel the glowing, healing
warmth of the sun on your body.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.470 align:middle line:90%


00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly you find
that you can direct that sun

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.260 align:middle line:90%
over and around your body.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And as you realize
this, you begin

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.575 align:middle line:84%
to direct the light from
the sun over your face.

00:04:25.575 --> 00:04:29.620 align:middle line:90%


00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.560 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the healing
warmth of the light

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.960 align:middle line:84%
from the sun over your face,
just relaxing those muscles

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.880 align:middle line:84%
around the eyes, around the
nose and mouth and your brow.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.480 align:middle line:90%


00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And as you do this, you find
that your facial muscles

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.340 align:middle line:84%
begin to flatten out
as they relax and you

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.990 align:middle line:90%
let go completely.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.410 align:middle line:90%


00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful day.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.540 align:middle line:84%
You move the light from the
sun into the throat area,

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.920 align:middle line:84%
feeling the warmth of the light
from the sun in your throat.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Relaxing all the muscles, just
letting go completely now.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.820 align:middle line:90%


00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And the warm sunlight now
moving into your shoulders

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and across your
shoulders, making them

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.530 align:middle line:84%
feel loose and limp
and comfortable

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.970 align:middle line:84%
as your shoulders sink into
the frame of your body.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:49.200 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And you feel so comfortable
now, so relaxed and at peace.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.720 align:middle line:90%


00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And you let nothing bother
or concern you at all.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.590 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And you direct the
light from the sun

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.730 align:middle line:84%
down your right arm
from the shoulders

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.600 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your fingers.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.060 align:middle line:84%
Your right arm begins
to relax and let go.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.020 align:middle line:90%


00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful feeling
to be here right now.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.470 align:middle line:90%


00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.720 align:middle line:84%
The warmth of the
light from the sun

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.860 align:middle line:84%
penetrates the nerves and bones
and muscles of that right arm.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:42.780 align:middle line:90%


00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.390 align:middle line:90%
And it's such a beautiful day.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:49.780 align:middle line:84%
You move the sun
over to your left arm

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and guide the light from the
sun down and up your left arm,

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.110 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your
shoulders all the way down

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.520 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your fingers.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.140 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:11.050 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the left arm
relaxing, becoming comfortably

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.860 align:middle line:90%
heavy and totally relaxed.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:20.300 align:middle line:90%


00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Now move that warm light
across and into the chest area,

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:31.456 align:middle line:84%
and relax the chest,
all the muscles there.

00:07:31.456 --> 00:07:34.192 align:middle line:90%


00:07:34.192 --> 00:07:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Now down to the stomach,
relaxing your tummy and down

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:42.285 align:middle line:84%
into your hips and your
thighs over to your right leg.

00:07:42.285 --> 00:07:46.090 align:middle line:90%


00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:51.080 align:middle line:84%
The light warms the muscles
as you relax your right leg.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.700 align:middle line:84%
Let it feel comfortable
and heavy now.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.610 align:middle line:90%


00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Now move the light
from the sun down

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.730 align:middle line:84%
your right leg, up and down
from the top of the hips

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:07.770 align:middle line:84%
to the tips of your toes
as the right leg relaxes

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:09.090 align:middle line:90%
and you let go.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:15.370 align:middle line:90%


00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.990 align:middle line:90%
And it's such a beautiful day.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:21.220 align:middle line:84%
You now move the light
into your left leg.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:26.950 align:middle line:84%
You move it up and down the left
leg from the top of the hips

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:28.690 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And your left leg relaxes,
releasing tension,

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.249 align:middle line:90%
letting go now completely.

00:08:36.249 --> 00:08:40.390 align:middle line:90%


00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Your whole body is now
totally and completely relaxed

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.960 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your
head all the way down

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.370 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:55.270 align:middle line:90%


00:08:55.270 --> 00:09:00.045 align:middle line:84%
And as your body relaxes,
your mind also relaxes.

00:09:00.045 --> 00:09:04.490 align:middle line:90%


00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And I want you now to
notice that the sun is

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:14.640 align:middle line:84%
setting, going down now,
deeper and deeper down.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And you're so deeply
relaxed but still

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.455 align:middle line:90%
completely alert and aware.

00:09:19.455 --> 00:09:22.420 align:middle line:90%


00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.720 align:middle line:84%
You resist the temptation
to fall asleep.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is thoroughly
relaxed, but you

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.780 align:middle line:90%
stay focused on these words.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:34.140 align:middle line:90%


00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.790 align:middle line:84%
So now I'd like you to
use your imagination,

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:42.200 align:middle line:84%
and once again you're in a
wonderful place in nature.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.770 align:middle line:84%
The trees are a
beautiful shade of green.

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.880 align:middle line:84%
It's a stunning day, and the
sun is shining down on you.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.310 align:middle line:90%


00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:57.150 align:middle line:84%
There's a soft and
gentle breeze in the air,

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:00.090 align:middle line:84%
making you feel pleasantly
relaxed and calm.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.570 align:middle line:90%


00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:07.800 align:middle line:84%
All around you can see trees
and plants and an array

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:13.100 align:middle line:84%
of the most beautiful
flowers you have ever seen,

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:90%
so colorful and vibrant.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And you can smell the rich
aroma of these flowers,

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:22.310 align:middle line:90%
making you feel so peaceful.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:26.620 align:middle line:90%


00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.470 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else matters right now.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.245 align:middle line:84%
You feel completely
at ease and so calm.

00:10:32.245 --> 00:10:35.270 align:middle line:90%


00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And in the distance, you
can hear the sound of water

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:40.310 align:middle line:90%
flowing slowly and gently.

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:44.170 align:middle line:90%


00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:47.690 align:middle line:84%
The sound of water is helping
you to go more and more deeply

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:48.490 align:middle line:90%
relaxed.

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:51.320 align:middle line:90%


00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.910 align:middle line:84%
You may feel your muscles
loosening more and more,

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.830 align:middle line:84%
relaxing with the beautiful
flowing sound of water.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:02.560 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Out of curiosity, you decide to
follow the sound of the water,

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.720 align:middle line:84%
and you feel excited about
where it's leading you,

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.610 align:middle line:84%
knowing deep within
yourself you're

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:19.110 align:middle line:84%
going into a very special
place, a place where you're

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.960 align:middle line:84%
going to create some
positive, wonderful,

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.265 align:middle line:90%
long-lasting changes.

00:11:23.265 --> 00:11:27.490 align:middle line:90%


00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:31.870 align:middle line:84%
As you walk slowly
towards the water,

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:36.850 align:middle line:84%
you can hear the sound of
birds singing in the trees.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:38.690 align:middle line:90%
You feel totally at ease.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:42.450 align:middle line:90%


00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.720 align:middle line:84%
As you finally
reach the lake, you

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:50.400 align:middle line:84%
realize it's the most beautiful
vision you've ever seen,

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.310 align:middle line:84%
and you're in awe of the
beauty that surrounds you.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:57.210 align:middle line:90%


00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:01.320 align:middle line:84%
The vast lake is filled
with a variety of colors,

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:06.870 align:middle line:84%
rich colors of blues,
turquoise, and light greens,

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:10.400 align:middle line:84%
and it fills your mind and
body with a wave of relaxation.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.280 align:middle line:90%


00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:17.090 align:middle line:84%
You may be becoming more relaxed
with each and every breath

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:25.350 align:middle line:84%
you take, feeling more calm,
more peaceful, and more

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:26.865 align:middle line:90%
relaxed than ever before.

00:12:26.865 --> 00:12:30.520 align:middle line:90%


00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.360 align:middle line:84%
Your mind may be
drifting in and out,

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:39.110 align:middle line:84%
just letting go deeper
and deeper still.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:44.030 align:middle line:84%
You may feel as though your
mind is flowing gently,

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:47.080 align:middle line:84%
flowing gently like the
lake in your imagination.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.640 align:middle line:90%


00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.940 align:middle line:84%
You look into the distance,
and you can see a wooden bridge

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.235 align:middle line:90%
leading over the lake.

00:12:55.235 --> 00:12:57.910 align:middle line:90%


00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.760 align:middle line:84%
You walk towards the bridge
feeling more and more

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.775 align:middle line:90%
deeply relaxed.

00:13:01.775 --> 00:13:04.280 align:middle line:90%


00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.140 align:middle line:84%
As you reach the
bridge, you can see

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:09.635 align:middle line:84%
there are 10 steps leading over
to the other side of the lake.

00:13:09.635 --> 00:13:13.750 align:middle line:90%


00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:17.480 align:middle line:84%
You slowly start
walking over the bridge,

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.220 align:middle line:90%
counting the steps in your mind.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.980 align:middle line:90%


00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:25.810 align:middle line:90%
10, 9.

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.580 align:middle line:90%
Deeper and deeper still.

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:33.080 align:middle line:90%


00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:38.450 align:middle line:84%
7, all the way down
to relaxation now.

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:48.490 align:middle line:84%
6, 5, and 4, drifting off
peacefully and easily.

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:51.990 align:middle line:90%
3, 2.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.980 align:middle line:84%
All the way down,
deeply relaxed.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.410 align:middle line:90%
And 1.

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:00.640 align:middle line:84%
You see a comfortable
padded chair,

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.930 align:middle line:84%
and you take a seat,
ready to embrace

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:08.160 align:middle line:84%
the changes to come in your
deep state of relaxation now.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.930 align:middle line:90%


00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Now that you're in a wonderfully
deep state of relaxation,

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.210 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to connect with
deeper and deeper feelings

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:27.130 align:middle line:84%
of kindness and
compassion whilst

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:30.310 align:middle line:84%
ensuring that you always
extend that same kindness

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:34.630 align:middle line:84%
towards yourself
so that you make

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:37.390 align:middle line:84%
sure you meet your
own needs in life

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.550 align:middle line:84%
as well as enriching
the lives of others.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:46.040 align:middle line:90%


00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:51.840 align:middle line:84%
You know that kindness
enriches people's well-being

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:56.270 align:middle line:84%
and helps make their
lives better and happier,

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:58.640 align:middle line:84%
and it's also the
social glue that

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.620 align:middle line:84%
allows us to connect
with others and build

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.380 align:middle line:84%
meaningful
relationships with them.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:07.920 align:middle line:90%


00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.100 align:middle line:84%
When someone does
something kind for us,

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.910 align:middle line:84%
we actually start
to like them more,

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:16.410 align:middle line:84%
and we want to cooperate
with them even more.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.420 align:middle line:84%
When we do something
kind for someone else,

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:21.390 align:middle line:84%
we earn that trust and
respect, and we feel better

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:26.140 align:middle line:84%
about ourselves for
being a good person too.

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.330 align:middle line:84%
So now I'd like you
to listen to the voice

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.770 align:middle line:84%
within you, the
voice where you're

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:33.705 align:middle line:84%
at your most
supportive and kind.

00:15:33.705 --> 00:15:36.660 align:middle line:90%


00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.570 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to take this voice
and those feelings with you.

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:42.390 align:middle line:90%


00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And in your mind now, you
drift right out of yourself

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:49.680 align:middle line:84%
and turn around and look
at the you over there,

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:56.200 align:middle line:84%
the one listening to this audio,
the you who wants to be kinder,

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.775 align:middle line:84%
and you can reflect
for a moment.

00:15:57.775 --> 00:16:02.620 align:middle line:90%


00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Reflect on the fact that
just as your breathing has

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:12.310 align:middle line:84%
a depth to it, a life to
it, a history to it, so too

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:15.790 align:middle line:84%
there is a depth to you,
that you over there,

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:20.200 align:middle line:84%
the whole full, complex
story of your life from when

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:24.100 align:middle line:84%
that you was a newborn baby
all the way up to today.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now
to really give that you

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:31.690 align:middle line:84%
over there the same kindness,
the same acknowledgment,

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:34.000 align:middle line:84%
same support that you would
give to a good friend.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.870 align:middle line:90%


00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:41.060 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to let
that you over there know

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.530 align:middle line:90%
that it's OK to be human.

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:43.820 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to be perfect.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.850 align:middle line:90%


00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:53.070 align:middle line:84%
As you look at that you over
there listening to this audio,

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:55.170 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to think
about giving that

00:16:55.170 --> 00:17:00.330 align:middle line:84%
you over that all the
kindness and self-acceptance

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.775 align:middle line:84%
that you so willingly
offer to others.

00:17:02.775 --> 00:17:06.089 align:middle line:90%


00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:12.150 align:middle line:84%
From now on in, you
soften your inner voice.

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:13.840 align:middle line:90%
You soften that inner critic.

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.630 align:middle line:90%


00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.730 align:middle line:84%
You practice
self-talk that sounds

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:20.395 align:middle line:90%
warm and friendly and kind.

00:17:20.395 --> 00:17:25.020 align:middle line:90%


00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.030 align:middle line:84%
You can allow your
inner voice to take

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:29.475 align:middle line:84%
on the tone of a
supportive friend or coach.

00:17:29.475 --> 00:17:33.310 align:middle line:90%


00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:37.450 align:middle line:84%
If you catch yourself sounding
harsh, you take a pause

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and change the tone back
to being warm and kind,

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.820 align:middle line:84%
just as you would when
talking to someone else.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:48.690 align:middle line:90%


00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:52.970 align:middle line:84%
You make sure that your
inner monologue is positive,

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:55.190 align:middle line:84%
staying well away
from negativity.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:18:01.770 align:middle line:90%


00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:08.430 align:middle line:84%
You also start to do things
now that nourish you daily,

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:13.660 align:middle line:84%
things that recharge you,
rejuvenate you, light you up,

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.690 align:middle line:84%
bring your mood up,
and feed your soul.

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:19.120 align:middle line:90%


00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:23.080 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you take some time
out to do more exercise,

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.360 align:middle line:90%
read a book, or enjoy a hobby.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.960 align:middle line:84%
It may be just 15 minutes
out of your whole day,

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.410 align:middle line:84%
but you ensure that you put
yourself first every day.

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:36.380 align:middle line:90%


00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.210 align:middle line:84%
You know how being
kind to yourself

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:42.020 align:middle line:84%
is a start to also being kind
to others, so from now on you

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.145 align:middle line:90%
put yourself first.

00:18:43.145 --> 00:18:48.680 align:middle line:90%


00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.230 align:middle line:84%
You no longer need a
reason to be kind to people

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.590 align:middle line:84%
as you now inspire people
to be kind to themselves,

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.450 align:middle line:90%
forgiving any imperfection.

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:59.720 align:middle line:90%


00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:03.040 align:middle line:84%
You enjoy doing random acts
of kindness for others.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:07.950 align:middle line:90%


00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:09.390 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's something small.

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:13.110 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you smile more
to make someone's day.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you write
something kind to someone

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:18.430 align:middle line:90%
or give a genuine compliment.

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:20.860 align:middle line:84%
Help someone out
in a practical way.

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Be kind to a stranger or
give your time to someone.

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it may be, you
know that those small acts

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:33.100 align:middle line:84%
of kindness make a huge
difference in someone's life.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And in turn, that
makes you happy too.

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:40.440 align:middle line:90%


00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And this growing
kindness not only

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:49.240 align:middle line:84%
helps you understand other
people more deeply, always

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.090 align:middle line:84%
seeing what pain and suffering
may be going on behind closed

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:58.710 align:middle line:84%
doors, but you also see that
beauty and their potential

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:01.260 align:middle line:84%
and now genuinely wish
someone well and hope

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.720 align:middle line:90%
they find their happiness.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:08.480 align:middle line:90%


00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:12.120 align:middle line:84%
It also helps you to
act in different ways,

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:16.320 align:middle line:84%
to plan ahead for a special
gift or a surprise you can give

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:23.040 align:middle line:84%
someone to take the time
to talk or to help someone

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.330 align:middle line:90%
who's particularly quiet.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you help bring
them out of their shell--

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.630 align:middle line:84%
to give to someone who's
in need and to continue

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:38.110 align:middle line:84%
to show that same respect
and kindness towards yourself

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:39.850 align:middle line:84%
because you don't
add to the world

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:43.150 align:middle line:84%
by burning yourself
out, trying to help

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.310 align:middle line:84%
every human being on
the planet when you need

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:48.640 align:middle line:84%
to live a life that
brings you happiness,

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:53.090 align:middle line:84%
that brings kindness and
compassion into your own life

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:57.370 align:middle line:84%
so that you have the well-being
and brightness of spirit

00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.780 align:middle line:84%
to be able to share this warmth
and compassion with others.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:04.400 align:middle line:90%


00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:08.510 align:middle line:84%
You know that kindness has many
benefits, including increased

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:10.055 align:middle line:90%
happiness and a healthy heart.

00:21:10.055 --> 00:21:12.970 align:middle line:90%


00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:15.460 align:middle line:84%
It also slows down
the aging process

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:19.300 align:middle line:84%
and improves relationships
and connections, which again

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.120 align:middle line:90%
indirectly boosts your health.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.940 align:middle line:90%


00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:28.160 align:middle line:90%
Kindness is a choice.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:32.150 align:middle line:84%
The more conditioned we are
to respond with kindness,

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:35.700 align:middle line:84%
the more natural it
becomes, and it's

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:39.000 align:middle line:84%
becoming more and more
natural to you day by day now.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.510 align:middle line:90%


00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:45.550 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:48.340 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind,

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.110 align:middle line:84%
and they'll become
more and more powerful

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:51.670 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:55.040 align:middle line:90%


00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from one to five

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.660 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of five, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.960 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling
fantastic, bringing back

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.780 align:middle line:84%
with you all the
wonderful new feelings.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:16.270 align:middle line:84%
So coming back now
with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:18.990 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:middle line:90%
