00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.140 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>> You are listening to the
insecurity mind talk audio.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.260 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.750 align:middle line:84%
But before it does, I
just like to remind you

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.610 align:middle line:84%
that the following
audio contains

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.150 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic suggestions
helping you to reach

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.370 align:middle line:90%
a deep level of relaxation.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.980 align:middle line:84%
So, please, be
sure that wherever

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.780 align:middle line:84%
you're listening to
this audio, you're

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.010 align:middle line:84%
in a safe and comfortable place,
free from distractions where

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.950 align:middle line:90%
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Please, don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.270 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.840 align:middle line:84%
will alert you and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.660 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.010 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
and close your eyes,

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.370 align:middle line:84%
relax, lie back, and
let go, and really

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.990 align:middle line:84%
enjoy these peaceful feelings
and all the benefits that

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.790 align:middle line:90%
come with it.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.290 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.970 align:middle line:84%
In this deep and special
sleep, your subconscious mind

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.540 align:middle line:84%
for your safe keeping
monitors everything

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.910 align:middle line:84%
that's happening around
you, so these suggestions,

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.700 align:middle line:84%
because they're
for your benefit,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.570 align:middle line:84%
go directly to your subconscious
mind where they're accepted.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And these thoughts become
established, firmly fixed

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:43.330 align:middle line:84%
deeply in your
inner mind, embedded

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.160 align:middle line:84%
so these suggestions remain
with you long after you open

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.900 align:middle line:84%
your eyes, helping you to
change those things you want

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.850 align:middle line:90%
to change for your own sake.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And these new thoughts
help you begin to change

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.725 align:middle line:90%
the things you want to change.

00:02:03.725 --> 00:02:06.560 align:middle line:90%


00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And these changes allow you to
enjoy your life more and more.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.410 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And I want you now to
imagine that you're

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.085 align:middle line:84%
checking your body to ensure
you become totally relaxed.

00:02:21.085 --> 00:02:23.740 align:middle line:90%


00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.795 align:middle line:84%
As your muscles relax, just
let your mind relax also.

00:02:28.795 --> 00:02:31.570 align:middle line:90%


00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Beginning with your
feet, feel your toes,

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.630 align:middle line:84%
stretch them and feel
the texture of what

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.010 align:middle line:90%
your feet are resting on.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.780 align:middle line:90%


00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.375 align:middle line:84%
And now, begin to
tighten your calves.

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:51.220 align:middle line:90%


00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.610 align:middle line:90%
And allow them to relax now.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.360 align:middle line:90%


00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Allow that relaxation to
spread past your ankles,

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.320 align:middle line:84%
up your calves through
the back of your knees,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and feel those muscles
easing, resting comfortably.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.480 align:middle line:90%


00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, the large muscles of
your thighs, pull them tight.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.090 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.565 align:middle line:84%
Be aware of those
large muscles tensing.

00:03:32.565 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.110 align:middle line:90%
And now, relax those muscles.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Feel them lengthen and
resting comfortably.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.850 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.850 --> 00:04:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Feel your legs as they sink even
deeper as you relax even more,

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.035 align:middle line:84%
and notice how rhythmic
your breathing is becoming.

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:07.280 align:middle line:90%


00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, your stomach muscles,
pull them together gently.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.220 align:middle line:90%


00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.149 align:middle line:84%
And now, let them expand
and relax comfortably.

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:23.600 align:middle line:90%


00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Your shoulders and back
muscles, flex your shoulders.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.870 align:middle line:84%
Feel those muscles
pull across your back.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.480 align:middle line:90%


00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And now, let your
shoulder slouch

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.690 align:middle line:84%
as you relax the
muscles, and notice

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.190 align:middle line:84%
how your spine sinks
deeper into your chair

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.500 align:middle line:90%
as you relax even more deeply.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.190 align:middle line:90%


00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And notice how easy and regular
your breathing has become.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.340 align:middle line:90%


00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, your fingertips
and fingers.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.995 align:middle line:84%
Clench them now,
feel the tension.

00:05:14.995 --> 00:05:18.300 align:middle line:90%


00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.220 align:middle line:90%
And now, allow them to relax.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.540 align:middle line:90%


00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Allow the relaxation to spread
up your arms all the way up

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:31.610 align:middle line:90%
to your neck.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.820 align:middle line:90%


00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And make sure your neck is
comfortable with your head

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.000 align:middle line:90%
in an easy position.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.620 align:middle line:90%


00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.385 align:middle line:90%
Tighten up your neck muscles.

00:05:46.385 --> 00:05:49.480 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, let those
columns of muscles

00:05:51.730 --> 00:06:00.860 align:middle line:84%
loosen as the muscles relax
and you allow your neck

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.595 align:middle line:84%
to sink into the cushions
into a comfortable position.

00:06:04.595 --> 00:06:09.120 align:middle line:90%


00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Your facial muscles are flat
and stretched comfortably

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.620 align:middle line:90%
across your face.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.400 align:middle line:90%
Squeeze up your face.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.670 align:middle line:90%
Feel the tension.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And now, relax those
muscles and feel them

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.880 align:middle line:90%
in lengthening and softening.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.550 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.790 align:middle line:90%
Relaxing more than ever before.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:39.370 align:middle line:90%


00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.430 align:middle line:84%
You can now feel the air
temperature against your skin,

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.140 align:middle line:84%
and it feels smooth
and comfortable.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.150 align:middle line:90%


00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And now, you can
allow the relaxation

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.020 align:middle line:84%
to spread onto your scalp,
knowing that you relaxed

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:03.200 align:middle line:84%
throughout your body
from the top of your head

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.865 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:07:04.865 --> 00:07:09.530 align:middle line:90%


00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:17.513 align:middle line:84%
Your body is now loose and
limp, and heavy and relaxed.

00:07:17.513 --> 00:07:22.680 align:middle line:90%


00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Notice how your body
is sinking deeper

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.880 align:middle line:84%
into relaxation
as your breathing

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.085 align:middle line:90%
becomes more regular and easy.

00:07:34.085 --> 00:07:38.530 align:middle line:90%


00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'll
count slowly from 1 to 10.

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And with each number you
drift deeper and deeper

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.460 align:middle line:90%
into peaceful relaxation.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.650 align:middle line:90%


00:07:52.650 --> 00:08:21.110 align:middle line:84%
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, and 10.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.170 align:middle line:90%
Now, feeling deeply relaxed.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.250 align:middle line:90%


00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And you find it easy to
focus your attention.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.905 align:middle line:84%
And you imagine
things very clearly.

00:08:33.905 --> 00:08:36.860 align:middle line:90%


00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.480 align:middle line:84%
I want you to
imagine that you're

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.659 align:middle line:84%
standing on a balcony which
has steps leading down

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:42.979 align:middle line:90%
to a beautiful garden.

00:08:42.979 --> 00:08:46.170 align:middle line:90%


00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And as you look
into that garden,

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:53.120 align:middle line:84%
you see it surrounded
with lovely trees,

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.975 align:middle line:84%
ensuring the garden is private,
secluded, and peaceful.

00:08:57.975 --> 00:09:01.720 align:middle line:90%


00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:07.060 align:middle line:84%
There are flower beds
set in the lovely lawn.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:12.685 align:middle line:84%
And further along is a
waterfall flowing into a stream.

00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:16.840 align:middle line:90%


00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:21.430 align:middle line:84%
You listen to the
sound of the water.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:27.360 align:middle line:84%
As you look around
you, you see the trees,

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:33.930 align:middle line:84%
and you hear a faint sound of
a bird in the distance adding

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:38.250 align:middle line:84%
to the feeling of
deep relaxation

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.140 align:middle line:90%
through your entire being.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:45.380 align:middle line:90%


00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.800 align:middle line:84%
If you look more
closely, you'll see

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.360 align:middle line:84%
that there are five steps
leading down to the garden,

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.380 align:middle line:84%
and then a small path that
leads to the waterfall.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.990 align:middle line:90%


00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, we'll
walk down the steps.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And with each step, you
go deeper and deeper

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:10.860 align:middle line:90%
into relaxation.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.100 align:middle line:90%


00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.380 align:middle line:90%
So let's begin.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.740 align:middle line:84%
As you put your foot
on the first step,

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:25.570 align:middle line:84%
you feel yourself going
deeper into relaxation.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Down onto the
second step, as you

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.740 align:middle line:84%
feel your foot firmly
placed onto the step,

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:37.240 align:middle line:84%
you feel a wonderful relief
as you drift even deeper

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.680 align:middle line:90%
into relaxation now.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.440 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Down onto the third step,
feeling wonderfully free

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.900 align:middle line:90%
and so, so relaxed.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:55.730 align:middle line:84%
As your foot reaches
for the fourth step,

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:59.710 align:middle line:84%
another wave of relaxation
drifts through your whole body.

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:02.260 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:07.600 align:middle line:84%
Down onto the fifth step
now, feeling even more deeply

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.360 align:middle line:90%
relaxed than ever before.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.400 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And now, as you find yourself
standing on the lawn,

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:21.650 align:middle line:84%
you see a little way
ahead a waterfall.

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.500 align:middle line:90%


00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And you listen to the water
as it gently splashes.

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:30.560 align:middle line:90%


00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:35.060 align:middle line:84%
You can notice the birds
singing in the distance

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:39.810 align:middle line:84%
and the sound of the
trees gently swing.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And a little to the side is
a comfortable garden bench.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:47.520 align:middle line:90%


00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.410 align:middle line:84%
You notice the
color of the bench.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:53.440 align:middle line:90%


00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'd like
you to walk over to the bench

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:00.750 align:middle line:90%
and sit down on the bench.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And now, you sit down
and you're surprised

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:05.400 align:middle line:90%
at just how comfortable it is.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.310 align:middle line:90%


00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.056 align:middle line:84%
And then, you're
even more relaxed.

00:12:10.056 --> 00:12:15.100 align:middle line:90%


00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:19.510 align:middle line:84%
As you sit down on the bench,
you take a deep breath.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe out, you
feel a wave of relaxation

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:28.120 align:middle line:84%
go through your
whole body, relaxing

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:33.050 align:middle line:90%
every muscle, every nerve.

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:38.460 align:middle line:84%
As you breathe in, you
breathe in positive thoughts.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe out, you
breathe out negative thoughts,

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:48.510 align:middle line:84%
leaving room for more positive
thoughts on this journey ahead.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:53.190 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Recently, or maybe
for some time,

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:59.640 align:middle line:84%
you've been
experiencing feelings

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:04.290 align:middle line:84%
that made you feel
insecure about yourself.

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And these feelings have made
you feel less fulfilled than you

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.080 align:middle line:90%
should be.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's having an impact
on the way you behave,

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.355 align:middle line:84%
the way you feel, and
the way you look at life.

00:13:18.355 --> 00:13:22.950 align:middle line:90%


00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:27.880 align:middle line:84%
But soon, much sooner
than you think,

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.710 align:middle line:84%
you're going to push aside
those negative feelings

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:35.410 align:middle line:84%
and instead you'll
start to accept yourself

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.780 align:middle line:90%
for who you are.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And you'll become
comfortable with who

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.520 align:middle line:90%
you are as a unique individual.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.010 align:middle line:90%


00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:48.890 align:middle line:84%
I wonder, now, if you can
look back in your life

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:51.380 align:middle line:84%
and take a moment
to look back, make

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.065 align:middle line:84%
a note of all the good and
bad decisions you've made.

00:13:54.065 --> 00:13:57.840 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:02.190 align:middle line:84%
Take a moment to think
about those decisions

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:07.770 align:middle line:84%
and see how they shaped
you, and who you've become,

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.590 align:middle line:84%
and who you may be
developing into because

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:11.970 align:middle line:90%
of those decisions.

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:17.380 align:middle line:90%


00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:23.020 align:middle line:84%
You know that you can learn
from any mistakes you've made,

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:27.540 align:middle line:84%
and you know that you
can help yourself.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Those mistakes can help to
empower yourself to enhance

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.140 align:middle line:90%
your own self acceptance.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:40.610 align:middle line:90%


00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:44.950 align:middle line:84%
As you look back
at those decisions,

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.230 align:middle line:84%
you have to think
about how life would

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:53.000 align:middle line:84%
be different if you had
confidence in yourself,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.690 align:middle line:84%
self-assurance, no
more insecurity.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:04.640 align:middle line:84%
If you are able to truly believe
in yourself and know that you

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:14.090 align:middle line:84%
are enough, you know that
everyone has their faults,

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:17.682 align:middle line:84%
but not everyone feels
that level of insecurity

00:15:17.682 --> 00:15:18.515 align:middle line:90%
that you're feeling.

00:15:18.515 --> 00:15:22.370 align:middle line:90%


00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:27.680 align:middle line:84%
You know that other people
put others faults aside,

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:32.670 align:middle line:84%
and people put their own
faults aside and move on.

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:37.920 align:middle line:84%
They learned from them and
recognize that they are enough.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.270 align:middle line:90%
And you are enough.

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:44.000 align:middle line:90%


00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.390 align:middle line:84%
When you're feeling
insecure, you may well

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:52.280 align:middle line:90%
doubt yourself or others.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And you may find
it hard to trust

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:56.620 align:middle line:90%
the person closest to you.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:00.640 align:middle line:90%


00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And this can mean making
relationships or friendships is

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:07.780 align:middle line:84%
very difficult, which
then, of course,

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.530 align:middle line:84%
leads back around
to more insecurity.

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:15.090 align:middle line:90%


00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:19.280 align:middle line:84%
So let's work on producing
and completely eliminating

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:25.360 align:middle line:84%
this insecurity for you
are your own unique person.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:30.200 align:middle line:84%
You have your own strengths
unlike anyone else.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And you appreciate all the
qualities that you have.

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:35.615 align:middle line:90%
You are enough.

00:16:35.615 --> 00:16:38.910 align:middle line:90%


00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:42.540 align:middle line:84%
So as you settle
deeper into hypnosis,

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:46.650 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to use your
creative imagination

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:49.430 align:middle line:84%
to visualize the
scenes I describe now.

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:53.720 align:middle line:90%


00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.240 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to
go back to a time

00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:01.630 align:middle line:84%
when you made a decision
because of your insecurity.

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:05.770 align:middle line:84%
This may have been
turning down a job offer,

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:08.020 align:middle line:84%
choosing the wrong
type of partner,

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.660 align:middle line:84%
or simply not attending
a social event.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:14.140 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:19.630 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you, now, to see
yourself as a new, confident,

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:23.710 align:middle line:90%
happy, and assertive person.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at
your body language,

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:30.780 align:middle line:84%
the way you're standing, the
way you're holding yourself.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.620 align:middle line:90%


00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:37.520 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to step
into that confident person

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:42.240 align:middle line:84%
and feel what you feel as
this new confident person,

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:46.632 align:middle line:84%
excitement,
self-assurance, confidence.

00:17:46.632 --> 00:17:49.740 align:middle line:90%


00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And you hear everything
that's being said internally.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.600 align:middle line:84%
The confident you has
very different thoughts

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.430 align:middle line:90%
and you can hear them.

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:03.730 align:middle line:84%
You can feel them
and you like it.

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:07.660 align:middle line:84%
You absorb the respect
that you give yourself when

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:11.250 align:middle line:90%
you talk to yourself like this.

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:14.700 align:middle line:90%
There's no negativity.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.935 align:middle line:84%
Simply positivity,
and it feeds itself.

00:18:17.935 --> 00:18:20.640 align:middle line:90%


00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.570 align:middle line:84%
The more you flood your
mind with positivity,

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:29.010 align:middle line:84%
the more confident you feel,
and you feel it taking over you.

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:31.900 align:middle line:90%


00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:35.710 align:middle line:84%
You see yourself in
this new confident self,

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:38.590 align:middle line:84%
and you relive again
that one decision

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:42.520 align:middle line:90%
you had in mind a moment ago.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.820 align:middle line:84%
See yourself as this
confident version of yourself

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:49.240 align:middle line:84%
choosing a very different
path, and making

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.055 align:middle line:84%
a different decision,
and it feels great.

00:18:52.055 --> 00:18:57.050 align:middle line:90%


00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:59.990 align:middle line:84%
See yourself, now,
in a situation

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:07.190 align:middle line:84%
you may have coming up in the
future, an interview, a party,

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:09.830 align:middle line:84%
a social occasion,
whatever it may be.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:12.470 align:middle line:90%


00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Visualize yourself
there and you're

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:19.520 align:middle line:84%
in the new confident
version of yourself.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.720 align:middle line:84%
You're feeding your mind with
positive, confident things,

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.630 align:middle line:84%
and it shows in
your body language.

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And you're fun and
exciting to be around.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:35.380 align:middle line:90%
You are interesting and valued.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:39.340 align:middle line:84%
You value yourself, and
so others value you to.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:43.870 align:middle line:90%


00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:48.190 align:middle line:84%
From now on, whenever you find
yourself thinking negatively

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:52.280 align:middle line:84%
about yourself, you
stop yourself straight

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:56.690 align:middle line:84%
away as you know that your
mind body reacts to this.

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:59.400 align:middle line:90%


00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.620 align:middle line:84%
You stop yourself and you
instantly say to yourself,

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:03.420 align:middle line:90%
I am enough.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:07.600 align:middle line:90%


00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.580 align:middle line:90%
You repeat it five times.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.450 align:middle line:84%
If he can repeat it out
loud, then even better.

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:15.920 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.530 align:middle line:84%
You write it on notes
all over your home

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:21.800 align:middle line:84%
and you allow yourself
to truly believe it.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.170 align:middle line:90%
You are enough.

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.510 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what
happened in the past

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:33.680 align:middle line:84%
to make you so insecure, you
don't need to dwell on that.

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:39.080 align:middle line:84%
This is your time to
change, to take control,

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.995 align:middle line:84%
to change those thinking
patterns, and to start afresh.

00:20:42.995 --> 00:20:50.460 align:middle line:90%


00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:55.290 align:middle line:84%
You, now, give yourself the
self-respect that you deserve,

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:58.860 align:middle line:84%
and you thrive on those
feelings of confidence

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.370 align:middle line:84%
as they grow and
grow within you.

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:05.610 align:middle line:90%


00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And when you return
to the here and now,

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.370 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that
you really do have

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:15.120 align:middle line:84%
all the resources you
need, and you use them

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.130 align:middle line:90%
whenever you need or want to.

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:20.370 align:middle line:90%


00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:24.300 align:middle line:84%
You're excited about the
changes that will take place,

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.705 align:middle line:84%
and you're excited to see them
grow because you are enough.

00:21:27.705 --> 00:21:34.390 align:middle line:90%


00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:36.610 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:39.670 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:41.830 align:middle line:84%
and will get more
and more powerful

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:45.320 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from 1 to 5

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.880 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of five you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:57.530 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling
fantastic, bringing back

00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:59.420 align:middle line:84%
with you all the
wonderful new feelings.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:07.220 align:middle line:84%
So coming back now,
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:09.020 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:12.070 align:middle line:90%
