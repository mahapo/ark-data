[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to the
House of Wellbeing.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.980 align:middle line:84%
You are listening to the
Confidence hypnotherapy audio.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.530 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.570 align:middle line:84%
But before it does,
I'd like to remind you

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.250 align:middle line:84%
that the following
audio contains

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.880 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic suggestions
that help you to reach

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.380 align:middle line:90%
a deep level of relaxation.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.580 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.950 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.480 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.003 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:45.170 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.510 align:middle line:84%
will alert you and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.230 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.310 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.760 align:middle line:84%
relax, lie back, and
let go, and really enjoy

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.150 align:middle line:84%
those peaceful feelings and all
the benefits that come with it.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Make yourself as
comfortable as possible

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.365 align:middle line:84%
and concentrate on
the sound of my voice.

00:01:07.365 --> 00:01:10.070 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And begin by drawing in
a long, slow, deep breath

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.360 align:middle line:90%
in through your nose.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.390 align:middle line:90%
Hold the breath for a moment.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And now slightly open your
mouth and release all the air

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.380 align:middle line:84%
from your body in a
long, low, deep sigh,

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.580 align:middle line:84%
and relax, allowing your
lungs to naturally deflate

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.050 align:middle line:84%
as your body sinks into
gentle relaxation now.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.470 align:middle line:90%


00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.640 align:middle line:90%
And you can release any tension.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Relax and let go as I
guide you through a journey

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:02.630 align:middle line:84%
of relaxation, a journey that
you will find very beneficial

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.220 align:middle line:90%
for your overall well-being.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.650 align:middle line:90%


00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.530 align:middle line:84%
You're going to start
this calming experience

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.720 align:middle line:84%
by first relaxing your
whole body-mind system.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.470 align:middle line:90%


00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's true to say that the
simple act of relaxing the body

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:28.180 align:middle line:84%
and mind has a positive knock-on
effect, because how you think

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.780 align:middle line:84%
determines how you
feel, and how you feel

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.780 align:middle line:90%
influences the world around you.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And how you choose
to think today

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.750 align:middle line:84%
affects your decisions
from here on in.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.390 align:middle line:84%
So to make my
assurances your reality,

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.410 align:middle line:84%
let's begin by
focusing your attention

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.800 align:middle line:90%
at the very top of your head.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Tension often starts at
the scalp and the neck.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.910 align:middle line:84%
So mentally and physically,
allow all the muscles

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.560 align:middle line:84%
around the top of your
head to relax now,

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.205 align:middle line:84%
letting all the tension
simply dissolve.

00:03:14.205 --> 00:03:17.430 align:middle line:90%


00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:25.700 align:middle line:84%
As you start to tune into
your body-mind system,

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:32.200 align:middle line:84%
just let any tension you may
be holding to release now.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.400 align:middle line:84%
Allow your brain to relax,
the left and the right

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.350 align:middle line:84%
lobes of the brain
just releasing.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Such a simple thought, yet so
profound and so significant.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.850 align:middle line:90%
Just letting go completely.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.780 align:middle line:90%


00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Drifting further
and further down,

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.100 align:middle line:84%
nobody wanting anything,
nobody needing anything.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.810 align:middle line:90%
This is your time to relax.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.550 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Taking the relaxation
into the face

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:14.210 align:middle line:84%
now, allowing all of your
facial muscles to feel loose.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:20.269 align:middle line:84%
Feel your brow relaxing,
your forehead smoothing out,

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.095 align:middle line:90%
the back of your eyes relaxing.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.920 align:middle line:90%


00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Tiny muscles around your
eyes and diet's eyelids,

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.430 align:middle line:84%
down into your cheeks and
into your jaw muscles,

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.370 align:middle line:90%
just releasing and letting go.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.400 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Allowing your
tongue to fall away

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.680 align:middle line:90%
from the roof of your mouth.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And should you find you need
to swallow, just do that

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.560 align:middle line:84%
now and drift down and
down, deeper and deeper

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.590 align:middle line:90%
into blissful relaxation.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.240 align:middle line:90%


00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.970 align:middle line:84%
The more you physically
relax, the more

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.210 align:middle line:90%
you can mentally relax.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And when you can
mentally relax, you

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.270 align:middle line:90%
can think much more clearly.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And when you think more clearly,
your life becomes clearer,

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.370 align:middle line:84%
you make better decisions,
and you're much more

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.645 align:middle line:90%
in control of your days.

00:05:22.645 --> 00:05:26.600 align:middle line:90%


00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.470 align:middle line:84%
So noticing now how
your neck feels,

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:37.250 align:middle line:84%
relaxing all the little muscles,
letting go of the strain,

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.420 align:middle line:90%
letting go of the tension.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.540 align:middle line:90%


00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.152 align:middle line:84%
Allow that tension that you
may be holding in your shoulder

00:05:46.152 --> 00:05:49.380 align:middle line:90%
to go now.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.510 align:middle line:84%
Feel those shoulders,
both of them,

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.060 align:middle line:84%
sinking into the
frame of your body.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Feel your neck lengthen
as you do this.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.770 align:middle line:90%


00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Feel or imagine all your
cares and worries just

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.890 align:middle line:84%
rolling off your shoulders now
as you take the relaxation down

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:17.080 align:middle line:84%
now into the tops of your
arms, letting any tension you

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.270 align:middle line:90%
may be holding just drain away.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.900 align:middle line:90%


00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And as your awareness floats
down through your upper arms,

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:33.260 align:middle line:84%
into your elbows, all the
muscles in your forearms

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:41.000 align:middle line:84%
relax, right down to your
wrists and into your hands,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.715 align:middle line:84%
and way down into the very tips
of your fingers and thumbs.

00:06:44.715 --> 00:06:48.720 align:middle line:90%


00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.380 align:middle line:90%
Your arms are feeling so heavy.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.140 align:middle line:90%
Your body's so comfortable.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.350 align:middle line:90%


00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.860 align:middle line:84%
Nothing whatsoever
to do but just

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.210 align:middle line:84%
relax and enjoy this feeling
of total release now.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:11.520 align:middle line:90%


00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.320 align:middle line:84%
As you let go of all the
tension in those muscles,

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:22.560 align:middle line:84%
you may experience them becoming
calmer and gently releasing.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.590 align:middle line:90%


00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And just tune into the
feeling of simply letting go.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.100 align:middle line:90%


00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.700 align:middle line:84%
As you become aware
of your breathing,

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:43.980 align:middle line:84%
notice that you are now
breathing steadily and slowly,

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.690 align:middle line:90%
rhythmically.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And with each exhale,
you feel yourself

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:55.030 align:middle line:84%
just relaxing even
more deeply, allowing

00:07:55.030 --> 00:08:00.600 align:middle line:84%
any tension in the chest area
now to simply drain away,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.170 align:middle line:84%
letting go completely
and totally.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:07.040 align:middle line:90%


00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.960 align:middle line:84%
Bring awareness
into your stomach

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:16.310 align:middle line:84%
now and let all your
stomach muscles relax.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And as you do, I
want you to imagine

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.060 align:middle line:84%
a ball of sunlight passing
down from the top of your head

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:27.770 align:middle line:84%
down through your face, your
throat, and into your stomach.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:31.760 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Visualize this healing
energy passing down

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:39.789 align:middle line:84%
through your throat and
chest and into your stomach.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:43.730 align:middle line:90%


00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:51.110 align:middle line:84%
So see and feel the sunlight
swirling and rotating.

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And as the light glows, it
warms and soothes and heals,

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:03.980 align:middle line:84%
and you release and relax and
drift down and further down.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:08.710 align:middle line:90%


00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And in your imagination,
you send the sunlight out

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:18.230 align:middle line:84%
now to every nerve cell,
bone, muscle, fiber,

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:21.750 align:middle line:90%
and system of the body.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.635 align:middle line:84%
See it flowing through
the bloodstream

00:09:24.635 --> 00:09:27.955 align:middle line:90%
and leave the light there.

00:09:27.955 --> 00:09:31.950 align:middle line:90%
It knows what to do.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:37.470 align:middle line:84%
As you take the relaxation
round into your back muscles,

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:41.130 align:middle line:84%
and from your back muscles
it relaxes those muscles

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.860 align:middle line:90%
either side of the spine.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Releasing, relaxing,
and just letting go now.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:54.110 align:middle line:90%
Deeper and deeper now.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:58.970 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.580 align:middle line:84%
As you relax your
waist and the muscles

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:07.880 align:middle line:84%
of your lower stomach and
down into the pelvic area, all

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.810 align:middle line:84%
the way down through
the large thigh muscles,

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.860 align:middle line:84%
down through your knees,
your shins, and your calves.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:19.160 align:middle line:90%


00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Just allow all those areas of
the body to relax and let go.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:30.620 align:middle line:90%


00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:35.931 align:middle line:84%
You're so relaxed, so
heavy, so comfortable.

00:10:35.931 --> 00:10:38.760 align:middle line:90%


00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And now tune into that
comfortable feeling

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:49.910 align:middle line:84%
as you think on down to
your ankles, into your feet,

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.570 align:middle line:84%
right down to the very
tips of your toes.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:55.520 align:middle line:90%


00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.680 align:middle line:84%
All the muscles of your body
now so beautifully relaxed,

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:07.160 align:middle line:84%
and you feel very heavy
and very comfortable.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:12.525 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling centered
and relaxed fully in control.

00:11:12.525 --> 00:11:18.380 align:middle line:90%


00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.450 align:middle line:84%
If there are any
areas of your body

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.540 align:middle line:84%
that still feel
tight or tense, you

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.960 align:middle line:84%
find that you can relax them
simply by giving yourself

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.360 align:middle line:90%
permission to do so.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:32.360 align:middle line:90%


00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can now go even
deeper as I count down

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.570 align:middle line:90%
from eight to zero.

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:39.520 align:middle line:90%


00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And with every number, you
feel yourself drifting further

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:44.860 align:middle line:90%
into blissful relaxation.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.040 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:58.470 align:middle line:90%
So eight, seven, six, five.

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:01.260 align:middle line:90%
Deeper now.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:10.460 align:middle line:90%
Four, three, two, one, and zero.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:17.330 align:middle line:84%
Deeply relaxed, letting go of
all the cares and worries, all

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.075 align:middle line:84%
the tension and pressure
and stresses and strains.

00:12:20.075 --> 00:12:22.670 align:middle line:90%


00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Let them all ease from your
body and ease from your mind,

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:33.740 align:middle line:84%
and allow yourself to drift down
into a deeper, more blissful

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.531 align:middle line:90%
state of creative relaxation.

00:12:36.531 --> 00:12:40.380 align:middle line:90%


00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And now that you're in
a deeply relaxed state,

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:50.650 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk about
feelings of confidence.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And you know that not
only does being confident

00:12:53.560 --> 00:13:00.840 align:middle line:84%
feel good, it helps you
to seize opportunities,

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:07.210 align:middle line:84%
to take more chances, make those
changes you've been wanting

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:12.070 align:middle line:84%
to make, or perhaps even take
the next step in your life

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:13.140 align:middle line:90%
or even your career.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:17.950 align:middle line:90%


00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:20.650 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps learning
to be more confident

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:23.140 align:middle line:84%
will help you to
attract a partner

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:30.100 align:middle line:84%
that you can build a healthy
relationship with, or maybe

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.280 align:middle line:84%
even seek out new
opportunities that will

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.010 align:middle line:90%
foster your personal growth.

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:39.630 align:middle line:90%


00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.840 align:middle line:84%
The real key to
being more confident

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.090 align:middle line:90%
is to think confidently.

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Talk confidently
and act confidently.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:54.740 align:middle line:90%


00:13:54.740 --> 00:14:02.050 align:middle line:84%
So from now on in, you start
to think much more positively,

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:09.010 align:middle line:84%
as by thinking
positively, you'll

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:12.740 align:middle line:84%
be manifesting good
things into your life.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:16.600 align:middle line:84%
So instead of focusing on
ways something can go wrong,

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.035 align:middle line:84%
from now on, you focus on
all the ways it can go right.

00:14:20.035 --> 00:14:23.090 align:middle line:90%


00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:26.710 align:middle line:84%
If a negative thought
enters your head,

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:32.200 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to visualize
pulling a plug from your mind

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:37.280 align:middle line:84%
as if it's right
out of the socket,

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.710 align:middle line:84%
cutting the power that
fuels negative thinking.

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:43.860 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And you know that negative
thoughts no longer serve you,

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:57.060 align:middle line:84%
so you let them go, preferring
now to believe in yourself,

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:02.410 align:middle line:84%
believing that things will
work out just as they should,

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:05.440 align:middle line:84%
having the confidence
to dream big,

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.300 align:middle line:90%
think big, and be positive.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:11.150 align:middle line:90%


00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:14.110 align:middle line:84%
You quiet your inner
critic from now on,

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:19.210 align:middle line:84%
that voice inside your head,
the negative self-talk,

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:24.030 align:middle line:84%
otherwise known as
your inner monologue.

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And knowing that has
an important effect

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:29.080 align:middle line:90%
on your confidence.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.880 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you
catch yourself when

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.000 align:middle line:90%
you're thinking negatively.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.770 align:middle line:84%
You replace the
thoughts with something

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:39.620 align:middle line:84%
you like about yourself,
something positive,

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:42.040 align:middle line:84%
remembering when you did
something you were proud of

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.240 align:middle line:90%
or was successful in.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.790 align:middle line:90%


00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Confident now about yourself
and about your abilities,

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:51.730 align:middle line:84%
immediately stopping
those negative thoughts

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:54.820 align:middle line:84%
in their tracks and
rewiring your thinking,

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.620 align:middle line:84%
retraining those
thinking patterns.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:05.380 align:middle line:90%


00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:08.455 align:middle line:84%
You notice that your body
language also starts to change.

00:16:08.455 --> 00:16:11.310 align:middle line:90%


00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:13.260 align:middle line:90%
You stand up straight.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.060 align:middle line:84%
You square your shoulders
and open up your chest.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:17.910 align:middle line:90%
You breathe deeply.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:20.940 align:middle line:84%
You maintain brisk,
purposeful strides when

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:22.740 align:middle line:90%
you walk to cover more ground.

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.990 align:middle line:90%
You have a confident stance now.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:28.190 align:middle line:90%


00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Your posture now makes
you feel stronger,

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.560 align:middle line:84%
and where your body
goes, your mind

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:39.845 align:middle line:84%
follows, acting confidently
and so feeling confident.

00:16:39.845 --> 00:16:44.400 align:middle line:90%


00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And when you
connect with people,

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:50.550 align:middle line:84%
you show confidence
through eye contact,

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:53.110 align:middle line:84%
exuding confidence when
you meet new people.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:57.000 align:middle line:90%


00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.600 align:middle line:84%
You use the 80-20 rule,
meeting someone's eye 80%

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.620 align:middle line:84%
of the time to help
strengthen your relationships.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:08.990 align:middle line:90%


00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:13.430 align:middle line:84%
You live your life day by
day, confident that by living

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:16.040 align:middle line:84%
in the present, you
appreciate what you have.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:21.150 align:middle line:90%


00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:23.849 align:middle line:84%
You appreciate what you're
grateful for without worrying

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:28.250 align:middle line:84%
about what will happen
tomorrow, freeing your mind,

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:30.740 align:middle line:84%
allowing confidence
to flow in now.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:35.460 align:middle line:90%


00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:39.230 align:middle line:84%
You are self-reliant,
self-confident,

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:42.400 align:middle line:84%
and filled with independence
and determination.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.320 align:middle line:90%


00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.620 align:middle line:90%
You are self-confident.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:55.180 align:middle line:84%
You think confidently
and you talk confidently.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:59.740 align:middle line:84%
You act confidently, and
so you feel confident.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:04.790 align:middle line:90%


00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:07.430 align:middle line:84%
You are now creating a
new positive reality.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:11.270 align:middle line:90%


00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.640 align:middle line:84%
You now experience
all the warmth and joy

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:18.530 align:middle line:84%
in life while detaching
from the negativity.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And from this moment on, you see
the positive side of everything

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.390 align:middle line:90%
that happens in your life.

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.850 align:middle line:90%


00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:29.790 align:middle line:84%
You see the positive
opportunities in everything

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:30.870 align:middle line:90%
you experience.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:36.820 align:middle line:90%


00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Your positive
thinking now results

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:40.380 align:middle line:90%
in a more positive life.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.580 align:middle line:90%


00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:46.580 align:middle line:84%
You experience a feeling
of overall well-being

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:47.630 align:middle line:90%
and mental calm.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:50.560 align:middle line:90%


00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:55.380 align:middle line:84%
You are at peace with yourself,
the world, and everyone in it.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.390 align:middle line:90%


00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Each and every
day, you experience

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:04.540 align:middle line:84%
more and more positive results
of your positive thinking,

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.470 align:middle line:84%
making you feel more
confident each and every day.

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:12.250 align:middle line:90%


00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:14.920 align:middle line:84%
From now on, your
self-esteem is increasing.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.460 align:middle line:90%


00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Your self-confidence
is increasing.

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.720 align:middle line:90%


00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.150 align:middle line:84%
You feel enthusiastic
about your life,

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:27.160 align:middle line:84%
and you look forward
to the challenges.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.260 align:middle line:90%


00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And you now breathe
life with new optimism,

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:37.840 align:middle line:90%
with new enthusiasm.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.140 align:middle line:84%
A happy, self-assured
inner you has emerged.

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:47.150 align:middle line:90%


00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:49.220 align:middle line:84%
From this moment
on, you're feeling

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:53.440 align:middle line:84%
and you're becoming much more
confident each and every day.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:58.580 align:middle line:90%


00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And this wonderful
suggestion and idea,

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:04.520 align:middle line:84%
this wonderful belief
of you becoming

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.490 align:middle line:84%
and you feeling more
confident is now

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:11.450 align:middle line:84%
growing stronger and
stronger inside your mind.

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:17.300 align:middle line:84%
This positive suggestion,
this positive idea,

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.250 align:middle line:84%
this wonderful
belief that you're

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:24.410 align:middle line:84%
becoming, that you're feeling
more and more confident

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:31.160 align:middle line:84%
every single day is becoming
more and more real for you.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And you're truly feeling more
confident each and every day.

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:45.760 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.955 align:middle line:84%
Positive, strong
confidence growing in you

00:20:48.955 --> 00:20:53.810 align:middle line:84%
now so that you can do what
you want to do in your life.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.620 align:middle line:90%


00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:59.960 align:middle line:84%
Every part of you
feeling more confident

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.690 align:middle line:84%
with every single
day that passes,

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:06.120 align:middle line:84%
much more confident to
do those things you've

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.400 align:middle line:90%
always wanted to do.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:12.350 align:middle line:90%


00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:17.810 align:middle line:84%
You think confidently,
you talk confidently,

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:22.040 align:middle line:84%
you act confidently, and
so you feel confident.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:26.990 align:middle line:90%


00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you
now to take a moment

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:31.540 align:middle line:84%
to visualize yourself
being confident.

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.230 align:middle line:90%


00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:37.910 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you see yourself at
work, talking to a friend,

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:42.110 align:middle line:84%
or simply having the courage
to start something new.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it may be,
feel it and see it.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.370 align:middle line:90%
Hear yourself being confident.

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:47.570 align:middle line:90%
Visualize it now.

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:52.140 align:middle line:90%


00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Notice how happy you
look, how reassured.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:59.460 align:middle line:90%
Your self-confidence is high.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:03.840 align:middle line:90%


00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:08.250 align:middle line:84%
See that your body language
and posture is assertive.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:09.930 align:middle line:90%
Your eye contact is strong.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:12.675 align:middle line:90%
