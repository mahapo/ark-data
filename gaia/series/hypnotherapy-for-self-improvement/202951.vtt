00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, I'm Sophie from
the House of Wellbeing.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.900 align:middle line:10%
In our self-improvement guided
meditation and hypnotherapy

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.440 align:middle line:10%
series, you'll find seven audios
to help you accept yourself

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.920 align:middle line:10%
for who you are, to improve
your self-esteem and confidence,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.320 align:middle line:10%
as well as guide you to
having much more patience,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.190 align:middle line:10%
to be kinder to
yourself and others,

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.990 align:middle line:10%
and to feel much
happier overall.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.850 align:middle line:84%
All of our audios are slightly
different to just meditation

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.450 align:middle line:84%
alone because we use powerful
therapeutic tools, including

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.600 align:middle line:84%
cognitive behavioral therapy,
neurolinguistic therapy,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.440 align:middle line:84%
visualization, and, of
course, hypnotherapy.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's that
combination that makes

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.690 align:middle line:84%
our audio so powerful and
hugely effective at helping

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.910 align:middle line:84%
you to make those changes
to your unwanted beliefs,

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.028 align:middle line:84%
behaviors, old habits, and
negative thinking patterns.

00:00:47.028 --> 00:00:48.570 align:middle line:84%
When you listen to
our audios, you'll

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.480 align:middle line:84%
be put into a deep
state of relaxation.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's a really
familiar state to you.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a stage of
relaxation you fall

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.870 align:middle line:84%
into just as you fall asleep
and just as you wake up.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.003 align:middle line:84%
So it's a really natural
feeling and it's very safe.

00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:03.420 align:middle line:84%
When you're in
that relaxed state,

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.129 align:middle line:84%
you're in the theta
brainwave state.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.100 align:middle line:10%
And that allows us to
bypass your conscious mind

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.490 align:middle line:10%
and talk instead directly
to your subconscious mind.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we want to get
to your subconscious mind,

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.560 align:middle line:84%
is because that's where all your
permanent beliefs, your habits,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.960 align:middle line:90%
your memories live.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.870 align:middle line:10%
So by talking directly to
your subconscious mind,

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.080 align:middle line:10%
we're then able to retrain,
reframe, and rewire

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.470 align:middle line:10%
your mind, meaning we can
then help you to eliminate

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.480 align:middle line:10%
any unwanted fears,
or behaviors,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.050 align:middle line:10%
phobias, negative thinking
patterns, or limiting beliefs,

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.530 align:middle line:10%
and instead replace them
with new positive empowering

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.260 align:middle line:10%
suggestions, resulting in
powerful long lasting changes.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.010 align:middle line:84%
We recommend that you
listen to our audios

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.110 align:middle line:84%
at least four times
so you can really

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.690 align:middle line:84%
override those old
beliefs, and instead

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.170 align:middle line:84%
compound the positive messaging
and help your mind to create

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.420 align:middle line:90%
new neural positive pathways.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.780 align:middle line:10%
And you'll soon see the changes
in the way you think and feel

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.760 align:middle line:10%
about an issue.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.470 align:middle line:84%
We suggest you
follow your instincts

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.900 align:middle line:84%
and listen to the audios
as often or as little

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.500 align:middle line:90%
as you want to.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.877 align:middle line:84%
You can listen to our audios at
any time of the day or night,

00:02:08.877 --> 00:02:10.919 align:middle line:84%
but we suggest you listen
to them when you're not

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.500 align:middle line:84%
too tired because if you
fall into a deep sleep,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.710 align:middle line:84%
then your subconscious
mind just isn't listening.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.260 align:middle line:84%
But if you get into
the end of the audio,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.820 align:middle line:84%
and you open your
eyes when I ask you

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.500 align:middle line:84%
to but you don't
remember what I said,

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.850 align:middle line:90%
then that's absolutely fine.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious mind
has been listening.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.460 align:middle line:84%
It will have just taken and
all of that positive messaging.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.790 align:middle line:84%
So, please, make sure
you listen to our audios

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.910 align:middle line:84%
when you're free from any
distractions or interruptions.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And, please, don't
listen to them

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.690 align:middle line:84%
when you're actively
doing something,

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.870 align:middle line:84%
like driving or
operating machinery.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.520 align:middle line:10%
If there's an
emergency and you need

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.790 align:middle line:10%
to come out of hypnosis
before we awaken you,

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.320 align:middle line:10%
then that's absolutely fine.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.240 align:middle line:10%
Your subconscious
mind will awaken you

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.240 align:middle line:10%
and you'll come out
of hypnosis easily.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.300 align:middle line:10%
It'll just be like waking up
from a nap or from a sleep.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.630 align:middle line:84%
So for now, please, click
on any of the audios you

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.940 align:middle line:90%
want to listen to in the series.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.440 align:middle line:10%
Find a comfortable
position where

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.800 align:middle line:10%
you can really relax and let
go, maybe a bed or a chair.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.910 align:middle line:10%
And then, close
your eyes to begin.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.000 align:middle line:90%
