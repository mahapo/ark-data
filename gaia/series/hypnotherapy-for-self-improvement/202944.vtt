00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.720 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>> You are listening to
the "Accepting Yourself"

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.100 align:middle line:90%
MindTalk audio.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.480 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.000 align:middle line:84%
But before it
does, I'd just like

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.940 align:middle line:84%
to remind you that the
following audio contains

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.400 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.070 align:middle line:90%
aim to cause deep relaxation.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.130 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that, wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.620 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.880 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.230 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.350 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.100 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.100 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.920 align:middle line:84%
relax, and let go
and really enjoy

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.610 align:middle line:84%
those peaceful feelings as all
the benefits come flooding in.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.970 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you, now,
to make yourself

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.750 align:middle line:84%
as comfortable as
possible and listen

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.085 align:middle line:90%
to the sound of my voice.

00:01:07.085 --> 00:01:10.450 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And as you do so, you may be
aware of other sounds going on

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.620 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.460 align:middle line:90%


00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.400 align:middle line:84%
But you know that
they're not important.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.340 align:middle line:90%
They don't matter at all.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And you can dismiss them
out of your awareness

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.140 align:middle line:84%
and focus your mind
entirely on what I'm saying.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.050 align:middle line:90%


00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.300 align:middle line:84%
This is your time, and
you'll make the most of it.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.050 align:middle line:90%


00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.520 align:middle line:84%
No one needs or wants
anything from you at all.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.070 align:middle line:90%


00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to
take in a deep breath,

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.460 align:middle line:84%
filling your lungs
as much as you can.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.020 align:middle line:90%
And let it out slowly.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.240 align:middle line:90%


00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And again, take in
a long, slow breath.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.919 align:middle line:90%


00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready,
let it out slowly.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.980 align:middle line:90%


00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Now you can allow your
breathing to return

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:28.900 align:middle line:84%
to normal, gentle
breaths in and out,

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.270 align:middle line:84%
returning to your normal
gentle breathing pace.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.310 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you, now,
to imagine yourself

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.355 align:middle line:84%
outside in your favorite
place in nature.

00:02:43.355 --> 00:02:46.700 align:middle line:90%


00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a peaceful
tropical beach.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be a
beautiful garden.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.420 align:middle line:90%


00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can
imagine lying back

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.665 align:middle line:84%
on a boat, which is sailing
on a tranquil river.

00:03:01.665 --> 00:03:04.200 align:middle line:90%


00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.200 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't
matter where you are as

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.940 align:middle line:90%
long as it feels good to you.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:90%


00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.570 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful day.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:23.780 align:middle line:84%
The sky is a special
shade of blue, so clear.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.900 align:middle line:90%
And it's a warm summer's day.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.670 align:middle line:90%


00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.470 align:middle line:84%
There's a breeze gently
blowing over you.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And the temperature is
just how you like it.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:44.760 align:middle line:90%


00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And in the sky is
a dazzling sun,

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.380 align:middle line:84%
so bright that you just
want to close your eyes

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.900 align:middle line:84%
and feel the glowing, healing
warmth of the sun on your body.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.920 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly, you find
that you can direct that sun

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.850 align:middle line:90%
over and around your body.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And as you realize
this, you begin

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.035 align:middle line:84%
to direct the light from
the sun over your face.

00:04:17.035 --> 00:04:21.120 align:middle line:90%


00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.060 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the healing
warmth of the light

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.410 align:middle line:84%
from the sun over your face,
just relaxing those muscles

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.330 align:middle line:84%
around the eyes, around the
nose and mouth and your brow.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.950 align:middle line:90%


00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And as you do this, you find
that your facial muscles

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.840 align:middle line:84%
begin to flatten out
as they relax and you

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.460 align:middle line:90%
let go completely.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:90%


00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.500 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful day.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.000 align:middle line:84%
You move the light from the
sun into the throat area,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.370 align:middle line:84%
feeling the warmth of the light
from the sun in your throat,

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.110 align:middle line:84%
relaxing all the muscles, just
letting go completely now.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:90%


00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And the warm sunlight now
moving into your shoulders

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.770 align:middle line:84%
and across your
shoulders, making them

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:32.040 align:middle line:84%
feel loose and limp
and comfortable

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.390 align:middle line:84%
as your shoulders sink into
the frame of your body.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.680 align:middle line:90%


00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:47.335 align:middle line:84%
And you feel so comfortable
now, so relaxed and at peace.

00:05:47.335 --> 00:05:51.220 align:middle line:90%


00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And you let nothing bother
or concern you at all.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.080 align:middle line:90%


00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And you direct the light from
the sun down your right arm,

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:09.080 align:middle line:84%
from the shoulders to
the tips of your fingers.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.727 align:middle line:84%
The right arm begins
to relax and let go.

00:06:12.727 --> 00:06:15.530 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful feeling
to be here right now.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.970 align:middle line:90%


00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.160 align:middle line:84%
The warmth of the
light from the sun

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.330 align:middle line:84%
penetrates the knots and bones
and muscles of that right arm.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:34.300 align:middle line:90%


00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.850 align:middle line:90%
And it's such a beautiful day.

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:41.230 align:middle line:84%
You move the sun
over to your left arm

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:48.110 align:middle line:84%
and guide the light from the
sun down and up your left arm,

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.550 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your
shoulders all the way down

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.945 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your fingers.

00:06:53.945 --> 00:06:56.620 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:02.500 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the left arm
relaxing, becoming comfortably

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.205 align:middle line:90%
heavy and totally relaxed.

00:07:06.205 --> 00:07:11.770 align:middle line:90%


00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.965 align:middle line:84%
Now, move that warm light
across and into the chest area.

00:07:15.965 --> 00:07:18.490 align:middle line:90%


00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And relax the chest,
all the muscles there.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.770 align:middle line:90%


00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, down to the stomach,
relaxing your tummy,

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:33.945 align:middle line:84%
down into your hips and your
thighs over to your right leg.

00:07:33.945 --> 00:07:37.590 align:middle line:90%


00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:42.520 align:middle line:84%
The light warms the muscles
as you relax your right leg.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Let it feel comfortable
and heavy now.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.070 align:middle line:90%


00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, move the light from
the sun down your right leg,

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:56.620 align:middle line:84%
up and down from the top of the
hips to the tips of your toes

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.712 align:middle line:84%
as the right leg
relaxes and you let go.

00:08:00.712 --> 00:08:06.850 align:middle line:90%


00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a beautiful
day, you now move the light

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.640 align:middle line:90%
into your left leg.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:18.400 align:middle line:84%
You move it up and down the left
leg, from the top of the hips

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.140 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And your left leg relaxes,
releasing tension,

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:27.690 align:middle line:90%
letting go, now, completely.

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:31.870 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:38.679 align:middle line:84%
Your whole body is now totally
and completely relaxed,

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:41.409 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your
head all the way down

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:42.805 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:08:42.805 --> 00:08:46.750 align:middle line:90%


00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And as your body relaxes,
your mind also relaxes.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:56.010 align:middle line:90%


00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And I want you, now, to
notice that the sun is

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:06.100 align:middle line:84%
setting, going down now,
deeper and deeper down.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And you're so deeply
relaxed, but still completely

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:10.870 align:middle line:90%
alert and aware.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:13.900 align:middle line:90%


00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:17.200 align:middle line:84%
You resist the temptation
to fall asleep.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.510 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is thoroughly
relaxed, but you

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.230 align:middle line:90%
stay focused on these words.

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:25.640 align:middle line:90%


00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.260 align:middle line:84%
So now I'd like you to
use your imagination.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And once again, you're in a
wonderful place in nature.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:38.290 align:middle line:84%
The trees are a
beautiful shade of green.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:41.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a stunning day, and the
sun is shining down on you.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:44.810 align:middle line:90%


00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:48.620 align:middle line:84%
There's a soft and
gentle breeze in the air,

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.560 align:middle line:84%
making you feel pleasantly
relaxed and calm.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.040 align:middle line:90%


00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.270 align:middle line:84%
All around, you can see
trees and plants and an array

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:04.580 align:middle line:84%
of the most beautiful
flowers you have ever seen,

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:07.880 align:middle line:90%
so colorful and vibrant.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And you can smell the rich
aroma of these flowers,

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:13.700 align:middle line:90%
making you feel so peaceful.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:18.080 align:middle line:90%


00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.960 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else matters right now.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.890 align:middle line:84%
You feel completely
at ease and so calm.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:26.750 align:middle line:90%


00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And in the distance, you
can hear the sound of water

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.670 align:middle line:90%
flowing slowly and gently.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:35.630 align:middle line:90%


00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:39.135 align:middle line:84%
The sound of water is helping
you to go more and more deeply

00:10:39.135 --> 00:10:39.935 align:middle line:90%
relaxed.

00:10:39.935 --> 00:10:42.840 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.340 align:middle line:84%
You may feel your muscles
are loosening more and more,

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.235 align:middle line:84%
relaxing with the beautiful
flowing sound of water.

00:10:49.235 --> 00:10:54.000 align:middle line:90%


00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.570 align:middle line:84%
Out of curiosity, you decide to
follow the sound of the water.

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.360 align:middle line:90%


00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And you feel excited about where
it's leading you, knowing deep

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:09.730 align:middle line:84%
within yourself you're going
to a very special place,

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.440 align:middle line:84%
a place where you're
going to create

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.690 align:middle line:84%
some positive, wonderful,
long-lasting changes.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:19.050 align:middle line:90%


00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:23.380 align:middle line:84%
As you walk slowly
towards the water,

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:28.360 align:middle line:84%
you can hear the sound of
birds singing in the trees.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.277 align:middle line:90%
You feel totally at ease.

00:11:30.277 --> 00:11:33.940 align:middle line:90%


00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:37.180 align:middle line:84%
As you finally
reach the lake, you

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:41.920 align:middle line:84%
realize it's the most beautiful
vision you've ever seen.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And you're in awe of the
beauty that surrounds you.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.640 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.220 align:middle line:84%
The vast lake is
filled with a variety

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:58.310 align:middle line:84%
of colors, rich colors of blues,
turquoise, and light greens.

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And it fills your mind and
body with a wave of relaxation.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.780 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.560 align:middle line:84%
You may be becoming more relaxed
with each and every breath

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:16.810 align:middle line:84%
you take, feeling more calm,
more peaceful, and more

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.335 align:middle line:90%
relaxed than ever before.

00:12:18.335 --> 00:12:21.990 align:middle line:90%


00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:25.830 align:middle line:84%
Your mind may be
drifting in and out,

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:30.570 align:middle line:84%
just letting go, deeper
and deeper still.

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:35.460 align:middle line:84%
You may feel as though your
mind is flowing gently,

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.540 align:middle line:84%
flowing gently like the
lake in your imagination.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:42.090 align:middle line:90%


00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:45.390 align:middle line:84%
You look into the distance,
and you can see a wooden bridge

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.680 align:middle line:90%
leading over the lake.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.410 align:middle line:90%


00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.060 align:middle line:84%
You walk towards the bridge,
feeling more and more

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:52.860 align:middle line:90%
deeply relaxed.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.760 align:middle line:90%


00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.590 align:middle line:84%
As you reach the
bridge, you can see

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:01.243 align:middle line:84%
there are 10 steps leading over
to the other side of the lake.

00:13:01.243 --> 00:13:05.190 align:middle line:90%


00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:08.930 align:middle line:84%
You slowly start
walking over the bridge,

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:10.670 align:middle line:90%
counting the steps in your mind.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:13.415 align:middle line:90%


00:13:13.415 --> 00:13:21.590 align:middle line:84%
10, 9-- deeper and
deeper, still--

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:29.920 align:middle line:84%
8, 7-- all the way down
to relaxation now--

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:39.960 align:middle line:84%
6, 5, and 4-- drifting off
peacefully and easily--

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:46.996 align:middle line:84%
3, 2-- all the way
down, deeply relaxed--

00:13:46.996 --> 00:13:49.930 align:middle line:90%
and 1.

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.060 align:middle line:84%
You see a comfortable,
padded chair,

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:55.390 align:middle line:84%
and you take a seat,
ready to embrace

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:59.340 align:middle line:84%
the changes to come in your
deep state of relaxation now.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:03.810 align:middle line:90%


00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:08.490 align:middle line:84%
For a while now, you've
been living with self-doubt

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.820 align:middle line:84%
and having a sense
that you can do better,

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:18.970 align:middle line:84%
striving for perfection, and
being too hard on yourself,

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:22.700 align:middle line:84%
always seeking to be
the best at what you do,

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:25.580 align:middle line:84%
while having to prove
yourself to others

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:28.490 align:middle line:84%
can be exhausting
and leave you feeling

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:32.170 align:middle line:90%
worried and unfulfilled.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:34.240 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure you
know that we all

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.240 align:middle line:84%
do the best that
we can at the time

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:42.530 align:middle line:84%
given with any
given circumstances.

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And like anyone else,
we're all sometimes

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:46.520 align:middle line:90%
prone to making mistakes.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:50.020 align:middle line:90%


00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.290 align:middle line:84%
The most important
thing, when this happens,

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:57.070 align:middle line:84%
is to forgive yourself and learn
from the mistakes every time.

00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:01.210 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:04.510 align:middle line:84%
We grow stronger and more
knowledgeable because of them.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:07.050 align:middle line:90%


00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:09.480 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps some painful criticism--

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.940 align:middle line:84%
hurt or rejection,
perhaps from childhood--

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:17.260 align:middle line:84%
has become a core belief that
persists in your adulthood.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.970 align:middle line:84%
So failing to accept yourself
becomes an affirmation

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:23.040 align:middle line:90%
of that limiting core belief.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.760 align:middle line:90%


00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And it makes you feel worse
and saps your motivation

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:36.640 align:middle line:84%
and energy, leading to
despondency and hopelessness,

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.330 align:middle line:84%
effectively eroding your
self-esteem and resources

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:41.835 align:middle line:90%
that you need to make changes.

00:15:41.835 --> 00:15:45.790 align:middle line:90%


00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:48.220 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you, now, to
think about all the things

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:51.350 align:middle line:90%
that you do love about yourself.

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:55.270 align:middle line:84%
It may be how good you
are at your job, how

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:56.980 align:middle line:84%
your friends adore
you, or perhaps

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:01.390 align:middle line:84%
how you're doing a great job
at raising your children,

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:06.910 align:middle line:84%
how kind, thoughtful, funny, or
loyal you are, whatever it is.

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:08.890 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you, now,
to take the time

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:12.680 align:middle line:84%
to think about that one thing
that you love about yourself.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.510 align:middle line:90%


00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Absorb that feeling and
allow it to sink in.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:23.240 align:middle line:90%


00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And note how others will
love this about you, too,

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:31.850 align:middle line:84%
and how they'll be drawn to
you because of that quality.

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Other people are drawn to
your positive qualities,

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:39.470 align:middle line:84%
and it's you who are holding
on to your negative qualities.

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:42.730 align:middle line:90%


00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.060 align:middle line:84%
It's time, now, to
start accepting that you

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.800 align:middle line:90%
do have good qualities.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.320 align:middle line:90%
You do have something to offer.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.250 align:middle line:90%
You're valued.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:51.660 align:middle line:90%
You're more than enough.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.230 align:middle line:84%
You are wanted,
and you're needed.

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:56.360 align:middle line:90%


00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.900 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you watch
your inner monologue,

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.840 align:middle line:84%
recognizing your strengths
and all the benefits

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.145 align:middle line:90%
that you have to offer others.

00:17:04.145 --> 00:17:08.300 align:middle line:90%


00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.250 align:middle line:84%
You make sure you
don't brush off

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:14.450 align:middle line:90%
any achievements or qualities.

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:18.130 align:middle line:84%
You think about the
now and take a moment

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:21.620 align:middle line:84%
to give value to all of your
achievements, no matter how

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:22.420 align:middle line:90%
small.

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:25.560 align:middle line:90%


00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.670 align:middle line:84%
We're not focusing
on negatives here.

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.520 align:middle line:84%
We're focusing solely
on the positives.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.980 align:middle line:90%


00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.110 align:middle line:84%
You know that we hold
negative thoughts

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:42.020 align:middle line:90%
much more easily in our minds.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:46.640 align:middle line:84%
But it's now time to accept
that you and all others

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.130 align:middle line:84%
have negative aspects
about you, but we're not

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:50.990 align:middle line:90%
focusing on them now.

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:54.440 align:middle line:84%
This only leads to
more negativity.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.375 align:middle line:84%
And you continue with
that line of thinking.

00:17:56.375 --> 00:17:59.010 align:middle line:90%


00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And you're listening
to this MindTalk audio

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:05.790 align:middle line:84%
as you want to focus on changing
those thinking patterns.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:08.370 align:middle line:84%
So from now on,
you take a moment

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:12.790 align:middle line:84%
to recognize achievements or
qualities, positive aspects

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:13.590 align:middle line:90%
about yourself.

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:17.680 align:middle line:90%


00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:21.010 align:middle line:84%
You are unique,
and not everyone is

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:25.210 align:middle line:90%
as special nor capable as you.

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And you value your
own unique qualities.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.310 align:middle line:90%
You absorb them.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:32.820 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps you write them down.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.220 align:middle line:84%
But whatever you do, you
don't brush them aside.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.980 align:middle line:84%
You are valued, and you
thrive on the good qualities

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:40.780 align:middle line:90%
that you have.

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:45.170 align:middle line:90%


00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:48.530 align:middle line:84%
With this new inner
self-confidence now embedded

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:53.670 align:middle line:84%
deep within you, you find
yourself no longer listening

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:58.030 align:middle line:84%
to negative comments, whether
from the past or in the future.

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:00.570 align:middle line:90%


00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:04.290 align:middle line:84%
These comments simply
bounce off you now.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:08.590 align:middle line:90%
You feel protected from within.

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Your internal dialogue
has also changed,

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.180 align:middle line:84%
and you find yourself rewarding
and complimenting yourself

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:20.200 align:middle line:84%
more and more as the old
habits of negative thinking

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.308 align:middle line:84%
or criticism simply
no longer serve you.

00:19:23.308 --> 00:19:27.060 align:middle line:90%


00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:31.680 align:middle line:84%
You now realize that people
who believe in themselves, that

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:37.230 align:middle line:84%
truly know who they are, accept
who they are, trust in life

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:40.990 align:middle line:84%
and love who they are
can do almost anything.

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:43.950 align:middle line:90%


00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:47.640 align:middle line:84%
They can achieve what
they want to achieve,

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.820 align:middle line:84%
be whoever they want
to be, and go forward

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.230 align:middle line:90%
in life as a success.

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:55.840 align:middle line:90%


00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Your internal dialogue
will affect your behavior

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:00.590 align:middle line:90%
more than you think.

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:02.890 align:middle line:84%
So from now on, you're
aware to make sure

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:07.060 align:middle line:84%
that that inner monologue is
only focused on positivity.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:11.070 align:middle line:90%


00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:16.110 align:middle line:84%
You believe in yourself, and
you know that no one is perfect

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.880 align:middle line:84%
and that others won't judge
you if you do something wrong.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.940 align:middle line:90%


00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And if they did, then
their opinion or approval

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:26.870 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't matter because
no one's perfect.

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.440 align:middle line:90%


00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.260 align:middle line:84%
You know that you'll
always do your best,

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:35.680 align:middle line:84%
and you accept that
that is good enough.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:40.095 align:middle line:84%
All that really matters is
you and what you think of you.

00:20:40.095 --> 00:20:42.825 align:middle line:90%


00:20:42.825 --> 00:20:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And you're now much more
easily able to put forward

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:50.720 align:middle line:84%
your best self and to be more
confident at work or socially.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.440 align:middle line:90%


00:20:54.440 --> 00:21:00.110 align:middle line:84%
You feel energized, motivated,
confident, self-assured,

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:02.900 align:middle line:90%
and driven.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:07.550 align:middle line:84%
So, with your new and improved,
limitless, upbeat attitude,

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:12.410 align:middle line:84%
you're raising your energy and
very best aspects to the top,

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:17.840 align:middle line:84%
to the surface, activating
the very best energies, easily

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:22.490 align:middle line:84%
and skillfully raising and
improving your self-ideals,

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:25.820 align:middle line:84%
your self-image,
and your self-esteem

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.690 align:middle line:84%
to new and improved
heights of greatness.

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:35.400 align:middle line:90%


00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.360 align:middle line:84%
You are now a confident
person, knowing

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:43.450 align:middle line:90%
your past does not define you.

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:45.880 align:middle line:84%
You know who you are and
where you want to go.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.510 align:middle line:90%


00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:52.400 align:middle line:84%
So as your self-confidence
soars daily,

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:56.180 align:middle line:84%
your ability to see things
more positively and clearly

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.530 align:middle line:90%
increases.

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Other people also notice
subtle changes in you,

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.610 align:middle line:84%
and you're pleasantly
surprised at the calm exterior

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:07.580 align:middle line:90%
that you now display.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:11.390 align:middle line:90%


00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:15.260 align:middle line:84%
What they probably don't
realize is that you're not just

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:18.250 align:middle line:90%
outwardly calm.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:22.270 align:middle line:84%
You also have a quiet
inner confidence, too.

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:24.795 align:middle line:84%
And this is the result of
you accepting yourself.

00:22:24.795 --> 00:22:27.710 align:middle line:90%


00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And because you're
finally beginning

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:32.930 align:middle line:84%
to realize this
and accept yourself

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:36.560 align:middle line:84%
as a wonderful person
you are, you really

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:42.005 align:middle line:84%
don't need to prove to anyone
that you can do better.

00:22:42.005 --> 00:22:46.690 align:middle line:84%
You are a unique individual
with so many good qualities,

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:49.840 align:middle line:84%
and you accept yourself as
the wonderful unique human

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.730 align:middle line:90%
being that you are.

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:55.880 align:middle line:84%
You trust yourself, and you
know that you're good enough.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.160 align:middle line:90%
No one is better than you.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.140 align:middle line:84%
They're simply different,
and that's good.

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.890 align:middle line:90%
That's what makes us so special.

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And when you accept yourself
on this deeper level,

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:07.950 align:middle line:84%
wonderful things
can begin to happen.

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:10.730 align:middle line:90%


00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:16.700 align:middle line:84%
You live your life skillfully,
successfully, and powerfully,

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:20.750 align:middle line:84%
doing all that it honestly
takes to rise to the top

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:23.870 align:middle line:84%
and exemplifying only
your very best self.

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:26.600 align:middle line:90%


00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And you rise to the top,
and you flourish, thriving,

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:34.010 align:middle line:84%
and gracefully succeeding
as never before, feeling

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:38.810 align:middle line:84%
a newer, truer, and growing
sense of satisfaction

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:43.270 align:middle line:84%
and self-approval and
acceptance as never before.

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:48.410 align:middle line:90%


00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:50.420 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.240 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind.

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.220 align:middle line:84%
They'll become more
and more powerful

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:56.950 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:59.480 align:middle line:90%


00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from one to five

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:04.290 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of five, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:10.820 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling
fantastic, bringing back

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.640 align:middle line:84%
with you all the
wonderful new feelings.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:22.960 align:middle line:84%
So coming back, now,
with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:28.000 align:middle line:90%
