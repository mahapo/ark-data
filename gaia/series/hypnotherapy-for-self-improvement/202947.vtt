00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>> You are listening to the
Patience MindTalk audio.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.930 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.640 align:middle line:84%
But before it does,
I'd like to remind you

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.590 align:middle line:84%
that the following
audio contains

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.830 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.280 align:middle line:90%
aim to cause deep relaxation.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.700 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that, whenever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.640 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.030 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.970 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.430 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.880 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.440 align:middle line:90%


00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.430 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.600 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.800 align:middle line:84%
relax, lie back, and
let go and really enjoy

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.580 align:middle line:84%
these peaceful feelings and all
the benefits that come with it.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Make yourself as
comfortable as possible

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.865 align:middle line:84%
and concentrate on
the sound of my voice.

00:01:17.865 --> 00:01:20.490 align:middle line:90%


00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And begin by drawing in
long, slow, deep breath

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.810 align:middle line:90%
in through your nose.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.830 align:middle line:90%
Hold the breath for a moment.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And now slightly open your
mouth and release all the air

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.744 align:middle line:84%
from your body in a
long, low, deep sigh.

00:01:41.744 --> 00:01:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And relax, allowing your
lungs to naturally deflate

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.480 align:middle line:84%
as your body sinks into
gentle relaxation now.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.240 align:middle line:90%


00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.420 align:middle line:90%
And you can release any tension.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Relax and let go as I
guide you through a journey

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:12.400 align:middle line:84%
of relaxation, a journey that
you will find very beneficial

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.020 align:middle line:90%
for your overall well-being.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.400 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.310 align:middle line:84%
You're going to start
this calming experience

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.505 align:middle line:84%
by first relaxing your
whole body-mind system.

00:02:24.505 --> 00:02:27.260 align:middle line:90%


00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's true to say that the
simple act of relaxing the body

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.960 align:middle line:84%
and mind has a positive knock-on
effect because how you think

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.170 align:middle line:90%
determines how you feel.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And how you feel influences
the world around you.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And how you choose
to think today

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.510 align:middle line:84%
affects your decisions
from here on in.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.150 align:middle line:84%
So to make my
assurances your reality,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.200 align:middle line:84%
let's begin by
focusing your attention

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.590 align:middle line:90%
at the very top of your head.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Tension often starts at
the scalp and the neck.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.670 align:middle line:84%
So mentally and physically
allow all the muscles

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:21.220 align:middle line:84%
around the top of your
head to relax now,

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.980 align:middle line:84%
letting all the tension
simply dissolve.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.190 align:middle line:90%


00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:35.470 align:middle line:84%
As you start to tune into
your body-mind system,

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.970 align:middle line:84%
just let any tension you may
be holding to release now.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Allow your brain to relax,
the left and the right lobes

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.700 align:middle line:84%
of the brain just releasing,
such a simple thought, yet

00:03:51.700 --> 00:04:01.570 align:middle line:84%
so profound and so significant,
just letting go completely,

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.930 align:middle line:84%
drifting further
and further down,

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.890 align:middle line:84%
nobody wanting anything,
nobody needing anything.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.595 align:middle line:90%
This is your time to relax.

00:04:10.595 --> 00:04:14.310 align:middle line:90%


00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Taking the relaxation
into the face

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.970 align:middle line:84%
now, allowing all of your
facial muscles to feel loose.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Feel your brow relaxing,
your forehead smoothing out,

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:37.280 align:middle line:84%
the back of your eyes relaxing,
tiny muscles around your eyes

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.240 align:middle line:84%
and eyelids, down
into your cheeks

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:51.150 align:middle line:84%
and into your jaw muscles,
just releasing and letting go,

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.330 align:middle line:84%
allowing your tongue to
fall away from the roof

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.460 align:middle line:90%
of your mouth.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And should you find you need
to swallow, just do that

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.250 align:middle line:84%
now and drift down and
down, deeper and deeper

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.430 align:middle line:90%
into blissful relaxation.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.990 align:middle line:90%


00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.750 align:middle line:84%
The more you physically
relax, the more

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.960 align:middle line:90%
you can mentally relax.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you can
mentally relax, you

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.050 align:middle line:90%
can think much more clearly.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And when you think more clearly,
your life becomes clearer.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.220 align:middle line:90%
You make better decisions.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.425 align:middle line:84%
And you're much more in
control of your days.

00:05:32.425 --> 00:05:36.370 align:middle line:90%


00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.240 align:middle line:84%
So noticing, now,
how your neck feels,

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:47.020 align:middle line:84%
relaxing all the little muscles,
letting go of the strain,

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.220 align:middle line:90%
letting go of the tension.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.290 align:middle line:90%


00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:56.060 align:middle line:84%
Allow that tension that you
may be holding in your shoulder

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.150 align:middle line:90%
to go now.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Feel those shoulders,
both of them,

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.860 align:middle line:84%
sinking into the
frame of your body.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Feel your neck lengthen
as you do this.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.500 align:middle line:90%


00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Feel or imagine all your
cares and worries just

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.830 align:middle line:84%
rolling off your
shoulders now as you

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:25.470 align:middle line:84%
take the relaxation down, now,
into the tops of your arms,

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.100 align:middle line:84%
letting any tension you may
be holding just drain away.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.760 align:middle line:90%


00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And as your awareness floats
down through your upper arms,

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:43.020 align:middle line:84%
into your elbows, all the
muscles in your forearms

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:51.430 align:middle line:84%
relax, right down to your wrists
and into your hands and way

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.520 align:middle line:84%
down into the very tips of
your fingers and thumbs.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.480 align:middle line:90%


00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.960 align:middle line:84%
Your arms are feeling so heavy,
your body so comfortable.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.120 align:middle line:90%


00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.630 align:middle line:84%
Nothing whatsoever
to do but just

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:15.360 align:middle line:84%
relax and enjoy this feeling
of total release now.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:21.290 align:middle line:90%


00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:26.060 align:middle line:84%
As you let go of all the
tension in those muscles,

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:32.390 align:middle line:84%
you may experience them becoming
calmer and gently releasing.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.340 align:middle line:90%


00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And just tune into the
feeling of simply letting go.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.830 align:middle line:90%


00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.490 align:middle line:84%
As you become aware
of your breathing,

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:53.760 align:middle line:84%
notice that you are now
breathing steadily and slowly,

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.460 align:middle line:90%
rhythmically.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And with each exhale,
you feel yourself just

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:04.810 align:middle line:84%
relaxing even more
deeply, allowing

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:10.350 align:middle line:84%
any tension in the chest area,
now, to simply drain away,

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:13.815 align:middle line:84%
letting go completely
and totally.

00:08:13.815 --> 00:08:19.280 align:middle line:90%


00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.160 align:middle line:84%
Bring awareness into
your stomach now.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And let all your
tummy muscles relax.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And as you do, I
want you to imagine

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:34.429 align:middle line:84%
a ball of sunlight passing
down from the top of your head

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:39.194 align:middle line:84%
down through your face, your
throat, and into your stomach.

00:08:39.194 --> 00:08:43.350 align:middle line:90%


00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Visualize this healing
energy passing down

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:51.415 align:middle line:84%
through your throat and
chest and into your stomach.

00:08:51.415 --> 00:08:55.350 align:middle line:90%


00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:02.750 align:middle line:84%
So see and feel the sunlight
swirling and rotating.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And as the light glows, it
warms and soothes and heals.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And you release and relax and
drift down and further down.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:20.340 align:middle line:90%


00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And in your imagination, you
send the sunlight out, now,

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:29.850 align:middle line:84%
to every nerve cell,
bone, muscle, fiber,

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:33.360 align:middle line:90%
and system of the body.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.630 align:middle line:84%
See it flowing through
the bloodstream.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:39.570 align:middle line:90%
And leave the light there.

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:43.560 align:middle line:90%
It knows what to do.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:49.110 align:middle line:84%
As you take the relaxation
round into your back muscles

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:52.770 align:middle line:84%
and from your back muscles,
it relaxes those muscles

00:09:52.770 --> 00:10:00.610 align:middle line:84%
either side of the spine,
releasing, relaxing,

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:05.770 align:middle line:84%
and just letting go now,
deeper and deeper now.

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:10.580 align:middle line:90%


00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.190 align:middle line:84%
As you relax your
waist and the muscles

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:19.520 align:middle line:84%
of your lower stomach and
down into the pelvic area, all

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.450 align:middle line:84%
the way down through
the large thigh muscles,

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:30.750 align:middle line:84%
down through your knees,
your shins, and your calves,

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:36.620 align:middle line:84%
just allow all those areas of
the body to relax and let go.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:42.230 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:47.190 align:middle line:84%
You're so relaxed, so
heavy, so comfortable.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:50.350 align:middle line:90%


00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And now tune into that
comfortable feeling

00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:01.570 align:middle line:84%
as you think on down to your
ankles and to your feet,

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:07.140 align:middle line:84%
right down to the very
tips of your toes,

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:12.230 align:middle line:84%
all the muscles of your body,
now, so beautifully relaxed.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And you feel very heavy
and very comfortable.

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling centered and
relaxed and fully in control.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:30.000 align:middle line:90%


00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.070 align:middle line:84%
If there are any
areas of your body

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:35.160 align:middle line:84%
that still feel
tight or tense, you

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.580 align:middle line:84%
find that you can relax them
simply by giving yourself

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.070 align:middle line:90%
permission to do so.

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:43.990 align:middle line:90%


00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And you can now go even
deeper as I count down

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:48.200 align:middle line:90%
from eight to zero.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.070 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And with every number, you
feel yourself drifting further

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.500 align:middle line:90%
into blissful relaxation.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.630 align:middle line:90%


00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:10.080 align:middle line:90%
So, 8, 7, 6, 5--

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:22.080 align:middle line:90%
deeper now-- 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Deeply relaxed, letting go of
all the cares and worries, all

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.710 align:middle line:84%
the tension and pressure
and stresses and strains.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:34.320 align:middle line:90%


00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:40.200 align:middle line:84%
Let them all ease from your
body and ease from your mind.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And allow yourself to drift down
into a deeper, more blissful

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:47.752 align:middle line:90%
state of creative relaxation.

00:12:47.752 --> 00:12:53.720 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, in your
imagination, I'd like

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:57.770 align:middle line:84%
you to imagine that
you're standing

00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:03.140 align:middle line:84%
on the top of a hill
on a beautiful island.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's a lovely,
warm summer's day.

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:12.350 align:middle line:84%
There's a clear, blue
sky, not a cloud in sight.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And the temperature is
just how you like it.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.100 align:middle line:90%


00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.630 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the gentle
warmth of the sun on your head

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:26.040 align:middle line:84%
and shoulders, and you can
hear the sounds of nature

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.460 align:middle line:84%
all around you, making you
feel even more relaxed.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:34.990 align:middle line:90%


00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:39.790 align:middle line:84%
The long grass in the
meadow below sway slightly.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And you can see a
winding path that

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.490 align:middle line:84%
disappears into a
small apple orchard

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.250 align:middle line:90%
just at the bottom of hill.

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:50.450 align:middle line:90%


00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And just beyond the
orchard, you can

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:56.810 align:middle line:84%
see the sea, the
sunlight darting off

00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:00.290 align:middle line:84%
the tops of the waves
and the whole ocean

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:02.000 align:middle line:90%
shimmering and sparkling.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.240 align:middle line:90%


00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:11.400 align:middle line:84%
You begin to move easily
down the path now,

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:15.920 align:middle line:84%
noticing the grass
springing under your feet,

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.340 align:middle line:84%
pushing you encouragingly
towards your destination.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.810 align:middle line:90%


00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And you catch the faint smell
of sea air in the breeze

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:33.360 align:middle line:84%
as you get closer to the
ocean now, as you stroll down,

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.320 align:middle line:90%
down the winding path.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And you move
smoothly and easily.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:44.045 align:middle line:84%
And you feel relaxed and
centered and fully in control.

00:14:44.045 --> 00:14:48.830 align:middle line:90%


00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And you're becoming aware, now,
of the growing calm within you.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.180 align:middle line:90%


00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.420 align:middle line:84%
You stop to look at the
beautiful flowers growing

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:06.640 align:middle line:84%
each side of the path, their
colors so vivid and bright.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And you stand there for a
moment, taking in the view.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:15.580 align:middle line:84%
A feeling of happiness flows
through you, continuing down.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:21.170 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.540 align:middle line:84%
You're aware, now,
of a deep sense

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:28.990 align:middle line:84%
of calmness and
tranquility right

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:32.830 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your head
to the tips of your toes,

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:35.410 align:middle line:84%
renewing your energy,
feeling wonderful.

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:38.780 align:middle line:90%


00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.840 align:middle line:84%
As you walk, you find
yourself almost floating,

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.035 align:middle line:84%
as though in a dream world,
down towards the orchard.

00:15:45.035 --> 00:15:48.550 align:middle line:90%


00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:53.450 align:middle line:84%
You move with such ease,
with no effort whatsoever.

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And in no time,
you find yourself

00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:02.080 align:middle line:84%
drifting through the fruit trees
with lush, cool, green foliage

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.530 align:middle line:90%
forming a canopy overhead.

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And you see the
sunlight glittering

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:08.575 align:middle line:90%
through the branches.

00:16:08.575 --> 00:16:13.080 align:middle line:90%


00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And as you stand there, you
feel a glittering sunlight

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:20.260 align:middle line:90%
on your face and neck.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And you feel and
experience it vibrating

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.525 align:middle line:84%
throughout your entire
body-mind system.

00:16:25.525 --> 00:16:30.730 align:middle line:90%


00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And as the sunlight moves, it
glows and warms and soothes

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:39.850 align:middle line:90%
and heals your body and mind.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And you release and relax
and move down and down,

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:51.050 align:middle line:84%
taking in another deep breath,
relaxing even more now.

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:56.230 align:middle line:90%


00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:58.450 align:middle line:84%
You can hear the
sound of the ocean

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:01.680 align:middle line:90%
as you move nearer and nearer.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And with every
step you take, you

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:08.339 align:middle line:84%
feel more relaxed
and more calm as you

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:12.329 align:middle line:84%
follow that winding path
that leads you downwards.

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:15.760 align:middle line:90%


00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.520 align:middle line:84%
You turn a corner,
and to your delight,

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:25.410 align:middle line:84%
you find yourself on a
beautiful deserted beach,

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:29.880 align:middle line:84%
the beach sweeping away into
a small bay in front of you.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And the ocean is a striking
turquoise blue, pure and clear.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel the warm
sand underneath your shoes.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And you take your
shoes off, and you

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:49.520 align:middle line:84%
start walking lazily across
the beach to the water's edge.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.310 align:middle line:90%


00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:55.610 align:middle line:84%
You feel the sand
beneath your feet,

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:59.630 align:middle line:84%
and you feel the
sand change from cool

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:03.410 align:middle line:84%
to moist beneath your feet as
you wander along the shoreline.

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:08.880 align:middle line:90%


00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.250 align:middle line:84%
As you turn around,
you start to walk up

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:15.690 align:middle line:84%
the beach towards
a grassy mound.

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And as you walk up slowly, you
take in the smell of the ocean

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:25.540 align:middle line:84%
and you hear the sound
of the water hissing

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:26.650 align:middle line:90%
over the warm sand.

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:30.680 align:middle line:90%


00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:34.040 align:middle line:84%
You reach the mound
now, and you sit down,

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.820 align:middle line:90%
making yourself comfortable.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.580 align:middle line:90%


00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And as you gaze out across
the breathtaking scene,

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:48.300 align:middle line:84%
you watch the waves roll
in and roll out again,

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:52.370 align:middle line:90%
rhythmically in and out again.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:57.450 align:middle line:90%


00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:00.750 align:middle line:84%
You play with the sand
through your fingers,

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:07.940 align:middle line:84%
noticing just how good you
feel, so relaxed now, so

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:11.750 align:middle line:84%
relaxed that you've opened
up your subconscious mind

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.660 align:middle line:84%
and you're ready to start
making those changes you've

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.150 align:middle line:84%
been wanting to make
once and for all.

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:20.180 align:middle line:90%


00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And as you let go now,
you can allow your mind

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:30.950 align:middle line:84%
to gently drift and wander,
because in hypnosis, you

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:36.500 align:middle line:84%
can really begin to enjoy the
wonderful feelings of knowing

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:40.610 align:middle line:84%
that calm and relaxation
have come, now,

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:43.520 align:middle line:90%
so easily and naturally to you.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:47.780 align:middle line:90%


00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.630 align:middle line:84%
You know that you
have been impatient,

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and you want to make
those changes now.

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:57.540 align:middle line:90%


00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:03.840 align:middle line:84%
You're tired of feeling the
urgency, the frustration,

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.530 align:middle line:84%
and the tension that
comes from impatience,

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:09.565 align:middle line:84%
and you're ready
to make the change.

00:20:09.565 --> 00:20:15.520 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:20.990 align:middle line:84%
You may have found that,
at times of impatience,

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:26.750 align:middle line:84%
you find your stomach
tensing up as if in knots.

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:31.010 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
focus here and teach

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:35.380 align:middle line:84%
you to allow those
muscles to relax

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:39.310 align:middle line:84%
and for this relaxation to
spread from those muscles

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:40.615 align:middle line:90%
up into your brain.

00:20:40.615 --> 00:20:47.910 align:middle line:90%


00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:54.460 align:middle line:84%
So imagine, now, a glowing
light in your stomach area,

00:20:54.460 --> 00:21:02.160 align:middle line:84%
warming and relaxing all the
muscles in that area, all

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:07.550 align:middle line:84%
the muscles becoming
heavier, eyes staying

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:10.750 align:middle line:84%
relaxed as if you're
sinking into your chair.

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:13.890 align:middle line:90%


00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And you can learn to relax
those muscles more and more

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:19.935 align:middle line:90%
every time you exhale.

00:21:19.935 --> 00:21:26.080 align:middle line:90%


00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:33.070 align:middle line:84%
When you feel yourself tensing
and becoming impatient,

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:37.630 align:middle line:84%
you remember to
take a big breath in

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.430 align:middle line:90%
and to release that tension.

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:44.010 align:middle line:90%


00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Imagine yourself
now in a situation

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:53.960 align:middle line:84%
where you would have previously
become impatient or nervous,

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.170 align:middle line:90%
frustrated.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:00.770 align:middle line:84%
You quickly focus
on your stomach,

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:04.600 align:middle line:90%
taking in a deep breath.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.190 align:middle line:90%
And release the tension.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.930 align:middle line:90%


00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:12.600 align:middle line:84%
Focus on your mind
and reconsider

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:17.115 align:middle line:84%
the importance, the urgency
that you are creating.

00:22:17.115 --> 00:22:20.410 align:middle line:90%


00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:24.420 align:middle line:84%
You remember to
stay calm as that's

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:29.180 align:middle line:84%
when you make better
decisions, when you're more

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:31.210 align:middle line:90%
productive, more efficient.

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:36.200 align:middle line:90%


00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:41.090 align:middle line:84%
So picture yourself
now in that situation.

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And instead of the
impatient person

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:48.200 align:middle line:84%
you may have previously
been, instead

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.430 align:middle line:84%
you choose to let
go of the tension,

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:56.190 align:middle line:90%
the angst in the muscles.

00:22:56.190 --> 00:23:00.320 align:middle line:90%
You take in that deep breath.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And you exhale,
slowly and powerfully,

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.900 align:middle line:84%
muscles releasing
with every breath

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:14.540 align:middle line:84%
you take, aware that,
if your body is calm,

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:19.070 align:middle line:84%
your mind will slow and
that sense of urgency

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:22.130 align:middle line:90%
will slow, too.

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:28.680 align:middle line:84%
You're breaking the habit,
now, of immediate urgency,

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.730 align:middle line:84%
of wanting to get
something done immediately.

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:35.930 align:middle line:90%


00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:39.680 align:middle line:84%
You feel much more
rational and calm

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.715 align:middle line:84%
if something needs
to be done quickly.

00:23:41.715 --> 00:23:46.490 align:middle line:90%


00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:52.160 align:middle line:84%
You know that you can move fast
and work quickly, get something

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.220 align:middle line:84%
done quickly, but
you don't allow

00:23:55.220 --> 00:24:00.110 align:middle line:84%
it to affect your state of
mind, to affect those muscles

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:04.610 align:middle line:84%
in your stomach, and to
lead to that panicked sense

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.660 align:middle line:90%
of impatience and urgency.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:15.870 align:middle line:90%


00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:21.370 align:middle line:84%
You practice taking in a long,
deep breath and letting it go.

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:26.280 align:middle line:90%


00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:31.570 align:middle line:84%
You feel that deeper sense
of calm within your stomach,

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:36.850 align:middle line:84%
moving all the way up,
influencing your mind.

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:39.440 align:middle line:84%
So you're connected to
your natural wisdom.

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:42.100 align:middle line:90%


00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And in this state
of deeper calmness,

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:49.510 align:middle line:84%
you can make much
better decisions.

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:56.120 align:middle line:90%


00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And it begins to dawn on
you that you don't need

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.976 align:middle line:90%
to be impatient or frustrated.

00:25:02.976 --> 00:25:06.290 align:middle line:90%


00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:11.660 align:middle line:84%
You can do all you need to do
in a new and different way that

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.370 align:middle line:90%
feels good.

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:18.180 align:middle line:90%
You put yourself first.

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:21.930 align:middle line:84%
You no longer want to feel
those feelings of angst

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.330 align:middle line:90%
when you're rushing.

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And you double-check
with yourself

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:30.730 align:middle line:84%
if you really need to be
moving quite so quickly.

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:37.610 align:middle line:90%


00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:41.390 align:middle line:84%
You start to realize
that there really

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:45.830 align:middle line:84%
isn't that much need to
be quite so impatient,

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:50.420 align:middle line:84%
to get things done
quite so quickly,

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:55.220 align:middle line:84%
and that feeling of calm
begins in your stomach.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:26:00.910 align:middle line:84%
By relaxing and
letting go, you are

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:04.970 align:middle line:84%
allowing your body to
connect to your mind,

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:10.335 align:middle line:84%
letting go of tension,
putting yourself first.

00:26:10.335 --> 00:26:13.840 align:middle line:90%


00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:17.530 align:middle line:84%
You know that, with the
tension and stress and anxiety

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:22.990 align:middle line:84%
you're creating in those
moments of impatience,

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:29.320 align:middle line:84%
that will be affecting your
judgment, your decision making,

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:33.310 align:middle line:84%
but also your mental health
and your physical health.

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:36.070 align:middle line:90%


00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Those stress hormones
are damaging,

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:42.130 align:middle line:84%
and you no longer want
to be a part of it.

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:46.480 align:middle line:84%
You know that your
priorities are different now.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And you reassess
what really does

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:53.440 align:middle line:84%
have to be done quite so
quickly, quite so regularly.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:27:00.400 align:middle line:90%


00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:03.670 align:middle line:84%
You know that there are
times when other people don't

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:07.750 align:middle line:90%
react as quickly as you.

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:10.285 align:middle line:84%
And each person is
different and special.

00:27:10.285 --> 00:27:12.920 align:middle line:90%


00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And you know that,
as long as they're

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:21.760 align:middle line:84%
moving as quickly as they can,
as productively as they can,

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.660 align:middle line:84%
then that's the
best they can do.

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:26.370 align:middle line:90%


00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Everyone works at the pace
that's right for them,

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.845 align:middle line:90%
and you now appreciate this.

00:27:32.845 --> 00:27:35.520 align:middle line:90%


00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And you can be
surprised to discover

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:43.560 align:middle line:84%
how pleasant it is to sometimes
wait until the time is right.

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:49.500 align:middle line:90%


00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.920 align:middle line:84%
You double-check
with yourself if life

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:57.570 align:middle line:84%
will be that much different
if you move a little bit more

00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:01.665 align:middle line:84%
slowly and if others take
a little bit more time.

00:28:01.665 --> 00:28:08.150 align:middle line:90%


00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:12.360 align:middle line:84%
You're becoming more
efficient and productive,

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:17.210 align:middle line:84%
allowing yourself a little
bit more time and less stress

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:19.550 align:middle line:90%
hormones.

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:24.020 align:middle line:84%
With a calmer mind
and a calmer body,

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:28.550 align:middle line:90%
you're much more productive.

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And you can now allow yourself
to let go of the impatience

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.765 align:middle line:90%
and to embrace a calm mind.

00:28:35.765 --> 00:28:39.740 align:middle line:90%


00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:42.410 align:middle line:84%
You can allow yourself
to change the way

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:48.290 align:middle line:84%
you've got used to being
tense, to getting frustrated.

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And instead, you
can use that energy

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:54.560 align:middle line:84%
to be more productive
and more efficient,

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.770 align:middle line:84%
to conserve your
energy, and to finish

00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:01.640 align:middle line:84%
the task you want to
accomplish, but in a way

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.170 align:middle line:84%
that feels so much
more enjoyable.

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:09.300 align:middle line:90%


00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And it all begins with you
making that choice to change,

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:21.150 align:middle line:84%
taking in that deep breath
and reassessing that priority.

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Do you really have to get
it done straight away?

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:29.270 align:middle line:90%


00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:33.860 align:middle line:84%
That long, deep, powerful
breath in and out,

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:38.330 align:middle line:84%
fueling this new patient
and calm version of you.

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:41.720 align:middle line:90%


00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Simply by relaxing the
muscles in your stomach,

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:53.160 align:middle line:84%
you're allowing the
tension to leave your body,

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:58.120 align:middle line:84%
feeling and breathing
the way you want to.

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:02.340 align:middle line:84%
Feel the sense of patience
flowing through your body.

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:08.140 align:middle line:90%


00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:14.950 align:middle line:84%
Imagine yourself, now, as a much
more patient person, much more

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:17.510 align:middle line:90%
calm.

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:22.370 align:middle line:84%
Notice how you speak
now that you're calm.

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:25.280 align:middle line:90%
How do you look?

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Your shoulders are down,
and you have no frown lines.

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:33.230 align:middle line:84%
You look calm and peaceful
as you manage your tasks

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:34.545 align:middle line:90%
as calmly as possible.

00:30:34.545 --> 00:30:39.770 align:middle line:90%


00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:43.940 align:middle line:84%
You allow your body to slow
down to a comfortable rhythm.

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.810 align:middle line:90%


00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And you allow your body to
become familiar with the slower

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:56.560 align:middle line:84%
pace, changing thinking patterns
and changing behaviors now.

00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:00.390 align:middle line:90%


00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And even though you
may tense up at times,

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:12.320 align:middle line:84%
you now always have the ability
to reconnect to the new patient

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:21.010 align:middle line:84%
way of breathing,
reacting, and of feeling,

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:23.300 align:middle line:90%
physically and emotionally.

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:26.660 align:middle line:90%


00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:35.010 align:middle line:84%
You allow this feeling to become
part of you, to stay with you.

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And the more you listen
to this MindTalk audio,

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:43.940 align:middle line:84%
you know that you're
retraining your mind and body

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.960 align:middle line:84%
so that you no longer
instinctively tense

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.872 align:middle line:90%
up and become impatient.

00:31:48.872 --> 00:31:52.330 align:middle line:90%


00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Instead, you're
teaching your body

00:31:54.550 --> 00:32:00.640 align:middle line:84%
to take in those deep breaths,
starting at the stomach

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:07.980 align:middle line:84%
and working up to your mind,
where you slow everything down,

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:12.300 align:middle line:84%
still very much aware
and alert and even more

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:16.350 align:middle line:84%
productive than before,
but without the tension

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:19.200 align:middle line:84%
and impatience that
you used to feel.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.980 align:middle line:90%


00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And you're excited to
start making those changes,

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.370 align:middle line:90%
physically and emotionally.

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:37.410 align:middle line:90%


00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:39.840 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:42.930 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:45.960 align:middle line:84%
and will get more
and more powerful

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:49.910 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from one to five

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.640 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:33:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of five, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:05.570 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling
fantastic, bringing back

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:09.240 align:middle line:84%
with you all the
wonderful new feelings.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:10.510 align:middle line:90%
Coming back now.

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:19.300 align:middle line:90%
So 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:22.200 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:35.000 align:middle line:90%
