00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>> You are listening to the
self-esteem mind talk audio.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.660 align:middle line:84%
In a moment the hypnosis will
begin, but before it does,

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.410 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to remind you that
the following audio contains

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.530 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.160 align:middle line:84%
aim to help you get into a
deep state of relaxation.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.320 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.620 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:45.800 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.480 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.035 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:58.035 --> 00:01:01.710 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.690 align:middle line:84%
But right now there's
nothing at all

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.320 align:middle line:84%
that you need to do, apart
from close your eyes,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.000 align:middle line:84%
relax, lie back, and
let go, and really enjoy

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.170 align:middle line:84%
those peaceful feelings and all
the benefits that come with it.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Make yourself as
comfortable as possible

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.420 align:middle line:84%
and concentrate on
the sound of my voice.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.100 align:middle line:90%


00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And begin by drawing in
a long, slow, deep breath

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.360 align:middle line:90%
in through your nose.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.410 align:middle line:90%
Hold the breath for a moment.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And now slightly open your
mouth and release all the air

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.400 align:middle line:84%
from your body in a
long, low, deep sigh

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.620 align:middle line:84%
and relax, allowing your
lungs to naturally deflate

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.670 align:middle line:84%
as your body sinks into
a gentle relaxation nap.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.890 align:middle line:90%


00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.010 align:middle line:90%
And you can release any tension.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Relax, and let go as I
guide you through a journey

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.980 align:middle line:84%
of relaxation, a journey that
you will find very beneficial

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.600 align:middle line:90%
for your overall well-being.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.990 align:middle line:90%


00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.900 align:middle line:84%
You're going to start
this calming experience

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.065 align:middle line:84%
by first relaxing your
whole body-mind system.

00:02:31.065 --> 00:02:33.880 align:middle line:90%


00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's true to say that the
simple act of relaxing the body

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.550 align:middle line:84%
and mind has a positive knock-on
effect, because how you think

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.590 align:middle line:90%
determines you feel.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And how you feel influences
the world around you.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And how you choose
to think today

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.210 align:middle line:84%
affects your decisions
from here on in.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.750 align:middle line:84%
So to make my
assurances reality,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.800 align:middle line:84%
let's begin by
focusing your attention

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.190 align:middle line:90%
at the very top of your head.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Tension often starts at
the scalp and the neck.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.270 align:middle line:84%
So mentally and physically
allow all the muscles

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.870 align:middle line:84%
around the top of your
head to relax now,

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.810 align:middle line:84%
letting all the
tension simply dissolve

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.885 align:middle line:84%
as you start to tune into
your body-mind system.

00:03:36.885 --> 00:03:42.050 align:middle line:90%


00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Just let any tension you may
be holding to release that.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.400 align:middle line:90%
Allow your brain to relax.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.780 align:middle line:84%
The left and the right lobes
of the brain just releasing.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:02.380 align:middle line:84%
Such a simple thought, yet so
profound and so significant,

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.575 align:middle line:90%
just letting go completely.

00:04:04.575 --> 00:04:08.140 align:middle line:90%


00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Drifting further
and further down.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.720 align:middle line:90%
Nobody wanting anything.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.460 align:middle line:90%
Nobody needing anything.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.169 align:middle line:90%
This is your time to relax.

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.890 align:middle line:90%


00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.530 align:middle line:84%
Taking the relaxation
into the face

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:30.550 align:middle line:84%
now, allowing all of your
facial muscles to feel loose.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Feel your brow relaxing,
your forehead smoothing out,

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.445 align:middle line:90%
the back of your eyes relaxing.

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:41.280 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Tiny muscles around your
eyes and eyelids down

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.150 align:middle line:84%
into your cheeks and into
your jaw muscles just

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.760 align:middle line:90%
releasing and letting go.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.780 align:middle line:90%


00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Allowing your
tongue to fall away

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.050 align:middle line:90%
from the roof of your mouth.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And should you find you need
to swallow, just do that

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.900 align:middle line:84%
now and drift down and
down, deeper and deeper

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.830 align:middle line:90%
into blissful relaxation.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.550 align:middle line:90%


00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.340 align:middle line:84%
The more you physically
relax, the more

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.580 align:middle line:90%
you can mentally relax.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And when you can
mentally relax, you

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.640 align:middle line:90%
can think much more clearly.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And when you think more clearly,
your life becomes clearer.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.900 align:middle line:90%
You make better decisions.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And you're much more in
control of your days.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.970 align:middle line:90%


00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.840 align:middle line:84%
So noticing now how
your neck feels,

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:53.620 align:middle line:84%
relaxing all of your muscles,
letting go of the strain,

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.760 align:middle line:90%
letting go of the tension.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.930 align:middle line:90%


00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Allow the tension that you may
be holding in your shoulder

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.830 align:middle line:90%
to go now.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Feel the shoulders,
both of them,

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.530 align:middle line:84%
sinking into the
frame of your body.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.522 align:middle line:84%
Feel your neck lengthen
as you do this.

00:06:13.522 --> 00:06:17.110 align:middle line:90%


00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Feel or imagine all your
cares and worries just

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:27.270 align:middle line:84%
rolling off your shoulders now
as you take the relaxation down

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:33.440 align:middle line:84%
now into the tops of your
arms, letting any tension you

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.630 align:middle line:90%
may be holding just drain away.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.370 align:middle line:90%


00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And as your awareness floats
down through your upper arms

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.600 align:middle line:84%
into your elbows, all the
muscles in your forearms

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:57.370 align:middle line:84%
relax, right down to your
wrists, and into your hands,

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.070 align:middle line:84%
and way down into the very tips
of your fingers and thumbs.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:05.180 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.760 align:middle line:90%
Your arms are feeling so heavy.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.852 align:middle line:90%
Your body is so comfortable.

00:07:10.852 --> 00:07:13.690 align:middle line:90%


00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.530 align:middle line:84%
Nothing whatsoever to
do, but just relax,

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:22.048 align:middle line:84%
and enjoy this feeling
of total release now.

00:07:22.048 --> 00:07:27.910 align:middle line:90%


00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:32.578 align:middle line:84%
As you let go of all the
tension in those muscles,

00:07:32.578 --> 00:07:38.890 align:middle line:84%
you may experience them becoming
calmer and gently releasing.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:42.040 align:middle line:90%


00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Just tune into the feeling
of simply letting go.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:49.460 align:middle line:90%


00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.980 align:middle line:84%
As you become aware
of your breathing,

00:07:52.980 --> 00:08:00.228 align:middle line:84%
notice that you're now
breathing steadily and slowly,

00:08:00.228 --> 00:08:03.120 align:middle line:90%
rhythmically.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And with each exhale,
you feel yourself

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:11.370 align:middle line:84%
just relaxing even
more deeply, allowing

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:16.950 align:middle line:84%
any tension in the chest area
now to simply drain away,

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:20.340 align:middle line:84%
letting go completely
and totally.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:25.860 align:middle line:90%


00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Bring awareness into
your stomach now.

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:34.419 align:middle line:84%
And let all your
tummy muscles relax.

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And as you do, I
want you to imagine

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:41.010 align:middle line:84%
a ball of sunlight passing
down from the top of your head

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:46.010 align:middle line:84%
down through your face, your
throat, and into your stomach.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:49.960 align:middle line:90%


00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Visualize this healing
energy passing down

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:58.070 align:middle line:84%
through your throat, and
chest, and into your stomach.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:01.970 align:middle line:90%


00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:09.320 align:middle line:84%
So see and feel the sunlight
swirling and rotating.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And as the light glows, it
warms, and soothes, and heals.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And you release, and relax, and
drift down, and further down.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.950 align:middle line:90%


00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:31.562 align:middle line:84%
And in your imagination,
you send the sunlight out

00:09:31.562 --> 00:09:36.420 align:middle line:84%
now to every nerve cell,
bone, muscle, fiber,

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.970 align:middle line:90%
and system of the body.

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:43.480 align:middle line:84%
See it flowing through
the bloodstream.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.380 align:middle line:90%
Leave the light there.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:50.190 align:middle line:90%
It knows what to do.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:55.296 align:middle line:84%
As you take the relaxation
round into your back muscles,

00:09:55.296 --> 00:09:59.340 align:middle line:84%
and from your back muscles,
it relaxes those muscles

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:03.100 align:middle line:90%
either side of the spine.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Releasing, relaxing,
and just letting

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:12.498 align:middle line:90%
go now, deeper and deeper now.

00:10:12.498 --> 00:10:17.180 align:middle line:90%


00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:22.460 align:middle line:84%
As you relax your waist and
the muscles of your low stomach

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:26.400 align:middle line:84%
and down into the
pelvic area all the way

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.030 align:middle line:84%
down through the
large thigh muscles,

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:34.472 align:middle line:84%
down through your knees,
your shins, and your calves.

00:10:34.472 --> 00:10:37.360 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:43.470 align:middle line:84%
Just allow all those areas of
the body to relax and let go.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:48.860 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:54.114 align:middle line:84%
You're so relaxed, so
heavy, so comfortable.

00:10:54.114 --> 00:10:56.960 align:middle line:90%


00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And now tune into that
comfortable feeling

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:07.622 align:middle line:84%
as you think on down to your
ankles, and to your feet,

00:11:07.622 --> 00:11:10.705 align:middle line:84%
and right down to the
very tips of your toes.

00:11:10.705 --> 00:11:13.672 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.672 --> 00:11:18.960 align:middle line:84%
All the muscles of your body
now are so beautifully relaxed.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And you feel very heavy
and very comfortable.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling centered and
relaxed, and fully in control.

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:36.630 align:middle line:90%


00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.565 align:middle line:84%
If there are any
areas of your body

00:11:38.565 --> 00:11:41.730 align:middle line:84%
that still feel
tight and tense, you

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:45.150 align:middle line:84%
find that you can relax them
simply by giving yourself

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:46.836 align:middle line:90%
permission to do so.

00:11:46.836 --> 00:11:50.570 align:middle line:90%


00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And you can now go even deeper
as I count down from 8 to 0.

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:57.720 align:middle line:90%


00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And with every number you
feel yourself drifting further

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:02.910 align:middle line:90%
into blissful relaxation.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.850 align:middle line:90%


00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:16.670 align:middle line:90%
So 8, 7, 6, 5.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:19.040 align:middle line:90%
Deeper now.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:28.740 align:middle line:90%
4, 3, 2, 1, and 0.

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Deeply relaxed, letting go
of all the cares and worries,

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.280 align:middle line:84%
all the tension, and pressure,
and stresses, and strains.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.890 align:middle line:90%


00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Let them all ease from your
body, and ease from your mind,

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:51.930 align:middle line:84%
and allow yourself to drift
down into a deeper and blissful

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:54.530 align:middle line:90%
state of creative relaxation.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:13:00.310 align:middle line:90%


00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, in your
imagination, I'd like

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:04.420 align:middle line:84%
you to imagine that
you're standing

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:09.770 align:middle line:84%
on the top of a hill
on a beautiful island.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's a lovely
warm summer's day.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:18.920 align:middle line:84%
There's a clear blue sky,
not a cloud in sight.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.812 align:middle line:84%
And the temperature is
just how you like it.

00:13:21.812 --> 00:13:24.590 align:middle line:90%


00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:28.220 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the gentle
warmth of the sun on your head

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.500 align:middle line:90%
and shoulders.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And you can hear
the sounds of nature

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:35.985 align:middle line:84%
all around you, making you
feel even more relaxed.

00:13:35.985 --> 00:13:41.600 align:middle line:90%


00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:46.370 align:middle line:84%
The long grass in the
meadow below sways slightly.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And you can see a
winding path that

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:52.040 align:middle line:84%
disappears into a
small apple orchard

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.072 align:middle line:90%
just at the bottom of the hill.

00:13:54.072 --> 00:13:56.970 align:middle line:90%


00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And just beyond the orchard,
you can see the sea.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:05.670 align:middle line:84%
The sunlight darting off
the tops of the waves.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.550 align:middle line:84%
The whole ocean
shimmering and sparkling.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:12.820 align:middle line:90%


00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:18.000 align:middle line:84%
You begin to move easily
down the path now,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.500 align:middle line:84%
noticing the grass
springing under your feet,

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.800 align:middle line:84%
pushing you encouragingly
towards your destination.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.490 align:middle line:90%


00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And you catch the faint smell
of sea air in the breeze

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:39.900 align:middle line:84%
as you get closer to the
ocean as you stroll down,

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.910 align:middle line:90%
down the winding path.

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And you move
smoothly and easily.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And you feel relaxed, and
centered, and fully in control.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:55.450 align:middle line:90%


00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:59.388 align:middle line:84%
And you're becoming aware now,
a growing calm within you.

00:14:59.388 --> 00:15:02.810 align:middle line:90%


00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.990 align:middle line:84%
You stop to look at the
beautiful flowers growing

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:13.260 align:middle line:84%
each side of the path, their
colors so vivid and bright.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And you stand there for a
moment taking in the view.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:22.020 align:middle line:84%
A feeling of happiness flows
through you, continuing down.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:27.770 align:middle line:90%


00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:35.190 align:middle line:84%
You're aware now of a deep sense
of calmness and tranquility,

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:39.420 align:middle line:84%
right from the top of your
head to the tips of your toes,

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.208 align:middle line:84%
renewing your energy,
feeling wonderful.

00:15:42.208 --> 00:15:45.420 align:middle line:90%


00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.675 align:middle line:84%
As you walk, you find yourself
almost floating as though

00:15:48.675 --> 00:15:51.755 align:middle line:90%
in a dream down to the orchard.

00:15:51.755 --> 00:15:54.665 align:middle line:90%


00:15:54.665 --> 00:16:00.080 align:middle line:84%
You move with such ease,
with no effort whatsoever.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And in no time,
you find yourself

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:06.370 align:middle line:84%
drifting through
the fruit trees with

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:12.130 align:middle line:84%
the lush, cool, green foliage
forming a canopy overhead.

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And you see the
sunlight glittering

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.160 align:middle line:90%
through the branches.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:19.630 align:middle line:90%


00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And as you stand there, you
feel the glittering sunlight

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:26.830 align:middle line:90%
on your face and neck.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And you feel and
experience it vibrating

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:32.125 align:middle line:84%
throughout your entire
body-mind system.

00:16:32.125 --> 00:16:37.260 align:middle line:90%


00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And as the sunlight moves, it
glows, and warms, and soothes,

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.470 align:middle line:90%
and heals your body and mind.

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And you release, and relax,
and move down, and down,

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:57.690 align:middle line:84%
taking in another deep breath,
relaxing even more now.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:02.870 align:middle line:90%


00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.030 align:middle line:84%
You can hear the
sound of the ocean

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:08.120 align:middle line:90%
as you move nearer and nearer.

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And with every
step you take, you

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:14.930 align:middle line:84%
feel more relaxed
and more calm as you

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:18.950 align:middle line:84%
follow that winding path
that leads you downwards.

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:22.310 align:middle line:90%


00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:23.690 align:middle line:90%
You turn a corner.

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And to your delight,
you find yourself

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.669 align:middle line:90%
on a beautiful deserted beach.

00:17:28.669 --> 00:17:31.980 align:middle line:90%


00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:36.450 align:middle line:84%
The beach sweeping away into
a small bay in front of me.

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And the ocean is a striking
turquoise blue, pure and clear.

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel the warm
sand underneath your shoes.

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.380 align:middle line:90%
And you take your shoes off.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And you start walking
lazily across the beach

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.091 align:middle line:90%
to the water's edge.

00:17:56.091 --> 00:17:58.920 align:middle line:90%


00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.250 align:middle line:84%
You feel the sand
beneath your feet.

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And you feel the
sand change from cool

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:10.164 align:middle line:84%
to moist beneath your feet as
you wander along the shoreline.

00:18:10.164 --> 00:18:15.490 align:middle line:90%


00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:17.800 align:middle line:84%
As you turn around,
you start to walk up

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:22.330 align:middle line:84%
the beach towards
a grassy mound.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And as you walk up slowly, you
take in the smell of the ocean.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And you hear the
sound of the water

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.000 align:middle line:90%
hissing over the warm sand.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.310 align:middle line:90%


00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:40.740 align:middle line:84%
You reach the mound
now, and you sit down,

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.603 align:middle line:90%
making yourself comfortable.

00:18:42.603 --> 00:18:46.230 align:middle line:90%


00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And as you gaze out across
the breathtaking scene,

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:54.770 align:middle line:84%
you watch the waves roll
in and roll out again,

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:59.180 align:middle line:90%
rhythmically in and out again.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:04.090 align:middle line:90%


00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:07.360 align:middle line:84%
You play with the sand
through your fingers,

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.750 align:middle line:90%
noticing just how good you feel.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:14.070 align:middle line:90%
So relaxed now.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:18.420 align:middle line:84%
So relaxed that you've opened
up your subconscious mind.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And you're ready to start
making those changes you wanted

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.880 align:middle line:90%
to make once and for all.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:30.660 align:middle line:84%
As you continue to
listen to this mind talk,

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:34.470 align:middle line:84%
you can enjoy a
process of change

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:39.190 align:middle line:90%
with regards to your self-image.

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And you can begin
to make changes

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:46.040 align:middle line:84%
on a subconscious
level, which will then

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.515 align:middle line:84%
start to show in your body
language and behavior.

00:19:49.515 --> 00:19:54.890 align:middle line:90%


00:19:54.890 --> 00:20:01.550 align:middle line:84%
So imagine yourself now standing
in front of a large window.

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And see yourself now looking
in through the window.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And you see someone
that you know loves you.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.940 align:middle line:84%
You may not recognize
that person.

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.880 align:middle line:84%
All you know is
that they love you

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:23.284 align:middle line:84%
deeply for the wonderful
person that you are.

00:20:23.284 --> 00:20:26.730 align:middle line:90%


00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:30.360 align:middle line:84%
You may be curious about how
you know that they love you.

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.880 align:middle line:90%


00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:38.120 align:middle line:84%
What do they do to demonstrate
that they love you?

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:41.720 align:middle line:90%
How do they behave?

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.370 align:middle line:90%
What do they think?

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:46.060 align:middle line:90%
How do they talk?

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.570 align:middle line:84%
How do they show
that they love you?

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:53.450 align:middle line:90%


00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:58.060 align:middle line:84%
You think about all the
things they love about you--

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:02.800 align:middle line:84%
your personality
traits, the things

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:13.060 align:middle line:84%
you have done for others, the
achievements you have made,

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.820 align:middle line:84%
the changes you have
made in your life,

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.200 align:middle line:90%
the way you treat others.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:22.180 align:middle line:90%


00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.730 align:middle line:84%
The person that you
see through the window

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:26.570 align:middle line:90%
loves you for who you are.

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:27.780 align:middle line:90%
And it feels good.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:32.640 align:middle line:90%


00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:38.670 align:middle line:84%
You may wonder what it would
be like to become that person,

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:43.100 align:middle line:84%
to become that person
who is so loved no matter

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:44.435 align:middle line:90%
what's happened in the past.

00:21:44.435 --> 00:21:50.890 align:middle line:90%


00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And so now see yourself
within that person.

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:59.195 align:middle line:84%
You are now that person
who loves you so much.

00:21:59.195 --> 00:22:01.760 align:middle line:90%


00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And as you begin to see the
world through that person's

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:10.810 align:middle line:84%
eyes, you can start to
catch a glimpse of yourself,

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:14.260 align:middle line:84%
and begin to see
that you over there

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.210 align:middle line:84%
through the eyes
of the person that

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:20.440 align:middle line:84%
loves you, seeing what
they see that makes

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.100 align:middle line:90%
them love you so much.

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:25.950 align:middle line:90%


00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:31.460 align:middle line:84%
You can feel all the things that
this person loves about you,

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:36.620 align:middle line:84%
all your personality traits, the
things you've done for others,

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:41.080 align:middle line:84%
the achievements you've
made, the changes you've

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:45.618 align:middle line:84%
made in your life, the
way you treat others.

00:22:45.618 --> 00:22:48.900 align:middle line:90%


00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And the person that you
see through the window

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.250 align:middle line:84%
loves you for who you
are, and it feels good.

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:59.280 align:middle line:90%


00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:05.110 align:middle line:84%
I would like you now to think
about a beautiful garden.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And as you look at the grass
in the beautiful garden,

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:15.400 align:middle line:84%
you'll notice that the grass
is neat, and even looks

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.140 align:middle line:90%
absolutely perfect.

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:21.590 align:middle line:90%


00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:23.300 align:middle line:90%
You take a step closer.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And you bend down to take
a closer look at the grass.

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And you notice that
each blade of grass

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.616 align:middle line:90%
is completely different.

00:23:33.616 --> 00:23:37.270 align:middle line:90%


00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:43.020 align:middle line:84%
Yet all of the blades
together share a similarity,

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:48.520 align:middle line:84%
just like every single person on
the planet shares a similarity.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we're all unique
and different in our own way.

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:55.330 align:middle line:90%


00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:59.800 align:middle line:84%
You're absolutely
unique to everyone else.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And you have so many positive
qualities and aspects

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:07.710 align:middle line:90%
that others like about you.

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And you focus on how
you believe in yourself,

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.330 align:middle line:84%
and you believe in
what you can do.

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:19.140 align:middle line:90%


00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Just like that person you saw
who loves you for who you are.

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:26.230 align:middle line:90%


00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:28.730 align:middle line:84%
All your different
personality traits,

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:32.260 align:middle line:84%
there may be some you
don't quite like as much.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:36.020 align:middle line:84%
But there will be
some that others love.

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And you enjoy that
feeling of stepping

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:41.420 align:middle line:84%
into someone else's
shoes and looking

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.265 align:middle line:90%
at yourself from the outside.

00:24:43.265 --> 00:24:46.600 align:middle line:90%


00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.870 align:middle line:84%
You notice that actually
you are interesting.

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:52.410 align:middle line:90%
You are fun.

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:56.150 align:middle line:90%
You are kind and caring.

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
things lead to people

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:02.210 align:middle line:90%
wanting to be around you.

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And the more you realize this,
the more your confidence grows.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.830 align:middle line:84%
The more people become
interested in you,

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:13.990 align:middle line:84%
and in turn, again,
your confidence

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:16.300 align:middle line:84%
grows stronger and
stronger again.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:22.080 align:middle line:90%


00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And you know that you can't be
confident that you'll always

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:29.610 align:middle line:90%
succeed, of course.

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:34.350 align:middle line:84%
But you can be confident that
you'll always do your best.

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:35.595 align:middle line:90%
And that is enough.

00:25:35.595 --> 00:25:38.940 align:middle line:90%


00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:42.240 align:middle line:84%
You've done so much in
your life that you probably

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:47.080 align:middle line:84%
didn't spend much time thinking
about, and congratulating

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:53.170 align:middle line:84%
yourself about all that you've
done, all that you've achieved,

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:55.390 align:middle line:84%
and the positive
impact that you've

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:56.965 align:middle line:90%
had on the lives of others.

00:25:56.965 --> 00:26:00.790 align:middle line:90%


00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And so whilst you listen
to this, or at a time when

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:10.590 align:middle line:84%
you have a moment
to sit and think,

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:14.420 align:middle line:84%
you can think about
the good that you've

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:19.970 align:middle line:84%
done throughout your life, and
the positive impact that you've

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:26.190 align:middle line:84%
had on others, and
times you're proud of.

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And you make this a regular
part of your routine.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:34.220 align:middle line:90%


00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:37.892 align:middle line:84%
You don't dwell on any
mistakes you've made,

00:26:37.892 --> 00:26:41.150 align:middle line:84%
or any traits you don't
like about yourself.

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:45.580 align:middle line:84%
This is your time to focus
on the positive impacts,

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:46.900 align:middle line:90%
your positive traits.

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:51.420 align:middle line:90%


00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:54.630 align:middle line:84%
You remind yourself of
at least one good thing

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:57.330 align:middle line:84%
you've done that
day, no matter how

00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:01.210 align:middle line:84%
small, whether it's
an achievement,

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:06.620 align:middle line:84%
or a smile you gave someone, or
a thank you, which made someone

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:07.420 align:middle line:90%
smile.

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:10.780 align:middle line:90%


00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:13.630 align:middle line:84%
You allow these small
and large gestures

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:18.580 align:middle line:84%
to grow your self-esteem and
self-assurance every day.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:23.140 align:middle line:90%


00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Your confidence and
self-esteem grows

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:28.260 align:middle line:90%
stronger each and every day.

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:32.040 align:middle line:90%


00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Let it be part of your
routine to tell yourself

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:36.680 align:middle line:90%
what you're proud of.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.570 align:middle line:90%


00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Remind yourself of the
positive impacts you're making,

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:46.890 align:middle line:84%
of your achievements,
no matter how small.

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:50.280 align:middle line:84%
It's now part of
your daily routine.

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's at
the end of the day,

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:56.100 align:middle line:84%
or the first thing
in the morning,

00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:03.080 align:middle line:84%
remind yourself of one small
thing, no matter how small,

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.450 align:middle line:90%
how large.

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And allow that
self-esteem to grow now.

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:11.390 align:middle line:90%
No dwelling on negativity here.

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:14.750 align:middle line:84%
This is your time to
work on your self-esteem.

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:23.240 align:middle line:90%


00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.640 align:middle line:84%
You can walk around
with your head held

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:31.820 align:middle line:84%
high, confident and proud
of the fact that you're

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:38.540 align:middle line:84%
kind and loving, and that you're
an understanding person who

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:41.870 align:middle line:90%
has a lot to offer.

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And if other people haven't
recognized that yet,

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:45.900 align:middle line:90%
they will soon.

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:48.540 align:middle line:90%


00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And you know that if you don't
have self-esteem yourself

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:56.010 align:middle line:84%
and respect for yourself,
it's difficult for others

00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:58.410 align:middle line:90%
to find that in you.

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:02.070 align:middle line:84%
So from now on, allow
that self-esteem

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:05.690 align:middle line:84%
to grow, and see the changes
taking place around you.

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:08.510 align:middle line:90%


00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:11.850 align:middle line:84%
You can feel proud and
confident about yourself.

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:17.450 align:middle line:90%


00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:21.230 align:middle line:84%
With your new
self-confidence, you

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:28.100 align:middle line:84%
can be more assertive and more
sure of yourself, more willing

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.350 align:middle line:84%
to create, and to
achieve your goals.

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:34.450 align:middle line:90%


00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And with each and every goal you
achieve, no matter how small,

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:43.140 align:middle line:90%
allow your confidence to grow.

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:45.375 align:middle line:90%
Allow your self-esteem to grow.

00:29:45.375 --> 00:29:47.880 align:middle line:90%


00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:53.990 align:middle line:84%
You stop any negative inner
thinking, for this is harmful,

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:57.410 align:middle line:90%
and you stop it from now on.

00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:00.410 align:middle line:84%
Your inner monologue is
filled with positivity.

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:03.810 align:middle line:90%


00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:07.980 align:middle line:84%
You remind yourself of
your goals, your impact,

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:11.565 align:middle line:84%
and allow that confidence to
grow and to show to others.

00:30:11.565 --> 00:30:16.730 align:middle line:90%


00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you now feel more
confident to approach others,

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:28.140 align:middle line:84%
and to initiate a conversation,
to have the confidence

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:34.110 align:middle line:84%
to make your own suggestions,
to make up your own mind,

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:37.680 align:middle line:90%
and to stand by what you think.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.975 align:middle line:84%
And others will respect
you for this hugely.

00:30:39.975 --> 00:30:44.480 align:middle line:90%


00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling so
much more self-assured.

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:53.540 align:middle line:84%
You have the confidence
to ask more questions.

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And your knowledge
increases, giving you

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.410 align:middle line:90%
more confidence still.

00:30:57.410 --> 00:31:01.430 align:middle line:90%


00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:06.850 align:middle line:84%
You're feeling happy and
content with yourself.

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And you therefore have
no need to judge others.

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And if others judge you,
you feel compassion,

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:18.940 align:middle line:84%
because they don't have the
same confidence in themselves

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:20.560 align:middle line:90%
that you have in yourself.

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:28.670 align:middle line:90%


00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:33.440 align:middle line:84%
From now on you are a new
person, a stronger character

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:40.170 align:middle line:84%
with a determined fight, filled
with courage and determination.

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And your confidence grows
more and more every day.

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:47.850 align:middle line:90%
You lift your head up.

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:50.550 align:middle line:90%
You place your shoulders back.

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And you face the world
with gusto and confidence

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:56.910 align:middle line:84%
as you know that you
now have the strength

00:31:56.910 --> 00:32:00.825 align:middle line:84%
and courage within you that you
have been lacking in the past.

00:32:00.825 --> 00:32:04.410 align:middle line:90%


00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And you know that the more
you listen to this mind talk,

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:13.810 align:middle line:84%
the more you'll see
that self-esteem grow.

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:15.550 align:middle line:84%
The more it grows,
the more it will

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:20.380 align:middle line:84%
show in your body language,
and the more others

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:23.272 align:middle line:90%
will be drawn to.

00:32:23.272 --> 00:32:26.290 align:middle line:90%
And you enjoy those changes.

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And in turn, your
confidence grows again.

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:35.070 align:middle line:90%


00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:37.530 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:40.770 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:43.170 align:middle line:84%
and will get more
and more powerful

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:45.120 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:48.990 align:middle line:90%


00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from 1 to 5

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.140 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of 5, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:03.450 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling
fantastic, bringing back

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:07.120 align:middle line:84%
with you all the
wonderful new feelings.

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.510 align:middle line:90%
Coming back now.

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:17.740 align:middle line:90%
So 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:20.670 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:30.000 align:middle line:90%
