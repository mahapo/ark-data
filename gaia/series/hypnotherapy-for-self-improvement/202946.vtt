00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:11.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Welcome to House
of Well-being.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.720 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the
Happier mind talk audio.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.330 align:middle line:84%
In a moment the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.940 align:middle line:84%
But before it does I'd
just like to remind you

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.440 align:middle line:84%
that the following
audio contains

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.020 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.720 align:middle line:84%
aim to help you reach a
deep level of relaxation.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.130 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.410 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.910 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.100 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.040 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.540 align:middle line:84%
But right now there's
nothing at all

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.820 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.610 align:middle line:84%
relax, lie back, and
let go and really enjoy

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.780 align:middle line:84%
those peaceful feelings and all
the benefits that come with it.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.020 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.420 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now
to make yourself

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.200 align:middle line:84%
as comfortable as
possible and listen

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.510 align:middle line:90%
to the sound of my voice.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.820 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And as you do so, you may be
aware of other sounds going on

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.080 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.790 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.810 align:middle line:84%
But you know that
they're not important.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.550 align:middle line:84%
They don't matter at all,
and you can dismiss them out

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.530 align:middle line:84%
of your awareness and
focus your mind entirely

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.580 align:middle line:90%
on what I'm saying.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.500 align:middle line:90%


00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.790 align:middle line:84%
This is your time, and
you make the most of it.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.510 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.980 align:middle line:84%
No one needs or wants
anything from you at all.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.480 align:middle line:90%


00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to take
a deep breath, filling

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.900 align:middle line:90%
your lungs as much as you can.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.560 align:middle line:90%
And let it out slowly.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.700 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And again take in a
long, slow breath.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.500 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready,
let it out slowly.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.400 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.900 align:middle line:84%
Now you can allow your
breathing to return to normal.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.770 align:middle line:90%
Gentle breaths in and out.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.350 align:middle line:90%


00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.800 align:middle line:84%
Returning to your normal
gentle breathing pace.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.620 align:middle line:90%


00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now
to imagine yourself

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.830 align:middle line:84%
outside in your favorite
place in nature.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.140 align:middle line:90%


00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a peaceful
tropical beach,

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.585 align:middle line:84%
or it could be a
beautiful garden.

00:02:54.585 --> 00:02:57.850 align:middle line:90%


00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can
imagine lying back

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.095 align:middle line:84%
on a boat which is sailing
on a tranquil river.

00:03:03.095 --> 00:03:05.620 align:middle line:90%


00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.620 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't
matter where you are as

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.470 align:middle line:90%
long as it feels good to you.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.880 align:middle line:90%


00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.020 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful day.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:25.240 align:middle line:84%
The sky is a special
shade of blue so clear.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.420 align:middle line:90%
And it's a warm summer's day.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.170 align:middle line:90%


00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.880 align:middle line:84%
There's a breeze gently
blowing over you,

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.990 align:middle line:84%
and the temperature is
just how you like it.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:46.190 align:middle line:90%


00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And in the sky is a
dazzling sun so bright

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.840 align:middle line:84%
that you just want
to close your eyes

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.340 align:middle line:84%
and feel the glowing, healing
warmth of the sun on your body.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.350 align:middle line:90%


00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly you find
that you can direct that sun

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.200 align:middle line:90%
over and around your body.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And as you realize
this, you begin

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.460 align:middle line:84%
to direct the light from
the sun over your face.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.570 align:middle line:90%


00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.510 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the healing
warmth of the light

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.850 align:middle line:84%
from the sun over your face,
just relaxing those muscles

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.815 align:middle line:84%
around the eyes, around the
nose and mouth and your brow.

00:04:35.815 --> 00:04:39.390 align:middle line:90%


00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And as you do this, you find
that your facial muscles

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.920 align:middle line:84%
begin to flatten
out as they relax,

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.870 align:middle line:90%
and you let go completely.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.310 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful day.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.440 align:middle line:84%
You move the light from the
sun into the throat area,

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.810 align:middle line:84%
feeling the warmth of the light
from the sun in your throat,

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.640 align:middle line:84%
relaxing all the muscles, just
letting go completely now.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.750 align:middle line:90%


00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And the warm sunlight now
moving into your shoulders

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.220 align:middle line:84%
and across your
shoulders, making them

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:33.430 align:middle line:84%
feel loose and limp
and comfortable

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.850 align:middle line:84%
as your shoulders sink into
the frame of your body.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:42.110 align:middle line:90%


00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:49.125 align:middle line:84%
And you feel so comfortable
now, so relaxed and at peace.

00:05:49.125 --> 00:05:52.620 align:middle line:90%


00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And you let nothing bother
or concern you at all.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.510 align:middle line:90%


00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And do you direct the
light from the sun

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.620 align:middle line:84%
down your right arm
from the shoulders

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.550 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your fingers.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.875 align:middle line:84%
The right arm begins
to relax and let go.

00:06:13.875 --> 00:06:16.910 align:middle line:90%


00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful feeling
to be here right now.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.400 align:middle line:90%


00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.620 align:middle line:84%
The warmth of the
light from the sun

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.770 align:middle line:84%
penetrates the nose and bones
and muscles of that right arm.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:35.700 align:middle line:90%


00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a beautiful
day, you move the sun over

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:46.740 align:middle line:84%
to your left arm and guide the
light from the sun down and up

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:54.000 align:middle line:84%
your left arm from the top of
your shoulders all the way down

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.410 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your fingers.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.060 align:middle line:90%


00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:03.940 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the left arm
relaxing, becoming comfortably

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.730 align:middle line:90%
heavy and totally relaxed.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:13.230 align:middle line:90%


00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:19.890 align:middle line:84%
Now move that warm light
across and into the chest area

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:24.328 align:middle line:84%
and relax the chest,
all the muscles there.

00:07:24.328 --> 00:07:27.200 align:middle line:90%


00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Now down to the stomach,
relaxing your tummy and down

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.390 align:middle line:84%
into your hips and your
thighs over to your right leg.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.030 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:43.960 align:middle line:84%
The light warms the muscles
as you relax your right leg.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Let it feel comfortable
and heavy now.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.530 align:middle line:90%


00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Now move the light from the sun
down your right leg up and down

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.120 align:middle line:84%
from the top of the hips
to the tips of your toes

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.950 align:middle line:84%
as the right leg
relaxes and you let go.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:08.300 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a beautiful
day, you now move a light

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:14.060 align:middle line:90%
into your left leg.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:19.850 align:middle line:84%
You move it up and down the left
leg from the top of the hips

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:24.380 align:middle line:84%
to the tips of your toes
and your left leg relaxes,

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:29.160 align:middle line:84%
releasing tension,
letting go now completely.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.289 align:middle line:90%


00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Your whole body is now
totally and completely relaxed

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.850 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your
head all the way down

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:44.260 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.180 align:middle line:90%


00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And as your body relaxes,
your mind also relaxes.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:57.400 align:middle line:90%


00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And I want you now to
notice that the sun is

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:07.550 align:middle line:84%
setting going down now
deeper and deeper down.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And you're so deeply
relaxed but still

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.320 align:middle line:90%
completely alert and aware.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.350 align:middle line:90%


00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.620 align:middle line:84%
You resist the temptation
to fall asleep.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.960 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is thoroughly
relaxed, but you

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.670 align:middle line:90%
stay focused on these words.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:27.070 align:middle line:90%


00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:30.690 align:middle line:84%
So now I'd like you to
use your imagination,

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:35.100 align:middle line:84%
and once again, you're in a
wonderful place in nature.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:39.690 align:middle line:84%
The trees are a
beautiful shade of green.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:42.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a stunning day, and the
sun is shining down on you.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:46.230 align:middle line:90%


00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:50.070 align:middle line:84%
There's a soft and
gentle breeze in the air,

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.995 align:middle line:84%
making you feel pleasantly
relaxed and calm.

00:09:52.995 --> 00:09:56.460 align:middle line:90%


00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:00.690 align:middle line:84%
All around, you can see
trees and plants and an array

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:06.010 align:middle line:84%
of the most beautiful
flowers you have ever seen,

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:09.310 align:middle line:90%
so colorful and vibrant.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And you can smell the rich
aroma of these flowers,

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.220 align:middle line:90%
making you feel so peaceful.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:19.510 align:middle line:90%


00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.360 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else matters right now.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.105 align:middle line:84%
You feel completely
at ease and so calm.

00:10:25.105 --> 00:10:28.160 align:middle line:90%


00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And in the distance, you
can hear the sound of water

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.235 align:middle line:90%
flowing slowly and gently.

00:10:33.235 --> 00:10:37.100 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.585 align:middle line:84%
The sound of water is helping
you to go more and more deeply

00:10:40.585 --> 00:10:41.385 align:middle line:90%
relaxed.

00:10:41.385 --> 00:10:44.260 align:middle line:90%


00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.790 align:middle line:84%
You may feel your muscles
are loosening more and more,

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.695 align:middle line:84%
relaxing with a beautiful
flowing sound of water.

00:10:50.695 --> 00:10:55.500 align:middle line:90%


00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Out of curiosity, you decide to
follow the sound of the water,

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.640 align:middle line:84%
and you feel excited about
where it's leading you,

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.500 align:middle line:84%
knowing deep within
yourself you're

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:12.010 align:middle line:84%
going into a very special
place, a place where you're

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:14.860 align:middle line:84%
going to create some
positive, wonderful,

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.145 align:middle line:90%
long-lasting changes.

00:11:16.145 --> 00:11:20.470 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:24.790 align:middle line:84%
As you walk slowly
towards the water,

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:29.800 align:middle line:84%
you can hear the sound of
birds singing in the trees.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.580 align:middle line:90%
You feel totally at ease.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:35.350 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:38.620 align:middle line:84%
As you finally
reach the lake, you

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:43.360 align:middle line:84%
realize it's the most beautiful
vision you've ever seen,

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.090 align:middle line:84%
and you're in awe of the
beauty that surrounds you.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:50.100 align:middle line:90%


00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:54.240 align:middle line:84%
The vast lake is filled
with a variety of colors,

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:59.730 align:middle line:84%
rich colors of blues,
turquoises, and light greens,

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:03.290 align:middle line:84%
and it fills your mind and
body with a wave of relaxation.

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:06.240 align:middle line:90%


00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.990 align:middle line:84%
You may be becoming more relaxed
with each and every breath

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:18.240 align:middle line:84%
you take, feeling more calm,
more peaceful, and more

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.765 align:middle line:90%
relaxed than ever before.

00:12:19.765 --> 00:12:23.420 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Your mind may be
drifting in and out,

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:32.010 align:middle line:84%
just letting go deeper
and deeper still.

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:36.900 align:middle line:84%
You may feel as though your
mind is flowing gently,

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.940 align:middle line:84%
flowing gently like the
lake in your imagination.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.530 align:middle line:90%


00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.860 align:middle line:84%
You look into the distance,
and you can see a wooden bridge

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.150 align:middle line:90%
leading over the lake.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:50.820 align:middle line:90%


00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.670 align:middle line:84%
You walk towards the bridge
feeling more and more

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:54.660 align:middle line:90%
deeply relaxed.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.260 align:middle line:90%


00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.030 align:middle line:84%
As you reach the
bridge, you can see

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:02.525 align:middle line:84%
there are 10 steps leading over
to the other side of the lake.

00:13:02.525 --> 00:13:06.650 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:10.360 align:middle line:84%
You slowly start
walking over the bridge,

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.115 align:middle line:90%
counting the steps in your mind.

00:13:12.115 --> 00:13:14.910 align:middle line:90%


00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:26.700 align:middle line:84%
10, 9, deeper and
deeper still, 8, 7,

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:37.590 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to
relaxation now, , 6, 5, and 4,

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:44.880 align:middle line:84%
drifting off peacefully
and easily, 3, 2,

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:51.330 align:middle line:84%
all the way down deeply
to relaxed, and 1.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.540 align:middle line:84%
You see a comfortable
padded chair,

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.820 align:middle line:84%
and you take a seat
ready to embrace

00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:01.080 align:middle line:84%
the changes to come in your
deep state of relaxation now.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:06.440 align:middle line:90%


00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And as you relax peacefully
and comfortably, let's

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.170 align:middle line:90%
focus on the issue of happiness.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:16.750 align:middle line:90%


00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.930 align:middle line:84%
You know that while some
factors that affect happiness

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:23.530 align:middle line:84%
are out of your control,
there are always

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.245 align:middle line:84%
actions we can take to
increase our good feelings.

00:14:26.245 --> 00:14:29.720 align:middle line:90%


00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.290 align:middle line:84%
One is by starting to
be good to yourself.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And that may sound self-evident,
but too many people

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.210 align:middle line:84%
skip this step by either
making other people happy

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:45.600 align:middle line:84%
or by trying to make
themselves happy by chasing

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.660 align:middle line:84%
ever higher goals while
holding themselves

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.060 align:middle line:84%
to ever greater
standards of perfection.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:56.250 align:middle line:90%


00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:59.280 align:middle line:84%
Ironically, being
good to yourself

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.920 align:middle line:84%
brings you closer to
achieving your ambitions

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.940 align:middle line:84%
and now brings you more
self-confidence and much more

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:06.740 align:middle line:90%
happiness.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:13.110 align:middle line:90%


00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:15.410 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the happiest
people go out

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:19.040 align:middle line:84%
of their way to treat
themselves right

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.450 align:middle line:84%
and do something nice for
themselves each and every day.

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:25.060 align:middle line:90%


00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:28.270 align:middle line:84%
They set appropriate boundaries
and take care of themselves

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.872 align:middle line:84%
by saying no to things
when they need to.

00:15:30.872 --> 00:15:33.590 align:middle line:90%


00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:36.730 align:middle line:84%
So from now on, you commit
to doing one nice thing

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:38.330 align:middle line:90%
for yourself each day.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:41.070 align:middle line:90%


00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:45.490 align:middle line:84%
You no longer seek
perfection or beat yourself

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:49.780 align:middle line:84%
up if you haven't done
some, instead choosing

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:56.220 align:middle line:84%
to forgive yourself all and give
yourself a much needed break,

00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:01.170 align:middle line:84%
no longer seeking perfection,
just joy and happiness.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:05.360 align:middle line:84%
As you think to yourself
will this make me happy

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.130 align:middle line:84%
and for the things that no
longer do, you let them go.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:11.370 align:middle line:90%


00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Your self-acceptance
as high as you

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.400 align:middle line:84%
learn to love yourself
more and more,

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.640 align:middle line:84%
believing in what you're
doing, the path you're on,

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.960 align:middle line:90%
and the choices that you make.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.480 align:middle line:84%
You know that if something
no longer makes you happy,

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.570 align:middle line:84%
then you choose to do
something about it.

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:30.840 align:middle line:90%
You change it.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:31.640 align:middle line:90%
You drop it.

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.440 align:middle line:90%
You move on.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.210 align:middle line:90%


00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:38.710 align:middle line:84%
You eliminate toxic
people out of your life,

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:42.250 align:middle line:84%
choosing to surround yourself
with positivity and people

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:45.040 align:middle line:84%
who build your confidence
up and who respect you.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.764 align:middle line:90%


00:16:47.764 --> 00:16:51.010 align:middle line:84%
You put yourself
first, and you start

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:55.480 align:middle line:84%
to do more things in your
life that make you happy.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:59.970 align:middle line:84%
So whether that's spending more
time with your friends or more

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:05.160 align:middle line:84%
time with family, spending more
time outside or on holiday,

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.069 align:middle line:84%
starting a passion project,
something you've always

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:14.119 align:middle line:84%
wanted to do, you ensure
you eat more healthily

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:18.349 align:middle line:84%
and that you sleep
better, you exercise more,

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:21.109 align:middle line:84%
knowing that these basic
fundamentals create

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:23.119 align:middle line:84%
the foundations
of a happy person.

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:28.140 align:middle line:90%


00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.870 align:middle line:84%
From now on you're a
very positive person,

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:33.750 align:middle line:84%
and you see everything
in a new light

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:36.900 align:middle line:84%
because you always look for the
silver lining in all things.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.850 align:middle line:90%


00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:43.655 align:middle line:84%
You're optimistic, happy,
and excited about the future.

00:17:43.655 --> 00:17:46.390 align:middle line:90%


00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:49.480 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you feel more
and more joy and happiness

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.760 align:middle line:90%
for no apparent reason.

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Just like a little child
that is so happy just being,

00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:01.120 align:middle line:84%
you, too, are filled with the
pure wonder of life of being.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.530 align:middle line:84%
More and more, you're
becoming aware of the miracle

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:06.100 align:middle line:90%
that you are.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And from now on for
no apparent reason,

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:13.420 align:middle line:84%
you feel more joy and happiness
as you go through the day.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:18.280 align:middle line:84%
You simply feel
the joy of being.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:22.330 align:middle line:84%
This new happiness is producing
more love in your life

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:25.930 align:middle line:84%
and in your world
all around you.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.870 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing and hearing
and feeling and sensing

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:32.290 align:middle line:84%
beauty and light and
love and everything.

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:34.940 align:middle line:90%


00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:39.530 align:middle line:84%
You feel wonderful, and you
feel content with your life, joy

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:41.870 align:middle line:90%
and peace, deep peace.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:45.790 align:middle line:90%


00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:50.030 align:middle line:84%
The change is taking
place within now.

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:56.550 align:middle line:84%
You're becoming more and more
amazing in every way every day.

00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Your confidence is growing,
and you feel more calm and more

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.000 align:middle line:90%
in control.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.120 align:middle line:90%


00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.910 align:middle line:84%
Your life is filled
with such wonder.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.280 align:middle line:84%
You are filled with
wonder, and your spirit

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.655 align:middle line:90%
soar to new heights.

00:19:12.655 --> 00:19:15.330 align:middle line:90%


00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.640 align:middle line:84%
All of these changes
within you are also

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.520 align:middle line:84%
affecting your
creative abilities

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.900 align:middle line:90%
in a positive and profound way.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.420 align:middle line:90%


00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.480 align:middle line:84%
You're creating and making
things that are incredible.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.960 align:middle line:90%


00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.150 align:middle line:84%
First, you have visions
of what you can do

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:39.650 align:middle line:84%
and what you can make and
then you produce them.

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:41.780 align:middle line:90%
You have a vision.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:46.350 align:middle line:90%
You have an amazing imagination.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:48.860 align:middle line:84%
Your happiness is
reaching new found times.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:52.430 align:middle line:90%


00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:55.740 align:middle line:84%
You see everything with new
clear vision, with new eyes

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:56.540 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:00.930 align:middle line:90%


00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:03.930 align:middle line:84%
You feel more and more
happy each and every day.

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.660 align:middle line:90%


00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:10.390 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to use
your imagination now,

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:15.040 align:middle line:84%
to think of a time when
you were really happy.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.020 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you were laughing.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you were with
your family or friends,

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:21.490 align:middle line:90%
or you felt freedom.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:26.420 align:middle line:84%
You were doing something you
love or having independence.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Take your time to think about
everything that makes you happy

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:32.780 align:middle line:84%
or a special time
that made you happy.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:44.460 align:middle line:90%


00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:48.060 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
visualize that those thoughts

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.330 align:middle line:84%
and feelings, those words,
everything that represents

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:54.690 align:middle line:84%
those feelings of happiness
are slowly turning

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:56.595 align:middle line:90%
into your favorite soft drink.

00:20:56.595 --> 00:20:59.580 align:middle line:90%


00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.490 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps they're
turning into a fresh glass

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:06.150 align:middle line:84%
of orange juice or
a green smoothie

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:09.820 align:middle line:90%
or simply a glass of water.

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready, I'd
like you to see yourself now

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:16.650 align:middle line:84%
picking up the glass
and drinking the drink,

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:22.760 align:middle line:84%
slowly drinking all the things
that make you feel so happy.

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.610 align:middle line:84%
Feel that happiness going
down through your throat

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:29.160 align:middle line:84%
into your body and running
through your insides

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.720 align:middle line:90%
filling you with happiness.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.070 align:middle line:90%


00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:36.140 align:middle line:84%
You fill your body
up with happiness.

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:37.850 align:middle line:90%
You are happy.

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:40.530 align:middle line:90%
You feel happy.

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:42.720 align:middle line:90%
You say to yourself, I am happy.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.710 align:middle line:90%
I feel happy.

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:48.320 align:middle line:90%


00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.360 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.270 align:middle line:84%
embedded into your
subconscious mind,

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:55.160 align:middle line:84%
and they'll become
more and more powerful

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.770 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:59.460 align:middle line:90%


00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment I'm going
to count up from 1 to 5

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.840 align:middle line:84%
to awaken you, and
at the count of 5,

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.630 align:middle line:84%
you'll be wide awake,
fully refreshed,

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:12.250 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling fantastic,
bringing back with you

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:15.870 align:middle line:84%
all the wonderful new
feelings of happiness.

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:22.410 align:middle line:84%
So coming back now
with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:25.190 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:31.000 align:middle line:90%
