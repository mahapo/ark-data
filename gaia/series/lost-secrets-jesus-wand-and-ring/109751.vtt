[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.034 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.034 --> 00:00:12.575 align:middle line:84%
>>Now what we're going to do in
this part of the presentation

00:00:12.575 --> 00:00:15.130 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to talk
about Nashville, some

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.100 align:middle line:84%
of the material from my
book "City of Peace,"

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.750 align:middle line:90%
as well as other material.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.580 align:middle line:84%
As I said earlier, I like to
consult God or a form of God,

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.010 align:middle line:84%
Google, when I'm working
with ideas or concepts

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.470 align:middle line:84%
just to see what is the
collective mind of humanity

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.550 align:middle line:84%
thinking about
any given subject.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.200 align:middle line:84%
So I'll go to Google
and click on the images.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And so in this
instance, I clicked

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle line:90%
on Nashville, Tennessee.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.510 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of unscientific,
but it's just a barometer.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.570 align:middle line:84%
What does Google
say about Nashville?

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And as we look at
it, we find that it

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.350 align:middle line:84%
has one of our famous buildings
downtown, the BellSouth

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.150 align:middle line:90%
building.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.780 align:middle line:84%
It's got the General
Jackson, the Grand Ole Opry.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.670 align:middle line:90%
And then also, there's this UFO.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.300 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.880 align:middle line:10%
Turns out in 1989, this alleged
authentic UFO photograph

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.724 align:middle line:10%
was provided by Commander
Graham Bethan of the US Navy.

00:01:04.724 --> 00:01:07.260 align:middle line:10%
Either this is a hoax or
this guy is totally for real.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.600 align:middle line:10%
He actually took photographs
of this saucer in Nashville,

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.960 align:middle line:10%
Tennessee, in 1989.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.790 align:middle line:10%
And I just cracked up, and I
say, OK, so the collective mind

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.700 align:middle line:10%
associates Nashville
with the Grand Ole Opry

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.980 align:middle line:10%
and with really
killer UFO pictures.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've got a flying saucer
on top of our Sheraton Hotel.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, OK, Men in Black
would sure like this set-up.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.910 align:middle line:84%
But again, one of
our most famous icons

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.680 align:middle line:90%
now is the BellSouth building.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to play in a
really intriguing role for us

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.850 align:middle line:84%
later in the presentation
when we actually

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.800 align:middle line:90%
get down to the mall site.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Beside it is the mother church
of country music, the Grand Ole

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Opry, the Ryman Auditorium, the
world-famous Ryman Auditorium,

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.230 align:middle line:84%
which was originally
Baptist Tabernacle.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.010 align:middle line:84%
It didn't have a stage in it
when the Ryman Auditorium was

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.050 align:middle line:84%
first built. It has
this incredible stage

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.800 align:middle line:84%
now with the
concentric rings that I

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.440 align:middle line:90%
love, and here's the stage.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.210 align:middle line:84%
How did that stage
get to be built?

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's kind of an
interesting anecdote

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.110 align:middle line:84%
about how that stage was
built. In 1901, this woman--

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.510 align:middle line:84%
her name is Emma Calve--
came to Nashville.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Emma Calve was like the
Madonna of her time.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.790 align:middle line:90%
Early 1900s she lived in Paris.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.980 align:middle line:84%
She ran a Rosicrucian
occult society.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.460 align:middle line:90%
She had a boyfriend.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.700 align:middle line:90%
His name was Berenger Sauniere.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And so when Emma Calve is
running her Rosicrucian society

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.560 align:middle line:84%
in Paris, she's
going down to see

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.520 align:middle line:84%
her lover, this Catholic
priest, Berenger Sauniere,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.390 align:middle line:90%
down in Rennes-le-Chateau.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.740 align:middle line:90%
Well, what's the connection?

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, the stage for
the Ryman Auditorium

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.940 align:middle line:84%
was built in 1902 for a
production of "Carmen"

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.780 align:middle line:90%
by Emma Calve.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.330 align:middle line:84%
So at the same time
that she's rooting out

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.120 align:middle line:84%
all these mysteries
of the Holy Grail

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.740 align:middle line:84%
with Berenger Sauniere
in southern France,

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.180 align:middle line:84%
she's also popping
here to Nashville

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.280 align:middle line:84%
and staying here for a while
for her production of "Carmen."

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.817 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, there's
an author named

00:03:15.817 --> 00:03:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Warren Getler, who
wrote a book called

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.020 align:middle line:90%
"Shadow of the Sentinel."

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.742 align:middle line:84%
And what he talks
about in this is

00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:23.380 align:middle line:84%
this group called
Sentinels that operate

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.290 align:middle line:90%
throughout the southeast.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.350 align:middle line:84%
This group is called the
Knights of the Golden Circle.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.372 align:middle line:84%
The story, according
to Getler-- and he

00:03:30.372 --> 00:03:32.580 align:middle line:84%
covered the gold market for
the "Wall Street Journal"

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.830 align:middle line:90%
for 20 years.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.610 align:middle line:84%
This is a mainstream guy,
mainstream as they get,

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.300 align:middle line:84%
who's involved in
rooting out this mystery.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.080 align:middle line:84%
He meets a guy named
Bob Brewer, who

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.880 align:middle line:84%
lives in Northwest Arkansas,
who claims his family is part

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.410 align:middle line:84%
of the Sentinel group of the
Knights of the Golden Circle,

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.790 align:middle line:84%
a Neo-Knights
Templar organization

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.190 align:middle line:84%
founded during the
time of the Civil War

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.740 align:middle line:90%
by Frank and Jesse James.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.460 align:middle line:84%
They're stealing
gold from the Yankees

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and hiding it throughout the
southeast using the same codes

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.180 align:middle line:84%
that the Knights Templar
used in southern France,

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.580 align:middle line:84%
including Rennes-le-Chateau, to
hide gold and other treasure.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.940 align:middle line:84%
The Knights of the Golden
Circle operated out

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.570 align:middle line:90%
of the Ryman Auditorium.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.810 align:middle line:84%
They're hiding gold
throughout the southeast.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.490 align:middle line:84%
Nashville, Tennessee, is the
base for this organization.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.180 align:middle line:84%
I just find it really
intriguing that at the same time

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Emma Calve is working on
these codes with Sauniere,

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.280 align:middle line:84%
the Neo-Knights Templar are
operating out of Nashville

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.040 align:middle line:84%
at the very same
time, and she seems

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.800 align:middle line:84%
to have been some
kind of a conduit.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.760 align:middle line:84%
I can't prove a link
between Emma Calve and Frank

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.310 align:middle line:84%
and Jesse James, who
Getler says faked his death

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.760 align:middle line:84%
and was operating at
that time, but it's

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.450 align:middle line:90%
an intriguing possibility.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And the point is that you
often hear around Nashville,

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.520 align:middle line:84%
you scratch the surface, there
is some really funny business

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.220 align:middle line:90%
that goes on in this town.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's just one example
of how all the roads seem

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.090 align:middle line:90%
to lead to Nashville.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.500 align:middle line:10%
By the way, Rennes-le-Chateau
is on [? Hertok's ?] map as one

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.310 align:middle line:10%
of these 12 cities
around the planet

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.900 align:middle line:10%
where you find repositories
of this ancient knowledge.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.640 align:middle line:84%
Nashville is called the
Athens of the South.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.570 align:middle line:84%
This is supposedly
because of the number

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.467 align:middle line:90%
of universities that are here.

00:05:19.467 --> 00:05:21.550 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to show you
some funny business here

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.560 align:middle line:84%
that suggests there seems to be
some effort to literally make

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Nashville sort of a new Athens.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.560 align:middle line:84%
The keystone of this is
that we have a scale replica

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.230 align:middle line:84%
of the Parthenon from ancient
Greece, Athena's Temple of Holy

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.510 align:middle line:90%
Wisdom-- a scale replica.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.500 align:middle line:84%
The engineers and architects
who designed this spent years

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.200 align:middle line:84%
in Greece attempting to find
the actual specifications

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.040 align:middle line:84%
and plans for the
Parthenon and claim they

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.040 align:middle line:84%
accurately duplicated
the Parthenon in Greece.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.530 align:middle line:84%
Very interesting, because
that's quite a feat.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.370 align:middle line:84%
By the way, the original
Parthenon in Greece

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.350 align:middle line:90%
was multi-colored.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:00.950 align:middle line:84%
This is a painting
at the Parthenon

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.290 align:middle line:90%
here in Nashville that shows it.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And you can see it's bright
purple, pink, fuchsia-- very

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.000 align:middle line:84%
high vibration,
feminine colors, again,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.070 align:middle line:90%
the Temple of Holy Wisdom.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.060 align:middle line:90%
Wait.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.240 align:middle line:90%
That's La Madeleine.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.550 align:middle line:10%
What's that doing there?

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.270 align:middle line:10%
Wait a minute.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.400 align:middle line:10%
That's La Madeleine.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.480 align:middle line:84%
That's the temple that Napoleon
built for Mary Magdalene

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.630 align:middle line:90%
in Paris.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.870 align:middle line:84%
It, too, is modeled
after the Parthenon.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.960 align:middle line:10%
It's not a scale
replica of the Parthenon

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.680 align:middle line:10%
as we have here in Nashville,
but it is a Parthenon.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.900 align:middle line:10%
Napoleon understood that
Mary Magdalene and Athena

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.960 align:middle line:10%
were part of the
continuous transmission

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.020 align:middle line:10%
of this priestess wisdom.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.196 align:middle line:84%
And so effectively when
we're at the Parthenon,

00:06:46.196 --> 00:06:47.570 align:middle line:84%
we could well be
at the Madeleine

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.690 align:middle line:84%
in Paris, the temple
of Mary Magdalene.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.870 align:middle line:84%
One thing that's very
interesting about this,

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:57.270 align:middle line:84%
you notice the pillars in
the front sort of taper in.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.260 align:middle line:84%
What they tell you
at the Parthenon

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.550 align:middle line:84%
is that those sides
taper in a little bit,

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:08.467 align:middle line:84%
and they meet in a pyramid
one mile above the Parthenon.

00:07:08.467 --> 00:07:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're
looking at the Parthenon,

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.580 align:middle line:84%
you have to imagine that
this temple actually

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:17.070 align:middle line:90%
extends one mile into the air.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Wow-- I mean, that's a very
profound detail for them

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.520 align:middle line:84%
to have duplicated from
the ancient Parthenon,

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.510 align:middle line:84%
and it suggests that this
could be an actual working

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.580 align:middle line:90%
temple, which I believe it is.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Don't call it a temple when
you're at the Parthenon,

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:32.580 align:middle line:90%
though.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.380 align:middle line:90%
You have to call it a museum.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.950 align:middle line:84%
That's the official
Nashville position on it.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.910 align:middle line:84%
They've duplicated
some of the color.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.540 align:middle line:84%
As you walk around
the outside, you

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.910 align:middle line:84%
get a real sense of the
grantor of this temple

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:47.440 align:middle line:90%
and the feel for it.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.580 align:middle line:84%
It was originally built to
celebrate Tennessee Centennial,

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.640 align:middle line:90%
built in 1897.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.850 align:middle line:90%
These are actual photographs.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.769 align:middle line:84%
We had a Centennial Exposition
here in Nashville at that time.

00:07:57.769 --> 00:07:59.560 align:middle line:84%
For many, it was the
first time they'd ever

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.900 align:middle line:90%
experienced electric light.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.890 align:middle line:84%
1892 was the Chicago
World Exposition,

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:09.850 align:middle line:84%
celebrating the 400th
anniversary of Columbus'

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:11.430 align:middle line:90%
discovery of America.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:15.482 align:middle line:84%
Emma Calve was there, too,
hanging out with Nikola Tesla.

00:08:15.482 --> 00:08:16.690 align:middle line:90%
What were they talking about?

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:18.160 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.650 align:middle line:84%
The Eiffel Tower was
built during this time.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And Nashville came along
and built the Parthenon.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Memphis built a pyramid
beside the Parthenon

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:27.950 align:middle line:90%
for their exhibition.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.730 align:middle line:84%
They tore that down,
and they were going

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.670 align:middle line:90%
to tear down the Parthenon.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:34.710 align:middle line:84%
But then they decided, hey,
people really like this.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.669 align:middle line:84%
So they rebuilt it as
a permanent facility.

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:41.919 align:middle line:10%
This is the statue of Athena
that originally stood outside.

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:46.110 align:middle line:10%
In 1982-- well, actually,
going back a step, in the 1920s

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:49.330 align:middle line:10%
they rebuilt the Parthenon
as a permanent facility

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:50.640 align:middle line:10%
here in Nashville.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And in 1982, they commissioned
the local sculptor,

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Master Sculptor Alan
LeQuire to sculpt

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:00.140 align:middle line:84%
a 42-foot-tall tall
statue of Pallas Athena

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.210 align:middle line:90%
to place inside the Parthenon.

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:04.130 align:middle line:84%
This is the tallest
indoor statue

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:07.510 align:middle line:84%
in the Western world,
again, 42 feet tall.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:09.687 align:middle line:84%
To give you a sense
of the size of this,

00:09:09.687 --> 00:09:11.770 align:middle line:84%
that angel that she's
holding in her hand-- that's

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.810 align:middle line:84%
Nike-- that statue is
6 feet 4 inches tall

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.100 align:middle line:90%
and weighs 400 pounds.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about an
enormous temple facility.

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:24.140 align:middle line:84%
I once had a chance to see the
Gilded Athena from the outside.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally they
open the doors,

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:30.640 align:middle line:84%
and it's just absolutely
magical to see Athena inside.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:35.740 align:middle line:84%
2003, they put a thin
layer of 24-karat gold

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.410 align:middle line:90%
over Athena's body.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:41.790 align:middle line:84%
She is now the woman
clothed with the sun.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.040 align:middle line:90%
It's magnificent.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:43.990 align:middle line:90%
It's stunning.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And when have you ever stood in
front of so much 24-karat gold

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.480 align:middle line:90%
before?

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.130 align:middle line:10%
She stands with
Nike in her hand,

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.750 align:middle line:10%
with her Medusa breastplate
that made her impervious to her

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:57.850 align:middle line:10%
enemies' weapons on her chest.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:59.850 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Parthenon officials,

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:01.360 align:middle line:84%
Alan LeQuire, the
master sculptor,

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.000 align:middle line:90%
did extensive research.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And they believe this is the
most accurate reproduction

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.210 align:middle line:84%
of the original statue
of Pallas Athena

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.590 align:middle line:84%
as it stood in the
original Parthenon

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:14.425 align:middle line:84%
in Greece-- very, very
powerful, powerful statue.

00:10:14.425 --> 00:10:17.750 align:middle line:90%


00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.830 align:middle line:10%
Once you look closely
at certain angles,

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:26.010 align:middle line:10%
you notice going back
one that she's pregnant.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.300 align:middle line:10%
Athena is pregnant, just
like the way Mary Magdalene

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.160 align:middle line:10%
is portrayed as
pregnant, for example,

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:37.760 align:middle line:10%
at Kilmore Church in Ireland,
giving birth to new humankind.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.260 align:middle line:84%
She stands with her
rod and her serpent

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.530 align:middle line:90%
at her side and her shield.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:48.330 align:middle line:84%
That rod and serpent, I believe,
is symbolic of Kundalini.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.190 align:middle line:84%
We're told that Athena
is the goddess of war

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.880 align:middle line:90%
and the goddess of wisdom.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.310 align:middle line:84%
So we're wanting to interpret
all of her symbolism,

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.960 align:middle line:84%
including her shield, her
serpent, and rod in light

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.790 align:middle line:84%
of military symbolism,
but actually, she's

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:02.320 align:middle line:84%
the goddess of
wisdom, too, so we

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.630 align:middle line:84%
have to interpret all
of her accouterments

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.580 align:middle line:84%
in light of the
wisdom tradition.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.920 align:middle line:84%
What is the coiled
serpent at the base

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.670 align:middle line:90%
of the rod, the spinal cord?

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:14.140 align:middle line:90%
It's Kundalini.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And when you lift Kundalini,
what does that do for you?

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, it creates a shield
around your body, a force

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:24.450 align:middle line:84%
field of energy that attracts
to you that which you do want

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.640 align:middle line:84%
and repels that
which you don't want.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.240 align:middle line:84%
It makes you impervious
to your enemies' weapons,

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.970 align:middle line:84%
puts you in a state of
wonderment and bliss.

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.520 align:middle line:90%


00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.320 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that the
legendary founder of Athens,

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.910 align:middle line:84%
Erichthonius, was portrayed
with the lower part of his body

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:43.050 align:middle line:84%
as a serpent and the
upper part a man.

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:44.470 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.560 align:middle line:84%
I think this goes back to
Osiris squeezing himself

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.880 align:middle line:90%
through the serpent.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.510 align:middle line:84%
The Athenians were supposed
to be serpent-born.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:52.870 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:55.190 align:middle line:90%
They're reptilian?

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.550 align:middle line:84%
That they're born
of Kundalini energy?

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.160 align:middle line:90%
That came out of a wormhole?

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Maybe all of the above,
something like that.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Erichthonius was kept
in a cista, which is

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.390 align:middle line:90%
a basket, a chest, or a casket.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.910 align:middle line:10%
And so here in this detail,
we see Athena with-- this

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:16.530 align:middle line:10%
is actually Jason being
spit from the serpent, Jason

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.250 align:middle line:10%
and the Argonauts story.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.720 align:middle line:10%
So he clearly is one of
these serpent-born people who

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:26.740 align:middle line:10%
have been renewed by uplifting
their spiritual energy,

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.410 align:middle line:10%
their Kundalini, but
possibly even something more.

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:33.360 align:middle line:84%
But again, the Greeks got
all their stuff from Egypt,

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.800 align:middle line:84%
so we have to ask the
question, is this,

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.660 align:middle line:84%
in fact, Osiris being
squeezed through the body

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:43.510 align:middle line:84%
of the serpent, renewed and
with the serpentine wisdom?

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.110 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Athens,
the place called

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:47.190 align:middle line:84%
the Erechtheion was
the sanctuary that

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:50.340 align:middle line:84%
stood on the side of the ancient
king's palace of the Acropolis

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.990 align:middle line:90%
at Athens.

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Our state capital sits
on a hill that they

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:57.070 align:middle line:90%
call the State Acropolis.

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:58.540 align:middle line:84%
That's a strange
choice of words,

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:02.430 align:middle line:84%
because the word Acropolis
means "place of secrete."

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.330 align:middle line:84%
Built near the end of the fifth
century BC, this Erechtheion

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:08.810 align:middle line:84%
in Athens was marked by
three famous tokens--

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.220 align:middle line:84%
a sacred olive tree,
a seer well named

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.750 align:middle line:84%
for Erechtheus and a trident
mark on the porch floor.

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:18.940 align:middle line:84%
A trident is a
three-pronged image.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Immediately above
this trident mark

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.040 align:middle line:84%
was an opening to
the sky, making it

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.850 align:middle line:84%
one of the hypaethral
structures,

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:27.190 align:middle line:84%
as they were called, and
left in communication,

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.140 align:middle line:84%
as it were, with the
source of their manna,

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:30.770 align:middle line:90%
the heavenly energy.

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:32.820 align:middle line:84%
This was the royal
temple of Erechtheus,

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.700 align:middle line:90%
who is also called Poseidon.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, here in front of our State
Acropolis in the same location

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:42.480 align:middle line:84%
described here, we have a
2,200-foot-long rod that has

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.790 align:middle line:84%
a trident mark on
its porch floor.

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.910 align:middle line:84%
I just find that just kind
of a curious coincidence.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.810 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
Court of Three Stars.

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to have
a lot more to say

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:59.770 align:middle line:84%
about this ring, or Court of
Three Stars, as we continue.

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Ever seen this face before,
the one on the left?

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:07.510 align:middle line:84%
That's the face on the
Shroud of Turin, right?

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it is the face on
the Shroud of Turin.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.690 align:middle line:90%
It's Jesus, right?

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.700 align:middle line:90%
No, it is not Jesus.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:20.570 align:middle line:84%
This diagram was made
in 1798, 100 years

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:22.450 align:middle line:84%
before the face on
the Shroud of Turin

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:26.400 align:middle line:84%
was revealed to the world for
the first time, supposedly.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.840 align:middle line:84%
This is Isis and Serapis
that we're looking at.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.560 align:middle line:84%
But it is the same face
on the Shroud of Turin.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.630 align:middle line:90%
How can that be?

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:37.280 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.666 align:middle line:90%
It just is.

00:14:38.666 --> 00:14:41.810 align:middle line:90%


00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:44.765 align:middle line:10%
Remember Jesus was
portrayed as a serpent,

00:14:44.765 --> 00:14:49.770 align:middle line:10%
and a serpent is symbolic of
vibration, energy, frequency,

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:50.850 align:middle line:10%
wisdom.

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And so it would make sense
that his face might appear

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:55.280 align:middle line:90%
on the body of a serpent.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Is that Mary Magdalene,
therefore, beside him?

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Did they go to a carnival
in Alexandria, Egypt,

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:02.950 align:middle line:84%
where this bas relief was
found and stick their heads

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:07.770 align:middle line:84%
through the carnival exhibit
and somebody snapped or made

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:08.687 align:middle line:90%
their bas relief?

00:15:08.687 --> 00:15:09.940 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.340 align:middle line:10%
I don't know, but
that is Serapis,

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:14.410 align:middle line:10%
but it looks like Jesus.

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:16.665 align:middle line:10%
Here's a separated-at-birth
one for you.

00:15:16.665 --> 00:15:18.790 align:middle line:10%
Oh, by the way, I'm convinced
that the serpent that

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:26.430 align:middle line:10%
is lifted by Athena is also the
same serpent lifted by Moses.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:28.620 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
serpent around the pillar

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.070 align:middle line:84%
is where we get our
English word "dollar."

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:34.290 align:middle line:10%
Because this coin on the right
is from a German coin they

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:38.780 align:middle line:10%
called a thaler, spelled
T-H-A-L-E-R, thaler.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:42.080 align:middle line:10%
And that's where our
word "dollar" comes from.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.780 align:middle line:84%
So when we worship
the almighty dollar,

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:49.330 align:middle line:84%
we're actually worshipping Jesus
as the wise serpent of wisdom,

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.900 align:middle line:84%
another piece of the symbolism
that has been twisted

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.460 align:middle line:90%
and now has a different meaning.

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.980 align:middle line:84%
But that is the source of
our dollar bill symbol.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.910 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the
Gnostics, who portray Jesus

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:04.490 align:middle line:90%
as the serpent on the pillar.

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:09.170 align:middle line:84%
So we have the money bag with
the dollar bill logo on it.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Does anybody know who owns
the logo of the money bag

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:16.030 align:middle line:90%
with the dollar bill on it?

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.280 align:middle line:90%
I just learned this recently.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Gene Simmons of Kiss
owns the moneybag logo

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.520 align:middle line:84%
with the dollar symbol on
it-- Gene Simmons of Kiss.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:27.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:33.020 align:middle line:84%
This guy in his book "Kiss,
Sex, Money" talks about his love

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:34.320 align:middle line:90%
of money.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:38.200 align:middle line:84%
He loves money and wants
you to love money, too.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I
love money so much,

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:42.190 align:middle line:84%
I found out that the
moneybag logo was available,

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:43.150 align:middle line:90%
and I own it.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And I enforce this
trademark now.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:53.390 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:54.650 align:middle line:90%
Separated at birth?

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:56.370 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:58.660 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.560 align:middle line:84%
I gotta ask Gene
one of these days,

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.210 align:middle line:84%
did you see this and said,
hey, make my hair look

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:07.940 align:middle line:90%
like Osiris, Serapis, Jesus?

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how this
happens, but it just happens.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.040 align:middle line:84%
There's a higher mind
operating in our lives.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And if we can connect with
it, magical, wonderful things

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.950 align:middle line:90%
happen, totally unexpected.

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:24.420 align:middle line:84%
He'd probably be so ticked
if he saw this, but--

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:25.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:28.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying Gene
Simmons is Jesus.

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying he's Osiris.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying he's
got the exact same look

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.760 align:middle line:84%
and that they might have
been separated at birth.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And it is coincidental that
Gene Simmons owns that moneybag

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:38.360 align:middle line:90%
logo.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.632 align:middle line:90%
How did that work out?

00:17:39.632 --> 00:17:41.050 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to know.

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:43.220 align:middle line:84%
So let's get back to
the Parthenon here.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>Did you pay him
for the use of it?

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:48.479 align:middle line:84%
>>Did I pay Gene Simmons
to-- don't bring that up,

00:17:48.479 --> 00:17:49.770 align:middle line:90%
because he's going to see this.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:50.080 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.430 align:middle line:90%
He's gonna send me a bill.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:54.257 align:middle line:90%


00:17:54.257 --> 00:17:55.590 align:middle line:90%
Let's get back to the Parthenon.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:59.080 align:middle line:84%
We're on the east side
of the Parthenon now.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.665 align:middle line:84%
This is actually the
entrance, and I'm

00:18:00.665 --> 00:18:02.790 align:middle line:84%
going to just kind of take
you through a little bit

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:04.720 align:middle line:90%
of the imagery that's here.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.030 align:middle line:84%
We're not sure exactly what the
original pediment or friezes

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:09.340 align:middle line:90%
look like on the Parthenon.

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.540 align:middle line:84%
It's all been destroyed
and separated.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:16.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a big bone of contention
among the Greeks and the Brits.

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.950 align:middle line:84%
So this is, though,
what we think

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:22.410 align:middle line:84%
is a very faithful reproduction
of the original pediment.

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And you see the guy
sitting on the chair

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:26.590 align:middle line:90%
there with the six pack?

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:29.100 align:middle line:90%
That's Zeus.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.700 align:middle line:90%
He's the chairman of the board.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:32.650 align:middle line:90%
He's the chairman.

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:33.733 align:middle line:90%
He's sitting on the chair.

00:18:33.733 --> 00:18:35.360 align:middle line:90%
This is a meeting of the gods.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.700 align:middle line:90%
What are they talking about?

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've got these
creatures running around.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:40.490 align:middle line:90%
They're called human beings.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:41.790 align:middle line:90%
We created them.

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:44.360 align:middle line:84%
They survived the flood--
weren't supposed to.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Now what are we going
to do with them?

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And so the gods are
getting together

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.850 align:middle line:84%
to try to figure out, what are
we going to do with these guys?

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:54.570 align:middle line:84%
The guy sitting behind Zeus
with the ax in his hand,

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.370 align:middle line:90%
his name is Hephaestus.

00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:59.780 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned earlier, the
Greeks stole all their stuff

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.217 align:middle line:90%
from Egypt and Sumeria.

00:19:01.217 --> 00:19:03.550 align:middle line:84%
The guy sitting on the chair,
the chairman of the board,

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:07.060 align:middle line:84%
the Sumerians called him
Enlil-- not a very nice guy.

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:09.480 align:middle line:84%
In the Atlantis
story told by Plato,

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.140 align:middle line:84%
it was Zeus-Enlil who's
watching humankind

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.700 align:middle line:90%
from the center of the universe.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.130 align:middle line:84%
We had a divine
essence inside of us,

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:21.010 align:middle line:84%
Plato tells us in the "Timaeus,"
that was diminishing over time.

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:24.040 align:middle line:90%
Zeus decided to send his wrath.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.280 align:middle line:84%
That's where Plato's
story cuts off.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.670 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
Zeus' wrath was.

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.210 align:middle line:84%
Did he send a pulse of
electromagnetic energy

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:34.290 align:middle line:84%
from the center of the galaxy
that pile-drived our planet?

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:37.470 align:middle line:84%
There went all our
satellites and cell phones?

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:39.980 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're thinking
happened in the ancient world.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.120 align:middle line:90%
And now we're regrouping here.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.280 align:middle line:84%
The guy behind him with
the ax, Hephaestus,

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.770 align:middle line:90%
they call him Enki in Sumeria.

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:50.660 align:middle line:84%
He's the god of
smithcraft and alchemy.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Zecharia Sitchin upholds
Hephaestus or Enki

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:56.480 align:middle line:84%
as the fashioner of the
bodies of humankind.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.870 align:middle line:90%
In Egypt, he's called Ptah.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:00.520 align:middle line:90%
He's Ptah in Egypt.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.170 align:middle line:84%
That ax in his hand
is very important,

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:06.720 align:middle line:84%
because he probably didn't
chop wood with that ax.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:11.370 align:middle line:84%
The ax is the symbol of the
creative tool of the gods.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.014 align:middle line:84%
And funny, here in Music City
if you go up to a guitar player

00:20:14.014 --> 00:20:15.430 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, man,
what kind of ax

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:17.320 align:middle line:84%
do you play, they're
probably going to say,

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.790 align:middle line:84%
oh, it's a Gibson Les Paul or
Fender Stratocaster, whatever.

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:23.290 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to be
talking about an instrument

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:26.550 align:middle line:84%
that chops wood like this,
although when musicians

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:28.480 align:middle line:84%
talk about, let's get
together and practice,

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.030 align:middle line:84%
they say, hey, let's
hit the shed together.

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:34.176 align:middle line:84%
This is because they refer
to their instruments as axes,

00:20:34.176 --> 00:20:35.800 align:middle line:84%
and when they're
going to hit the shed,

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.299 align:middle line:84%
it means we're going
to go practice.

00:20:37.299 --> 00:20:38.990 align:middle line:90%
We're going to chop wood.

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And what's understood
among musicians

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:44.410 align:middle line:84%
is that the ax, the guitar,
the creative instrument

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:47.650 align:middle line:84%
is a device that
channels vibration.

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And as you play the
strings, the tightly wound,

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:54.850 align:middle line:84%
serpent-like strings, you're
able to influence others

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.330 align:middle line:90%
creatively.

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:58.390 align:middle line:84%
That I believe is
the intended meaning

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.430 align:middle line:84%
of the ax in the
ancient world as well.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:03.840 align:middle line:84%
It's the creative instrument,
or tool of the gods,

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.430 align:middle line:90%
that they have in their hand.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And it probably has
a variety of uses,

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:12.770 align:middle line:84%
including fashioning
the bodies of men

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:16.220 align:middle line:84%
and working with light
and other energies.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.190 align:middle line:90%
So it's funny.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:18.731 align:middle line:84%
If you drive around
Nashville, you're

00:21:18.731 --> 00:21:22.960 align:middle line:84%
going to see models of Gibson
Les Pauls all over this town.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.160 align:middle line:84%
It's the ultimate ax that
musicians like to play.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.100 align:middle line:10%
It is kind of the tool of
the ax gods here in town.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:34.140 align:middle line:10%
Here is Hephaestus with
his ax, utilizing it again

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:35.520 align:middle line:10%
as a creative tool.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.950 align:middle line:10%
And so again, it's just a very
important symbol here in town

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:42.570 align:middle line:10%
that the ax is symbolic of
creative transformation.

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And here is Hephaestus
on his winged disk,

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:48.640 align:middle line:84%
on his winged chariot
sailing into the stars.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.790 align:middle line:84%
So again, we're assured
this is not an ax that you

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:54.064 align:middle line:90%
would use to chop down a tree.

00:21:54.064 --> 00:21:55.730 align:middle line:84%
When you look around
Nashville, in fact,

00:21:55.730 --> 00:22:01.170 align:middle line:84%
you see a church that looks
like a Gibson Flying V guitar.

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:03.325 align:middle line:84%
It's all over this
town, Music City,

00:22:03.325 --> 00:22:07.510 align:middle line:84%
the idea of the ax as a
tool of creative inspiration

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:10.430 align:middle line:90%
that can inspire people.

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:14.180 align:middle line:84%
When we come back around now to
the west side of the Parthenon,

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:18.510 align:middle line:84%
we see a very interesting
depiction here on the frieze.

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:20.050 align:middle line:90%
We see two gods in the center.

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:21.860 align:middle line:90%
On the left is Athena.

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:26.640 align:middle line:84%
On the right is Poseidon
with his trident.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.100 align:middle line:84%
What we're witnessing here is a
contest between these two gods.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.160 align:middle line:84%
These creatures,
humankind, who were once

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.310 align:middle line:84%
hybrids of men and
gods, have survived

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:38.710 align:middle line:90%
Zeus' wrath, the cataclysm.

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:42.130 align:middle line:84%
I believe we call it the flood
or the cataclysm that destroyed

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.409 align:middle line:90%
Atlantis around 10,000 BC.

00:22:44.409 --> 00:22:45.950 align:middle line:84%
They're getting
together, and they're

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:48.630 align:middle line:84%
going to build this
new town for humankind.

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.710 align:middle line:90%
This new town needs a name.

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:53.370 align:middle line:84%
So they have a contest
between these two gods.

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is that
Poseidon takes his trident

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:58.150 align:middle line:90%
and sticks it in the ground.

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And a salt spring emerges
a couple of miles away.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And the gods are quite pleased
by his miraculous feat.

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:10.040 align:middle line:84%
Athena takes her rod
and spear and sticks it

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:13.510 align:middle line:84%
in the ground, and an
olive tree blossoms.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So the gods decided to call this
new town Athens after Athena,

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.670 align:middle line:84%
rather than Poseidonas
after Poseidon.

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:27.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, Poseidonas was the name
of the Capitol of Atlantis,

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:28.600 align:middle line:90%
which is kind of interesting.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And here is Poseidon
with his trident,

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.155 align:middle line:84%
which is the rod with the
three prongs at the end of it.

00:23:33.155 --> 00:23:36.135 align:middle line:84%
It became the devil's pitchfork
in Christian symbolism.

00:23:36.135 --> 00:23:39.050 align:middle line:90%


00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:43.280 align:middle line:84%
It's funny, because Atlantis
was ruled by the Titans, who

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.840 align:middle line:90%
were called Giants.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And here in Nashville, we
have an NFL football team

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:50.090 align:middle line:90%
called the Titans.

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost as
if the Titans have

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:56.490 align:middle line:84%
returned to the capital of
the New Atlantis, Nashville.

00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing this whole myth
starting to kind of spin itself

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:01.290 align:middle line:90%
once again.

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:03.840 align:middle line:90%


00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And so here again is
the detail of Athena

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.450 align:middle line:90%
with her rod and spear.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:11.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's funny,
too, because we're

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:14.610 align:middle line:84%
going to go to the mall
site in just a few minutes,

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:16.610 align:middle line:84%
and that mall site
is located where

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:19.810 align:middle line:84%
it is because it's been a sacred
ceremonial center for thousands

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:21.510 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:23.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a burial ground,
as I mentioned earlier,

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:27.560 align:middle line:84%
but it was known as a sacred
center originally why?

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Because of the salt spring
that's located there.

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Nashville was originally
called the Great Lick

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:36.910 align:middle line:84%
because the wild buffalo
and the other wild animals

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:39.070 align:middle line:84%
would congregate at
the bicentennial mall

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:43.340 align:middle line:84%
site because of the great salt
spring and salt lick there.

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny that today when
a musician gets out his ax

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:47.760 align:middle line:84%
and plays a great
piece of music,

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:50.607 align:middle line:90%
we call that a great lick.

00:24:50.607 --> 00:24:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And so in the ancient
world, Nashville

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:53.930 align:middle line:90%
was known as the Great Lick.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Now it's Music City, USA,
home of really great licks.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:00.020 align:middle line:84%
So this stuff just
repeats itself

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.760 align:middle line:90%
in these really strange ways.

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.960 align:middle line:84%
The apostle Paul
visited ancient Athens,

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.722 align:middle line:84%
and he said, hey, man, this
town is full of false idols.

00:25:09.722 --> 00:25:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, we got a bunch
of false idols here.

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:13.070 align:middle line:84%
We call them
country music stars.

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.870 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:16.660 align:middle line:84%
They think they're high
beings and everything,

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:19.410 align:middle line:84%
but pretty much, they're,
well, not really, I guess.

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:20.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.220 align:middle line:84%
He also said, hey, you
got a Parthenon there

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.260 align:middle line:90%
in ancient Athens.

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've got a Parthenon
here in the modern Athens

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:28.980 align:middle line:90%
of the South.

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:34.190 align:middle line:84%
He also said, you've got a
temple of Mars, or Marduk,

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:36.650 align:middle line:90%
on top of Mars Hill.

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, you notice here that
our state Capitol, which

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.010 align:middle line:84%
is called the State Acropolis,
or Place of Secrets,

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:44.140 align:middle line:90%
sits on top of a tiered mound.

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.320 align:middle line:90%
They call it Capitol Hill.

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.420 align:middle line:90%
What do you know?

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.340 align:middle line:84%
The capitol sits
on top of a hill,

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:53.536 align:middle line:84%
just like the capitol sat on top
of a hill in ancient Atlantis.

00:25:53.536 --> 00:25:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not saying this
is ancient Atlantis.

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:57.951 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying this is where
the idea of putting the capitol

00:25:57.951 --> 00:26:00.200 align:middle line:90%
on a hill comes from.

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Beside the state
capitol is a place

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.700 align:middle line:90%
called War Memorial Auditorium.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.090 align:middle line:84%
What we're looking
at here is the temple

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:11.380 align:middle line:84%
that sits beside War
Memorial Auditorium.

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:17.820 align:middle line:10%
Inside is the most marvelous
statue of Mars I've ever seen.

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:23.350 align:middle line:10%
I call this hill Mars Hill
and this temple enclosure

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:26.810 align:middle line:10%
the Temple of Mars, just
like ancient Athens,

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:29.650 align:middle line:10%
a Parthenon and Mars
Hill with the temple

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:31.560 align:middle line:10%
of Mars inside of it.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to visit
this Temple of Mars here.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:37.110 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you, most
Nashvillians have no clue

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:38.760 align:middle line:90%
that this is even there.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.220 align:middle line:84%
They just tuck this little
temple right beside the state

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:45.150 align:middle line:84%
capitol, don't give it
any particular name.

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:51.290 align:middle line:84%
But here is this statue of Mars
holding in his hand Nike, just

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:52.750 align:middle line:90%
like Athena.

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:56.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what we're going to
notice at the Temple of Mars

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:59.820 align:middle line:84%
is that the similar
motifs and symbols

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.640 align:middle line:84%
that we see at the
Parthenon are also

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.140 align:middle line:90%
present at the temple of Mars.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.130 align:middle line:84%
The reason why I
believe that is is

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:08.800 align:middle line:84%
because those two temple sites
are meant to be connected.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.660 align:middle line:90%


00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:16.020 align:middle line:84%
So here is Mars, the god of
enlightenment originally,

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:21.400 align:middle line:84%
holding Nike with her rings
of power in her hand--

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.210 align:middle line:90%
her rings of power.

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Here is Nike in Athena's hand,
again, just for reference.

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:30.700 align:middle line:84%
The same sculptor,
Alan LeQuire, who

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:34.120 align:middle line:84%
sculpted Athena also
sculpted the nine muses

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:37.650 align:middle line:84%
at the top of Music Row
here in Nashville, which

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:39.190 align:middle line:84%
is a very beautiful
statue of all

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:43.310 align:middle line:84%
these naked people with what
appears to be reptilian skin--

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:45.090 align:middle line:90%
scaly skin.

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:47.810 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea what
his intention was

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:51.990 align:middle line:84%
by putting scaly or reptilian
skin on the nine muses,

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:54.730 align:middle line:84%
but you can use your
imagination on that one.

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:59.630 align:middle line:84%
The central figure is
holding the golden ring.

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:03.400 align:middle line:84%
Remember Lord of the
Rings, the ring of power?

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.360 align:middle line:84%
This is what we're
searching for.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we're talking
about the rod and the ring.

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Here is Ahura Mazda,
the god of light,

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:14.450 align:middle line:84%
who originally held that
ring, or chakra, of power.

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:18.310 align:middle line:84%
It's called the ring
of cosmic sovereignty.

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:20.350 align:middle line:84%
You achieve the ring
of cosmic sovereignty,

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:23.630 align:middle line:84%
according to Ahura Mazda,
through right action,

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:28.370 align:middle line:84%
right thinking, right
intention, right responsibility.

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:30.910 align:middle line:84%
The way I interpret
it, it says to me

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:32.900 align:middle line:84%
that this Iranian god
is saying, if you've

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:37.470 align:middle line:84%
got the ring, or vibration,
of cosmic sovereignty,

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:41.440 align:middle line:84%
you can do just about anything
you want-- manifest objects,

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:43.760 align:middle line:84%
travel through
portals, you name it.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.350 align:middle line:84%
You're an interdimensional
being, is the way I look at it,

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:51.510 align:middle line:84%
and here he is in his winged
craft, or his winged disk.

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:53.470 align:middle line:10%
Here's another god
that's also in the ring,

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:57.820 align:middle line:10%
and we notice how it compares
favorably with the Ouroboros

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:01.800 align:middle line:10%
ring of alchemy, the symbol
of our ultimate transmutation

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.207 align:middle line:10%
into a god-being.

00:29:03.207 --> 00:29:04.915 align:middle line:10%
And that's what I
think the ring actually

00:29:04.915 --> 00:29:08.510 align:middle line:10%
is, is symbolic of that ring
of cosmic sovereignty, which

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:10.800 align:middle line:10%
is why in the Middle
Ages Jesus was portrayed

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.379 align:middle line:10%
in the golden ring.

00:29:12.379 --> 00:29:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Remember earlier I mentioned
a group called the Knights

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.410 align:middle line:90%
of the Golden Circle?

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:22.320 align:middle line:84%
The Knight of the Golden Circle
right there-- the golden circle

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.930 align:middle line:84%
is the circle of alchemy,
and that's the secrets

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:28.320 align:middle line:84%
that these beings
or these figures

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:32.340 align:middle line:90%
ultimately protect and purvey.

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.760 align:middle line:84%
The ring or disk
of life is called

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.870 align:middle line:90%
the Aton in ancient Egypt.

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And here we have Akhenaten
and his bride Nefertiti

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:41.580 align:middle line:84%
with their child,
initiating them

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:46.970 align:middle line:84%
in the rays or vibrations,
the ring of the Aton disk.

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:50.650 align:middle line:84%
Here is Akhenaten
and Nefertiti bathing

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:52.160 align:middle line:84%
themselves,
baptizing themselves,

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:55.150 align:middle line:84%
in fact inhaling the ring
of cosmic sovereignty

00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:59.680 align:middle line:84%
and also transmitting it
through the key of life.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.490 align:middle line:84%
There's a funny wordplay
here, notice by Sigmund Freud,

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:07.570 align:middle line:84%
that Aton, A-T-O-N,
and Adon, A-D-O-N,

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:10.080 align:middle line:84%
are interchangeable terms,
because the letters D and T are

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.270 align:middle line:90%
interchangeable.

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:16.440 align:middle line:84%
So Aton, the Egyptian word for
"the disk," "the light," which

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.720 align:middle line:84%
is, in fact, the light
behind the light, and Adon,

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:24.050 align:middle line:84%
the Hebrew word for
the Lord, are the same.

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And there's excellent
research out now

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:29.860 align:middle line:84%
that tells us that Jesus and
Mary Magdalene, Akhenaten

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:33.300 align:middle line:84%
and Nefertiti are
intertwined, interchangeable,

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:36.940 align:middle line:84%
in fact, that the Essenes
were great assimilators

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:41.637 align:middle line:84%
of the original teaching of the
Aton, the light behind the sun.

00:30:41.637 --> 00:30:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Egyptologists want
you to believe they

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.340 align:middle line:90%
worshipped the sun-- wrong.

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:48.060 align:middle line:10%
What they worshipped, what they
were calling to be the Aton,

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:51.150 align:middle line:10%
was the light that
illuminated the sun,

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:53.520 align:middle line:10%
the sun behind
the sun, something

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:58.150 align:middle line:10%
they called the Black Sun,
black because it's secretive,

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:03.540 align:middle line:10%
hidden-- the hidden sun or
hidden light behind the sun.

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:06.200 align:middle line:10%
And so in my view,
the instrument

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.580 align:middle line:10%
that Akhenaten is
using to channel

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:11.680 align:middle line:10%
the rays of the celestial
disk of the Aton

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:14.160 align:middle line:10%
and the rod or wand in
Jesus' hand I believe

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.510 align:middle line:10%
are interchangeable.

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:17.350 align:middle line:10%
In fact, I would
go so far as to say

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:20.260 align:middle line:10%
that the rod or
wand in Jesus' hand

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:24.480 align:middle line:10%
is one of the rays or wands
emanating from the Aton, which

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:28.150 align:middle line:10%
means that Jesus was
actually using a ray of light

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:33.010 align:middle line:10%
to perform his miracles that
is symbolized by an actual rod

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:34.880 align:middle line:10%
or wand.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.940 align:middle line:84%
You see Akhenaten with
Nefertiti, his bride.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:41.540 align:middle line:84%
She holds an alabaster jar
in her hand of anointing oil.

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Mary Magdalene became known as
the woman with the alabaster

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:48.030 align:middle line:90%
jar in the Jesus story.

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Both of these couples,
these divine, royal couples,

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:56.200 align:middle line:84%
are performing identical
functions at their time.
