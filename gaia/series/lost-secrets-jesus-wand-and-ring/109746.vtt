00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.930 align:middle line:84%
>>And this is why
from the Pistis Sophia

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.530 align:middle line:84%
I cite this quote every
time I give a presentation.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.110 align:middle line:84%
If you hear nothing
else from me,

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.130 align:middle line:84%
I will hope that you will
listen to this and refer to it

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.180 align:middle line:84%
often, because I believe
it's the mission statement

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.540 align:middle line:90%
for our incarnation on Earth.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.070 align:middle line:84%
In answer to a question
by Mary Magdalene,

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.630 align:middle line:84%
Jesus says, "Cease not
to seek day and night

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.970 align:middle line:84%
and remit not yourselves
until you find the purifying

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.100 align:middle line:84%
mysteries, which will
purify you and make you

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.330 align:middle line:84%
into a refined light so
that you will go on height

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.910 align:middle line:84%
and inherit the
light of my kingdom."

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.410 align:middle line:84%
"Cease not to seek day and
night and remit not yourselves

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.376 align:middle line:84%
until you find the purifying
mysteries which will purify you

00:00:54.376 --> 00:00:55.750 align:middle line:84%
and make you into
a refined light

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.458 align:middle line:84%
so that you will go
on height and inherit

00:00:57.458 --> 00:00:58.720 align:middle line:90%
the light of my kingdom."

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.460 align:middle line:84%
What happened to
those teachings?

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.775 align:middle line:90%
Where did they go?

00:01:03.775 --> 00:01:06.310 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.590 align:middle line:84%
They're in the
air all around us.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.670 align:middle line:90%
That's the answer to me.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.530 align:middle line:90%
That's the answer to me.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, Mary Magdalene
downloaded this knowledge

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.200 align:middle line:84%
into the thought-sphere
that surrounds this planet--

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.250 align:middle line:90%
the thought-sphere.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Just like there's
an atmosphere, just

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.220 align:middle line:84%
like there's a soul-sphere,
there is a thought-sphere.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.540 align:middle line:84%
This is why two people separated
by vast distances living

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.397 align:middle line:84%
on different continents
can have the same idea.

00:01:32.397 --> 00:01:34.230 align:middle line:84%
They just pull it out
of the thought-sphere.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.830 align:middle line:84%
John Lennon said,
hey, I didn't write

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.235 align:middle line:90%
a lot of those Beatles songs.

00:01:37.235 --> 00:01:38.360 align:middle line:90%
I just put my name on them.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.030 align:middle line:90%
They came to me fully formed.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.950 align:middle line:84%
They dropped out of
the thought-sphere.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I'm
convinced these teachings are.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.780 align:middle line:84%
We just need to recognize that
our divine spark can access

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.910 align:middle line:84%
these teachings while our
conscious mind might not

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.320 align:middle line:90%
be able to.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And we begin to put ourselves
in resonance with them

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.640 align:middle line:84%
by looking for them, by
asking for these downloads.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.060 align:middle line:84%
This is our mission
statement for life.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.858 align:middle line:90%
Why am I on Earth?

00:02:05.858 --> 00:02:07.220 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.910 align:middle line:84%
It's not spend my days
shopping at Wal-Mart.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not going-- he doesn't
say, go to the mall,

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.260 align:middle line:84%
shop till you drop,
burn yourself out

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.010 align:middle line:90%
in a career you hate.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.029 align:middle line:90%
It's find these mysteries.

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:23.320 align:middle line:84%
What we're talking about with
these purifying mysteries

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.241 align:middle line:90%
is called the rainbow body.

00:02:25.241 --> 00:02:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And in future
lectures, you're going

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.280 align:middle line:84%
to hear me talk about the
rainbow body more and more.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.360 align:middle line:84%
I had a wonderful experience--
just a brief anecdote.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.280 align:middle line:84%
I was recently at a conference,
and a really lovely couple

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.932 align:middle line:84%
came up to me, and they're
like, yeah, you're right on it.

00:02:39.932 --> 00:02:41.390 align:middle line:84%
What you're talking
about with this

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.950 align:middle line:84%
the body is a wormhole,
that's really cool.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.290 align:middle line:84%
We're PhDs from the
Harvard Divinity School,

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.830 align:middle line:84%
and we've been to India,
and we've been to Tibet,

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.270 align:middle line:84%
spent years there talking
with the Lamas there.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about
dissolving the body into light

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.850 align:middle line:84%
and then entering into
a pinpoint of light.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.620 align:middle line:84%
But they said, what
they're not adding

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.440 align:middle line:84%
is the piece that you're adding,
that that light is a wormhole.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.440 align:middle line:84%
It's like, yes, that's
exactly what I'm saying.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And so now what we're trying
to do is bring the Tibetan

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.187 align:middle line:84%
tradition together with
modern Western science,

00:03:18.187 --> 00:03:20.270 align:middle line:84%
beliefs in wormholes because
I believe that that's

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.530 align:middle line:90%
what they're describing.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.920 align:middle line:84%
These Lamas at the
time of their death,

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.540 align:middle line:84%
they would go sit
in a chamber for 49

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.690 align:middle line:90%
days, the period of incubation.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.110 align:middle line:84%
After 49 days, there was
nothing left in the chamber.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.380 align:middle line:84%
They dissolved
themselves into light

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.650 align:middle line:84%
and entered another
realm through a wormhole.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.110 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're understanding
today is how they did it.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
ancient Egyptians

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.090 align:middle line:84%
and possibly the Atlanteans
had that understanding as well.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.740 align:middle line:10%
And this is why this
is so important,

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.690 align:middle line:10%
the statement from Jesus, "The
light of the body is the eye.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.480 align:middle line:10%
It therefore thine eye
be simple, thy whole body

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.720 align:middle line:10%
will be full of light."

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.850 align:middle line:10%
Thy whole body will
be full of life,

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:09.980 align:middle line:10%
become focused on your
body as a light entity

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.400 align:middle line:10%
and refine that light, purify
it through your thoughts,

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.209 align:middle line:10%
through your diet, through
your spiritual application

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.510 align:middle line:10%
and however you want
to exemplify that.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.020 align:middle line:84%
This is how we begin to put
ourselves in tune or resonance

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.610 align:middle line:90%
with these teachings.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.770 align:middle line:10%
And so when John the Baptist
baptized Jesus in the River

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.290 align:middle line:10%
Jordan, it's important for us
to recognize, first of all,

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.510 align:middle line:10%
that that word "Jordan" comes
from the Babylonian word

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.490 align:middle line:10%
Eridanus, which
means River of Life

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.830 align:middle line:10%
and was applied
to the Milky Way.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.500 align:middle line:84%
So maybe he wasn't baptizing
him in a polluted river

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.260 align:middle line:90%
in Palestine after all.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Maybe John the
Baptist was initiating

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Jesus in some star knowledge,
esoteric knowledge that came

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.420 align:middle line:90%
from or about the Milky Way.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And what we see
here is this angel

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.150 align:middle line:84%
waiting to give Jesus his
new cloak, his new garment.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
important concept,

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.190 align:middle line:84%
because that is a
light body that he

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.970 align:middle line:90%
is receiving-- a light body.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.500 align:middle line:84%
When John the Baptist
appeared on the scene,

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.510 align:middle line:84%
they asked Jesus, hey,
who is John the Baptist?

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.080 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I
think he's Elijah.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.790 align:middle line:84%
I think he's the
reincarnated Elijah.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's very interesting,
because before Elijah ascended

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.850 align:middle line:84%
into the heavens in a whirlwind,
he turned to his priest Elisha

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.290 align:middle line:84%
and transmitted to
him a garment called

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.280 align:middle line:84%
his mantle, which I believe
is symbolic of this teaching.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Elijah said, hey, buddy,
I'm going to dissolve myself

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.770 align:middle line:90%
into the whirlwind.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to enter
this other dimension.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.010 align:middle line:84%
But, hey, baby, if you
want to do it, here you go.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.980 align:middle line:90%
Here's the teaching right here.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.970 align:middle line:90%
And Elisha hung on to it.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Then it appears to me that
when Elijah comes back around

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.940 align:middle line:84%
as John the Baptist, he went
and recovered that cloak.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.630 align:middle line:84%
I call it the cloak of
the Illuminati, the cloak

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.860 align:middle line:90%
of the illumined ones.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.650 align:middle line:84%
There is an earthly
counterpart to that.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:15.330 align:middle line:84%
As we develop this light body,
it changes our earthly body.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.350 align:middle line:84%
According to Wally Budge, a few
of the many powers possessed

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.010 align:middle line:84%
by these cloak-clad oracles,
as they were called,

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.060 align:middle line:84%
include healing the sick,
cloaking his companions

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.750 align:middle line:84%
in an incorruptible body,
manipulation of matter,

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.650 align:middle line:90%
predicting the future.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that what the
Seal of Solomon did?

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Didn't it also produce
those wonderful things?

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe there's a
correlation between those two.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Mary Magdalene is also
connected with the mysteries

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:48.000 align:middle line:84%
of this cloak, or
this garment of light.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.280 align:middle line:84%
So is Osiris, who is portrayed
here and his pupal form--

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.670 align:middle line:84%
pupal, P-U-P-A-L, like
the caterpillar preparing

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.770 align:middle line:84%
to transform itself
into a butterfly.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Except in Egypt, they call that
garment the crossed garment.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.620 align:middle line:84%
I like to joke that here
when you speak Southern,

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:10.000 align:middle line:84%
people say, hey, I'm going
to the church of "Chrast."

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Little do they realize
they're actually

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.030 align:middle line:84%
utilizing an ancient
Egyptian word, "karast."

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And what "karast"
referred to originally

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:24.220 align:middle line:84%
was a garment of light
put on the body of Osiris.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.600 align:middle line:84%
It referred to the transfigured,
re-erected mummy otherwise

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.620 align:middle line:84%
called the karast and
was the supreme symbol

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.290 align:middle line:90%
of the Egyptian mysteries.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:33.500 align:middle line:90%
Here you go.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Here's your karast body,
your garment of light.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.580 align:middle line:84%
You're good to go,
ready to launch.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I return once again to
the quote by Terence McKenna.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:48.390 align:middle line:84%
"We are like caterpillars
in a pupal form,

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:51.880 align:middle line:84%
contemplating pupation,
transformation."

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.790 align:middle line:84%
No longer will I chew
on the cabbage leaves.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:58.070 align:middle line:84%
You won't catch me at
Burger King anymore, honey.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.110 align:middle line:84%
No longer will I spend
my time moving around

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.630 align:middle line:90%
on the underside of the foliage.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:04.750 align:middle line:90%
Nope.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.280 align:middle line:90%
Not going to do it.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Instead, my life, as Jesus
said in the Pistis Sophia,

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.120 align:middle line:84%
must be a preparation
for a transition

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.970 align:middle line:90%
to another dimension.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:18.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm committed to go return
to the immortal realm

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:22.220 align:middle line:84%
of the Barbelo to live
with the light beings.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And we find example after
example in ancient art

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.890 align:middle line:90%
of this transformation.

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:32.309 align:middle line:84%
Osiris is wrapped
in his karast body,

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:36.270 align:middle line:90%
his tight-fitting holy shroud.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:39.429 align:middle line:84%
Isis stands above
him, beaming him

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:42.490 align:middle line:90%
energy, lifting his vibration.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Again, this could be the star
Sirius beaming this higher

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.890 align:middle line:84%
energy to us, with Osiris
representing the Earth.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:53.160 align:middle line:84%
But either way, the
ship that Osiris

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.220 align:middle line:84%
is going to ride
upon into eternity,

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.410 align:middle line:84%
the way the Egyptians
portrayed it is exactly

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.850 align:middle line:84%
the way Professor
Stephen Hawking portrays

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.560 align:middle line:90%
a wormhole today.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.510 align:middle line:84%
Stephen Hawking a
reincarnated Egyptian priest?

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.090 align:middle line:90%
Can't say that.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.210 align:middle line:84%
But I can't say
for sure he better

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:13.100 align:middle line:84%
check out some of this
ancient Egyptian imagery,

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.630 align:middle line:84%
because this has all
been done before.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're on the
threshold of awakening

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.710 align:middle line:84%
today, where we
can understand what

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:21.740 align:middle line:84%
is going on here
and the potential

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.790 align:middle line:90%
that that leaves for us.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Can wormholes lead
to time travel?

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.890 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.657 align:middle line:84%
This is how they used
to portray the stairway

00:09:31.657 --> 00:09:32.490 align:middle line:90%
or ladder to heaven.

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:38.070 align:middle line:84%
This is once again from
Notre Dame Cathedral.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.440 align:middle line:10%
This is how I show Mary
Magdalene contemplating

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.140 align:middle line:10%
the same mysteries
today on the cover

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:46.060 align:middle line:10%
of my DVD, "Stairway to Heaven,"
Mary Magdalene in a state

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.720 align:middle line:10%
of ecstasy.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.560 align:middle line:90%
Our brain is a wormhole.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.810 align:middle line:84%
It is our brain that can
contemplate the wormhole.

00:09:55.810 --> 00:10:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And I just find it kind of--
I guess humorous is the word.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.340 align:middle line:84%
If you take your human
ears and go like this,

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:07.190 align:middle line:84%
it looks like the mouths are
the gates of the wormhole,

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.650 align:middle line:84%
and the folds of
our brain does look

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:13.169 align:middle line:84%
like a squinched-up
serpent, or worm.

00:10:13.169 --> 00:10:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where
I get this notion

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:18.360 align:middle line:84%
that I think our brain
is actually the place.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Descartes said the pineal
gland is the seat of our soul.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And it could well be that that
divine spark I'm describing

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:28.190 align:middle line:84%
doesn't actually live in the
heart, as you might think.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:32.040 align:middle line:84%
It actually wells
in the pineal gland.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And to the extent that we
contemplate such imagery

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.540 align:middle line:84%
and understand it and
the transformation

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:40.170 align:middle line:84%
that is encoded within
such imagery, now

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.790 align:middle line:84%
we begin that process
of activation.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:47.399 align:middle line:84%
So again, to activate the temple
of light for our evolving soul,

00:10:47.399 --> 00:10:49.440 align:middle line:84%
we've got to liberate
ourselves from the delusion

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.273 align:middle line:90%
that we're helpless.

00:10:50.273 --> 00:10:52.940 align:middle line:90%


00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:56.470 align:middle line:10%
We've got to reconcile the
opposite polarities within.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.860 align:middle line:10%
And the example I cite
for this is very simple.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.400 align:middle line:10%
I cite it almost every
time I give a presentation,

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.140 align:middle line:10%
because like the
statement of Jesus,

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.390 align:middle line:10%
this goes along with that.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
lesson of Earth life.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.340 align:middle line:84%
It's 12 lines brought to
life in our imagination that

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:17.040 align:middle line:84%
are projected on a
screen-- if we accept

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.810 align:middle line:84%
that this three-dimensional
cube is merely 12 lines brought

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:21.930 align:middle line:84%
to life on our
screen, then we have

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:25.790 align:middle line:84%
to accept the possibility that
this remote control is also

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:28.150 align:middle line:84%
something different than
it first appears to be.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.260 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the physics
teacher would tell us

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.300 align:middle line:84%
that this remote control,
while it appears to be solid,

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.480 align:middle line:90%
is, in fact, not solid at all.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:39.060 align:middle line:84%
It's merely a collection of
atoms, molecules, and energy

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:42.050 align:middle line:84%
in motion that's brought
to life in our imagination,

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:45.600 align:middle line:84%
and we agree that
this thing is solid.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.780 align:middle line:84%
If that's true, and
I believe it's true,

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.050 align:middle line:84%
then this cube offers us
a very important piece

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:51.031 align:middle line:90%
of understanding.

00:11:51.031 --> 00:11:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look at this
cube from one perspective,

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.150 align:middle line:84%
it looks like you're
looking into it,

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:56.690 align:middle line:90%
looking at it from the bottom.

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.290 align:middle line:84%
But now if we shift
our perspective

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.220 align:middle line:84%
and look at it
from the top down,

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:05.140 align:middle line:84%
now it looks like another
cube manifests before us.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:09.900 align:middle line:84%
If we call the bottom way
fear and the top way love,

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.430 align:middle line:84%
it provides for us the
two ways we typically

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:16.090 align:middle line:84%
approach people and situations
here in this realm and the way

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:18.040 align:middle line:90%
that they approach us.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Those are really the
only two emotions.

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.060 align:middle line:90%
It's either love or fear.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.320 align:middle line:84%
Everything else
is simply a shade

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.120 align:middle line:90%
or a variation of love or fear.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:32.020 align:middle line:84%
The Hopi tell us as we
get closer to 2012 only

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.710 align:middle line:84%
love can exist in our
heart because more

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.590 align:middle line:84%
and more, our thoughts
and our actions

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.880 align:middle line:84%
are going to become
instantly real.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:43.140 align:middle line:84%
That means we can't be in
the terror zone anymore.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.770 align:middle line:84%
We've got to find a way to get
into the love zone, the tara,

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:49.280 align:middle line:84%
or compassion and
enlightenment, zone

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.880 align:middle line:84%
so that we can be in balance
and in harmony with this shift.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Once we do that, our
three-dimensional cube

00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:02.290 align:middle line:84%
becomes the core of a
fourth-dimensional hypercube.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.780 align:middle line:84%
More and more, we find
ourselves interacting

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:08.730 align:middle line:84%
with the other dimensions and
higher capabilities within us.

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Because it is love within us
that activates these higher

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.510 align:middle line:90%
capabilities.

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And that is the reward for
focusing on the love zone,

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.980 align:middle line:84%
is access to these higher
dimensional realms.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.200 align:middle line:90%


00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Our lack of or
misunderstanding or darkness

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:32.820 align:middle line:84%
concerning these other
dimensions is the fall.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Eden is that frequency
of love or vibration.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.530 align:middle line:90%
It is the Garden of Galaxies.

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And when they talk
about a fall, the fall

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.960 align:middle line:84%
is the fall from this
original unity and access

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.430 align:middle line:84%
to transdimensional stargates,
wormholes, and higher

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:49.900 align:middle line:90%
capabilities within our body.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.310 align:middle line:84%
The fall is from this original
unity, this multiplicity.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:57.060 align:middle line:84%
This is why all spiritual
teachings describe this path

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:01.550 align:middle line:84%
as a path of healing, because
its goal is wholeness,

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:09.880 align:middle line:84%
W-H-O-L-E-N-E-S-S. But the
goal is really holiness,

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:18.180 align:middle line:84%
H-O-L-I-N-E-S-S. As we
become whole, we become holy.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's what enables us to
open the holes in space time

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.250 align:middle line:90%
and step through them.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:28.150 align:middle line:90%
That is what our goal is.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.160 align:middle line:84%
The goal is wholeness,
it's holiness,

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.930 align:middle line:84%
and the unity of all
things on a higher level.

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:38.580 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're striving for.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Here's how we get things
to happen in the 3-D world.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.770 align:middle line:10%
You have an inspiration.

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:46.480 align:middle line:10%
We think the thought about it.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.490 align:middle line:10%
We put emotion into it.

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:54.490 align:middle line:10%
Then with effort, usually
lots of it and lots of time,

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:56.260 align:middle line:10%
then something can happen.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.600 align:middle line:90%
We've all bought into this.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.890 align:middle line:90%
We were raised this way.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.660 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the
American thought-sphere

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.260 align:middle line:90%
especially-- hard work.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.140 align:middle line:84%
You really want something,
put your mind to it

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.150 align:middle line:84%
and put a lot of effort
into it and a lot

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:12.790 align:middle line:90%
of time and maybe some luck.

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:15.120 align:middle line:90%
You'll get it, OK?

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.530 align:middle line:84%
No matter what the goal is,
that's the process that we all

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.020 align:middle line:84%
have bought into,
that this is the way

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.840 align:middle line:90%
it works in the real world.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.280 align:middle line:84%
But in the 4-D world, the one
we're embracing and activating

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.240 align:middle line:84%
within ourselves, the sequence
that leads to manifestation

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.810 align:middle line:90%
looks like this.

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:36.390 align:middle line:84%
You have the inspiration,
put the thought into it,

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:39.530 align:middle line:84%
really focus on
the emotion, feel

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:42.170 align:middle line:84%
what it would be like
on every possible level

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:46.290 align:middle line:84%
to achieve that manifestation,
and it will happen.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:49.310 align:middle line:90%
What's missing?

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Effort and lots of time--
that's the big shift,

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.590 align:middle line:84%
that we can actually
bring things

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.850 align:middle line:90%
into instant manifestation.

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:04.420 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
stepping into, and that's

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:07.130 align:middle line:84%
part of the value of
stepping into this

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:09.850 align:middle line:84%
or embracing this
kind of thought.

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:12.060 align:middle line:90%
That transforms us into fools.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody knows
you can't get shit

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.760 align:middle line:84%
without really
working your ass off.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.360 align:middle line:84%
So you're a fool
to believe that.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.450 align:middle line:90%
Wrong.

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:22.000 align:middle line:84%
The fool in the ancient
world was not an idiot.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.320 align:middle line:90%
The fool was fearless.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.860 align:middle line:84%
But I don't like to
call anybody fearless,

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.550 align:middle line:84%
because I don't
want to be fearless.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:31.310 align:middle line:90%
I want to be what?

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Full of love-- that's the
opposite of fearless, isn't it?

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm full of love,
then what that means

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:43.210 align:middle line:84%
is that I have the power
of instant manifestation.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:44.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm an alchemist,
in other words.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.210 align:middle line:84%
I can take lead and turn it
into gold with my thoughts,

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:50.790 align:middle line:90%
with my energy, with my emotion.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And the emotion that transforms
and transmutes is not fear.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.520 align:middle line:84%
The emotion that
transmutes and transforms

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.750 align:middle line:90%
is love, or a hyperlove.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:middle line:84%
What I'm showing you here
is actually a tarot card.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.579 align:middle line:84%
It was Thoth, that Egyptian
god of divine magic and alchemy

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:12.590 align:middle line:84%
who is credited with the
creation of the tarot deck.

00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Thoth was the great
initiator of ancient Egypt.

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:17.410 align:middle line:84%
We see here from
the Temple of Edfu,

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:21.190 align:middle line:84%
the pharaoh preparing to
scale the ladder to heaven.

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:22.720 align:middle line:90%
And note the musical term.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.220 align:middle line:90%
He's going to scale it.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.260 align:middle line:84%
He's going to put himself
at the same frequency

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.140 align:middle line:84%
or vibration as the
ladder to heaven

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and then enter that heavenly
realm, which is symbolized here

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:39.120 align:middle line:84%
by Thoth levitating before
this utensil, or device.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And the ship that the
figure or the pharaoh

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:45.360 align:middle line:84%
is going to sail upon
is the Bark or Ark

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.160 align:middle line:84%
of the Millions of Years,
which is the whole wormhole

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.050 align:middle line:90%
concept illustrated once again.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:55.260 align:middle line:84%
So in my view, the word
"tarot" means royal path.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:18:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And what the tarot provides
for us is that royal pathway.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And the royal path
is from zero to hero,

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.990 align:middle line:84%
22 cards in the major
arcana beginning with 0,

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:10.770 align:middle line:84%
the Fool, the fearless
one, the one full of love,

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:14.880 align:middle line:84%
who is seeking the gate to the
higher realms, the gate here

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.380 align:middle line:84%
being symbolized by the
almond-shaped doorway called

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.840 align:middle line:90%
the amandorla.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.510 align:middle line:90%


00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:25.440 align:middle line:84%
To activate the
temple of light, we

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.150 align:middle line:84%
must reconcile the
opposites within

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.170 align:middle line:90%
and unite the rod and ring.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
want to talk about.

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:34.351 align:middle line:10%
And the way I want
to talk about that

00:18:34.351 --> 00:18:39.010 align:middle line:10%
now is by utilizing some
imagery from the tarot,

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:40.960 align:middle line:10%
especially from the
ancient Egyptian tarot

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.880 align:middle line:10%
by Clive Barrett.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.860 align:middle line:10%
In ancient Egypt,
male and female

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.810 align:middle line:10%
were portrayed very distinctly.

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:49.120 align:middle line:10%
And by that, I mean
the females were always

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:55.320 align:middle line:10%
portrayed with Caucasian-type
skin, pale yellow to white.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:01.200 align:middle line:84%
The men were always
portrayed red, red and white.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.560 align:middle line:84%
This is why in
alchemical depictions

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:08.600 align:middle line:84%
you'll see the red king
and the white queen.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.930 align:middle line:84%
This goes all the way
back to ancient Egypt.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And what they're describing
with the red king

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.850 align:middle line:84%
and the white queen is the
unity of male and female,

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:20.050 align:middle line:84%
the rod and ring,
the reconciliation

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:21.700 align:middle line:90%
of the opposites.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:25.360 align:middle line:84%
In the tarot, in
the sun card, we

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.480 align:middle line:84%
see the male and
female arm in arm

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.220 align:middle line:84%
underneath the big,
beautiful ball of sun

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.254 align:middle line:84%
with the mount of
creation behind them.

00:19:32.254 --> 00:19:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And what we notice
is that they're

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:39.510 align:middle line:84%
standing in a ring, a circle,
of all the colors of a rainbow.

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, Clive Barrett doesn't say
this, but what I'm suggesting

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:46.470 align:middle line:84%
is that they're standing in
the ring of what is called

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:48.700 align:middle line:90%
the ring of cosmic sovereignty.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:52.160 align:middle line:84%
They're standing in the
gate of manifestation.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.720 align:middle line:84%
This male and female figure
are our inner male and female

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.640 align:middle line:90%
figure.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And as we reconcile the
opposites within ourselves,

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.560 align:middle line:84%
within our inner
male and female,

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.220 align:middle line:84%
this is what puts us in that
state or vibration of love that

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:08.460 align:middle line:90%
enables that vibration.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.360 align:middle line:84%
I've been reading
the tarot for, gosh,

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, eight years
now or so professionally.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And very often when people
come to me for a reading,

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.310 align:middle line:84%
this is one of the
cards that pops up.

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:21.020 align:middle line:90%
This is the eight of swords.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
people find themselves

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.510 align:middle line:90%
when they come to me.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:27.570 align:middle line:84%
They're on one side
of this precipice,

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:31.270 align:middle line:84%
and all the good stuff they
want is on the other side.

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:32.610 align:middle line:90%
But there's no bridge.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:33.700 align:middle line:90%
There's no rope.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:34.840 align:middle line:90%
There's no ladder.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:38.080 align:middle line:84%
There's no apparent way for
them to get across here.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And what they're really
asking me is, how am I

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.060 align:middle line:90%
going to get across there?

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.240 align:middle line:84%
First thing I tell
them is that these

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:49.430 align:middle line:84%
swords that we see in front of
us here aren't really swords.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.920 align:middle line:84%
In the tarot, I believe
those are words.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Because when you take the
letter S off the word "sword,"

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:57.060 align:middle line:90%
you're left with "words."

00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And what I try to
identify in the reading

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:04.050 align:middle line:84%
right off the bat is what are
the words, the vibrations, that

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:09.030 align:middle line:84%
are in front of you that are
keeping you locked in place?

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Very often those words
are "I'm lonely,"

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:16.890 align:middle line:84%
"I'm in a terrible
marriage," "I'm

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:20.830 align:middle line:84%
not experiencing the
fulfilled career I want."

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:24.970 align:middle line:84%
No matter what it is,
the bottom-line word

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:30.520 align:middle line:84%
that it all gets condensed
down to is "I'm afraid."

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.980 align:middle line:90%
And that's why they stay here.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:36.460 align:middle line:84%
As they're at this place, they
have really only two choices.

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:40.100 align:middle line:84%
One, they can go back
around the other side.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Three, six, eight
weeks, months, or years

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:44.300 align:middle line:84%
later-- whoops--
they're going to come

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.730 align:middle line:90%
right back to this same place.

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Because usually we
want to avoid fear.

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.060 align:middle line:90%
We want to avoid pain.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:53.337 align:middle line:84%
And we think we might
be able to sidetrack it.

00:21:53.337 --> 00:21:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And once they come
back to this place,

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.140 align:middle line:84%
they only have two
more choices again.

00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:00.300 align:middle line:84%
They can go back around the
other way, which is frequently

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.570 align:middle line:90%
what happens.

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Three, six, eight
weeks, months, years--

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:06.630 align:middle line:84%
whoops-- they're right
back to this place again.

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Or they can begin to
set their sights on what

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:13.350 align:middle line:90%
it is that they do want.

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Again, here are some examples
of what people don't want.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:18.680 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, I'm
overspending, I'm stuck,

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm not fulfilling my real
potential, I'm alienated,

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:25.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm isolated, I'm alone,
I'm not connected.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.270 align:middle line:90%
This is my favorite one.

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:28.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm packing spiritual power.

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.810 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked
that woman, I said,

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:34.262 align:middle line:84%
what do your closets
look like at home?

00:22:34.262 --> 00:22:35.410 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:37.750 align:middle line:90%
She said, well, they're stuffed.

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:40.450 align:middle line:84%
I said, yeah, you're packing
spiritual power, all right.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:44.240 align:middle line:84%
You're packing it
away in your closet.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.760 align:middle line:84%
What she meant is that
I'm a real powerful person

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.520 align:middle line:90%
spiritually, but I'm packing it.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.595 align:middle line:90%
I'm stuffing it away.

00:22:50.595 --> 00:22:53.190 align:middle line:90%


00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And again, the bottom
line is I'm afraid.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And what we're trying to
do in this path, which

00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:03.500 align:middle line:84%
the tarot helps us
with, is to get unstuck

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:04.860 align:middle line:90%
and to not be afraid anymore.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.540 align:middle line:84%
But we don't want to
be afraid anymore.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.810 align:middle line:90%
We want to be in love.

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:13.120 align:middle line:10%
But it's a narrow bridge
that leads to this path here.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.790 align:middle line:10%
And that's kind of the hitch.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:16.070 align:middle line:10%
And that's why there's fear.

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:19.920 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, we can take a few steps,
but like the guy in the center,

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.760 align:middle line:10%
it's a real balancing act, as
you probably all experienced

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:27.130 align:middle line:10%
it-- yeah, hey, I'm taking off
on these ascension teachings.

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And your family might have
said, what, are you crazy?

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Just stick with the
church, as an example.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:36.360 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with the church?

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Here's the hold-up
for many of us.

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:40.980 align:middle line:84%
We all have an inner
male and female side.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.210 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like a dumb
question when I ask people,

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:45.439 align:middle line:84%
do you recognize you have
a male and a female side?

00:23:45.439 --> 00:23:46.980 align:middle line:84%
I might as well just
ask, hey, do you

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.000 align:middle line:84%
know the moon is
made of green cheese?

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Because they think it's
a really stupid question

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:55.540 align:middle line:84%
or it's completely irrelevant,
when, in fact, that's

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.510 align:middle line:84%
the starting place,
because we all

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:00.990 align:middle line:84%
have this polarity within
us, this opposites.

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:03.450 align:middle line:84%
They're often at war
with one another.

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Consequently, if our inner
male and female look like this,

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.150 align:middle line:84%
guess what your relationships
are going to look like out here

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:11.650 align:middle line:90%
in the real world?

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:13.430 align:middle line:90%
The exact same way.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And so we all have this
inner male and female,

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:18.790 align:middle line:84%
and one thing that I've
observed in reading the tarot

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:22.230 align:middle line:84%
is that in a traditional
relationship,

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:24.970 align:middle line:84%
the male feels like its
primary responsibility

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:30.590 align:middle line:84%
towards the female is to
protect her, to provide for her.

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:33.500 align:middle line:84%
But behind that is a
really important one,

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.910 align:middle line:84%
and that is she just wants
him to pay attention to her.

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:39.260 align:middle line:90%
Turn off the football game.

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.530 align:middle line:90%
Don't work so late.

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Pay attention to me,
not your computer.

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.557 align:middle line:90%
That's what she really wants.

00:24:45.557 --> 00:24:47.140 align:middle line:84%
But the male is like,
well, if I don't

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:48.570 align:middle line:84%
work all these
long hours, how do

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:51.320 align:middle line:84%
you think I'm going to pay
for taking you out to dinner?

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Or whatever the excuse is, and
so the male and the female,

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.320 align:middle line:84%
she's in tears on
the bench here.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.220 align:middle line:84%
He's staring out the window
going, women-- geez, man.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:01.020 align:middle line:90%
Whew.

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:02.550 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to do here?

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And so we've got to
find a way to reconcile

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:06.982 align:middle line:90%
these opposites within.

00:25:06.982 --> 00:25:11.380 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, here's the
male side's natural domain.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:16.870 align:middle line:84%
This is where the male side
focuses his energy and emotion

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:18.220 align:middle line:90%
for the most part.

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Looking up at these swords
are actually words above him,

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:24.130 align:middle line:84%
which represent what
he doesn't want-- oh, I

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:25.850 align:middle line:84%
don't want to go
broke; I don't want

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:30.380 align:middle line:84%
to work in this job--
everything that we don't want.

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.595 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually worry,
fear, stress, anxiety, doubt.

00:25:33.595 --> 00:25:37.450 align:middle line:84%
But the really big one
is disbelief-related.

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:39.300 align:middle line:84%
The male side just
simply usually

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:44.110 align:middle line:84%
does not believe that it can
make a change in its life.

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:47.450 align:middle line:84%
It does not want to step out
and try to make a change,

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:50.675 align:middle line:84%
because that means
stepping into the unknown.

00:25:50.675 --> 00:25:52.910 align:middle line:90%
And that brings about fear.

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And what that brings
about is paralysis--

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.840 align:middle line:84%
sitting on the couch at home,
probably a Corona beside him,

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.160 align:middle line:84%
focusing on worry, fear,
stress, anxiety, and doubt.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:08.410 align:middle line:84%
While all along right beside
him is the ankh, or key of life,

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:15.140 align:middle line:84%
the symbol of our escape or
release from this condition.

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:17.230 align:middle line:84%
So what I'll do in the
course of a reading

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:22.190 align:middle line:84%
is I'll be listening at
first and going along,

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:27.140 align:middle line:84%
and we get a whole list of,
hey, this is what I don't want.

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:30.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm stuck, I'm
alone, I'm isolated,

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:31.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm broke, whatever it is.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:35.585 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll ask another really
dumb question, even dumber

00:26:35.585 --> 00:26:37.960 align:middle line:84%
than, do you recognize you
have a male and a female side?

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And that question
is, well, we just

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:46.490 align:middle line:84%
went through what you don't
want-- what do you want?

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:48.590 align:middle line:90%
What you mean what do I want?

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:53.880 align:middle line:84%
It's like nobody ever asks
you, what do you want?

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And very often,
there is silence.

00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:00.880 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what I do want.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, very often,
what you do want--

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:09.258 align:middle line:84%
guess what-- is the opposite
of what you don't want.

00:27:09.258 --> 00:27:11.400 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:18.170 align:middle line:84%
So I'll just suggest, what's the
opposite of feeling isolated?

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:19.660 align:middle line:90%
Connected.

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:22.740 align:middle line:84%
What's the opposite
of being shut down?

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.450 align:middle line:90%
Activated.

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:27.840 align:middle line:84%
What's the opposite
of being unfulfilled?

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.350 align:middle line:90%
Fulfilled.

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And so we'll start to
generate this list,

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:33.470 align:middle line:84%
and I'll put them in
a circle like this

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:35.900 align:middle line:90%
with a dot in the center.

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say, OK, this
is what we do want.

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:44.320 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that
this is what we do want,

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.800 align:middle line:84%
but we're still vibing
at the frequency

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:48.650 align:middle line:90%
of what we don't want.

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:51.790 align:middle line:84%
That male side keeps putting
out that thunderstorm energy,

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:54.250 align:middle line:84%
saying, hey, yeah,
try coming near me.

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:55.360 align:middle line:90%
I'll knock your socks off.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, tell me you're going
to do something for me?

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:57.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, right.

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.080 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.801 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'll ask
people to consider,

00:28:00.801 --> 00:28:02.800 align:middle line:84%
which is what I'm asking
you, is that while this

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:06.840 align:middle line:84%
looks like a circle, another
way of describing a circle

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.450 align:middle line:90%
is a ring, right?

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:10.800 align:middle line:90%
Like a ring.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.930 align:middle line:84%
But another way of describing
a ring is a vibration.

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Like when the phone
rings, it vibrates.

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:19.020 align:middle line:90%
That's how we know it's ringing.

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:21.650 align:middle line:84%
So what I'll say is
what we've got to do

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:23.630 align:middle line:84%
is put ourselves
in the vibration,

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:26.750 align:middle line:84%
the frequency, of what
it is that we do want.

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And the way we do that
is very simply back

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:34.370 align:middle line:84%
to metaphysical square one--
affirmations, taking those two

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:37.040 align:middle line:84%
power words "I am"
and taking it off

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:40.400 align:middle line:84%
of "I'm isolated,
I'm unconnected,

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:44.710 align:middle line:84%
and putting it in front of what
we do want, "I'm activated."

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And what we've got
to do is make sure

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.335 align:middle line:84%
that our energy and
emotion is going only

00:28:49.335 --> 00:28:51.680 align:middle line:90%
on what is inside that circle.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.559 align:middle line:84%
If it's not inside
that circle or ring,

00:28:54.559 --> 00:28:56.100 align:middle line:84%
we don't want anything
to do with it.

00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:00.270 align:middle line:84%
We no longer want to sacrifice
our energy and emotion

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:01.620 align:middle line:90%
for that.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is it starts
to open that gateway for us.

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:10.820 align:middle line:10%
I use my cat Boo as
an example of this.

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:13.560 align:middle line:10%
Boo and I like to play
with the light pen.

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.560 align:middle line:10%
You put it on the ground,
and the cats go crazy.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.220 align:middle line:10%
And Boo loves to
chase the light.

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.560 align:middle line:84%
The other cats don't want
anything to do with it.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.654 align:middle line:84%
Boo also likes catnip, so
there might be a connection.

00:29:22.654 --> 00:29:25.460 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:28.980 align:middle line:84%
But when Boo is focused
on that red beam of light

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:32.870 align:middle line:84%
on that carpet there,
that's the perfect moment.

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:35.200 align:middle line:84%
As far as Boo is concerned,
there is no past,

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.330 align:middle line:84%
there's no future,
there's no questions.

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:40.290 align:middle line:90%
He's going to get that light.

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:43.160 align:middle line:90%
I know he's not, OK?

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.780 align:middle line:84%
But hey, there's probably a
deity out there going, now,

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:47.490 align:middle line:84%
I know William Henry
thinks he's going

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:51.590 align:middle line:84%
to get that wormhole open,
but I know he's just like Boo.

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:52.440 align:middle line:90%
But that's OK.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.835 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:53.835 --> 00:29:56.640 align:middle line:84%
Because it's really all
about the journey, right?

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.830 align:middle line:90%
The journey is the reward.

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:03.390 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the perfect moment, no
past, no future, no questions,

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:06.000 align:middle line:84%
I borrowed that
from Joe Montana.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.410 align:middle line:90%
You all know who Joe Montana is?

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:09.870 align:middle line:84%
He's the Hall of
Fame quarterback

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:12.200 align:middle line:90%
for the San Francisco 49ers.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And I heard him
interviewed one time,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.680 align:middle line:84%
and the guy asked him, Joe,
you're like unbelievable

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.380 align:middle line:90%
when you're on the field.

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:24.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people said you're
almost like supernatural.

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:26.090 align:middle line:90%
How did you do it?

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:28.220 align:middle line:90%
Could you slow time down?

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:31.300 align:middle line:84%
How were you able to
perform those feats of magic

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.100 align:middle line:90%
on the field?

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And Joe said, hey, when I was
standing there with my guys,

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.900 align:middle line:84%
we're talking, looking
at the goal line,

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:44.380 align:middle line:84%
I had it in my head there was
no past, no future, no question

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.730 align:middle line:84%
that I was going to
score that touchdown.

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, my
body knew how to do it.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.820 align:middle line:90%
I had that emotion in me.

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.560 align:middle line:84%
I just had to get out
of the way of my body

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:58.390 align:middle line:84%
and let the body do
what it knew how to do.

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:00.397 align:middle line:84%
Well, I told this
story to Greg Braden

00:31:00.397 --> 00:31:02.980 align:middle line:84%
once in a Dreamland interview,
and he's like, wow, Joe Montana

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.220 align:middle line:90%
is a quantum physicist?

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:09.050 align:middle line:84%
It's like, yeah, that's exactly
what Joe Montana is describing,

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:11.700 align:middle line:84%
is putting ourself in
this emotional state.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:14.370 align:middle line:84%
There's no past,
there's no future,

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:17.760 align:middle line:84%
there's no question that
I'm going to get that light,

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.587 align:middle line:84%
and I've just got to get my body
to do what I know it can do.

00:31:21.587 --> 00:31:24.170 align:middle line:84%
The fact of the matter is, Boo
catches it almost every time we

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:25.840 align:middle line:90%
play.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.800 align:middle line:84%
He just doesn't tell me,
but I watch him do that.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.960 align:middle line:10%
So the bottom line
here is we've got

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.460 align:middle line:10%
to focus on what we do want,
not what you don't want.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:38.040 align:middle line:84%
I've been saying this for,
I don't know-- Sarah Beth

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.650 align:middle line:84%
and I have been reading
together for eight years.

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:42.245 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only
thing I can tell

00:31:42.245 --> 00:31:44.620 align:middle line:84%
you-- focus on what you do
want, not what you don't want.

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, recently
there's a DVD that's

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.050 align:middle line:90%
come out called "The Secret."

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm watching this, and
it's a high production DVD.

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:53.584 align:middle line:90%
What's the message of the DVD?

00:31:53.584 --> 00:31:55.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they got
Michael Beckwith,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.870 align:middle line:84%
they've got all these
other scientists.

00:31:56.870 --> 00:32:00.420 align:middle line:84%
Focus on what you do want,
not what you don't want.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:01.220 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.880 align:middle line:90%
That is the secret.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:08.380 align:middle line:84%
That is the secret
ring of Solomon, too.

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:10.515 align:middle line:84%
It's focusing on
what we do want.

00:32:10.515 --> 00:32:13.530 align:middle line:90%
Well, what do we want?

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, in "The Secret,"
oh, we want a new car.

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:17.700 align:middle line:90%
Oh, come on.

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:19.120 align:middle line:90%
That's so mundane.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.500 align:middle line:90%
And it's so first three chakras.

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:24.300 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe they even
went there with it, you know?

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:25.915 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:25.915 --> 00:32:32.400 align:middle line:10%
Because what we do want is
to be in the right place

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:35.640 align:middle line:10%
at the right time with the right
people, the right intentions

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:38.170 align:middle line:10%
and the right actions.

00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:39.642 align:middle line:84%
And if you think
about it, if we're

00:32:39.642 --> 00:32:42.100 align:middle line:84%
in the right place at the right
time with the right people,

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:45.320 align:middle line:84%
right intention, and right
action, what's our life like?

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.320 align:middle line:90%
Hey, pretty dang good, isn't it?

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:51.160 align:middle line:84%
We want to focus on the
field, know that we influence

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:51.960 align:middle line:90%
all of this.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.080 align:middle line:90%
This is a mirror out here.

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:56.730 align:middle line:84%
But this really is
what we do want.

00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Right personal choice,
right individual commitment,

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:03.720 align:middle line:84%
right personal responsibility,
right personal judgment-- these

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.940 align:middle line:84%
are the keynotes or
rungs of the ladder

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:11.220 align:middle line:84%
that the initiates of Mithras
used to teach 2,000 years ago.

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:15.450 align:middle line:84%
These enable the initiate
to scale the ladder.

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:17.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is how we begin to
put ourselves in attunement

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:19.220 align:middle line:90%
with these higher mysteries.

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:22.580 align:middle line:84%
It's about thinking
the right thoughts,

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:25.370 align:middle line:84%
being committed to ourselves
and to individuals,

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:28.130 align:middle line:84%
and being personally
responsible for ourselves.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:31.610 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like I'm being a moral
person here, and it really is.

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:34.560 align:middle line:84%
But I'm saying this is why
these teachings have lasted

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.380 align:middle line:90%
for several thousand years.

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:39.790 align:middle line:84%
They asked Buddha, hey, how
do you overcome suffering?

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Buddha gave them the Eightfold
Path-- right thought,

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:47.030 align:middle line:84%
right intention, right
action, so on and so forth.

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:51.040 align:middle line:84%
It's repeated over and over
again, because what it does

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:55.220 align:middle line:84%
is it puts us in that
higher, finer vibration.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is it
unites male and female.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.340 align:middle line:84%
On the left is an
Egyptian hieroglyph.

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:03.730 align:middle line:90%
The Tet power pillar is male.

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:05.514 align:middle line:90%
The key of life is female.

00:34:05.514 --> 00:34:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And when you put the
male and female together,

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:09.940 align:middle line:84%
they're united on the ring with
the dot in the center, which

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:13.920 align:middle line:84%
is the Egyptian hieroglyph
for enlightenment, which

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:17.429 align:middle line:84%
is why I use it in my readings,
because that symbolizes

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:22.800 align:middle line:84%
the light for us,
what we do want.

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.610 align:middle line:84%
When we focus on
what we do want,

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:27.989 align:middle line:84%
we emit a field
around our bodies

00:34:27.989 --> 00:34:31.120 align:middle line:84%
that begins to set up that
force of attraction that puts us

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:33.150 align:middle line:84%
always in the right
place at the right time

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:35.370 align:middle line:84%
with the right people
and the right action.

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is where all this
business about effort and time

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.429 align:middle line:90%
begins to evaporate.

00:34:40.429 --> 00:34:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Because what I'm
feeling is that when

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:45.449 align:middle line:84%
we see them standing
in this rainbow ring,

00:34:45.449 --> 00:34:49.659 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the open mouth
or the gate of a wormhole.

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And what we're trying to do in
terms of transforming ourselves

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:57.270 align:middle line:84%
is literally step through
those gates, access the field.

00:34:57.270 --> 00:35:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And so at the top, it looks
like an Indiana Jones moment.

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Remember in "Indiana
Jones the Last Crusade?"

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:05.800 align:middle line:84%
Indy comes to this
place right here where

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.910 align:middle line:84%
he's on one side
of the precipice,

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:11.450 align:middle line:84%
the Holy Grail is hidden in
the cave on the other side.

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And Indy he realizes
he can't use his whip,

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:18.360 align:middle line:84%
he can't use his gun, he
can't beat somebody up

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:21.090 align:middle line:84%
or steal something,
all the usual ways

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:23.940 align:middle line:84%
he used to get what he
wanted in those movies.

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Steven Spielberg was
brilliant in portraying

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:30.880 align:middle line:84%
this moment of transformation
or ascension for Indiana Jones.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Because Indy realized
the only way for him

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.000 align:middle line:84%
to get across that
precipice in that movie

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.700 align:middle line:84%
was to take a single
step of faith.

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:41.250 align:middle line:84%
He had to focus on
what he did want.

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:44.850 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want his father to
die, played by Sean Connery,

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:46.700 align:middle line:90%
had been shot by the Nazis.

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And Indiana knew if
he got the Holy Grail,

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:50.620 align:middle line:90%
he could save his father's life.

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:53.420 align:middle line:84%
So he didn't want
his father to die.

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:57.200 align:middle line:84%
He had to focus on what he
did want-- get the Grail,

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.950 align:middle line:90%
save his father's life.

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:01.840 align:middle line:84%
He was literally in a
life-and-death situation.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you and I
find ourselves alone,

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.460 align:middle line:84%
isolated, stuck,
or whatever it is,

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:08.630 align:middle line:84%
we're not technically in
a life-and-death situation

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:12.180 align:middle line:84%
like Indiana Jones was,
but really, we are.

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Because if we stay stuck,
alone, and isolated,

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:18.660 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be a
form of a death for us.

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.390 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to become
like Indiana Jones,

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:25.790 align:middle line:84%
focus on what we do want,
unite our heart with our head,

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:27.700 align:middle line:90%
then take the first step.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm convinced that
what Indiana took that step

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and there was the
solid-but-invisible bridge

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:35.760 align:middle line:84%
linking the two sides, as
portrayed in the movie,

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:38.020 align:middle line:84%
that's just as good
as opening a wormhole.

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:41.370 align:middle line:10%
He opened a gateway
and stepped through it

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:46.430 align:middle line:10%
across to the other side and
saved his father's life-- saved

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:48.260 align:middle line:10%
his father's life.

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:52.290 align:middle line:84%
At that point, Indiana
Jones was no longer

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:53.440 align:middle line:90%
a rogue archaeologist.

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.340 align:middle line:90%
He was a master.

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:57.090 align:middle line:90%
He was a master.

00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:59.300 align:middle line:84%
He had mastered the law
"as above, so below."

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is the secret
of raising ourselves

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:04.210 align:middle line:90%
from the dead.

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:06.420 align:middle line:90%
We are all dead on this realm.

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:07.865 align:middle line:90%
This is the realm of the dead.

00:37:07.865 --> 00:37:09.781 align:middle line:84%
In case no one's mentioned
that to you before,

00:37:09.781 --> 00:37:11.190 align:middle line:84%
I thought you
might like to know.

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:13.950 align:middle line:90%
This is the realm of the dead.

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:16.240 align:middle line:84%
We're entering the
realm of the living,

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.270 align:middle line:84%
of greater life by
absorbing these teachers.

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is the primary
secret of raising ourselves.

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:25.530 align:middle line:84%
As long as we remain unplugged
into that which we do want,

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:29.530 align:middle line:84%
that which is above, we
master that which is below.

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:31.760 align:middle line:84%
How do we overcome
fear and death?

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:36.780 align:middle line:84%
By focusing on what we do
want, that which is above.

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And the tower is
a representation

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:42.190 align:middle line:84%
that we all can begin to utilize
by which we can ascend up

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:45.190 align:middle line:84%
in graduated stages of
consciousness to the divine

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:47.510 align:middle line:84%
and work in harmony with
divine consciousness

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:51.260 align:middle line:84%
to bring down the glory of the
divine radiance into our bodies

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:53.100 align:middle line:84%
so that it's
irradiated from above,

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:58.680 align:middle line:84%
so becoming a citadel of
light in this lower realm.

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Where we're all at is in
the middle point there.

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:04.860 align:middle line:84%
We are at the very
apex, or close to it,

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:10.130 align:middle line:84%
of human evolution, which means
what our role, our business,

00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:13.600 align:middle line:84%
is about is transforming
ourselves into conduits

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:16.840 align:middle line:84%
to bring a higher vibrational
energy into this realm

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.020 align:middle line:84%
so that then we can
begin to take it out

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:22.350 align:middle line:84%
of the realm of fear and
terror and make this place

00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:24.990 align:middle line:90%
a realm of love.

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:26.475 align:middle line:90%
