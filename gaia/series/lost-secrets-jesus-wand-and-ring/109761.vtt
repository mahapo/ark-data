[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.390 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>Meru was also the root of
the place name Sumer-- Sumer--

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.510 align:middle line:90%
ancient Iraq.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.690 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Iraq, we find a
place called the Tower of Babel.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.720 align:middle line:90%
What was the Tower of Babel?

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, humankind
gathered together

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.830 align:middle line:84%
to build this tower as a
gate or ladder to heaven.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.560 align:middle line:84%
But Yahweh said, hey, I
don't want company just yet.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.655 align:middle line:84%
So he smashed our tower
and separated humankind

00:00:37.655 --> 00:00:38.455 align:middle line:90%
by language.

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:41.330 align:middle line:90%


00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Meru is the model,
according to scholars,

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.270 align:middle line:90%
for the Tower of Babel.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.940 align:middle line:84%
So it would make sense that
the original tower of Babel,

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.880 align:middle line:84%
our beloved tower, was a
particle accelerator, a device

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.720 align:middle line:84%
that opens holes in space,
the ladder to heaven,

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.020 align:middle line:84%
which is very interesting
because the Sumerian term

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.410 align:middle line:90%
for gods is "dingir"-- dingir.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.410 align:middle line:84%
Sitchin offers up this glyph
right here, the Dingir Glyph,

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.290 align:middle line:84%
as the glyph for the
Annunaki gods, they who

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.430 align:middle line:90%
came to Earth from the heavens.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.610 align:middle line:84%
"Din" means righteous,
bright, or pure.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.920 align:middle line:84%
"Din" means righteous,
bright, or pure.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:28.100 align:middle line:10%
"Gir" has some very interesting
association attached to it.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.385 align:middle line:10%
First, it resembles a fish.

00:01:29.385 --> 00:01:32.100 align:middle line:90%


00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.440 align:middle line:84%
As Sitchin noticed-- and here's
the comparison with the fish.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.100 align:middle line:84%
You see, the rounded
Christian fish

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.200 align:middle line:84%
is actually similar to
the original Sumerian

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.120 align:middle line:90%
depiction of the fish.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.810 align:middle line:10%
It's more angular.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.270 align:middle line:10%
As Sitchin noticed,
the axis of the gir

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.000 align:middle line:10%
fits neatly into the
opening of the din.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And he believes that this is
a rocket ship of some kind.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.780 align:middle line:84%
The pure one of
the space vehicles

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.140 align:middle line:84%
is one of the
interpretations he gives.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.560 align:middle line:10%
But I see a
remarkable similarity

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.650 align:middle line:10%
in simplistic terms between the
dingir and the Meru diagram.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.800 align:middle line:10%
And I think the gods didn't
travel here in rocket ships.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.760 align:middle line:10%
I think they came here in
particle accelerators or warp

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.030 align:middle line:10%
craft through wormholes opened
by particle accelerators,

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.860 align:middle line:10%
and that what happened is they
left this technology for us.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Part of the gods wanted us
to have this technology,

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.430 align:middle line:90%
as the Sumerian stories relate.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.940 align:middle line:84%
The other half didn't
want us to have it.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.050 align:middle line:84%
One half seeks to up-level
us to the level of the gods

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.590 align:middle line:84%
and even to exceed the
capability of the gods.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.470 align:middle line:84%
The other half seeks to keep us
at the level of slaves and sex

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.270 align:middle line:90%
objects.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.194 align:middle line:90%


00:02:42.194 --> 00:02:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And so here we see
it in the comparison.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.220 align:middle line:10%
The Shambhala point apex
corresponds with the gir

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.920 align:middle line:10%
of the Dingir Glyph.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.790 align:middle line:84%
For a number of years, I worked
with a two-dimensional image

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.020 align:middle line:90%
of the Meru diagram.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.620 align:middle line:10%
And then I hired an artist
named Jack Andrews to make

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.179 align:middle line:10%
a 3D version of it for me.

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:03.470 align:middle line:10%
I didn't tell Jack what it was.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.460 align:middle line:10%
I just said, Jack,
you're great 3D artist.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.820 align:middle line:10%
You got kind of a
Central Asian feel.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Just take this 2D
diagram, run it

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.910 align:middle line:84%
through your 3D
computer program,

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.550 align:middle line:90%
and spit something out for me.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.272 align:middle line:90%
And so he did.

00:03:16.272 --> 00:03:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And not knowing
what it is, this is

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.640 align:middle line:84%
what he came up with as the base
of this second-century Chinese

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.440 align:middle line:90%
manuscript.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.340 align:middle line:84%
It looks like it's opening
some kind of a vortex,

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.610 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
myth says it was.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.690 align:middle line:84%
The apex of it looks like
some kind of a warp craft

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.715 align:middle line:84%
or something, because that's
what I believe it was.

00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:36.840 align:middle line:84%
I think the way to enter
the realm of the immortals

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.440 align:middle line:90%
is to enter their craft.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And by craft, I mean to
understand their teaching,

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.080 align:middle line:84%
the transformation that renders
you into a Christ-like being.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Did I mention what happened
with Roerich when he went

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.180 align:middle line:90%
to Shambhala on behalf of FDR?

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.875 align:middle line:90%


00:03:53.875 --> 00:03:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Roerich enters Shambhala,
and he comes back out,

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.940 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly the locals
adore him as a deity.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.390 align:middle line:10%
Because only an immortal being
can enter Shambhala and come

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.410 align:middle line:10%
back out, and Roerich did that.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.610 align:middle line:10%
Suddenly FDR and Wallace have
a major scandal on their hands.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.816 align:middle line:84%
They've sent a Russian mystic
to Mongolia in search of Jesus,

00:04:15.816 --> 00:04:18.070 align:middle line:84%
and the guy entered the
realm of the immortals

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.959 align:middle line:84%
and came back out and now has
proclaimed himself the Messiah.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:22.990 align:middle line:90%
Oops.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.010 align:middle line:84%
We got a big problem
on our hands.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.750 align:middle line:90%
So what does FDR and Wallace do?

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, first they terminate
the relationship by cable.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Then they sic the
Treasury Department

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.430 align:middle line:90%
on Roerich's finances?

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.650 align:middle line:90%
What do you know?

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.780 align:middle line:84%
He owes over a quarter
million dollars in back taxes.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And they saber rattle
at him and say,

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.634 align:middle line:84%
if you come back to
the United States,

00:04:41.634 --> 00:04:43.550 align:middle line:84%
we're going to cuff you
and throw you in jail.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.510 align:middle line:84%
You'll never see
the light of day.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Roerich never came back
to the United States,

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.600 align:middle line:84%
never told his story about
what he did in Mongolia.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.326 align:middle line:84%
Not even his followers
today know the full story.

00:04:54.326 --> 00:04:56.200 align:middle line:84%
We're only now beginning
to piece it together

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.630 align:middle line:84%
based on the research
that I'm doing

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.600 align:middle line:84%
and also the revelation of
the Russian files, which

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.140 align:middle line:84%
is a stack about that big of
Russian surveillance of Roerich

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.410 align:middle line:90%
and also MI-6.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.360 align:middle line:84%
The British intelligence were
also watching this expedition.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.660 align:middle line:84%
They've just now started
releasing their files on him,

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.460 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to be
very interesting to see

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.960 align:middle line:84%
what actually comes
out of that research.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.190 align:middle line:84%
So here's a comparison of NASA's
image of a warp craft with what

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.760 align:middle line:84%
came out of this second-century
Chinese manuscript-- very

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.790 align:middle line:90%
interesting.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.940 align:middle line:84%
So I went hog wild and
said, well, Jack, I really

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.210 align:middle line:84%
loved what you did
with the Meru diagram.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.620 align:middle line:84%
What can you do with the
Bicentennial Mall diagram?

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.500 align:middle line:90%
Feed it into the computer.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is what came out,
the image here on the right.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.812 align:middle line:84%
The base of it
rendered Darth Vader,

00:05:44.812 --> 00:05:48.470 align:middle line:84%
or a Darth-Vader-like-looking
helmet.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.110 align:middle line:84%
We come up the
tube of light here,

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.090 align:middle line:84%
and we come up to the
Court of Three Stars.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at that, and I was
just shocked, because I said,

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Jack, it looks like
there's a meditating Buddha

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.520 align:middle line:84%
right there where the
Court of Three Stars is.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.104 align:middle line:90%
He's like, wow, you're right.

00:06:04.104 --> 00:06:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know,
I've been working

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.535 align:middle line:84%
with these 3D
programs for a while,

00:06:07.535 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:84%
and it's like they have
a mind of their own.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.010 align:middle line:84%
You never know what
they're going to spit out.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And so here's sort of the
3D computer mind's allegory

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.710 align:middle line:84%
of what the Bicentennial
Mall might actually

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.940 align:middle line:84%
encode at some level, a
meditating kind of figure

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.410 align:middle line:84%
right here in this area that
looks like Superman's fortress

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.210 align:middle line:90%
of solitude or something.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.560 align:middle line:84%
So I asked him to go back
and actually recreate

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.260 align:middle line:84%
a version of it where
we have a meditating

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.860 align:middle line:84%
Buddha underneath the
Court of the Three Stars

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.310 align:middle line:84%
as just kind of a
fun little exercise.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:45.620 align:middle line:84%
But this is what came out of
this Bicentennial Mall diagram.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And here are the two
of them together.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.760 align:middle line:84%
What I want to do
now is I want to talk

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.970 align:middle line:84%
about the rod and the ring
united in the Spear of Destiny.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.160 align:middle line:84%
The Sphere of Destiny,
as many of us know,

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.970 align:middle line:84%
is part of Christian
lore, Christian legend.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:07.090 align:middle line:84%
The story is that when
Jesus' body is on the cross,

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:11.760 align:middle line:84%
this Roman centurion named
Longinus takes his spear,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.410 align:middle line:84%
sticks Jesus in the
side, and out spurts

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.260 align:middle line:90%
the transformed blood and water.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.660 align:middle line:84%
This spear disappears
into legend.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And in the legend, whoever
recovers the spear of destiny

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.510 align:middle line:90%
controls the world.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.160 align:middle line:84%
This is why, according
to some researchers,

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Adolf Hitler desperately
sought the spear of destiny.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.400 align:middle line:84%
So that's sort of
the pretext for this.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And what we have
to do to understand

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.750 align:middle line:84%
the spirit of destiny
is talk about what's

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.480 align:middle line:84%
called the Temple of
Sexual Instruction,

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.990 align:middle line:84%
according to Masonic Lore, the
Temple of Sexual Instruction.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.909 align:middle line:90%
And here it is right here.

00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:48.950 align:middle line:84%
This is labeled the Temple
of Sexual Instruction.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.850 align:middle line:84%
What we have is a
rectangular stand.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.790 align:middle line:10%
We have a phallic
or vertical column

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:58.450 align:middle line:10%
that looks sort of like a
ladder with a ring up on top.

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:00.440 align:middle line:10%
And what this
represents to Masons

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:07.650 align:middle line:10%
is the rod and ring, the
Temple of Sexual Instruction--

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:11.500 align:middle line:10%
very simple, the unity
of male and female.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.540 align:middle line:10%
And beside it is the simple line
drawing of the same concept.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.820 align:middle line:10%
Again, the Temple of
Sexual Instruction-- we

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.780 align:middle line:10%
see on the sides here
at the very bottom

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:27.000 align:middle line:10%
of the rectangle now these
circular areas or curved areas.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.150 align:middle line:90%
Those are male testicles.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And then this would
be the penis entering

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:36.470 align:middle line:84%
the vagina, the rod and the
ring-- the Temple of Sexual

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:37.820 align:middle line:90%
Instruction.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:42.210 align:middle line:84%
The unity of male and
female is representing

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.810 align:middle line:90%
the ultimate creative secrets.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.480 align:middle line:90%
How were our bodies formed?

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.020 align:middle line:90%
The unity of male and female.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, here are rods
entering a ring.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Actually, what we're looking
at is sperm entering an egg.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.550 align:middle line:84%
What level of
magnification would you

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.610 align:middle line:90%
like to look at this at?

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.260 align:middle line:90%
At the human body level?

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.660 align:middle line:90%
At the level of sperm?

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.280 align:middle line:90%
At the level of our body?

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Sperm have a head, a
middle section, and a tail.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.580 align:middle line:84%
So does our brain and
spinal cord system.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:20.140 align:middle line:84%
It has a head, a middle
section, and a tail.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.710 align:middle line:84%
We still have
remnants of our tails

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.390 align:middle line:84%
originally at the base of
our spinal cord system.

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And so here in the Temple of
Sexual Instruction, the head,

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.170 align:middle line:84%
the middle section,
and the tail--

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:34.340 align:middle line:84%
those are the basic
components that Masons believe

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.690 align:middle line:90%
encode the secrets of creation.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.840 align:middle line:84%
The problem with this
is that these secrets

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.990 align:middle line:90%
can be weaponized.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:43.110 align:middle line:84%
They can be used for
peaceful purposes

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:47.197 align:middle line:84%
or to create weapons systems
if you know what you're doing.

00:09:47.197 --> 00:09:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And what I want you
to appreciate here

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.320 align:middle line:84%
is the way this
works at the mall.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.210 align:middle line:84%
It has head, a middle
section, and the tail

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:58.710 align:middle line:90%
down here, exactly like a sperm.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:00.430 align:middle line:90%
Here is sperm entering an egg.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Here is a warp craft
entering a wormhole.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.200 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, again, at what
level of dimension

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.310 align:middle line:84%
would you like to
discuss these mysteries?

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:17.460 align:middle line:84%
At the level of sperm and egg
or at the macro level of warp

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.980 align:middle line:90%
craft entering a wormhole?

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Symbolically, that is a
penis entering a vagina,

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:25.590 align:middle line:90%
a sperm entering an egg.

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:30.740 align:middle line:84%
It's all the same symbolism,
the rod and the ring--

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.220 align:middle line:90%
the rod and the ring.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:37.020 align:middle line:84%
That's why they call this the
Temple of Sexual Instruction.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.290 align:middle line:90%
It's not perverted.

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:40.288 align:middle line:90%
It's just basic understanding.

00:10:40.288 --> 00:10:44.300 align:middle line:90%


00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And here we come back
to the hieroglyph

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.890 align:middle line:84%
we looked at earlier, the
Egyptian hieroglyph for light--

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:54.270 align:middle line:84%
a sperm entering an egg, a
warp craft entering a wormhole,

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:58.150 align:middle line:84%
a penis entering a
vagina, all symbolically

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:03.150 align:middle line:84%
represented by the
exact same icon.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And so here now
we have a diagram

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.060 align:middle line:90%
that is most interesting to us.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:12.380 align:middle line:84%
What we have is a
rod entering a ring.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Can you see the concentric
rings extending outward here?

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:19.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is exactly what we
looked at just a moment ago.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:24.140 align:middle line:84%
This could be illustrative
of a sperm entering an egg.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:30.610 align:middle line:84%
What we're looking at here I
think is just astounding to me.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:35.310 align:middle line:84%
What this is a diagram is
of Heinrich Himmler's Spear

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:37.480 align:middle line:90%
of Destiny.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Adolf Hitler and
Heinrich Himmler

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:43.760 align:middle line:84%
were masters of
ancient occult lore.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And Heinrich Himmler personally
supervised the design

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.330 align:middle line:90%
of his Spear of Destiny.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:54.720 align:middle line:84%
Heinrich Himmler well knew that
the Spear of Destiny legend

00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:00.280 align:middle line:84%
had absolutely nothing to do
with a Roman centurion name

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Longinus and a
stupid Roman spear.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.420 align:middle line:90%
Give me a break.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:10.840 align:middle line:84%
He absolutely knew that the
legend of the Spear of Destiny

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.685 align:middle line:84%
that poked Jesus in the side
or who controlled the spear

00:12:13.685 --> 00:12:15.560 align:middle line:84%
controlled the destiny
of the world-- he knew

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:19.340 align:middle line:84%
about the legend, but he
knew that this spear that's

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.340 align:middle line:84%
in the Hapsburg museum
in Austria today

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:26.450 align:middle line:84%
is not that spear,
plain and simple.

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:27.560 align:middle line:90%
You know why they do this?

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.790 align:middle line:84%
Because they want the
"sheeple" to believe

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:33.640 align:middle line:84%
in fairy tales and cups
and other crap like that.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.510 align:middle line:84%
It keeps them
busy, it keeps them

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:39.890 align:middle line:84%
distracted so that they can do
the real esoteric and occult

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:41.330 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the crucifixion
probably took place.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there was a Spear
of Destiny there.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's connected
with the rod that Moses

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.560 align:middle line:84%
struck the water with and out
spurted the water of life.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.210 align:middle line:84%
But no, it has
nothing whatsoever

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:59.430 align:middle line:84%
to do with a first-century
Roman centurion spear-- period.

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:03.870 align:middle line:84%
What it has to do with
is ancient, esoteric,

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:07.640 align:middle line:84%
highly occult knowledge
about the unity

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.440 align:middle line:90%
of the rod and the ring.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.680 align:middle line:84%
We're talking particle
accelerators here.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.890 align:middle line:84%
We're talking ancient
technology that

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:20.020 align:middle line:84%
can create a realm of peace or
the most disastrous weapons you

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.570 align:middle line:90%
can imagine.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Heinrich Himmler
and Adolf Hitler

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:27.740 align:middle line:84%
sit down with their weapons
desires, the exotic guys,

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:32.410 align:middle line:84%
and say, we're starting the Nazi
Reich, the Thousand-Year Reich.

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:33.970 align:middle line:90%
We need some weapons.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:37.710 align:middle line:84%
We want you to go 50
years in the future

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:41.050 align:middle line:84%
and think about the most
devastating weapons you

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:43.020 align:middle line:90%
can come up with.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And then go another
50 years in the future

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.990 align:middle line:84%
and come up with the most
devastating weapons you can

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:51.770 align:middle line:90%
and build those.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:54.020 align:middle line:90%
That was their assignment.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.140 align:middle line:84%
That's what Heinrich
Himmler is operating on,

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.280 align:middle line:90%
that kind of mentality.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.000 align:middle line:90%
Where did they get these ideas?

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Third Reich
was all about recovering

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:06.590 align:middle line:90%
ancient Atlantean technology.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:08.180 align:middle line:90%
That's what it was about.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.920 align:middle line:84%
They had 12,000,
15,000 occult volumes.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.690 align:middle line:90%
That's what this place was here.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.120 align:middle line:84%
Do you realize that
the spear tip we're

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.100 align:middle line:84%
looking at here, which Himmler
called the Spear of Destiny,

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:21.920 align:middle line:84%
what he had intended to do
if he had been successful

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.960 align:middle line:84%
was to take this ancient
Germanic castle at Wewelsburg

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.360 align:middle line:84%
and this was going to
be the tip of the spear.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.850 align:middle line:90%
You see this triangle up here?

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:31.800 align:middle line:90%
That's this building right here.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.420 align:middle line:84%
He had 20,000 occult volumes
from the ancient world

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:38.170 align:middle line:84%
that were to fill this
library right here.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.870 align:middle line:84%
This was the
headquarters of the SS,

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:44.350 align:middle line:84%
an order called the
Order of the Black Sun,

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:49.820 align:middle line:84%
a name they derived from ancient
legends of a place called Meru.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:53.540 align:middle line:84%
The black sun was
the beacon of Meru,

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.090 align:middle line:84%
and Himmler chose the
Order of the Black Sun

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:58.480 align:middle line:84%
as the name of his
esoteric occult order,

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.910 align:middle line:84%
because he knew
the black sun was

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:06.220 align:middle line:84%
the light behind the sun,
the very power of God.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.810 align:middle line:84%
They went all the way back,
deeply researched this stuff.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:11.990 align:middle line:90%
They got it right.

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:14.810 align:middle line:84%
They used it for
the wrong reasons,

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.070 align:middle line:84%
but I believe their
research was right on.

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:19.760 align:middle line:84%
He knew exactly what
this technology was

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.400 align:middle line:90%
and what it was capable of.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.110 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about a
weapon of mass destruction

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:26.470 align:middle line:84%
that Saddam Hussein
would be foaming

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:30.160 align:middle line:84%
at the mouth over and probably
came from the same place

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.620 align:middle line:84%
that Saddam was hitting the
books, too, if truth be told.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.574 align:middle line:84%
So here's the Wewelsburg
Castle in Germany,

00:15:35.574 --> 00:15:36.990 align:middle line:84%
still stands today,
that was going

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.820 align:middle line:84%
to be the tip of the
Spear of Destiny.

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Here is the Black
Sun logo that was

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:46.390 align:middle line:84%
laid in the central
hall of this place.

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:50.830 align:middle line:84%
What it is is a
model of our galaxy.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.210 align:middle line:84%
This is the central
core of our galaxy.

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:55.780 align:middle line:84%
These are the arms
of the galaxy.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.600 align:middle line:84%
These guys had a Milky
Way based perspective.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.550 align:middle line:84%
They were not seeing
the Nazi regime

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:05.120 align:middle line:84%
as existing for 1,000
years on this planet.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.480 align:middle line:84%
They were ready to
colonize other planets.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.970 align:middle line:90%
That was their goal.

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:12.400 align:middle line:84%
They believed in something
called the Vril Force, the Vril

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Force or Vril Energy,
which was believed

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:20.080 align:middle line:84%
to be derived from the black
sun, the sun behind the sun,

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.350 align:middle line:84%
possibly even the
black hole or black sun

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:24.920 align:middle line:90%
at the center of our galaxy.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.750 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'd say
most likely that.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:31.330 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about a
civilization, a technology,

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.240 align:middle line:84%
if theoretical
physics are right,

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:37.450 align:middle line:84%
at least 200 years in advance
of where we're at right now.

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:40.440 align:middle line:84%
That's how far in advance
they were thinking.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.430 align:middle line:84%
But their thinking
wasn't forward thinking.

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.510 align:middle line:90%
It was reverse thinking.

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Because they were
getting all their stuff

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:50.740 align:middle line:84%
from Tibet and from
other repositories

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.870 align:middle line:84%
throughout the world that
preserved the ancient knowledge

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.990 align:middle line:90%
they traced back to Atlantis.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:59.330 align:middle line:84%
This black sun was
also thought to exist

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.490 align:middle line:84%
in the center of the
Earth, the energy of it,

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:03.280 align:middle line:84%
anyway, giving
light to the Vril-ya

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.079 align:middle line:84%
and putting out radiation in
the form of this energy called

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:07.040 align:middle line:90%
Vril.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.930 align:middle line:84%
The Vril Society was
a literary society

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:13.079 align:middle line:84%
in Nazi Germany that
believed that Aryans

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:16.630 align:middle line:84%
were the actual biological
ancestors of the black sun.

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, Jose Arguelles
is a Mayan scholar

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:24.250 align:middle line:84%
who has deeply researched Maya
prophecy and Maya codices.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And he came up with this idea
that the Maya wizard kings were

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.980 align:middle line:90%
interdimensional travelers.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.790 align:middle line:84%
They utilized the
power of black holes

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.930 align:middle line:90%
to travel between dimensions.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.090 align:middle line:84%
That's what the Nazis
were talking about back

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:41.350 align:middle line:84%
in the '30s as well, was
utilizing this Spear of Destiny

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:46.300 align:middle line:84%
as a particle accelerator
to open holes in spacetime.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Meantime, they'd wipe
out the rest of us.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.300 align:middle line:84%
The Department of
Homeland Security

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.680 align:middle line:84%
right now has a new technology
called active denial.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:59.650 align:middle line:84%
If you Google "Raytheon
active denial,"

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:04.000 align:middle line:84%
you're going to learn about an
electromagnetic pulse beam that

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.360 align:middle line:84%
is designed for use
by Homeland Security

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.900 align:middle line:90%
on the American people.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:08.850 align:middle line:90%
What's it for?

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:10.260 align:middle line:90%
Crowd control.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.350 align:middle line:90%
What does it do?

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:16.590 align:middle line:84%
It zaps you with a pulse
that goes 1/64 of an inch

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:19.610 align:middle line:84%
beneath your skin and
begins to fry you.

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:21.960 align:middle line:84%
The longest anybody's
been able to sustain

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.200 align:middle line:90%
the pain is two seconds.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Why is Homeland
Security developing

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:28.580 align:middle line:84%
this for use against
the American people?

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Who are the mobs they're
seeking to control?

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.710 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying here is that
this is what our Homeland

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:34.700 align:middle line:90%
Security is using now.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.390 align:middle line:84%
What Homeland Security
was using in Nazi Germany,

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:40.300 align:middle line:84%
they were developing
similar technology, but even

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.164 align:middle line:90%
beyond that.

00:18:41.164 --> 00:18:42.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're talking
about pulse beam

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:47.780 align:middle line:84%
weapons that could just fry a
whole civilization en masse.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.180 align:middle line:84%
They were probably
5 to 10 years away

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.060 align:middle line:90%
from actually utilizing this.

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.810 align:middle line:84%
There's books that are out
now that have recovered

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:56.340 align:middle line:90%
this Nazi weapons technology.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:59.000 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it was all
brought over here in the US.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.940 align:middle line:84%
It was divided
between us and Russia.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:06.080 align:middle line:84%
But as I was saying, the black
sun is the beacon of Meru.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.320 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
identifiers of Meru.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And again, utilize
this technology

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:14.400 align:middle line:84%
to create a gateway, a bond
between heaven and earth,

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.290 align:middle line:84%
or utilize it to create
weapons of mass destruction.

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:18.270 align:middle line:90%
Take your pick.

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:19.945 align:middle line:84%
FDR, Hitler, and
Himmler, they would

00:19:19.945 --> 00:19:23.550 align:middle line:84%
have liked to use it to create
weapons of mass destruction.

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.560 align:middle line:10%
So here's a comparison
then between the tip

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.640 align:middle line:10%
of the spirit of
destiny of Himmler

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.320 align:middle line:10%
and the tip of the Meru diagram.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.849 align:middle line:10%
I think they're
strikingly similar.

00:19:32.849 --> 00:19:34.890 align:middle line:10%
I think they're close
enough that we can say, OK,

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:38.610 align:middle line:10%
there appears to be a match
here between these diagrams.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:39.950 align:middle line:90%
Here's the Spear of Destiny.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Does anybody recognize this
layout right here, this place?

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.920 align:middle line:90%


00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.970 align:middle line:90%
That is Washington, DC.

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:49.850 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:51.860 align:middle line:84%
L'Enfant and the
other architects

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:54.370 align:middle line:84%
who designed and laid
out Washington, DC,

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:57.870 align:middle line:84%
apparently also understood
these principles

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:01.370 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient Spear of Destiny
and sought to lay one out.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:04.690 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they did lay one
out in Washington, DC.

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:08.480 align:middle line:84%
The tip of the spear
in DC is the US Capitol

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.450 align:middle line:84%
that points directly to
the United States Capitol.

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And when you do a Google
search on the Capitol,

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.590 align:middle line:90%
they think we're so stupid.

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.090 align:middle line:84%
They blurred out the
Capitol so we wouldn't

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:20.502 align:middle line:90%
recognize the building.

00:20:20.502 --> 00:20:21.980 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.840 align:middle line:84%
So terrorists couldn't,
therefore, also figure out

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.810 align:middle line:90%
where the Capitol is, too.

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:31.610 align:middle line:10%
But the point is that this
Spear of Destiny design

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:33.480 align:middle line:10%
is transmitted
throughout the ages.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.800 align:middle line:10%
And I believe that it
came from the gods.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.610 align:middle line:10%
It mimics the dingir,
the craft of the gods,

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:41.720 align:middle line:10%
a whirling ship, a
vortex-creating particle

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:46.570 align:middle line:10%
accelerator, and represents the
ultimate power on this planet,

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:50.230 align:middle line:10%
represents the ultimate misuse
of power on this planet.

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:53.260 align:middle line:84%
Because they who are presently
in power in this world

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:56.040 align:middle line:84%
don't want us to ascend
to the level of gods.

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.850 align:middle line:84%
They want us at the level
of slaves and sex objects.

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And so consequently, they're
utilizing this technology

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.420 align:middle line:90%
to hurt us.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Has anybody ever seen
this place before?

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:09.124 align:middle line:90%


00:21:09.124 --> 00:21:10.540 align:middle line:84%
You're spending
about a $1 billion

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:14.690 align:middle line:90%
a week trying to take it over.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:17.630 align:middle line:90%
This is downtown Baghdad.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:21.050 align:middle line:84%
This is Saddam Hussein's
ceremonial center.

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:25.380 align:middle line:84%
This is Saddam Hussein's
Spear of Destiny.

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.940 align:middle line:84%
This is Saddam
Hussein's clock tower.

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:32.770 align:middle line:90%
Rod and ring unified.

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Saddam Hussein knew what
the Spear of Destiny was.

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.750 align:middle line:84%
He knew that if you had
the Spear of Destiny,

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:41.780 align:middle line:84%
you controlled the
destiny of the world.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And so he had this mile-long
complex built to match Heinrich

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.640 align:middle line:90%
Himmler's.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.990 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they're
almost perfect matches.

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:52.700 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I talked
to the architect.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.130 align:middle line:90%
He lives in Cleveland, Ohio.

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:56.610 align:middle line:84%
My conversation
with this architect

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:58.651 align:middle line:84%
went a lot better than
the one here in Nashville.

00:21:58.651 --> 00:21:59.830 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:01.800 align:middle line:84%
He was happy to be
the hell out of Iraq

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.570 align:middle line:90%
and living in Cleveland.

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:06.750 align:middle line:90%
This is a library right here.

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:11.460 align:middle line:84%
This blue tower right here
is actually 180 feet tall.

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:15.430 align:middle line:84%
What Saddam had planned to
do was build a library there.

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:18.080 align:middle line:84%
What was Saddam going
to put in his library?

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.290 align:middle line:90%
"Playboy?"

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:20.556 align:middle line:90%
I understand he likes Cheetos.

00:22:20.556 --> 00:22:21.680 align:middle line:90%
Or he doesn't like Cheetos.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.064 align:middle line:84%
He like doesn't like
Froot Loops, either.

00:22:24.064 --> 00:22:24.980 align:middle line:90%
But he likes Tostitos.

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.000 align:middle line:84%
He eats them by the
bagful, according

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.180 align:middle line:90%
to people that guard him.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.540 align:middle line:84%
So he's going to fill
it full of Cheetos.

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:31.440 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm kidding.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.740 align:middle line:84%
What he was going to fill
this place full of was

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:39.030 align:middle line:84%
the thousands upon thousands of
ancient Sumerian cylinder seals

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:42.740 align:middle line:84%
that showed the technologies
of the gods, the Annunaki.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:45.540 align:middle line:84%
He was going to put thousands of
tablets from the ancient world

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:46.340 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:49.340 align:middle line:84%
The Saddam Hussein School
for Cuneiform Studies

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:51.750 align:middle line:84%
was going to be
based at this place.

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And what he sought
to do was to create

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.100 align:middle line:84%
a weapon of mass
destruction out of this.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.080 align:middle line:84%
The weapon of mass
destruction was

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.680 align:middle line:84%
knowledge about
the ancient world,

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.722 align:middle line:84%
knowledge that takes
Christianity and goes

00:23:06.722 --> 00:23:09.620 align:middle line:84%
whoosh and pulls out
the underpinnings

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:12.299 align:middle line:84%
from it, iron-clad proof
that scholars already

00:23:12.299 --> 00:23:14.340 align:middle line:84%
know that the Old Testament
and the New Testament

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.177 align:middle line:84%
are based on ancient
Iraqi stories.

00:23:17.177 --> 00:23:19.260 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing original
about anything in the New

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:20.310 align:middle line:90%
Testament or the Old.

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:22.330 align:middle line:90%
It all comes from ancient Iraq.

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:24.626 align:middle line:84%
And if you've got an
administration hell-bent

00:23:24.626 --> 00:23:26.000 align:middle line:84%
on reading the
Book of Revelation

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.052 align:middle line:84%
as a script, where the end time
is here and Jesus is returning

00:23:32.052 --> 00:23:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
make this happen

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:36.540 align:middle line:84%
and we're all going to be
raptured the hell out of here,

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.380 align:middle line:84%
you don't want some
maniac running around Iraq

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.770 align:middle line:84%
with knowledge that directly
contradicts that and, in fact,

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:45.290 align:middle line:84%
proves that we
came from the stars

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.870 align:middle line:84%
and that those gods
who came from the stars

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:52.190 align:middle line:84%
came in stargates and wormholes
and possessed unimaginably

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:54.110 align:middle line:90%
advanced technology.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:55.800 align:middle line:90%
So what do you do?

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.080 align:middle line:90%
You invade.

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.570 align:middle line:90%
What's the first thing you do?

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.630 align:middle line:84%
You go to the museum where
this stuff is housed,

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:06.090 align:middle line:84%
and you steal it from
humankind so that never again

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:08.960 align:middle line:84%
will such knowledge
see the light of day.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:12.020 align:middle line:84%
It probably won't--
not in our lifetime.

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:15.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm convinced that knowledge is
probably in Langley, Virginia,

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:16.720 align:middle line:90%
or God knows where.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.180 align:middle line:90%
I hope they didn't destroy it.

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:21.385 align:middle line:84%
It would not be beneath
them to destroy it.

00:24:21.385 --> 00:24:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Because what he was
assembling-- and I'm not saying

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Saddam Hussein is a
good guy in any way.

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:27.560 align:middle line:84%
But what he was
assembling for us

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.170 align:middle line:84%
was a Disneyland for
the ancient gods.

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:32.900 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to open
Iraq up to tourism.

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:34.800 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't trying
to run the world.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:38.990 align:middle line:84%
He wanted tourists to come to
Iraq like they come to Egypt.

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:41.130 align:middle line:84%
See my School of
Cuneiform Studies?

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:42.400 align:middle line:90%
Look at these cylinder seals.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.920 align:middle line:84%
Look at the great
gods of ancient Iraq.

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:49.300 align:middle line:84%
That stuff is gone--
gone, gone, gone.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:53.510 align:middle line:84%
But we do have a Spear of
Destiny at our disposal

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:55.640 align:middle line:90%
here in Nashville.

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:59.880 align:middle line:84%
I see a tremendous similarity
between these two facilities.

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:03.081 align:middle line:84%
They're both examples of
the rod and ring technology

00:25:03.081 --> 00:25:04.080 align:middle line:90%
we have been describing.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And they both can be called
temples of sexual instruction,

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:09.250 align:middle line:90%
the unity of male and female.

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:11.120 align:middle line:90%
This is a clock tower.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Saddam had planned
to have a drone that

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:19.930 align:middle line:84%
would control the Iraqi people,
a drone tone coming out of it.

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:21.650 align:middle line:84%
This is a clock tower
right here, too.

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Every hour on the hour, the
95 bells in those 50 towers

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:28.030 align:middle line:90%
plays "The Tennessee Waltz."

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:29.500 align:middle line:90%
They have the same purpose.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.090 align:middle line:90%
They have the exact same shape.

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Do they come from the
same ancient pedigree?

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.480 align:middle line:90%
I can't say that.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the architect
is saying no.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying yeah.

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:43.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I talked
with him, he didn't say,

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:46.410 align:middle line:84%
oh, look, William, let me
explain something to you.

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:50.130 align:middle line:84%
When you go to design a
garden, there's a specific way

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:52.320 align:middle line:84%
that you do it that's
been done over time,

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and you're very careful that
each of the seven human chakras

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:58.220 align:middle line:84%
are perfectly marked with
appropriate symbolism.

00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.500 align:middle line:90%
He didn't say any of that.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:03.170 align:middle line:84%
He just blew off and
dismissed my whole proposition

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:04.420 align:middle line:90%
altogether.

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm saying if this
similarity didn't happen

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:10.150 align:middle line:84%
by chance with this
architect, maybe it

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:12.600 align:middle line:90%
came out of the thought-sphere.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some form of consciousness
is operating in this town

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.980 align:middle line:84%
to make it more like ancient
Athens with the same temples

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.670 align:middle line:84%
and that his team was influenced
by this divine mind that said,

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:25.980 align:middle line:84%
hey, these rat bastards
have been setting up

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:29.140 align:middle line:84%
these Spears of Destiny
in different places

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:31.220 align:middle line:84%
around the planet,
and they're a bunch

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:34.050 align:middle line:90%
of bleepin' blinkety-blinks.

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And now what we want is a
Spear of Destiny laid out

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:41.200 align:middle line:84%
in a place that can be
used for peaceful purposes.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.650 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
spend $55 million

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:46.630 align:middle line:84%
and lay one of these
places out so that people

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:50.230 align:middle line:84%
can come and learn that we
are the Spear of Destiny,

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:53.250 align:middle line:84%
that it is our body that is
the ultimate weapon that they

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.010 align:middle line:90%
are so afraid of.

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:58.340 align:middle line:84%
They don't want you to know
the latent capabilities

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:00.620 align:middle line:90%
within our DNA.

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.770 align:middle line:84%
That scares the
hell out of them.

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:04.690 align:middle line:90%
So what they do is they impose.

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:08.440 align:middle line:84%
They feed us crap that
keeps us at a low vibration.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:12.870 align:middle line:84%
They sit us in front of TVs
that are even a lower vibration.

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And they feed us these
plastic people every night

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:19.030 align:middle line:84%
that try to tell us
what it's all about.

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:20.992 align:middle line:90%
And most of us go, uh-huh.

00:27:20.992 --> 00:27:24.260 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Because the moment we
start to wake up and begin

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:30.090 align:middle line:84%
to activate this
potential, hey, we're

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:32.270 align:middle line:84%
not going to put up
with their crap anymore.

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:33.370 align:middle line:90%
It's a whole new world.

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
happening right now.

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:39.500 align:middle line:10%
And we're the
front line of that.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.530 align:middle line:10%
As we look at the
Bicentennial Mall, as I said,

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:43.390 align:middle line:10%
we find that each
of the seven chakras

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:45.970 align:middle line:10%
are perfectly marked with
appropriate symbolism,

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:49.360 align:middle line:10%
beginning with the
root chakra here.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.370 align:middle line:84%
Children playing
in a fountain-- I

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:54.460 align:middle line:84%
can't think of a more
poignant representation

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:57.320 align:middle line:84%
of the first chakra
than baby souls

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.950 align:middle line:90%
bathing in the cosmic waters.

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:03.810 align:middle line:84%
This is the place where
we came from originally,

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:07.240 align:middle line:90%
the stars, the cosmic ocean.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And in my imagination-- and
I'm not stoned right now.

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:13.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
make this observation.

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:15.770 align:middle line:84%
These circles with the
energy spurting up from it,

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:19.410 align:middle line:84%
that's how astronomers
show galaxies,

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:23.150 align:middle line:84%
as disks with energy, starry
energy spurting out from them.

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:26.230 align:middle line:84%
So these could all be
galaxies, and these baby souls

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:29.057 align:middle line:84%
are playing in the waters
of the cosmic ocean.

00:28:29.057 --> 00:28:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Little do they know
that they're going

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:35.210 align:middle line:84%
to get sucked into Earth
life, maybe by choice.

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Maybe all of us
came here by choice.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:39.110 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we're here and we
don't really want to be here.

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:41.670 align:middle line:84%
But either way, now
we're into manifestation,

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:44.310 align:middle line:84%
which is symbolized here
in the second chakra

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:46.340 align:middle line:90%
this simple square.

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:50.020 align:middle line:84%
On the body, the second chakra
is the grassy pubic region

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:51.076 align:middle line:90%
of our body.

00:28:51.076 --> 00:28:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And here in the
second chakra, we

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:55.890 align:middle line:90%
have a square patch of grass.

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:59.040 align:middle line:84%
The square always symbolizes
Earth and sacred geometry.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:02.070 align:middle line:84%
It represents the four
directions, the four elements.

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And so here is a very
simple but elegant way

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:08.230 align:middle line:84%
of illustrating
the second chakra.

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:11.630 align:middle line:84%
The third chakra is
our solar plexus.

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And at the mall, the third
chakra is an amphitheater.

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:19.390 align:middle line:84%
You actually have to
walk down into this pit.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And basically that pit,
that's where they want us.

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:26.280 align:middle line:84%
They want us viewing all the
players on the stage here,

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.470 align:middle line:84%
oblivious that there's
anything else going on

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:30.010 align:middle line:90%
in the greater world.

00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:32.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they'll tell
you there is nothing

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:33.890 align:middle line:90%
going on in the greater world.

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:36.000 align:middle line:90%
This is it right here.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.250 align:middle line:84%
If you can't feel it and
touch it, it ain't real.

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:44.620 align:middle line:84%
UFOs, angels, all of
that-- are you joking?

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:46.030 align:middle line:90%
You're deep inside this pit.

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:47.870 align:middle line:84%
We've got you
firmly under control

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:50.530 align:middle line:84%
when we've got you in
the first three chakras.

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:53.750 align:middle line:84%
We want you focused on those
real important questions.

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:55.590 align:middle line:90%
Hey, what am I going to eat?

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:56.910 align:middle line:90%
Where am I going to sleep?

00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:59.030 align:middle line:90%
Who am I going to sleep with?

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And who's Paula Zahn
talking to tonight?

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:03.870 align:middle line:90%
What time's the game start?

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:06.440 align:middle line:84%
That's right where they want
us, because the second that we

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.030 align:middle line:84%
learn that we can
get out of this pit

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:12.600 align:middle line:84%
and that there is, in fact, a
stairway to heaven attached,

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.790 align:middle line:90%
our life's questions change.

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:16.660 align:middle line:90%
Where did I come from?

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:18.530 align:middle line:90%
How did I get here?

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:20.340 align:middle line:84%
How do I get the
hell out of here?

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.600 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:27.060 align:middle line:84%
That's what we want to
know, isn't it, bottom line?

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:29.920 align:middle line:84%
How do we improve this place
then get the hell out of here?

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.950 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's my question.

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:33.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm a star walker, remember?

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:35.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I came from
somewhere else like you did,

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and I want to go
back to those stars.

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Just a minute ago, I swear
I was in another galaxy.

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:41.140 align:middle line:90%
And now I'm here.

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.304 align:middle line:90%
How did I get here?

00:30:43.304 --> 00:30:45.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show you some
interesting things at the heart

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:46.150 align:middle line:90%
chakra.

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:47.649 align:middle line:84%
I'm just kind of
skimming over here,

00:30:47.649 --> 00:30:50.350 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted to get here
to the throat chakra, where we

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:52.590 align:middle line:90%
see the World War II memorial.

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:54.980 align:middle line:84%
What do we find in the
World War II memorial?

00:30:54.980 --> 00:31:01.530 align:middle line:84%
An 18,168-pound black globe
that floats on 1/8 of an inch

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:05.370 align:middle line:84%
of water sitting on top
of concentric rings.

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Poignantly, the
Germans built this ball

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.570 align:middle line:90%
and sent it over to us.

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:12.800 align:middle line:90%
Huh.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.030 align:middle line:90%
That's the poignant spin.

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Would you like me to put
a paranoid spin on it

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.100 align:middle line:90%
now for you?

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:18.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's the paranoid spin.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Remember I said that
the innermost occult

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.870 align:middle line:84%
order of the Nazi SS was
the Order of the Black Sun.

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Look at the sun shining on
that black ball right there.

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.180 align:middle line:84%
When you're standing
in front of it,

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:35.040 align:middle line:84%
you can't tell-- is
the sun shining on it

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.760 align:middle line:90%
or from within it?

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:41.150 align:middle line:84%
It looks like the sun is
deep inside that ball,

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:45.080 align:middle line:84%
and that black globe
metaphorically becomes

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.880 align:middle line:90%
a black sun.

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.520 align:middle line:84%
I think the Germans
sent us the black sun

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:54.680 align:middle line:84%
because we kicked their ass,
and we've built the Meru.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.810 align:middle line:84%
We now have the Spear
of Destiny in America.

00:31:57.810 --> 00:31:59.270 align:middle line:90%
It's here.

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:01.190 align:middle line:90%
And that means we get the prize.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:03.170 align:middle line:90%
We have the black sun now.

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:05.550 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to do with it?

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:09.260 align:middle line:84%
It's not looking too good,
what we're going to do with it.

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.535 align:middle line:84%
So here's a close-up
of the black sun.

00:32:11.535 --> 00:32:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And you can see it's actually
deep inside that ball.

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:19.650 align:middle line:84%
This is symbolic, again,
of the Vril Force.

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about this
more when we actually

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:24.180 align:middle line:90%
get down to the mall.

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:27.530 align:middle line:84%
My favorite place to sit is
amongst these holly trees,

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:28.910 align:middle line:90%
or holy trees.

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And I look, and I go
up this ramp right

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:35.260 align:middle line:84%
here into the sun shining
in the black ball.

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:37.770 align:middle line:84%
You ever watched the
TV show "Stargate"

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:41.822 align:middle line:90%
or see the movie "Stargate?"

00:32:41.822 --> 00:32:43.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:45.970 align:middle line:84%
That's why I like the
black ball so much,

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:51.550 align:middle line:84%
because it makes me think, hey,
I could walk through right up

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:55.860 align:middle line:84%
this ramp through this black
sun into another realm.

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:58.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I really don't
want to leave that badly.

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:03.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm just kind of
over-emphasizing that.

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:06.160 align:middle line:84%
But remember we started
this talk this morning

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:09.310 align:middle line:84%
with the Seal of Solomon that
provides wondrous things.

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:11.970 align:middle line:10%
And I'm convinced
that we can apply

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:14.910 align:middle line:10%
the understanding of the Seal
of Solomon to the mall here.

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:18.550 align:middle line:10%
It is the rod and ring
of the ancient mysteries.

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And however it happened,
it's come together here

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.240 align:middle line:90%
in Nashville.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And now we can walk this
place and begin to utilize it.

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:30.190 align:middle line:84%
By the way, the
mall is unfinished.

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:32.410 align:middle line:84%
As we see it today,
it's unfinished.

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Plans called to have a river
snaking up the side of it.

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually
the architect's diagram

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:40.350 align:middle line:84%
of where they're
going to go with it.

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:43.070 align:middle line:10%
When they put that
river in there, honey,

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:46.250 align:middle line:10%
you've got something
called an asherah.

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:49.110 align:middle line:10%
You've got the pillar
of Osiris lifting

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:51.470 align:middle line:10%
the serpentine waterway.

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And how much more
over the top do

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:58.240 align:middle line:84%
we need for it to
get before we go,

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.700 align:middle line:84%
oh, OK, we see where
you're coming from.

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:05.980 align:middle line:84%
We see what pages you're
taking these diagrams out of.

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:10.400 align:middle line:84%
There's no question in my mind
that somebody or something

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:13.730 align:middle line:84%
is causing this to be
created as a modern version

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:15.030 align:middle line:90%
of the asherah pillar.

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:19.270 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the word "Osiris" comes
from "asherah," they believe.

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:21.010 align:middle line:10%
What's an asherah?

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:23.679 align:middle line:10%
Well, the biblical
definition of an asherah

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:30.900 align:middle line:10%
is a pillar, especially a
pillar that is an oak grove.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.389 align:middle line:84%
This is the pillar
portion of the complex.

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:35.609 align:middle line:84%
Here you see these dots
that run along the side.

00:34:35.609 --> 00:34:37.150 align:middle line:84%
When you get over
to the mall, you're

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:41.409 align:middle line:84%
going to find out
those are oak trees.

00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:42.870 align:middle line:84%
When you enter the
pillar portion,

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:46.429 align:middle line:84%
you are entering by definition,
by biblical definition,

00:34:46.429 --> 00:34:50.590 align:middle line:84%
an asherah, the grove
of the goddess--

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:52.090 align:middle line:90%
the grove of the goddess.

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:53.489 align:middle line:84%
When the patriarchy
came in, they

00:34:53.489 --> 00:34:55.449 align:middle line:84%
went to all the high
places and tore down

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:59.710 align:middle line:84%
all the asherahs to get rid
of the goddess religion.

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:01.330 align:middle line:90%
And they took those places over.

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:03.700 align:middle line:84%
But we've got one
here, and again, I'm

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:07.350 align:middle line:84%
convinced that the Osiris
pillar and the pillar that Moses

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:10.890 align:middle line:84%
lifted the serpent of healing
upon are the same thing,

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:13.590 align:middle line:84%
and Moses took over
this technology.

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:15.986 align:middle line:10%
This is a diagram of an asherah.

00:35:15.986 --> 00:35:17.360 align:middle line:10%
This is the way
they portrayed it

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.610 align:middle line:10%
in the ancient world--
not identical to the mall,

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:22.890 align:middle line:10%
but not too dissimilar, either.

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:26.950 align:middle line:10%
We have a pedestal
with a pillar attached

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:29.200 align:middle line:10%
to it with the symbol
of energy and vibration

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.289 align:middle line:10%
emanating from it.

00:35:31.289 --> 00:35:32.830 align:middle line:10%
Asherah appears in
the Old Testament,

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:35.690 align:middle line:10%
both as the name of a Canaanite
goddess and her wooden cult

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:38.610 align:middle line:10%
symbol, the multibranched
tree of life--

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:41.000 align:middle line:10%
the tree of knowledge,
or tree of life.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.300 align:middle line:10%
And that's what the Bicentennial
Capitol Mall is a model of.

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:47.170 align:middle line:10%
The fruit of her
tree represented

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:51.740 align:middle line:10%
all food, including especially
spiritual nourishment.

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:54.560 align:middle line:10%
And I am looking
at ways that we can

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:59.580 align:middle line:10%
derive spiritual nourishment
by walking the mall together,

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:02.630 align:middle line:10%
by sharing our knowledge
about the chakras, the energy

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:06.220 align:middle line:10%
centers, and ways that we can
do ceremony, have instruction

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.640 align:middle line:10%
at this place, so
that we can access

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.480 align:middle line:10%
to the other dimensional
realms and receive

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:14.700 align:middle line:10%
the spiritual energy that
theoretically this design

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.560 align:middle line:10%
channels.

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:17.820 align:middle line:90%
That's my goal.

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:21.232 align:middle line:84%
Here's a biblical asherah,
actually an Assyrian asherah.

00:36:21.232 --> 00:36:22.940 align:middle line:84%
This is what it looked
like in operation,

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:26.070 align:middle line:84%
connecting the
Earth with the stars

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:29.370 align:middle line:84%
and receiving, Isis
with her asherah,

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:31.800 align:middle line:84%
or Osiris, Ishtara
with her asherah.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:35.174 align:middle line:90%


00:36:35.174 --> 00:36:36.590 align:middle line:84%
What she's pointing
at, I believe,

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:42.410 align:middle line:84%
is the pineal gland, the
cone-shaped enlightenment gland

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:44.560 align:middle line:84%
at the center of our
brain that has been found

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.832 align:middle line:90%
to have calcite micro crystals.

00:36:47.832 --> 00:36:50.430 align:middle line:90%


00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:54.530 align:middle line:84%
We're talking our pineal gland
is actually like a cell phone,

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:58.250 align:middle line:84%
capable of receiving
other-dimensional messages.

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:01.510 align:middle line:84%
This is actual photographs
of the human hand

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:04.660 align:middle line:84%
with the crystalline energies
that we see on top of it.

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:08.500 align:middle line:84%
These are tuners
of cosmic energy.

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.590 align:middle line:84%
If you think of our
body as a candle,

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:12.870 align:middle line:90%
the pineal gland is the wick.

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:17.060 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, none
of our candles are lit.

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:20.320 align:middle line:84%
None of our elevators
go to the top.

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
coming together to do

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:25.100 align:middle line:90%
is to learn to light our candle.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Because once one of
us lights our candle,

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:29.900 align:middle line:84%
I can pass it to you,
and you can pass it

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:32.340 align:middle line:90%
to me, and so on and so forth.

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:34.320 align:middle line:90%
That's the goal.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:37.010 align:middle line:84%
In just a couple moments
here, we'll be on our way

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:40.120 align:middle line:84%
to the mall to experience
this ourselves.

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:43.580 align:middle line:84%
What we see here now is
the Court of Three Stars.

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:47.970 align:middle line:84%
50 25-foot-tall solid
pillars with bells on them

00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:51.180 align:middle line:90%
ring the Court of Three Stars.

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:54.430 align:middle line:10%
The floor has red, white,
and blue granite laid on it,

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:56.280 align:middle line:10%
and we're going
to talk about what

00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:00.210 align:middle line:10%
the function of that granite is
when we get down to the site.

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:05.010 align:middle line:84%
What I wanted to leave you
with here is this notion.

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:07.440 align:middle line:84%
In the Bible, remember
we talked about Elijah

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.390 align:middle line:90%
at the very beginning.

00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:12.560 align:middle line:84%
The messianic prophecy is Elijah
is going to return and give

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:15.560 align:middle line:90%
the rod to the Messiah.

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:19.010 align:middle line:84%
When Elijah left, he
ascended into the heavens

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:20.440 align:middle line:90%
in a whirlwind.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.030 align:middle line:84%
The name of the
place where Elijah

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:23.670 align:middle line:84%
ascended into the
heavens in the Bible

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:26.600 align:middle line:90%
was called Gilgal-- Gilgal.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And what Gilgal
means is a circle

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:34.470 align:middle line:90%
of vertical pillars or stones.

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:38.650 align:middle line:84%
When Elijah ascended into
the heavens at Gilgal,

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:42.760 align:middle line:90%
50 prophets witnessed it.

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:48.750 align:middle line:84%
At the Court of Three Stars,
we have a circle of 50 vertical

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:51.740 align:middle line:90%
or upright pillars.

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:53.060 align:middle line:90%
That's a Gilgal.

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:56.250 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what we're
looking at right there.

00:38:56.250 --> 00:39:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Gilgal later is picked up
and used in the New Testament

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:04.370 align:middle line:84%
in the word Golgotha, the
place of the skull, where

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:06.400 align:middle line:90%
the crucifixion took place.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.940 align:middle line:84%
The arrangement
at the crucifixion

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.830 align:middle line:90%
was there were three crosses.

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:13.110 align:middle line:84%
The arrangement at the
Gilgal in Nashville,

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:17.970 align:middle line:84%
there are three stars laid
on the floor of this porch

00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:21.130 align:middle line:90%
in a trident pattern.

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Those three stars correspond
exactly with our third eye.

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And what we're going
to see when we get down

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:29.790 align:middle line:84%
there is that we're
going to stand-- this

00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:middle line:90%
is a Grail temple from Germany.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:37.160 align:middle line:84%
This is a Grail temple compared
to the Court of Three Stars.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.716 align:middle line:84%
They just made all this
up here in Nashville?

00:39:39.716 --> 00:39:41.030 align:middle line:90%
Hm.

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Somebody with a pretty
big brain, I think,

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:45.950 align:middle line:90%
is behind all of this.

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:49.290 align:middle line:10%
There's Stonehenge,
Stonehenge compared

00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:52.085 align:middle line:10%
to the Court of Three Stars.

00:39:52.085 --> 00:39:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And what we're going to find
out is that when we get down

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:56.870 align:middle line:84%
to the Court of Three
Stars and we follow

00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:59.870 align:middle line:84%
the pattern of the three
stars, they point directly

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:02.313 align:middle line:90%
to an iron rod that is--

00:40:02.313 --> 00:40:03.872 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:03.872 --> 00:40:07.192 align:middle line:84%
--three stars that corresponds
exactly with the pineal gland.

00:40:07.192 --> 00:40:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
going to find out is

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:13.990 align:middle line:84%
that we stand on that, an
incredible acoustic experience

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:16.970 align:middle line:90%
is experienced inside your head.

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:19.130 align:middle line:84%
You are standing
on that so that you

00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:22.770 align:middle line:84%
can receive the tone, the
charge, or frequency that

00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:26.990 align:middle line:84%
decalcifies our pineal
gland, lights its candle,

00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and when the pineal
gland's candle is lit,

00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:31.010 align:middle line:90%
it releases secretions.

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And contained within
those secretions

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:36.550 align:middle line:84%
are the secrets that begin the
process of putting our rainbow

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:38.760 align:middle line:90%
body on our flesh.

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:41.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's going to be
where we're headed next.

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:42.910 align:middle line:84%
I want to conclude
this presentation

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:45.479 align:middle line:84%
by thanking you very much
for your kind attention.

00:40:45.479 --> 00:40:46.520 align:middle line:90%
I hope you've enjoyed it.

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'll look forward
to seeing you all again.

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:49.730 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:53.680 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:54.934 align:middle line:90%
