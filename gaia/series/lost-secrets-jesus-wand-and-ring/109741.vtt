00:00:03.374 --> 00:00:10.620 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.990 align:middle line:10%
>>Speaking of light and
brightness and shining,

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:20.660 align:middle line:10%
let's look at MR. MR-- the
device attached to Marduk,

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.440 align:middle line:10%
the god of Babylon, the
shining one of Babylon,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.880 align:middle line:10%
whose name Marduk later became
Mars, the "enlightened one."

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Look at the comparison
here between Marduk

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.550 align:middle line:84%
before his pillar
of MR-- brightness

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.550 align:middle line:84%
and shining-- and the way
Isis is portrayed next

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.740 align:middle line:90%
to the Osiris device.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Are they portraying
the same technology?

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.320 align:middle line:90%
I think that they are.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.600 align:middle line:84%
Marduk was the chief
god of Babylon.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And scholars tell us his
tool is called a spade.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.750 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't look anything
like a spade to me.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.492 align:middle line:84%
I think they-- what happens
is that, in the 1800s,

00:00:56.492 --> 00:00:58.450 align:middle line:84%
they look at these
depictions and say, oh, that

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.020 align:middle line:90%
must be a spade.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.981 align:middle line:84%
And what happens for
the next 100 years

00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:03.980 align:middle line:84%
is that every scholar who
goes to the University

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.510 align:middle line:84%
of Pennsylvania or
University of Chicago

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.180 align:middle line:84%
repeats the same
lie over and over

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.010 align:middle line:90%
again until it becomes gospel.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And anybody that challenges
that is a heretic.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.140 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm a heretic.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying
that's not a spade.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.390 align:middle line:84%
That's a device that brought
about brightness and shining,

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.240 align:middle line:90%
awakening.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.870 align:middle line:84%
It was called the mar
or the MR, "mister."

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:31.670 align:middle line:90%
It's funny.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.800 align:middle line:84%
When I moved to
Nashville in 1982,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.840 align:middle line:84%
two things really
changed my life.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.980 align:middle line:84%
One, I read "Holy
Blood, Holy Grail"

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.020 align:middle line:84%
when I was a
sophomore in college.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And two, I learned
to speak Southern.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And learning to speak Southern
became an incredible tool

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.820 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.566 align:middle line:84%
It happened-- my family,
we used to have horses.

00:01:51.566 --> 00:01:52.690 align:middle line:90%
And we had a ranch manager.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And he sat me down one day,
and he says, you're a Yankee,

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.660 align:middle line:90%
read this.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.880 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.230 align:middle line:84%
"Mister Dukes, Mister Not
Dukes, Osar, CM Wangs, Lib,

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.910 align:middle line:90%
Mister Dukes."

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.560 align:middle line:84%
He said, no, you
gotta speak Southern!

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.750 align:middle line:90%
"'Em are ducks.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.050 align:middle line:90%
'Em are not ducks!

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.470 align:middle line:90%
Oh, 'es 'ey are!

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.840 align:middle line:90%
See 'em wings?

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'll be!

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.790 align:middle line:90%
'Em are ducks!" [LAUGHTER]

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And so from that point forward,
I started speaking Southern.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And so when I'm with a word,
I'll slow that word down.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And what it did is it
gave me an opportunity

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.250 align:middle line:84%
to start to say, well, where
did this word come from.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.520 align:middle line:90%
"See 'em wings?

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.050 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'll be!

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.560 align:middle line:90%
'Em are ducks."

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.540 align:middle line:84%
So Marduk was implanted
in my consciousness

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.070 align:middle line:84%
back in '82 with this
idea of speaking Southern.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.330 align:middle line:84%
The temple dedicated to Marduk
was called the E-Sagila,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.280 align:middle line:84%
where the mer or mar,
this device of brightness

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.360 align:middle line:90%
and shining, was located.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.760 align:middle line:90%
It was called the "lofty house."

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.030 align:middle line:84%
It was known as the mooring
post of heaven and earth,

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.260 align:middle line:90%
a place of ascension.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.350 align:middle line:90%
So tell me that's a spade.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.900 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.300 align:middle line:84%
This device has something to do
with ascension, with connecting

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.100 align:middle line:90%
heaven and earth.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.360 align:middle line:10%
It's a mooring post.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.110 align:middle line:10%
In fact, when you flip
back over to Egypt,

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.366 align:middle line:10%
you find the root "mer."

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:24.350 align:middle line:10%
And the hieroglyph for
mer or MR is a pyramid.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.040 align:middle line:10%
Egyptologist Mark
Lehner has stated

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.260 align:middle line:10%
that the ancient Khemetian
term-- and "Khemet"

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.100 align:middle line:10%
is the ancient name for
Egypt-- the Khemetian term

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.405 align:middle line:10%
for "pyramid" was something
he calls "MR.pyramid."

00:03:34.405 --> 00:03:37.160 align:middle line:10%
Lehner bases this on
his translation of "MR"

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.880 align:middle line:10%
as "place of ascension."

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.880 align:middle line:84%
That's what the pyramid
was-- a place of ascension.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.440 align:middle line:10%
And it's connected with
the Babylonian belief

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.020 align:middle line:10%
in a place of ascension,
a mooring post, a bond

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.850 align:middle line:10%
between heaven and earth.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:04:00.020 align:middle line:10%
Zahi Hawass, the grand poobah of
the Giza Plateau, the Secretary

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.530 align:middle line:10%
General of the Antiquities
Organization of Egypt

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.980 align:middle line:10%
himself, explains that the Giza
Plateau, the Great Pyramid,

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.880 align:middle line:10%
was known by the Egyptians
as the House of Osiris, lord

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.930 align:middle line:10%
of the underground tunnels.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.810 align:middle line:84%
What that tells me is that
Osiris is not a person.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.050 align:middle line:90%
Osiris is a device.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.589 align:middle line:84%
This bond between
heaven and earth

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:21.630 align:middle line:84%
must have been located
at the Great Pyramid.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.070 align:middle line:90%
I believe it's still there.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.140 align:middle line:84%
I believe that this
device is housed

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.620 align:middle line:90%
within the Great Pyramid.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Zahi Hawass was actually here
in Nashville in June of 2006

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.540 align:middle line:84%
and said that by
the end of 2006,

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.230 align:middle line:84%
he's going to open a secret
chamber in the Great Pyramid--

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.190 align:middle line:84%
the lost tomb of Khufu,
as he describes it.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.190 align:middle line:84%
A little bit of insight-- Zahi
Hawass believes he is Khufu.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.284 align:middle line:90%


00:04:48.284 --> 00:04:49.869 align:middle line:90%
I just learned this.

00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Everybody who knew him
when he was studying

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.560 align:middle line:84%
at the ARE and the
University of Pennsylvania

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.670 align:middle line:84%
knows that he
believes he's Khufu.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.130 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god!

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.640 align:middle line:84%
So Osama believes
he's the Mahdi,

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.610 align:middle line:84%
and-- we need a scorecard of
who these people are on the news

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.160 align:middle line:90%
and who they think they are.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.270 align:middle line:84%
It'd be very helpful,
because then we would really

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.170 align:middle line:90%
realize their intentions.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.600 align:middle line:10%
The symbol of Marduk, this
brightness and shining device,

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.240 align:middle line:10%
was set upon a
composite creature

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.620 align:middle line:10%
called a mushrushu,
a hybrid being.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.740 align:middle line:10%
It looks like a
dragon or a bull.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.010 align:middle line:10%
And I think it's the
stand for this device.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.140 align:middle line:10%
I think it's the stand that
you put this device that

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.140 align:middle line:10%
connects heaven and earth upon.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And over and over again, we
see a similar scene of people

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.720 align:middle line:84%
worshipping or utilizing this
device, similar to the way

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Isis is portrayed operating
the Osiris device.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.620 align:middle line:84%
I think it's all
the same technology.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.980 align:middle line:84%
I think they're describing the
exact same device over and over

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.440 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Back at Abydos, we see
Isis tending the device.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.350 align:middle line:84%
But now we see there's an actual
human face in this antenna

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.150 align:middle line:90%
device.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's called
the head of Osiris.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And as we get in
more closely, we

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.680 align:middle line:84%
see that they appear
to be bringing

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.830 align:middle line:84%
some sort of a substance
out of it, which is what

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.250 align:middle line:90%
this figure holds in his hand.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.015 align:middle line:84%
They're operating
it like an antenna.

00:06:14.015 --> 00:06:16.670 align:middle line:90%


00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.310 align:middle line:10%
And we see now more
clearly the face

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.470 align:middle line:10%
that is emboldened on this
bas-relief, which-- it's

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.610 align:middle line:10%
extraordinary to stand in
front of this at Abydos,

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.870 align:middle line:10%
because you just get a sense
of energy coming from it,

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.150 align:middle line:10%
like the device is actually
still operating to this day.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.130 align:middle line:10%
The actual name, according
to Gerald Massey,

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:41.470 align:middle line:10%
of that head is Hathor, who is
also called [mufkut,] or "what

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:46.090 align:middle line:10%
is it"-- the golden head
or golden calf of Hathor.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.360 align:middle line:84%
I believe that that head--
the dead head of God--

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.900 align:middle line:90%
is what Mary Magdalene holds.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.330 align:middle line:84%
The candle that she has in her
hand in religious symbolism

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.650 align:middle line:84%
is the symbol of spiritual
illumination, of the light,

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.470 align:middle line:84%
of the seed of the
light of salvation.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And in Christian symbolism,
it's the divine light

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.900 align:middle line:84%
shining into the
world, as Christ

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.410 align:middle line:90%
is the light of the world.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.620 align:middle line:90%
Christ is not a person.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Christ is an energy, a
frequency, or a vibration.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.460 align:middle line:90%
Jesus is a man.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.000 align:middle line:90%
Christ is a person.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.850 align:middle line:84%
If you've never made
that distinction,

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.460 align:middle line:84%
it's very important
that you do that.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.670 align:middle line:90%


00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.660 align:middle line:84%
This symbolism
suggests Jesus' words,

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.542 align:middle line:90%
"I am the light of the world."

00:07:27.542 --> 00:07:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And what we're talking about
is this ancient shining device

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.134 align:middle line:84%
that I think is represented
as this lit candle.

00:07:34.134 --> 00:07:36.300 align:middle line:84%
No one lights a candle
unless you put it on a stand.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.100 align:middle line:90%
You don't hide it.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.550 align:middle line:90%
You bring it out.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately this
candle light has been hidden,

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.750 align:middle line:90%
this light of illumination.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.880 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Mary
Magdalene was called

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.890 align:middle line:84%
the Illuminator, the
Illumined One in France

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:51.320 align:middle line:90%
in the 14th century.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And what I've
suggested in my book

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:54.950 align:middle line:84%
"The Illuminator" and
other presentations

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.900 align:middle line:84%
is that the head in
Mary Magdalene's head,

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.870 align:middle line:84%
the dead head of God, is
not the decapitated cranium

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.340 align:middle line:84%
of John the Baptist, as
many grail researchers ask

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.530 align:middle line:90%
you to believe.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:08.130 align:middle line:84%
That head that she holds and
that candlestick beside her

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:12.580 align:middle line:84%
is in fact this technology
which was operated by Isis.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Mary Magdalene was a priestess
of the school of Isis.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.750 align:middle line:10%
This is why you see
these paintings that

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.790 align:middle line:10%
are so illustrative
of one another-- Isis

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.380 align:middle line:10%
standing beside
the Osiris device,

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.030 align:middle line:10%
Mary Magdalene standing
beside the pillar

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:32.679 align:middle line:10%
or cross of crucifixion
with the skull

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:35.230 align:middle line:10%
at the base of the depiction.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:39.789 align:middle line:84%
These are interchangeable terms,
interchangeable depictions.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:44.020 align:middle line:84%
What is omitted in
Christian understanding

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.440 align:middle line:84%
is the whole backstory
of where this came from.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.020 align:middle line:84%
They put a guy on a dead-- they
put a dead guy on a dead piece

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.980 align:middle line:90%
of wood and say, worship it.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Before that, they had a
living god with a living tree

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:06.526 align:middle line:84%
that you worked for,
that you in fact became.

00:09:06.526 --> 00:09:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the big
difference between these two.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:13.100 align:middle line:84%
One is a living tradition
that worships a living god.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.100 align:middle line:84%
The other-- the one on
the right, Christianity--

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.920 align:middle line:84%
is a dead religion
based on a dead guy

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.880 align:middle line:90%
and a dead piece of wood.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And everybody knows
the dead can't speak.

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.010 align:middle line:10%
So Mary Magdalene,
the Illuminator--

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:29.670 align:middle line:10%
when I asked Dana to make
the cover of this book,

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.820 align:middle line:10%
I portrayed her
holding her skull.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:35.400 align:middle line:10%
But I also wanted to
have the Osiris device.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.020 align:middle line:10%
Osiris again is the Egyptian
god of resurrection.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And he is not a person, just
like Christ is not a person.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.410 align:middle line:90%
It is a device.

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:48.390 align:middle line:84%
It is a means of channeling
this higher vibrational

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:52.880 align:middle line:84%
energy that awakens us
and in fact enlightens us.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.650 align:middle line:84%
"The Anointing of the Dove"
goes into this as well, where

00:09:55.650 --> 00:10:00.690 align:middle line:84%
we see Mary Magdalene
modeling the Osiris

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:02.900 align:middle line:84%
device, because I
believe that she

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.800 align:middle line:84%
had activated these latent
spiritual capabilities

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.330 align:middle line:90%
within herself.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.405 align:middle line:84%
That's why she was
the partner of Jesus.

00:10:09.405 --> 00:10:11.950 align:middle line:90%


00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:14.630 align:middle line:84%
She knew how to connect
with the Milky Way.

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:18.420 align:middle line:84%
She had the key to the Nile--
the heavenly Nile, the Milky

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.220 align:middle line:90%
Way.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And she brought
it into her body.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And she manifested
within her own body

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.400 align:middle line:84%
an anointing oil that
then she shared with Jesus

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:32.720 align:middle line:84%
and transformed him
into the Christos.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.150 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to talk
now about the living rod.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.359 align:middle line:84%
That's where all
of this is going.

00:10:37.359 --> 00:10:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Again, you have the two forms
of Christianity-- the one

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.880 align:middle line:84%
about the living
religion of Jesus, which

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.230 align:middle line:84%
is the religion of Jesus,
and then the descriptive

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:49.310 align:middle line:84%
religion about the dead
Jesus with the dead cross.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And the way you tell the two
apart, the way you track them,

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.420 align:middle line:90%
is the living rod.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.370 align:middle line:84%
This is Joseph of
Arimathea, considered

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:59.190 align:middle line:90%
to be Jesus' wealthy uncle.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:02.590 align:middle line:84%
He holds a rod in his
hand that is blossoming.

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:05.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a living staff
or a living rod.

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.710 align:middle line:84%
It represents the
living religion.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:12.660 align:middle line:10%
Joseph, the husband of
Mary, the mother of Jesus,

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:17.840 align:middle line:10%
also is connected in
Jewish mythology and lore

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.500 align:middle line:10%
with this living rod.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:26.220 align:middle line:10%
It's called the rod of God,
and it is transmittable.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.800 align:middle line:84%
It was originally in the Garden
of Eden, according to Haggadah.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.090 align:middle line:90%
It blossoms with fruit.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:34.210 align:middle line:84%
It was recreated at the
twilight between the sixth day

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:36.310 align:middle line:90%
and the seventh day of creation.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And it was passed
along from Adam to Noah

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:44.460 align:middle line:84%
to Enoch to Elijah
to John the Baptist.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.790 align:middle line:90%
And then Jesus is given this.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:51.051 align:middle line:84%
He's portrayed here with the
dead wood in the front here.

00:11:51.051 --> 00:11:53.050 align:middle line:84%
They did something very
clever in this painting.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.820 align:middle line:84%
When we look in
the background, we

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:59.010 align:middle line:84%
see that there's a negotiation
or a transaction going on.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening is
two figures, possibly

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Jesus and John the Baptist,
are being given the secrets

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:07.510 align:middle line:90%
of the caduceus rod of Hermes.

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens
is-- what we're

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.890 align:middle line:84%
to understand from this
painting is that all this

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:13.540 align:middle line:90%
happened in the background.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And now if you understand
this symbolism, all of that

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:22.310 align:middle line:84%
is unfolded in the
dead wood of the cross.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:25.900 align:middle line:84%
But what is never taught is
the negotiation that went on

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.010 align:middle line:84%
behind the scenes and how
the dead wood actually

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:34.080 align:middle line:84%
should represent the living
teaching of this rod of God.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.330 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:37.500 align:middle line:90%
It does not.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.690 align:middle line:90%


00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:44.876 align:middle line:10%
One way to track this living
rod is with the tower.

00:12:44.876 --> 00:12:46.500 align:middle line:10%
It's another word
that keeps coming up.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.960 align:middle line:10%
In Egypt it was spelled "tawer."

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.830 align:middle line:10%
Elsewhere it's the "tor,"
as in Glastonbury Tor, where

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.090 align:middle line:10%
Joseph of Arimathea is supposed
to have taken the living rod,

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:57.470 align:middle line:10%
or the tower.

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:01.050 align:middle line:10%
And so in this painting
we see the tower.

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Another of my favorite towers
is in Rennes-le-Chateau

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:06.530 align:middle line:84%
in southern France,
another place

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:10.410 align:middle line:90%
indicated on JJ Hurtak's map.

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:14.210 align:middle line:84%
In the late night 1800s, this
priest, Berenger Sauniere,

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.905 align:middle line:84%
found some extraordinary
secret in the vicinity

00:13:16.905 --> 00:13:17.780 align:middle line:90%
of Rennes-le-Chateau.

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Le Some believe it was the
genealogy of Jesus and Mary

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:22.170 align:middle line:90%
Magdalene.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Some believe it was the treasure
of King Solomon, maybe gold.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Some believe it was
some kind of documents.

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it was, this priest
Sauniere suddenly became

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:35.497 align:middle line:84%
very wealthy and set about
refurbishing his church,

00:13:35.497 --> 00:13:37.830 align:middle line:84%
the Church of Mary Magdalene
in Rennes-le-Chateau, which

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:41.070 align:middle line:84%
isn't a whole lot bigger than
this room right here, actually.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.420 align:middle line:10%
Inside the church,
he presents us

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.310 align:middle line:10%
with this astonishing
depiction--

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:47.220 align:middle line:10%
this statue of Mary Magdalene.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.780 align:middle line:10%
What can we notice about this
statue of Mary Magdalene?

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:54.030 align:middle line:10%
Well, first of all, she
has her skull at her feet,

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.000 align:middle line:10%
and she's holding a cross.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.110 align:middle line:90%
And that cross is green.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:02.020 align:middle line:10%
It's because
Rennes-le-Chateau is

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:06.150 align:middle line:10%
another of these centers
where the living religion can

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.940 align:middle line:10%
be traced to.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:11.220 align:middle line:10%
This is the Ouas scepter
that she holds in her hand.

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:15.500 align:middle line:10%
She holds the key of the Nile in
her hand at Rennes-le-Chateau.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.090 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what I
would suggest to you

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:19.740 align:middle line:84%
is that that green
cross in her hand

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:24.260 align:middle line:84%
is actually symbolic again of
the Osiris tower, the Osiris

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.060 align:middle line:90%
device.

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And it suggests that
Rennes-le-Chateau

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.500 align:middle line:84%
is one of these centers where
these secrets of this living

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:34.150 align:middle line:84%
religion were originally--
were taken at one time.

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I suggest to you that
this depiction of Isis standing

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:39.530 align:middle line:84%
beside Osiris is
interchangeable again

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:44.940 align:middle line:84%
with Mary Magdalene holding
the green or living cross.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:49.730 align:middle line:84%
It tells us that we're on the
track of the original version

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:55.880 align:middle line:84%
of Christianity-- the living
religion, not the dead one.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And so Joseph of Arimathea with
his living rod, Mary Magdalene

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:02.550 align:middle line:84%
with her living rod,
telling us they're

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.390 align:middle line:84%
part of the same lineage
of this teaching.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:08.470 align:middle line:84%
Joseph to Joseph to
Mary Magdalene, this

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:10.500 align:middle line:90%
is how we trace it.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in Domme,
in southern France--

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.230 align:middle line:84%
I was there two years
ago, two summers ago--

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:18.210 align:middle line:84%
I had heard about the Knights
Templar, a prison in Domme,

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:19.970 align:middle line:84%
France, in southern
France, where

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:22.900 align:middle line:84%
they made graffiti
etchings on the prison

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:26.610 align:middle line:84%
walls of a pregnant woman
holding a rod or a wand

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:28.280 align:middle line:90%
in her hand.

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.730 align:middle line:84%
10 years had gone by before
I finally got a chance

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:31.580 align:middle line:90%
to go to this place.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And I took this picture
last-- two years ago

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:38.010 align:middle line:84%
of a pregnant woman holding
this rod or wand in her hand.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.150 align:middle line:84%
We see the crucifixion
scene beneath it.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.950 align:middle line:84%
The Templars for
some reason connected

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:43.540 align:middle line:90%
the cross with the pyramid.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.370 align:middle line:90%
Gee, I wonder why?

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that they
understood that the place

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.220 align:middle line:84%
of the skull, the
place of crucifixion,

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:55.240 align:middle line:90%
was probably the Giza Plateau?

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.890 align:middle line:84%
That's what all
of this is leading

00:15:56.890 --> 00:16:00.015 align:middle line:84%
to-- that that was the central
place, the place of ascension.

00:16:00.015 --> 00:16:02.830 align:middle line:90%


00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:05.710 align:middle line:84%
Back to Solomon now
again with the tower

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:10.090 align:middle line:84%
in the pillar of the living rod
and the rebuilding of this--

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:13.420 align:middle line:84%
the Templars had gone
into Solomon's Temple

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:16.870 align:middle line:84%
in the early 1100s
looking for some secrets.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.410 align:middle line:84%
They claimed that they were
descendants of a group called

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:22.750 align:middle line:84%
the Desposyni, which is the
family of the Lord, the family

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.470 align:middle line:90%
of Jesus and Mary Magdalene.

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:27.580 align:middle line:84%
They spent 11 years
researching, digging

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.170 align:middle line:90%
underneath Solomon's Temple.

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And they came back to
Paris with something.

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Again, no one's
exactly sure what

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.390 align:middle line:84%
it was-- a cache of
knowledge, a hoard of gold,

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.930 align:middle line:90%
alchemical teachings, something.

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:42.510 align:middle line:84%
But they brought their teachings
back here to this place--

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Saint-Denis in Paris,
where Abbot Suger, who

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.790 align:middle line:84%
was a close friend
of the Templars,

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:52.700 align:middle line:84%
began writing books about
an illuminated Christianity.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:56.190 align:middle line:90%


00:16:56.190 --> 00:17:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And Suger began to design window
medallions at Saint-Denis.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.210 align:middle line:84%
This is one of those window
medallions personally designed

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:06.319 align:middle line:90%
by Suger.

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:11.609 align:middle line:10%
What we notice is we have an
ark on wheels with a green cross

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:13.339 align:middle line:10%
attached to it.

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:17.810 align:middle line:10%
That is the living pillar or rod
of God that we're looking at.

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Here is a line drawing of this
pillar, which Abbott suit says

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:28.820 align:middle line:84%
is a rendition or depiction of
the true pillar of crucifixion.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.050 align:middle line:84%
This is the true
pillar of crucifixion.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:34.790 align:middle line:84%
Now here in Nashville, there's
at least 1,000 churches.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And every one of them
portrays the pillar

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:41.730 align:middle line:84%
of crucifixion mounted to
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.690 align:middle line:90%
No they don't.

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:46.660 align:middle line:84%
There's only one
church on this planet

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:50.170 align:middle line:84%
that I've been able to find that
shows the pillar of crucifixion

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.410 align:middle line:84%
mounted to the Ark
of the Covenant,

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:55.900 align:middle line:84%
and that's Abbott Suger's
Saint-Denis in Paris.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.800 align:middle line:84%
There are no other
Christian churches

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.540 align:middle line:84%
that unite the
pillar of crucifixion

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.400 align:middle line:90%
with the Ark of the Covenant.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Why is that so
significant to me?

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.430 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's because I believe
that what we're actually

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:13.990 align:middle line:10%
looking at in these depictions
is the Osiris device.

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:17.030 align:middle line:84%
I propose that what
the Templars found

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:21.000 align:middle line:84%
hidden at Solomon's Temple
was either a blueprint for

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.570 align:middle line:84%
or the actual device
from ancient Egypt

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:27.740 align:middle line:84%
that may even have
originated in Atlantis.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And they understood that the
true pillar of crucifixion

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.150 align:middle line:90%
is not a piece of dead wood.

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.310 align:middle line:90%
It's not a piece of dead wood.

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:39.630 align:middle line:84%
It's a device, a
technology that opens

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:44.540 align:middle line:84%
holes in space, that enables
one to enter a portal

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.620 align:middle line:84%
and travel into other
dimensions or other places

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:51.260 align:middle line:84%
within our galaxy or
perhaps even other galaxies.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:55.150 align:middle line:84%
So I see a tremendous similarity
between the Osiris depiction

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:57.620 align:middle line:84%
and the Ark of the
Covenant on wheels

00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.260 align:middle line:90%
with the pillar mounted to it.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Now for a long time I was
curious about who Aminadab was.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Down here at the bottom of
the depiction on the right,

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:10.370 align:middle line:84%
we have what appears to be
sort of like a license plate.

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:12.760 align:middle line:84%
This device has a
name attached to it--

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.400 align:middle line:90%
the quadrige of Aminadab.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.930 align:middle line:90%
Well, who's Aminadab?

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:18.560 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't sure for a long time.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.094 align:middle line:84%
And then a couple of years
ago, a friend of mine,

00:19:21.094 --> 00:19:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Sir Laurence
Gardner, wrote a book

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:24.346 align:middle line:90%
called "The Magdalene Legacy."

00:19:24.346 --> 00:19:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And in that book he points out
that the third-century Fisher

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:32.340 align:middle line:84%
King Aminadab was the grandson
of Mary Magdalene's son

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.110 align:middle line:90%
Josephus.

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:37.440 align:middle line:84%
He entered into an historically
significant marriage

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.760 align:middle line:84%
that cemented the grail
bloodlines of Jesus

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.460 align:middle line:90%
and his brother James.

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:45.230 align:middle line:84%
What that means to me
is that this device

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:49.590 align:middle line:84%
is the property of this
family of the Desposyni.

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:53.840 align:middle line:84%
This device belonged to the
family of Jesus and Mary

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.260 align:middle line:90%
Magdalene.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.670 align:middle line:84%
If you can think of another
way to look at this,

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm totally open to it.

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:03.760 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that this was
the property of this family.

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.370 align:middle line:84%
That's why they put
their name on it.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And what it suggests to
me is that the Desposyni,

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:11.910 align:middle line:84%
the family of the Lord,
understands that-- get rid

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.200 align:middle line:90%
of that dead wood.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.940 align:middle line:90%
Get rid of that dead wood.

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.180 align:middle line:90%
Where's that living teaching?

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you mean millions
of people have

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.830 align:middle line:84%
been murdered for
the past 2,000 years

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:26.770 align:middle line:84%
to prevent that living
teaching from being

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:29.430 align:middle line:90%
revealed to the world at large?

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:30.760 align:middle line:90%
Well, why is that?

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, the fact is
that it has happened.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.030 align:middle line:84%
But why it's happened--
that's a whole other lecture.

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:41.130 align:middle line:84%
We want to talk about
activating the Temple of Light.

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:42.540 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're here for.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:46.740 align:middle line:84%
That's the business of the day--
activating the Temple of Light.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.010 align:middle line:90%
How do we do that?

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:53.150 align:middle line:84%
To activate the Temple of
Light for our evolving soul--

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:55.500 align:middle line:84%
for our soul drop,
our divine spark--

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:59.060 align:middle line:84%
we've got to liberate
ourselves from the delusion

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.500 align:middle line:84%
that we are helpless
and limited.

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.820 align:middle line:84%
How many went to Sunday
school and the first thing

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:07.730 align:middle line:84%
you learn is, you're a
filthy piece of crap?

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:11.180 align:middle line:84%
You're a sinful
piece of garbage,

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:14.450 align:middle line:84%
but we have the way to take
you out of your sinful state.

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:15.250 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Just pony up a few bucks
to the priest each week,

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:20.576 align:middle line:84%
pick your nose in the
back of the church,

00:21:20.576 --> 00:21:22.200 align:middle line:84%
and at the end of
the day, everything's

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.250 align:middle line:90%
going to be just groovy.

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:25.000 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.110 align:middle line:84%
We've got to liberate ourselves
from that delusion, which

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:30.510 align:middle line:90%
is what it is.

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Then we've got to
set about reconciling

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:34.910 align:middle line:90%
the opposites within.

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:38.610 align:middle line:84%
We've got to unite the
rod and ring within us.

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, we have a rod
and a ring within us.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Then we're prepared to live in a
higher stream of consciousness.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:47.512 align:middle line:90%
These are the first steps.

00:21:47.512 --> 00:21:48.970 align:middle line:84%
The reason I wanted
to include this

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:51.200 align:middle line:84%
is because what's
starting to happen

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.380 align:middle line:90%
is something very interesting.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:57.220 align:middle line:90%
I was in California recently.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:00.340 align:middle line:90%
My host is an inventor.

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And he was an engineer,
in fact, at Skunk Works,

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:07.590 align:middle line:84%
where they work on high-flying
aircraft-- wild aircraft

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:09.340 align:middle line:90%
stuff, the exotic stuff.

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.430 align:middle line:90%
He's also a Tesla researcher.

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And he was looking
at one of my DVDs.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I know
what he's doing.

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:18.850 align:middle line:90%
I know what he's talking about.

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing
I know, he quits

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:24.800 align:middle line:84%
his job, which made
his wife really happy,

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.630 align:middle line:84%
locks himself in his research
lab, which made his wife even

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:34.460 align:middle line:84%
happier, and came out with this
device that emits a radiant

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.540 align:middle line:84%
energy field so
that when you step

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.960 align:middle line:84%
into the field of this device,
it begins-- you're like, hey,

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.610 align:middle line:90%
this is really interesting.

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:45.470 align:middle line:90%
This is really kind of nice.

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening is that
it's not just this gentleman.

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:52.290 align:middle line:84%
It's other places that you see
these technologies coming out

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:54.170 align:middle line:84%
that want to take
you from a zero

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:57.460 align:middle line:84%
to a hero with
nothing in between.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at that
going, some of us--

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:04.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm included-- I'm not
ready to be a hero.

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:08.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm still working some of these
issues and that kind of thing.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I put this in
here because I believe

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:13.590 align:middle line:84%
these are the steps we've
got to take before we really,

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:17.020 align:middle line:84%
fully embrace the
actual activation,

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:20.630 align:middle line:84%
if you will, because if
we're not prepared-- let's

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.970 align:middle line:84%
just take our finger and
stick at the light socket

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:25.920 align:middle line:84%
for a few minutes and
get a good charge,

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.430 align:middle line:84%
because it's going to have,
I think, the same effect.

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:31.960 align:middle line:84%
There's nutritional supplements
coming out that are doing this.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.790 align:middle line:90%
There are technologies.

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:34.790 align:middle line:90%
There's teachings.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:37.451 align:middle line:84%
And it's like,
wow, we really are

00:23:37.451 --> 00:23:38.700 align:middle line:90%
on the threshold of awakening.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.074 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
stuff out there.

00:23:40.074 --> 00:23:43.800 align:middle line:84%
But we've got to make sure we're
in the right space-- mentally,

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.550 align:middle line:84%
physically, spiritually,
and emotionally--

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:46.790 align:middle line:90%
to embrace these things.

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And these are the first
three steps here, in my view.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I wanted to
talk about in this section

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:55.040 align:middle line:90%
of our talk.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.360 align:middle line:84%
There is a natural
body, our body,

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.410 align:middle line:90%
and there is a spiritual body.

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Sounds pretty basic,
but a lot of people

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:05.830 align:middle line:84%
don't understand that, nor do
they operate from the sense

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:08.530 align:middle line:90%
that we have a spiritual body.

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:10.630 align:middle line:84%
"And so it is written,
the first man Adam

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:11.690 align:middle line:90%
was made a living soul.

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:14.520 align:middle line:84%
The last Adam was made
a quickening spirit.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And as we have borne the
image of the earthly,

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:20.870 align:middle line:84%
we shall also bear the
image of the heavenly."

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:24.809 align:middle line:90%
1 Corinthians 15, 44 through 49.

00:24:24.809 --> 00:24:26.600 align:middle line:84%
"As we have borne the
image of the earthly,

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.950 align:middle line:84%
we shall also bear the
image of the heavenly."

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:32.350 align:middle line:90%
On the top, the Sombrero Galaxy.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:35.960 align:middle line:84%
On the bottom, a
cosmic egg in the womb.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:38.550 align:middle line:90%
We are cosmic eggs.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And when it says we're going to
bear the image of the heavenly,

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:44.890 align:middle line:84%
I think what it's talking about
is what the Buddhists believe.

00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Our soul drop, that
nucleus within us,

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:50.870 align:middle line:90%
can even become a whole galaxy.

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:54.250 align:middle line:84%
We talk about living
in another dimension.

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:56.800 align:middle line:84%
How about living in
another dimension?

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.040 align:middle line:84%
How about our soul drop, which
is condensed in this body,

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.540 align:middle line:90%
becoming a whole galaxy?

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:05.560 align:middle line:84%
That's a big jump in
scale and dimension,

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.380 align:middle line:84%
but that may be what
they're talking about.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere in between
the cosmic egg and the womb

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.420 align:middle line:84%
and the cosmic egg flying
around in the cosmos-- hey,

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.030 align:middle line:90%
that's our potential.

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And to the extent that
we begin to embrace

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:22.810 align:middle line:84%
that potential within us, magic
can really start to happen.

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:25.890 align:middle line:84%
All around us are
tiny doors that lead

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:28.580 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the universe.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:30.650 align:middle line:84%
That's what modern
science is telling us.

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:32.190 align:middle line:84%
This isn't "Alice
in Wonderland."

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:35.160 align:middle line:84%
This isn't-- pick Madeleine
L'Engle's stories.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Pick any story
that tells us this.

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:38.710 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:40.710 align:middle line:84%
They're predicted by
Einstein's equations.

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:44.000 align:middle line:84%
These quantum wormholes offer
faster-than-light transport

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.540 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the cosmos.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.020 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:49.890 align:middle line:84%
How would it feel like if we
could walk out this door right

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:52.350 align:middle line:84%
here and enter another
conference like this

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:53.670 align:middle line:90%
in Andromeda?

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:55.040 align:middle line:90%
I'd love it.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.230 align:middle line:84%
The Tibetans
operate on a premise

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:01.910 align:middle line:84%
that they're connected to
18 different solar systems

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:04.190 align:middle line:90%
within our galaxy.

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:07.770 align:middle line:84%
We're not even
connected to one, let

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:13.644 align:middle line:84%
alone keeping 18 of these
balls-- where am I now?

00:26:13.644 --> 00:26:16.170 align:middle line:10%
We must consciously
insert ourselves

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:18.090 align:middle line:10%
into the divine
web of the cosmos.

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:19.710 align:middle line:10%
That's an important step.

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:24.510 align:middle line:10%
We are all, at all times,
whether we recognize it or not,

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:29.106 align:middle line:10%
an inextricable part of the
universal web of consciousness.

00:26:29.106 --> 00:26:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And I hyphenated the
word "conscious-ness"

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:34.590 align:middle line:90%
because everything is conscious.

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:37.400 align:middle line:90%
We live in a mirror world.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Everything is energy
and vibration,

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.050 align:middle line:90%
and we are part of it.

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:45.360 align:middle line:90%
It mirrors us.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.860 align:middle line:84%
We have to imagine
this limitless web

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:50.840 align:middle line:84%
as a multileveled system
of dimensions nested

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:54.690 align:middle line:84%
within dimensions, with
information continually being

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:57.250 align:middle line:84%
exchanged between
these dimensions

00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:00.200 align:middle line:84%
at the molecular level, at the
level of our own communication

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:04.020 align:middle line:84%
with each other, at the
level of planetary life,

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and at the level of galaxies
and perhaps universes,

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.380 align:middle line:90%
of which we know nothing.

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:13.420 align:middle line:84%
50 years ago, they didn't know
anything about these galaxies.

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:16.340 align:middle line:84%
It was only in the
'40s that we really

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.030 align:middle line:84%
began to understand
in the modern world

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:22.160 align:middle line:84%
that our Milky Way galaxy
is shaped like a UFO,

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.800 align:middle line:90%
like a celestial disk.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.660 align:middle line:84%
In just a short 50
years, we now know

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:27.620 align:middle line:84%
there's hundreds of
billions of galaxies that

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:29.360 align:middle line:90%
inhabit the known universe.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And our universe is
nested within a dimension

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.470 align:middle line:90%
within a dimension.

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:34.620 align:middle line:90%
We're all part of it.

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And we can interact
on those levels.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:40.740 align:middle line:90%


00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.004 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we are
children of the cosmos.

00:27:43.004 --> 00:27:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we have
to begin to view ourselves.

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:47.220 align:middle line:90%
We're all star walkers.

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.360 align:middle line:90%
It's not just me.

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.500 align:middle line:90%
All of us are star walkers.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:54.660 align:middle line:84%
We come from other realms,
other dimensions, to this place.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:58.170 align:middle line:84%
We're going to return to other
realms, other dimensions,

00:27:58.170 --> 00:27:59.460 align:middle line:90%
other places.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.790 align:middle line:84%
I just hope I can
take my cats with me.

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:03.230 align:middle line:84%
This recently came
out the Gospel

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:08.290 align:middle line:84%
of Judas-- very controversial
new gospel, just revealed.

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Judas whispers to Jesus,
"I know who you are

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:13.780 align:middle line:90%
and where you have come from.

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:17.670 align:middle line:84%
You're from the immortal
realm of Barbelo."

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:20.800 align:middle line:90%
Where's that?

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.380 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Gospel of Judas,

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:27.770 align:middle line:84%
the savior is the divine
spark I've been speaking of.

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:28.680 align:middle line:90%
That's not my word.

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:33.120 align:middle line:84%
This is the Gospel of Judas'
word-- the spiritual being

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.840 align:middle line:84%
inside Jesus who lives
in a spiritual dimension.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:40.550 align:middle line:84%
The physical being of
Jesus is a simple covering,

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:42.910 align:middle line:84%
much like a clothing
that the spiritual savior

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:44.480 align:middle line:90%
wears in the world.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm asking
you to consider this body is.

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:48.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a covering.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.370 align:middle line:90%
It's also a device.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:51.930 align:middle line:90%
It's a stargate.

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And our divine
sparks temporarily

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.060 align:middle line:90%
inhabit this clothing.

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:58.220 align:middle line:90%
This is not William Henry.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:00.060 align:middle line:84%
William Henry is
something else that's

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.790 align:middle line:84%
existing in how many different
dimensions right now?

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:05.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm probably giving this talk
in a billion other places

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:06.820 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:08.720 align:middle line:90%
And you're there, too.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.240 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is essentially
telling Judas that

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:17.590 align:middle line:84%
by betraying him knowingly
and at his request,

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:22.020 align:middle line:84%
contrary to the dead religion
of Christianity's doctrine,

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.860 align:middle line:84%
that he is being a true friend
and allowing the man Jesus

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:28.432 align:middle line:84%
to die so that the savior,
the divine spark or particle,

00:29:28.432 --> 00:29:30.890 align:middle line:84%
can be free to return to his
home in heaven or the Barbelo.

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:33.480 align:middle line:90%


00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
all looking for.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:38.870 align:middle line:84%
We want to return to that
immortal realm of the Barbelo.

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:39.670 align:middle line:90%
