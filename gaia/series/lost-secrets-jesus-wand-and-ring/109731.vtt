00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.910 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.822 align:middle line:90%


00:00:09.822 --> 00:00:11.155 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, good morning, everybody.

00:00:11.155 --> 00:00:11.955 align:middle line:90%
And welcome.

00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:14.000 align:middle line:10%
Thank you very much
for being here.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.080 align:middle line:84%
This is "Activating
the Temple of Light,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.377 align:middle line:84%
the Great Secret of the
Lost Rod and Ring of Jesus."

00:00:20.377 --> 00:00:22.960 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to be looking at
some very interesting material

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.270 align:middle line:84%
today that encompasses a
lot of ancient material

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.730 align:middle line:84%
about this lost rod and ring,
but also modern Nashville

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.530 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.300 align:middle line:84%
We're going to tie
together these subjects

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.030 align:middle line:90%
in a very extraordinary way.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.240 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to introduce this
presentation with a quote.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.270 align:middle line:84%
"No one lights a
lamp and puts it

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.570 align:middle line:84%
in a place where it will
be hidden or under a bowl.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.740 align:middle line:84%
Instead, he puts it on its
stand so that those who come in

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.330 align:middle line:90%
may see the light."

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.310 align:middle line:84%
We're going to end our
day today at a light stand

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.370 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, a
temple facility that

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.480 align:middle line:84%
matches the ancient description
of the rod and ring that once

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.670 align:middle line:84%
was attributed to Jesus but
which we're going to see

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.720 align:middle line:84%
has a very, very ancient,
ancient pedigree.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.270 align:middle line:84%
I always like to begin with a
brief introduction about who

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.070 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.630 align:middle line:10%
I call myself an
investigative mythologist.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.360 align:middle line:10%
This is sort of like being
an investigative journalist,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.110 align:middle line:10%
except my focus is mythology.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.940 align:middle line:10%
A traditional mythologist will
look at myth and scripture,

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.570 align:middle line:10%
and they'll say, OK, there's
a literal understanding here.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.480 align:middle line:84%
There's a historical
understanding.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.590 align:middle line:84%
There's an allegorical,
symbolical understanding

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.940 align:middle line:90%
in these texts.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.180 align:middle line:84%
There's also a
metaphorical understanding.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And very often, they'll
stop with those four

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.130 align:middle line:90%
levels of interpretation.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.730 align:middle line:84%
But I've added a couple
other, additional levels.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.690 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
myth and scripture

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.960 align:middle line:84%
are loaded with references
to ancient technology.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.910 align:middle line:84%
I also believe that
myth and scripture

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.050 align:middle line:84%
are loaded with references to
an anatomical understanding,

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.740 align:middle line:84%
a higher spiritual
functioning of the human body.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's become my
quest to understand

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.650 align:middle line:84%
this coding about this
ancient technology

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.160 align:middle line:84%
and the spiritual functioning
of the human body.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.140 align:middle line:84%
My logo comes from the
Egyptian god Osiris, who

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.540 align:middle line:90%
was the god of Resurrection.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.970 align:middle line:84%
He was sort of a prototype for
Jesus, many scholars believe.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And what we see in
his hieroglyph here

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.700 align:middle line:84%
is a gateway or a
shrine that is flanked

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.550 align:middle line:84%
by two pillars or towers called
the TET pillars, power pillars.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.040 align:middle line:84%
We see another symbol
over here called

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.490 align:middle line:84%
the Shuti pillar, which
has a serpent levitating

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.470 align:middle line:90%
upon the pillar.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.560 align:middle line:84%
When we put those
symbols together,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.680 align:middle line:84%
we form a complete device
that the ancient Egyptians

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.290 align:middle line:90%
called Osiris.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.385 align:middle line:84%
And I use that word
"device" very intentionally,

00:02:53.385 --> 00:02:54.760 align:middle line:84%
because when you
look up the word

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.160 align:middle line:84%
"device" in the
dictionary, it says

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.140 align:middle line:84%
that you're dealing with a
technology, with an appliance,

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.130 align:middle line:84%
with a tool, and
also with a symbol.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Think of a heraldic
device, a heraldic symbol.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe that
this Osiris device

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.880 align:middle line:90%
is all of those things.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.200 align:middle line:84%
My research reveals, anyway,
that Osiris was a tool.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.700 align:middle line:90%
It was an appliance.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.470 align:middle line:10%
It was a technology.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.770 align:middle line:10%
And it was also a symbol for
a whole host of sciences.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.310 align:middle line:10%
What we see on the left
is Isis tending Osiris.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.710 align:middle line:10%
And beside it is
a color rendition

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.650 align:middle line:10%
of this done by my artistic
collaborator, Mr. Dana

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.300 align:middle line:10%
Augustine.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And so we can see that
it looks on the surface

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.740 align:middle line:90%
to be technological.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.850 align:middle line:84%
If it is, in fact, a
technology, a tool,

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.270 align:middle line:84%
what function did
this device serve?

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Egyptians
were very clear.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Osiris was called the
Tower-- the Tower.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And what Tower meant was the
bond between heaven and earth.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.390 align:middle line:90%
That was its function.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.550 align:middle line:84%
This device was the tree of
life, the ladder or stairway

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.830 align:middle line:84%
to heaven, according
to the Egyptians.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.390 align:middle line:90%
That's what it did.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to imagine we're
dealing with a technology that

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.820 align:middle line:90%
unites Heaven and Earth.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Here in this complete
rendition of Osiris

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.010 align:middle line:84%
being operated by
Isis, which today

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.240 align:middle line:84%
is in the Metropolitan Museum
of Art in New York City,

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.700 align:middle line:84%
but which originally hung on
the wall at Abydos in Egypt,

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.280 align:middle line:84%
we see an individual,
the pharaoh,

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.000 align:middle line:90%
serving food to Osiris.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.270 align:middle line:84%
What this indicates
is that this tool had

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.520 align:middle line:90%
a completely peaceful purpose.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.910 align:middle line:84%
They're not offering
dead bodies to it.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.730 align:middle line:84%
They're not offering
dead animals to it

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.030 align:middle line:84%
like you see in other
shrines or other holy places.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.360 align:middle line:84%
They're offering
food to this device.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And it brings up a
very important point

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.060 align:middle line:84%
when we're looking at
depictions such as this.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.000 align:middle line:84%
We have to factor
in the Babylonian

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.230 align:middle line:90%
and the Egyptian concept of sin.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk about
that just briefly here.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.660 align:middle line:84%
In the Babylonian doctrine of
sin, which came from Egypt,

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.060 align:middle line:84%
they tell us that
these ancient temples,

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.890 align:middle line:84%
which featured such imagery,
were not places of worship.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.130 align:middle line:84%
They were places where
people worked for the gods.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.520 align:middle line:90%
They were workshops.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And the work that humankind did
for the gods at these temple

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.820 align:middle line:84%
workshops was we
served them food.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.550 align:middle line:84%
The catch was that
in order for humans

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.360 align:middle line:84%
to serve food to the gods,
we had to be pure beings.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.080 align:middle line:84%
The gods didn't want to
eat contaminated food.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.650 align:middle line:84%
So they took a select
group of people, priests

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.940 align:middle line:84%
and priestesses, and taught
them to become pure beings,

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.610 align:middle line:84%
pure beings capable
of serving that food,

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.850 align:middle line:84%
and then these pure beings
worked for the gods.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.930 align:middle line:84%
This work is actually
what alchemists later

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.160 align:middle line:84%
called the Great
Work, the Magnum Opus,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.500 align:middle line:84%
the process of transmuting an
impure soul into a pure soul.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.870 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't that we
literally serve them food.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.240 align:middle line:84%
It's that we worked
for the gods,

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.800 align:middle line:84%
and in working for the gods,
we became gods ourselves

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.210 align:middle line:84%
and became star
walkers with the gods.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Ina, Ezekiel, Elijah, John
the Baptist, Mary Magdalene,

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Jesus are all figures who
studied in these temple

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.370 align:middle line:84%
workshops and, in fact, became
servants of the greater god.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.490 align:middle line:90%
They became gods themselves.

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.450 align:middle line:84%
The way that gods knew that
you weren't doing the work,

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:03.220 align:middle line:84%
that you were not serving them,
was your hair turned gray.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.110 align:middle line:90%
You aged.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.450 align:middle line:84%
You weren't doing the
alchemical work that

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.330 align:middle line:90%
made you an immortal being.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:17.356 align:middle line:84%
That was the definition of
sin-- not doing the work.

00:07:17.356 --> 00:07:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And then, of
course, Christianity

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:22.510 align:middle line:84%
came along and totally
demolished this whole concept,

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.120 align:middle line:84%
blew it up beyond
all recognition.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And no longer do we
work for the gods.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:33.400 align:middle line:84%
We worship a god in a
master-to-slave relationship.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And so that is the
critical understanding

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.370 align:middle line:84%
that we have to begin to
view such imagery with.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:39.820 align:middle line:84%
When they are
serving food, these

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.730 align:middle line:84%
are beings who are,
in effect, learning

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:46.720 align:middle line:84%
to transform themselves
into gods themselves.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.790 align:middle line:84%
As we look at the
Osiris device, we

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:52.240 align:middle line:84%
can see based on the
relative size of the people

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.470 align:middle line:84%
that this device appears
to have been enormous.

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:59.770 align:middle line:84%
If these figures standing
on top of this platform

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.560 align:middle line:84%
are, say, 5 and
1/2 feet tall, it

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:07.150 align:middle line:84%
looks like this device must
have stood a good 150 feet tall.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Or they're embellishing it with
this notion that, hey, this

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.720 align:middle line:84%
is a godly device that
we're dealing with,

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.110 align:middle line:84%
this tree of life, this bond
between Heaven and Earth.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.940 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in ancient
Egypt we do see

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.750 align:middle line:84%
beings that appear to be
portrayed as giants carrying

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.890 align:middle line:84%
a device that resembles the
biblical Ark of the Covenant.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And that is, I believe,
exactly what they are toting

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.480 align:middle line:90%
in this scene right here.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And when we come back
to the Osiris device,

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.580 align:middle line:84%
we can see that this platform
as a ringer for the Biblical

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:37.659 align:middle line:90%
Ark of the Covenant.

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:40.299 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I would suggest to
you that the biblical Ark

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:44.020 align:middle line:84%
of the Covenant is derived from
the original Egyptian blueprint

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.880 align:middle line:90%
based upon this Osiris device.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And as we pull
this detail, which

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.450 align:middle line:84%
is an accurate reproduction
based on the Egyptian original,

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.420 align:middle line:84%
we see these figures
operating this device.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.400 align:middle line:84%
It looks like it
must be rotating.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.520 align:middle line:84%
It looks like they're operating
a drill bit, like they're

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.590 align:middle line:90%
drilling for oil or something.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:05.770 align:middle line:84%
We have a lord of light
with his ox or bull

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:09.250 align:middle line:84%
on a platform attached
to the device.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And we have figures
standing back to back

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.030 align:middle line:90%
at the base of the pillar.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.250 align:middle line:84%
Each of these back-to-back
figures-- one is night,

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:16.980 align:middle line:90%
one is day.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And so here is the complete
rendition of the device,

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.020 align:middle line:84%
the Ark of the Covenant
with this Shuti pillar,

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.090 align:middle line:84%
or enlightenment
pillar, attached

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:29.770 align:middle line:84%
to it that became the bond
between heaven and earth.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:33.850 align:middle line:84%
This device came
originally from Abydos.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.560 align:middle line:84%
The Abydos Temple
is located where

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.930 align:middle line:84%
it is because of this
much, much older temple

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.120 align:middle line:90%
site called the Osirion.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.550 align:middle line:84%
Researchers such as John
Anthony West and others

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:46.630 align:middle line:84%
maintain that the Osirion is
an Atlantean temple complex.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:50.710 align:middle line:84%
It existed at least
12,000 years ago.

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.740 align:middle line:84%
It may be as old
as 50,000 years.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
the Osirion temple

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.500 align:middle line:84%
is located where
it is in Egypt was

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.830 align:middle line:84%
because they located
this former temple site.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.020 align:middle line:84%
You see these massive
red granite blocks,

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.040 align:middle line:90%
a couple of hundred ton each?

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.885 align:middle line:84%
How did they move
those things around?

00:10:06.885 --> 00:10:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm standing
here to give you

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:12.350 align:middle line:84%
an idea of the relative size
of these enormous red granite

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:13.460 align:middle line:90%
blocks.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.540 align:middle line:84%
The Osirion is one of the,
if not the, most mysterious

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.630 align:middle line:90%
place I've ever visited.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:23.450 align:middle line:84%
We see this massive,
colossal architecture

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.810 align:middle line:84%
at only a couple of other places
in Egypt-- the Valley Temple

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:29.690 align:middle line:84%
beside the Sphinx in Great
Pyramid, for example.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And again, researchers, Robert
Schoch, John Anthony West,

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.050 align:middle line:84%
say these temples are
pre-flood temples,

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:38.600 align:middle line:90%
12,000 years old, if not older.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.110 align:middle line:84%
On the exterior
wall of the Osirion

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.490 align:middle line:84%
as it butts up against the
modern-day temple of Abydos,

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:48.040 align:middle line:84%
we see an amazing
scene here etched

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.500 align:middle line:84%
onto the wall that features
the Shuti or enlightenment

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.300 align:middle line:90%
pillar of Osiris.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.500 align:middle line:84%
This to me is like identifying
a corporate facility.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:00.230 align:middle line:84%
This is the mark of this
intergalactic corporation,

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:01.070 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:02.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you
leave Nashville,

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.780 align:middle line:84%
you see a Ford Motor sign in
Nashville at a car dealership.

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And you go to Detroit, you see
the same logo, you say, ah, OK,

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.230 align:middle line:90%
it's the same organization.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way I tracked
this logo right here.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:18.100 align:middle line:84%
When I see it on a temple
wall at a workshop,

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:21.590 align:middle line:84%
it says, OK, this is
the domain of those who

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:25.100 align:middle line:90%
taught the secrets of Osiris.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.850 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, when we get
inside Abydos and also

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:32.300 align:middle line:10%
at the Temple of Dendera,
we see another key example

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.840 align:middle line:10%
of this Osiris device,
where now Isis and Nephthys

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.070 align:middle line:10%
are operating it.

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:41.360 align:middle line:10%
Always the women, the divine
feminine, that operated it.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.650 align:middle line:84%
We see the ark platform
that the pillar rests on.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And now at Dendera they've
added this ship of the gods.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:52.360 align:middle line:84%
This is the ark or bark
of the millions of years

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:56.770 align:middle line:84%
that Osiris is going to
sail into eternity upon.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.750 align:middle line:84%
One of the hallmark
pieces of my research

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.060 align:middle line:84%
is to compare the shape
of the ship of Osiris

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.800 align:middle line:84%
with the way modern
science portrays

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.704 align:middle line:84%
a wormhole, an intergalactic
transportation system

00:12:07.704 --> 00:12:09.620 align:middle line:84%
that can take you from
point A in the universe

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.690 align:middle line:84%
to point B as if there's
nothing in between.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And the question is , what is a
modern depiction of a wormhole

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:20.300 align:middle line:84%
doing attached to a device the
Egyptians called the Ladder

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.820 align:middle line:84%
to Heaven, the bond
between Heaven and Earth?

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.440 align:middle line:84%
The answer that I propose is
that this device was a particle

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.520 align:middle line:84%
accelerator, a device
that modern science says

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:35.720 align:middle line:84%
would be used to open stargates
in space and wormholes.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.690 align:middle line:84%
I challenge modern science
yet to say that that's not

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:39.760 align:middle line:90%
what we're looking at.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.492 align:middle line:90%
That has to be what it is.

00:12:41.492 --> 00:12:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
modern science would

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:46.160 align:middle line:84%
dismiss that notion as crazy,
but what I would suggest

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.740 align:middle line:84%
is that, hey, those who
are interested in designing

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.530 align:middle line:84%
these wormholes of
our future had better

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:54.430 align:middle line:84%
go back and take a look at
some of this ancient imagery,

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Atlantean or not, because
it's already laid out

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:00.540 align:middle line:90%
for us in very explicit terms.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.720 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in the
Osiris myth, it was

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.410 align:middle line:84%
said he entered the
tail of a great serpent,

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.440 align:middle line:84%
was drawn through its body,
and came out through the mouth

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.690 align:middle line:90%
as if born anew.

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:15.200 align:middle line:84%
What if that serpent
is, in fact, a wormhole

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.750 align:middle line:84%
that he entered the
tail of and came out

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:21.030 align:middle line:84%
the mouth of the wormhole
on the other side?

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.370 align:middle line:84%
These happened to be Cathar
drawings from southern France

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:25.820 align:middle line:84%
A group of people
who claimed they

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.760 align:middle line:84%
were taught a secret
religion and a symbol system

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:32.796 align:middle line:84%
by Jesus and his followers that
is traced to the ancient world.

00:13:32.796 --> 00:13:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that what
we're looking at here

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:38.110 align:middle line:84%
is a Cathar depiction
of a figure emerging

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:40.960 align:middle line:90%
from the mouth of a wormhole.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle line:84%
What the Cathars
understood and what

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.510 align:middle line:84%
we're going to discuss today
is that, contrary to the way

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:50.210 align:middle line:84%
movies like "Contact" or
"Stargate" portray it,

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:53.690 align:middle line:84%
you simply would not up and walk
through one of these gateways

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:54.800 align:middle line:90%
or portals.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.390 align:middle line:84%
There was an incredible
mental, physical, spiritual,

00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:00.350 align:middle line:84%
and emotional preparation that
was undertaken preparatory

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:03.230 align:middle line:84%
to entering the gate
of the gods and going

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.150 align:middle line:90%
into the heavenly realms.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:09.680 align:middle line:84%
That is the work that we are
all intended to do in this life,

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.870 align:middle line:84%
is to affect that
transformation so

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:15.710 align:middle line:84%
that at the time of our enter
into the other world, when we

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:19.160 align:middle line:84%
see that white light,
we know how to enter it

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.750 align:middle line:84%
and how to navigate
the other realms.

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:28.280 align:middle line:84%
My research reveals that
the serpent lifted by Moses

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:32.090 align:middle line:90%
is this serpent of Osiris.

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:34.670 align:middle line:84%
What Moses was
doing was updating

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:36.890 align:middle line:90%
an ancient Egyptian technology.

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Remember Moses was
trained in all the wisdom

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:41.900 align:middle line:84%
of the Egyptians, according
to the Bible, which

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.960 align:middle line:84%
covers a lot of ground, that
statement, trained in all

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.860 align:middle line:90%
the wisdom of the Egyptians.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:51.910 align:middle line:10%
And he may even have been
bringing forward an Atlantean

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:56.620 align:middle line:10%
technology if the chronology
attached to the Osiris device

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.800 align:middle line:10%
is accurate, and
I believe it is.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:06.010 align:middle line:10%
Ishtar, the light of the world,
also operated a similar device.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:09.280 align:middle line:10%
We see Ishtar standing
beside a pillar mounted

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.600 align:middle line:10%
to a Babylonian-style ziggurat
with the serpent entering into

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.710 align:middle line:10%
or exiting from that pillar,
matching the Osiris device.

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And she has her
satellite dish up on top.

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Starts her morning out like
my mother, watches "The View,"

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:29.590 align:middle line:84%
flips over to CNN, see what's
going on around the galaxy.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is also portrayed
with a device in his hand.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:39.730 align:middle line:84%
We call it the
cross-- the cross,

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:42.370 align:middle line:90%
as in crossing spacetime.

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:48.370 align:middle line:84%
He is lifting the mouth
of Leviathan, a serpent.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:51.100 align:middle line:84%
He is doing what
Osiris did, lifting

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:55.120 align:middle line:84%
the mouth of a wormhole,
lifting the mouth

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.730 align:middle line:84%
of a portal, a
gateway that enables

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.400 align:middle line:90%
us to cross the heavens.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.190 align:middle line:84%
That's my interpretation
of this imagery.

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:06.670 align:middle line:84%
This explains why the
Gnostics in Germany

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:11.740 align:middle line:84%
portrayed Jesus on the cross
in a traditional crucifixion

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:15.520 align:middle line:84%
scene, and they also portrayed
him as the serpent wound

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.370 align:middle line:90%
around the pillar.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Christianity connects Jesus with
the serpent of wisdom of Moses.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
we have to begin

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.930 align:middle line:84%
to interpret this the
serpent imagery in light

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:32.560 align:middle line:84%
of wormhole symbolism, that
what is being taught here

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.770 align:middle line:84%
is a method of raising
our spiritual vibration

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:40.011 align:middle line:84%
preparatory to entering
the gate of the gods.

00:16:40.011 --> 00:16:41.510 align:middle line:84%
What we're talking
about, of course,

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:45.520 align:middle line:84%
is Kundalini, the
spiritual energy coiled

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.450 align:middle line:90%
at the base of our spine.

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And as it rises up
our chakras, as it

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:52.330 align:middle line:84%
brings about
spiritual awakening,

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:54.010 align:middle line:90%
in fact, enlightenment.

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:57.370 align:middle line:84%
It puts us in a state
of bliss and joy.

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:59.260 align:middle line:84%
If we're talking
about Kundalini,

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.180 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
the human body

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.690 align:middle line:84%
as a conduit between an
earthly realm and a higher

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.619 align:middle line:90%
spiritual vibration.

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
leads me to apply

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:14.829 align:middle line:84%
the human body, a meditating
woman, to the Osiris pillar.

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:18.460 align:middle line:84%
We're all probably familiar
with the chakras, and we count,

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:24.160 align:middle line:84%
one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, all good children

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.630 align:middle line:90%
go to heaven.

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:30.940 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that our body is,
in fact, the stairway to heaven.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:37.060 align:middle line:84%
So it is not at all a leap to
apply this imagery to the body.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.720 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians did not
have a word for chakra.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:44.500 align:middle line:84%
As best we can tell, they
were not aware of the chakras.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.800 align:middle line:84%
But I think that we can
still apply this imagery

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.970 align:middle line:84%
to the Osiris device and
begin to view our human body

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:55.060 align:middle line:84%
from the soul's
perspective as a ladder

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:58.570 align:middle line:84%
or stairway to heaven, with
the first three chakras

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:00.340 align:middle line:90%
being the Ark of the Covenant.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.050 align:middle line:84%
The reason why
archeologists can't

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:03.790 align:middle line:84%
find the Lost Ark
of the Covenant

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:08.170 align:middle line:84%
is because they're sitting
on it all the time.

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:10.750 align:middle line:84%
The enlightenment
pillar that's attached

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:14.080 align:middle line:84%
to the Ark of the Covenant
is our spinal cord system.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.320 align:middle line:84%
The two tablets up on top of
the pillar, which are likely

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.300 align:middle line:84%
the two tablets that
Moses brought down

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:23.620 align:middle line:84%
from Sinai on his first
trip, are the two hemispheres

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.100 align:middle line:90%
of our brain.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And what this imagery
encodes is a blueprint

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.820 align:middle line:84%
for the enlightenment
of the human body

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:34.510 align:middle line:84%
preparatory to entering
the gate of the gods.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:38.320 align:middle line:84%
What is actually activated
in these teachings

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.230 align:middle line:90%
is not necessarily flesh.

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:44.950 align:middle line:84%
What is activated, enlightened,
or made extraordinary,

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:47.020 align:middle line:84%
in fact, say
alchemists, is what they

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:51.250 align:middle line:84%
describe as a solar drop,
an indestructible drop,

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:54.940 align:middle line:84%
a seed atom within
us that is perceived

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:58.120 align:middle line:90%
as a drop of molten gold.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Here I compare a Hubble image of
a galaxy beside a human embryo

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:06.970 align:middle line:84%
and when we plug in thoughts,
"as above, so below,"

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:09.460 align:middle line:84%
"as within, so
without" law, we can

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:13.420 align:middle line:84%
see a perfect match between
the human embryo and a galaxy

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:18.910 align:middle line:84%
as seeds of potential,
as seeds of life in fact.

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:22.930 align:middle line:84%
This seed atom, this
soul drop within us,

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:27.610 align:middle line:84%
is that which persists from
incarnation to incarnation.

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:31.240 align:middle line:84%
It is the nucleus that grows
the vehicles, including

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:36.910 align:middle line:84%
this vehicle, that are
necessary for incarnation.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:42.610 align:middle line:84%
From our divine spark grows
the incorruptible star body,

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:47.380 align:middle line:84%
light body, that is the goal
of the great work, the Magnum

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Opus, which is gold-making,
taking an impure metal

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:55.330 align:middle line:84%
and turning into gold,
but it's also god-making.

00:19:55.330 --> 00:20:00.370 align:middle line:84%
That is the work that we are
intended to do in this realm,

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:04.090 align:middle line:84%
to work for the gods to
transform ourselves into,

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:05.710 align:middle line:90%
in fact, a god-like being.

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:08.879 align:middle line:84%
And by god, I'm not necessarily
meaning a dirty old white man

00:20:08.879 --> 00:20:10.420 align:middle line:84%
sitting on a throne
with a long beard

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.300 align:middle line:90%
getting ready to judge your ass.

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:16.786 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking it's an
energy, a vibration,

00:20:16.786 --> 00:20:20.410 align:middle line:84%
a higher-frequency being,
something that may be even

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:22.250 align:middle line:90%
beyond our imagination.

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:24.130 align:middle line:10%
And we certainly
need to dismiss many

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:27.130 align:middle line:10%
of these controlling and
manipulated, manipulative

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:29.240 align:middle line:10%
images that we
have of the deity,

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:33.310 align:middle line:10%
because they no longer serve us.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:38.240 align:middle line:10%
So again, this divine
drop, this solar drop,

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.380 align:middle line:10%
is the gold within
of the alchemists,

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:46.330 align:middle line:10%
but it's also the god
within, the deity within.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you've never
thought about this concept,

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:51.820 align:middle line:84%
this is a very good place
to begin to connect with it.

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Just think in terms
that this is a vehicle.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.980 align:middle line:84%
This body is a
stairway to heaven

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.310 align:middle line:84%
from the soul's perspective,
from our divine drop's

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:01.540 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to us
to try to connect

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:07.900 align:middle line:84%
with that essence that
survives from incarnation

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.005 align:middle line:90%
to incarnation.

00:21:10.005 --> 00:21:13.420 align:middle line:84%
I recently came upon an amazing
quote by Terence McKenna.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:17.430 align:middle line:84%
He says, "We are like
caterpillars contemplating

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:18.610 align:middle line:90%
pupation.

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:22.090 align:middle line:84%
No longer will I chew
on the cabbage leaves.

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:24.860 align:middle line:84%
No longer will I spend
my time moving around

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.130 align:middle line:90%
on the underside of the foliage.

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Life must be a preparation for
transition to another dimension

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:37.750 align:middle line:84%
Life must be a
preparation for transition

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:42.070 align:middle line:84%
to another dimension, and what
a great time to be alive today,

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:44.220 align:middle line:84%
where modern science,
theoretical physicists

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.810 align:middle line:84%
are telling us we live
in a universe that

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:49.890 align:middle line:90%
has at least 10 dimensions.

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:52.330 align:middle line:84%
We're understanding
parallel universes now.

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:53.890 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about wormholes.

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:57.370 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about all
these incredible concepts

00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:59.800 align:middle line:90%
that excite the soul.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this is such
an amazing time to be here.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:08.540 align:middle line:84%
We are preparing ourselves
for life in another dimension.

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:12.340 align:middle line:84%
So I want to switch gears now
with that basic understanding

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:17.890 align:middle line:84%
and move towards talking about
what I call the Rod of Jesus.

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:20.860 align:middle line:84%
To pick up where we left off,
the word "tower" in Egypt

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:23.500 align:middle line:84%
means the bond between
Heaven and Earth.

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:27.430 align:middle line:84%
It's the same meaning as the
Sumerian word "Dur.An.Ki."

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Dur.An.Ki means bond between
Heaven and Earth as well.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.910 align:middle line:10%
According to Zecharia Sitchin,
the artificially raised

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:37.270 align:middle line:10%
platform atop
Jerusalem's Mount Moriah,

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:40.120 align:middle line:10%
which is the place where
Osama bin Laden would

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:43.930 align:middle line:10%
like to find the Ark of the
Covenant, march into Jerusalem,

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:48.125 align:middle line:10%
wipe out all the Jews, and
transform us all into Muslims.

00:22:48.125 --> 00:22:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, at the same time, we
have a president of the United

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.080 align:middle line:84%
States who would like to
find the Ark of the Covenant,

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.240 align:middle line:84%
march into Jerusalem,
set up that throne,

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.870 align:middle line:84%
and wipe out all
the other infidels

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:02.290 align:middle line:90%
and make everybody a Christian.

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Coincidental that we have
these two crazy people

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:08.605 align:middle line:84%
on the planet at exactly
the same time who

00:23:08.605 --> 00:23:10.922 align:middle line:84%
are trying to wipe
everybody out so they

00:23:10.922 --> 00:23:12.880 align:middle line:84%
can find the Ark of the
Covenant, which they're

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.360 align:middle line:84%
sitting on, and
then go to Jerusalem

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.420 align:middle line:90%
and proclaim themselves God.

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.470 align:middle line:90%
Oh, come on.

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:23.890 align:middle line:84%
They forget about everything
in ancient history

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:24.980 align:middle line:90%
that goes along with this.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.100 align:middle line:10%
And that's where
we're picking up here.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:31.300 align:middle line:10%
Again, according to
Sitchin, gods, the Annunaki,

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.520 align:middle line:10%
as they were called
in ancient Samaria,

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.830 align:middle line:10%
came to Earth from the heavens.

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:40.240 align:middle line:10%
And they set up a facility
atop Mount Moriah.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.000 align:middle line:84%
It had once been the location
of a facility constructed

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.240 align:middle line:84%
by ancient beings known
as the shining ones,

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.700 align:middle line:84%
the enlightened ones, the
illumined ones, the Annunaki.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And they called this
facility the Dur.An.Ki,

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:53.560 align:middle line:84%
the bond between
Heaven and Earth.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:55.750 align:middle line:84%
Sitchin believes
that the Dur.An.Ki

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:58.880 align:middle line:90%
functioned as an antenna.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:03.310 align:middle line:84%
This is the way Masons portray
Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem.

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:06.430 align:middle line:84%
When they talk about
building the third temple

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:08.170 align:middle line:84%
in the near future,
as they're talking

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:12.760 align:middle line:84%
about in kickstarting World
War III, as is their goal,

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.980 align:middle line:84%
they often forget
that Solomon's Temple

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.820 align:middle line:84%
had this massive
tower in front of it,

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:22.720 align:middle line:84%
this massive tower that was
built at the time of Jesus.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:27.880 align:middle line:84%
It stands around 180
feet tall, this tower.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.220 align:middle line:84%
I find it very
remarkable that that

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.950 align:middle line:84%
happens to match almost
precisely the height

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:35.030 align:middle line:90%
the pillar of Osiris.

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And what I wonder
is if it's possible

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.870 align:middle line:84%
that this Dur.An.Ki, this
bond between Heaven and Earth,

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:43.740 align:middle line:84%
was brought to Earth
by these shining ones

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:47.200 align:middle line:84%
and originally placed
atop Mount Moriah,

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.170 align:middle line:84%
today the site of Solomon's
Temple in Jerusalem.

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:53.890 align:middle line:84%
It so happens that this tower
in front of Solomon's Temple

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:58.880 align:middle line:84%
matches the same height and
it's also lined with gold.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.520 align:middle line:84%
It's either a
conductor of some kind,

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.700 align:middle line:84%
because gold is known
as a superconductor,

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:08.030 align:middle line:84%
or that tower is
meant as a sleeve

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:11.190 align:middle line:84%
to hide something that
is concealed within.

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:15.020 align:middle line:84%
I actually think that tower
functioned for both purposes.

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:19.790 align:middle line:84%
It was designed as this bond
between Heaven and Earth.

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:22.572 align:middle line:84%
And when we see Jesus
in typical depictions

00:25:22.572 --> 00:25:24.530 align:middle line:84%
at the Temple of Solomon--
well, wait a minute.

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:26.155 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever seen
a depiction of Jesus

00:25:26.155 --> 00:25:27.740 align:middle line:90%
at the Temple of Solomon?

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:28.910 align:middle line:90%
I haven't.

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:32.420 align:middle line:84%
That's his natural habitat
during his lifetime,

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:37.760 align:middle line:84%
but you never see depictions of
Jesus operating in the temple.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:42.890 align:middle line:84%
If you did, you would see this
massive, honking tower standing

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:43.940 align:middle line:90%
in front of it.

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.898 align:middle line:84%
And then from the time
you're in Sunday school,

00:25:45.898 --> 00:25:48.170 align:middle line:90%
you'd be going, what's that?

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:50.210 align:middle line:90%
What's that tower?

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:54.900 align:middle line:84%
Very important piece of history
that just isn't talk about.

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's not talked about
because I think people

00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:00.020 align:middle line:90%
don't understand what it is.

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:02.000 align:middle line:10%
Students of
Judeo-Christianity prophecy

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.630 align:middle line:10%
claim that when Jeshua
returns at the end time,

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:09.200 align:middle line:10%
he will set up his throne
in Jerusalem once again.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.360 align:middle line:10%
And again, this is Osama
bin Laden's whole gig.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.340 align:middle line:90%
He believes he's the Mahdi.

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.680 align:middle line:10%
He's the Islamic
messiah who's going

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.890 align:middle line:10%
to work with Jesus the prophet,
according to the Quran,

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:21.770 align:middle line:10%
and wipe out all the infidels
and then march into Jerusalem

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:25.730 align:middle line:10%
and build this thing again.

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:29.270 align:middle line:10%
At this time, it's thought
that the prophet Elijah will

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:33.980 align:middle line:10%
return the rod, a branch
from the tree of life,

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:35.090 align:middle line:10%
to the Messiah.

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:37.700 align:middle line:84%
So not only are they looking
for the Ark of the Covenant,

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.040 align:middle line:84%
if they know what
they're doing, which

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:42.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm not convinced
they do, they're also

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:46.730 align:middle line:84%
looking for the rod of the
Messiah, the branch that

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.650 align:middle line:84%
grew on the tree of
life, which I think

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:51.650 align:middle line:90%
of as sort of a remote control.

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:56.030 align:middle line:84%
If the Osiris device is the
tree of life, then the branch,

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:59.540 align:middle line:84%
I think, is sort of like
my remote control here.

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:02.090 align:middle line:84%
It can operate the
device, and it might even

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:04.430 align:middle line:84%
have some of the similar
capabilities of it.

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:05.870 align:middle line:90%
Think of an iPod.

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:08.300 align:middle line:84%
An iPod, you can watch
a movie on an iPod.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Or you can hook it up to
your computer and download

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.400 align:middle line:90%
movies or music or whatever.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.640 align:middle line:84%
It has similar functions
on a smaller scale.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I think this
rod of the Messiah actually is.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.910 align:middle line:84%
This is a fourth century
Coptic Christian depiction

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:28.130 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus with his rod
and his ring, his two

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:30.470 align:middle line:84%
key pieces of technology
that were then

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:32.900 align:middle line:90%
taken out of his hands.

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And he's just simply
shown waving his hand,

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.680 align:middle line:90%
performing his miracles.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.740 align:middle line:84%
But in example after example
of early Christian art,

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:44.090 align:middle line:84%
he had this rod and
ring in his hand.

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:46.790 align:middle line:84%
It's funny to me that
there are two forms

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:53.570 align:middle line:84%
of particle accelerators that
we build today-- rods and rings.

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:56.780 align:middle line:84%
So here's a
second-century depiction

00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.710 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus from the
Vatican museum of Rome,

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:03.290 align:middle line:90%
raising Lazarus from the dead.

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:04.400 align:middle line:90%
What do we note?

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:09.350 align:middle line:84%
First of all, short
hair, no beard,

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:14.210 align:middle line:84%
raising Lazarus with a Harry
Potter wand in his hand,

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:16.572 align:middle line:84%
Mary Magdalene
anointing his feet.

00:28:16.572 --> 00:28:19.110 align:middle line:90%


00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Rome, 150 AD--
earliest witnesses,

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:25.910 align:middle line:84%
they who were around at
about the same time as Jesus,

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:29.120 align:middle line:84%
made this depiction--
short hair, no beard,

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:33.230 align:middle line:84%
raising Lazarus with
a magic wand, a rod.

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:37.640 align:middle line:84%
150 AD, Rome-- short
hair, no beard,

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.830 align:middle line:84%
raising Lazarus
with a rod or wand.

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.350 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with these people?

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:44.150 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing wrong
with these people.

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:48.980 align:middle line:84%
I think they knew exactly what
was utilized in these miracles.

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Jesus transmuting
the loaves of bread,

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.390 align:middle line:84%
multiplying the
loaves of bread--

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:58.820 align:middle line:84%
short, curly hair; no
beard; Harry Potter wand.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Same thing here-- over and over
again in the first depictions

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:07.170 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus, he is portrayed
in exactly the same way.

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:10.970 align:middle line:84%
These are either copycat
images or they're

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:14.150 align:middle line:84%
providing a revelation of the
original Christian teaching.

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:16.670 align:middle line:10%
Jesus, Mary Magdalene,
the wedding at Cana,

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:19.270 align:middle line:10%
probably their wedding,
because the dude

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:22.640 align:middle line:10%
that is getting married is the
dude that provides the wine.

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.770 align:middle line:10%
So when Mary says,
hey Jesus, your guests

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:27.260 align:middle line:10%
are out of wine, bingo.

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:31.430 align:middle line:84%
What that's saying to
researchers is he's the groom.

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:32.990 align:middle line:90%
Mary Magdalene is the bride.

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.790 align:middle line:90%
And here they are.

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:34.748 align:middle line:90%
And so what does he do?

00:29:34.748 --> 00:29:37.100 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, let's
go get that wand.

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:39.980 align:middle line:84%
We gotta turn water into
wine for our guests.

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And so here is Jesus with
his Harry Potter wand

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:47.240 align:middle line:84%
with six water pots
plus a seventh.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:51.350 align:middle line:84%
Those are symbolic of our
energy bodies, of our chakras.

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:55.520 align:middle line:84%
The water turned into wine
is the water of our body.

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.850 align:middle line:84%
The wine is the
heavenly substance

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:01.300 align:middle line:90%
in all ancient traditions.

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:04.700 align:middle line:84%
What he is teaching people
to do at his wedding at Cana

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:08.060 align:middle line:84%
is transform themselves
into beings of light.

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:14.480 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do with taking
H2O and turning it into vino.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:18.130 align:middle line:84%
That's just something
we've got to get a hold of.

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:19.800 align:middle line:90%
