00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.460 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>>After the church councils in
400 AD, Jesus grows a beard.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.750 align:middle line:90%
He grows long hair.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.850 align:middle line:90%
They take his wand away.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.250 align:middle line:90%
What just happened?

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.290 align:middle line:84%
Did he pull a John Lennon, going
from clean-shaven, cherubic

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Beatle to long-haired,
bearded messiah, solo artist?

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Or are these two
different people?

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Did they take out the original
Jesus and put in an imposter?

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.500 align:middle line:84%
That sounds extreme,
but some people

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.700 align:middle line:84%
believe that's
exactly what happened.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Because it's after this
time that you no longer

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.800 align:middle line:90%
work for the gods.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.430 align:middle line:90%
You worship a God.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.040 align:middle line:90%
Oops.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Fact of the matter is,
we can trace this imagery

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.790 align:middle line:90%
to its source.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.230 align:middle line:90%
This imagery comes from Egypt.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.030 align:middle line:84%
On the left, Jesus raising
Lazarus; on the right,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.350 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptian god of
divine magic Thoth

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.230 align:middle line:84%
with his key of
life and caduceus

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.660 align:middle line:90%
wand in hand raising Osiris.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Lazarus, Osiris; Osiris,
Lazarus-- pretty much

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.610 align:middle line:90%
the same name, isn't it?

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.700 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly
the same depiction.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.905 align:middle line:90%
Where does it come from?

00:01:21.905 --> 00:01:23.520 align:middle line:90%
Abydos.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.440 align:middle line:90%
What else was housed at Abydos?

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.240 align:middle line:90%
The Osiris device.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.540 align:middle line:84%
I believe we're dealing
with the remote control

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.960 align:middle line:90%
to the Osiris device.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And what Jesus was
doing was updating

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.270 align:middle line:84%
the teaching of Thoth, the
Egyptian god of divine magic.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.140 align:middle line:84%
This is very uncomfortable for
some people to contemplate,

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.040 align:middle line:84%
because Jesus was supposed
to be an original.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.550 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.720 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't original,
not by any stretch.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.770 align:middle line:84%
What was original was the story
that emerged after 400 AD.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.010 align:middle line:84%
What we're to go do,
though, is to hit the books

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.220 align:middle line:84%
and find out where
this stuff came from.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.210 align:middle line:90%
And this is where it came from.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.630 align:middle line:84%
I believe that these
figures are interchangeable.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.820 align:middle line:84%
The scenes are telling
exactly the same story.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.380 align:middle line:84%
What's been omitted
is the technology.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.930 align:middle line:90%
Why is it omitted?

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't have a planet
full of Christ-like beings

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.180 align:middle line:90%
running around.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.210 align:middle line:84%
They don't pay taxes, and
they're totally unmanageable.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.190 align:middle line:84%
So the Church tells
you there's one

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.600 align:middle line:84%
guy at the top of the
pyramid, and, honey, you

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.590 align:middle line:90%
can't get there.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.190 align:middle line:84%
So just proclaim a
belief in this figure,

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.650 align:middle line:84%
and you're going
to be just fine.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.520 align:middle line:84%
But the Gnostics, those who
sought to find this knowledge

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.250 align:middle line:84%
to transmute themselves
into these pure beings,

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.010 align:middle line:84%
had a whole other agenda
and a whole other take.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.830 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we identify Thoth's
wand as the caduceus wand,

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.132 align:middle line:90%
the rod of transformation.

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:47.340 align:middle line:90%
It's what we're dealing with.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.340 align:middle line:84%
It's also the rod of Hermes,
who is portrayed here

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.930 align:middle line:84%
in this Greek depiction, Hermes
being the Greek name for Thoth,

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.470 align:middle line:84%
with his rod, releasing souls
from their vessel, the vessel

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.330 align:middle line:90%
being the human body.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.910 align:middle line:10%
So I think that this is a
classic depiction of Jesus

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.530 align:middle line:10%
with his rod and
his ring, and that's

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.750 align:middle line:10%
what we're all looking
for, is the secrets

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.660 align:middle line:10%
of that rod, which assuredly is
within us, and so is that ring.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.660 align:middle line:10%
Messianic prophecy says that
the Messiah will seat himself

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.050 align:middle line:10%
on the mercy seat in the Holy
of Holies of Mount Moriah.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.760 align:middle line:84%
This is a favorite
photograph I took

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.570 align:middle line:84%
in front of Notre
Dame Cathedral that

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.850 align:middle line:84%
shows an enlightened person,
probably Mary, sitting

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.490 align:middle line:84%
on the throne with the ladder
or stairway to heaven running up

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.870 align:middle line:84%
her body and with
a book in hand,

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.460 align:middle line:84%
kind of an
androgynous-looking figure.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.260 align:middle line:90%
It could be Mary.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.480 align:middle line:90%
It could also be Jesus.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.280 align:middle line:84%
But this is the place
where we all want to be,

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.030 align:middle line:84%
sitting on the throne with our
stairway to heaven activated,

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.970 align:middle line:84%
our scepter in hand, our rod in
hand, and our book of wisdom.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.940 align:middle line:10%
As I said, just as a branch
from the tree of life

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.620 align:middle line:10%
was kept before the Ark,
the Ark of the Covenant,

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.300 align:middle line:10%
this messianic figure
will set the rod of light

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.470 align:middle line:10%
before himself on the throne
of God, where the tree of life

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.690 align:middle line:10%
had grown in the Garden of Eden.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.720 align:middle line:10%
That's the prophecy
surrounding this.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.550 align:middle line:84%
I believe the Garden of
Eden could be a place.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.930 align:middle line:84%
But chances are,
if this device is

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.880 align:middle line:84%
an antenna, what we're
beginning to believe,

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.290 align:middle line:84%
or what I'm
beginning to surmise,

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.520 align:middle line:84%
is that it brought a healing
frequency to this realm.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.260 align:middle line:84%
It bathed the gods in a
frequency or key of life

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.200 align:middle line:84%
that activated latent
capabilities within themselves,

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.240 align:middle line:90%
as well as within human DNA.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you can get in the
presence of this device

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.310 align:middle line:84%
as it's radiating
this energy, we're

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.730 align:middle line:84%
talking about activation going
on in a major, major way.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.850 align:middle line:84%
So I believe the Garden
of Eden was a place,

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:57.410 align:middle line:84%
but it was also a frequency,
a vibration, a ring.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.849 align:middle line:84%
This is the ring that
accompanies the rod.

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:02.640 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm talking
about the rod and ring,

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about a
rod, and I'm talking

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:84%
about a frequency,
or a vibration,

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.720 align:middle line:84%
that this rod emits,
one that activates us,

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.650 align:middle line:84%
accelerates us, in fact,
may even enlighten us.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.217 align:middle line:84%
This is the Secret
Seal of Solomon.

00:05:20.217 --> 00:05:21.800 align:middle line:10%
It's important for
us to look at this,

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.630 align:middle line:10%
because we are talking about the
rebuilding of Solomon's Temple.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.880 align:middle line:10%
The Secret Seal of Solomon,
well known to magicians.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.140 align:middle line:10%
Solomon, we're
told, gained by it

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.030 align:middle line:10%
the love of all manner of
persons and overcame in battle,

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.900 align:middle line:10%
for neither weapons nor fire
nor water could hurt him.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Wow-- that's an
incredible technology.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.670 align:middle line:84%
You instantly have
the love of all people

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.180 align:middle line:84%
and you're impervious
your enemies' weapons?

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.130 align:middle line:90%
How do you get that?

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.730 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to know.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:57.810 align:middle line:84%
It held the secret
to wonderful things,

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.490 align:middle line:90%
this Secret Seal of Solomon.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.810 align:middle line:10%
This seal was placed
on the Vessel of Brass

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.940 align:middle line:10%
in front of the temple.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.760 align:middle line:10%
The seal was placed
on the Vessel of Brass

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.730 align:middle line:10%
in front of the temple.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:16.170 align:middle line:10%
Solomon used this seal
to bind up spirits.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.207 align:middle line:90%
I see dead people, right?

00:06:18.207 --> 00:06:19.520 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.360 align:middle line:90%
Solomon said, I've got a seal.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.170 align:middle line:90%
I'll fix their ass.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.970 align:middle line:90%
Here.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.470 align:middle line:90%
Fwhoom!

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.475 align:middle line:84%
And he seals them
with this secret seal.

00:06:28.475 --> 00:06:31.790 align:middle line:90%


00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:37.910 align:middle line:84%
Essentially what the Seal of
Solomon is is a rod and a ring.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.520 align:middle line:84%
So what we see is the Seal
of Solomon on the left,

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.380 align:middle line:84%
and on the right is
a simple line drawing

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:48.170 align:middle line:84%
of a rod with a
circle, or a ring.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And that is what the
Seal of Solomon is.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:57.320 align:middle line:84%
It's our rod and ring again
that produced wonderful things,

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.750 align:middle line:84%
made Solomon a loving
being that made him

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.820 align:middle line:90%
impervious to enemies' weapons.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.990 align:middle line:84%
What I noted is that the
Secret Seal of Solomon, the rod

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and ring, is a virtual match
for this rod with a ring of 50

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.810 align:middle line:90%
stone pillars in a circle.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.970 align:middle line:84%
You all see the similarity
between these two diagrams?

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.050 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.750 align:middle line:84%
Because the diagram on the left
is the Secret Seal of Solomon.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.530 align:middle line:84%
The diagram on the right is a
place in Nashville, Tennessee,

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:33.600 align:middle line:84%
called the Bicentennial
Capitol Mall.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.360 align:middle line:90%
It is a rod in a ring.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Does it produce
wonderful things?

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.490 align:middle line:90%
I think it does.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we're going
to end up this afternoon.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm going to be doing
throughout our talk today

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.710 align:middle line:84%
is comparing these
images and talking

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.600 align:middle line:84%
about why this rod
and ring in Nashville

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.090 align:middle line:84%
may, in fact, be
the Seal of Solomon

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:01.120 align:middle line:84%
and the rod and ring of
the Messiah, as we call it.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.960 align:middle line:90%
I call this place Stargate Park.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.100 align:middle line:84%
This rod and ring sits in
front of our state capitol

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.560 align:middle line:84%
in downtown Nashville, which
sits atop an artificially

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.840 align:middle line:90%
tiered mound.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.290 align:middle line:90%
It's located on a sacred site.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.070 align:middle line:90%
Why is it sacred?

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Because there's an
inscription here

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.540 align:middle line:84%
that tells us that this
was once a sacred burial

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:31.220 align:middle line:84%
ground where vast numbers
of bodies had been interred.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.179 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know what you think
when someone tells you there's

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:36.929 align:middle line:84%
vast numbers of
bodies interred here,

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:41.020 align:middle line:84%
but it sounds like a lot of
people to me-- thousands,

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.640 align:middle line:90%
maybe more.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.650 align:middle line:90%
Again, we see dead people.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Is it merely
coincidence that this

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.850 align:middle line:90%
matches the Seal of Solomon?

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And one of the purposes or
uses of the Seal of Solomon

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.540 align:middle line:90%
was to seal spirits.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.010 align:middle line:90%
Are there spirits sealed here?

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.850 align:middle line:84%
I can't say for sure, but
there are musicians here

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:06.420 align:middle line:84%
in Nashville that think
Nashville is Music City, USA,

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.310 align:middle line:84%
because ancient Indian
spirits are communicating

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:11.870 align:middle line:84%
through the 39,000
professional songwriters that

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:13.900 align:middle line:90%
make Nashville their home.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:17.100 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to talk about
this as we continue and compare

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.770 align:middle line:84%
this rod and ring of Nashville
and its role as a sacred center

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:24.096 align:middle line:90%
going back thousands of years.

00:09:24.096 --> 00:09:25.720 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in the
Tennessee State Museum,

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.310 align:middle line:84%
we see this painting
of the local Indians

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:29.880 align:middle line:90%
who once dwelt here.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.820 align:middle line:84%
They call them the
Stone Grave Race.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.460 align:middle line:90%
There are other names for them.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.910 align:middle line:84%
They built a
ceremonial mound right

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.980 align:middle line:84%
near the present side of
the bicentennial mall.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.060 align:middle line:84%
You can't call it a
pyramid, even though that's

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.672 align:middle line:84%
what it is, because
"pyramid" sounds Egyptian,

00:09:45.672 --> 00:09:47.630 align:middle line:84%
and everybody knows there
was no one in America

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.380 align:middle line:90%
before Columbus got here.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:56.370 align:middle line:84%
So you have to call it a mound
to satisfy the archeologists.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And so here is a
photograph, then,

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.790 align:middle line:84%
from the top of the Bicentennial
Mall complex looking

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.600 align:middle line:90%
towards the state capitol.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that the thing
is artificially tiered, sort of

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.760 align:middle line:90%
like a pyramid.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.580 align:middle line:84%
At the apex is the
ring, called the Court

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.070 align:middle line:84%
of Three Stars,
which we're going

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:19.570 align:middle line:90%
to discuss in detail later.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Photographs of the pillars
that ring the Court of Three

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Stars-- these actually
have bells in them.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:31.480 align:middle line:84%
So this circle literally does
ring every hour on the hour.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.400 align:middle line:84%
It plays the "Tennessee Waltz,"
the "Essene Waltz," I call it,

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.420 align:middle line:84%
because Tennessee is the word
"Eessennet" spelled backwards.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:46.210 align:middle line:84%
So this is actually a
rod and a ring together.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:47.930 align:middle line:84%
Very strange how it's
all come together.

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:52.770 align:middle line:84%
This is the pillars that
ring at Karnak in Egypt.

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is the Bicentennial
Mall at night from the Court

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:59.270 align:middle line:84%
of Three Stars looking towards
the capitol in a photograph

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.740 align:middle line:84%
by a friend, John
Partipilo, who is

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.510 align:middle line:84%
a photographer for the
"Tennessean," the local paper.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.330 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm suggesting
to you is that there's

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.200 align:middle line:84%
a tremendous similarity
between the rod

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.240 align:middle line:84%
and ring of the Bicentennial
Mall in Nashville

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.690 align:middle line:84%
and the rod and ring
carried by Jesus

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:17.320 align:middle line:84%
in this fourth-century
Coptic depiction of them.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.680 align:middle line:84%
Notice his rod
actually culminates

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.000 align:middle line:84%
in three lobes, which
correspond with the three

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.310 align:middle line:90%
stars of the rod in Nashville.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.490 align:middle line:84%
His ring in his hand, if
you take it and put it

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:30.160 align:middle line:84%
around the three stars,
that's what that is.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.924 align:middle line:84%
They correspond in a very
interesting and powerful way.

00:11:33.924 --> 00:11:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Actually, what we're
going to be looking

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:37.390 align:middle line:84%
at in the second part
of our talk today

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:39.690 align:middle line:84%
is the correspondence
between the rod and ring

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.840 align:middle line:84%
of the Bicentennial Capitol
Mall and Fludd's depiction

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.120 align:middle line:90%
of the perfect human.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Because, in fact, the mall is
a model of our chakra system.

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.120 align:middle line:84%
Each of the seven
chakras are perfectly

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.842 align:middle line:84%
marked with appropriate
symbolism, all by chance.

00:11:54.842 --> 00:11:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about what
I mean by that later.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.470 align:middle line:90%
Why Nashville?

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:05.260 align:middle line:84%
Why is this complex
in Nashville?

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:09.460 align:middle line:10%
Well, I often refer people
to JJ Hurtak's book "The Keys

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.880 align:middle line:10%
of Enoch."

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.430 align:middle line:10%
In it, a book
channeled by Hurtak

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:20.500 align:middle line:10%
in the '70s through Enoch, he
talks about 12 sacred sites

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.980 align:middle line:10%
that ring the planet, sort
of like a sacred necklace,

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.060 align:middle line:10%
a pearl necklace of sacred
sites of the goddess.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.560 align:middle line:84%
The center point of it is the
Great Pyramid complex in Giza.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.380 align:middle line:84%
He isolates regions
in southern France

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.050 align:middle line:84%
in the center of
the Atlantic, where

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:37.180 align:middle line:84%
people think
Atlantis was located;

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.670 align:middle line:84%
in Mongolia; the
Philippines; Hawaii;

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Vancouver, British Columbia;
Oak Island, Nova Scotia.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And Hurtak, or Enoch, says there
will be two new enlightenment

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:50.320 align:middle line:84%
centers at the time of The
Awakening, or Activation,

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.120 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.730 align:middle line:84%
One will be located in the
Four Corners area of the US.

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:57.460 align:middle line:84%
The other is in the
Southeastern quadrant of the US,

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.630 align:middle line:84%
running on a corridor
from Lexington, Kentucky,

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.960 align:middle line:90%
to Nashville, Tennessee.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:02.760 align:middle line:90%
Wait.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Did someone say Nashville,
Tennessee, is going

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:08.070 align:middle line:90%
to be an enlightenment center?

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:11.400 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's one
possible explanation

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.600 align:middle line:90%
for why this is happening here.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And again, we're going to go
into Nashville in detail later,

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:20.500 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see some things
that don't make sense going on

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:24.240 align:middle line:84%
in this city unless there's
a higher mind operating

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.480 align:middle line:84%
through the architecture and the
other activities going on here.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.670 align:middle line:84%
By the way, Graham
Hancock and Robert Bauval

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:33.750 align:middle line:90%
wrote a book called "Talisman."

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about how
secret societies use

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:39.680 align:middle line:84%
the architecture of
cities around the world

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.870 align:middle line:90%
to transmit knowledge.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:middle line:84%
They cite Paris
and Washington, DC,

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:48.060 align:middle line:84%
as two key examples of
cities that are utilized

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.400 align:middle line:90%
by these secret societies.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.310 align:middle line:90%
London is another one.

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.260 align:middle line:84%
They said a tip-off
that you're dealing

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.900 align:middle line:84%
with one of these Hermetic
cities, as they're called,

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.570 align:middle line:84%
or cities where the secret
societies are operative,

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.160 align:middle line:84%
is look for Hermes in a
prominent place in the city.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're here at
Union Station Hotel,

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:11.356 align:middle line:84%
and flying high above
this hotel is Hermes.

00:14:11.356 --> 00:14:15.250 align:middle line:84%
That tells me Nashville is
one of these Hermetic cities.

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to put a Gibson
Les Paul guitar in his hand

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:20.120 align:middle line:84%
here and let him
rip and let him know

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.346 align:middle line:84%
what the real business
that goes on here is.

00:14:23.346 --> 00:14:24.970 align:middle line:84%
So I want to shift
gears now, and we're

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:28.310 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about a concept
called The Instructor-- The

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:29.460 align:middle line:90%
Instructor.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:33.560 align:middle line:84%
According to the Quran, "Osiris"
is the Arabic pronunciation

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:37.420 align:middle line:84%
for Idris, a prophet who
was known as The Instructor.

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:41.889 align:middle line:84%
And Idris is known as the
son of Cain, or Enoch.

00:14:41.889 --> 00:14:43.430 align:middle line:84%
So again, in the
keys of Enoch, we're

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:47.350 align:middle line:84%
talking about a city
of Enoch, or "Enosh,"

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:50.400 align:middle line:84%
to pronounce Enoch with a
soft C-H instead of a hard,

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.850 align:middle line:90%
like "Noshville."

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:57.160 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about a
place of instruction.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
Nashville is, and that

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:03.790 align:middle line:84%
is what Osiris was as
well, was the instructor.

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:05.600 align:middle line:84%
So as we're looking
at the Osiris device,

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.450 align:middle line:84%
we're actually
looking at a device

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:10.750 align:middle line:90%
that provides instruction.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:17.070 align:middle line:84%
Osiris is portrayed as a device
and also in a human form.

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:20.350 align:middle line:84%
You always identify Osiris
because he's got a green face.

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.940 align:middle line:90%
He's the original green man.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And you can also identify Osiris
because, as the instructor,

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:31.070 align:middle line:84%
he's also holding his
green wand, or rod.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Here is Osiris with his
green face and his green rod,

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.240 align:middle line:90%
or wand, in his hand.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.830 align:middle line:90%
It's called the Ouas Scepter.

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:43.440 align:middle line:10%
And it's commonly called the
Key of the Nile-- the Key

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.050 align:middle line:10%
of the Nile.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.680 align:middle line:10%
It's placed in the hands
of all the Netters,

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:52.350 align:middle line:10%
or all the gods of Egypt, and
it pertains to the living branch

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:56.810 align:middle line:10%
conducting the vivifying
sap, the nourishing sap,

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:58.940 align:middle line:10%
the [? highly ?] of
the philosophers,

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:03.110 align:middle line:10%
the word of the Christians,
says Schwaller de Lubicz.

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:05.850 align:middle line:10%
So this rod or staff
that he has in his hand

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:08.010 align:middle line:10%
is a branch from
the tree of life

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:11.650 align:middle line:10%
that is a conductor of this
spiritual substance called

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.490 align:middle line:10%
"the word," like, "In the
beginning, was the word,"

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:19.250 align:middle line:10%
the life-force energy upon
which the world is built. Again,

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:23.390 align:middle line:10%
it is a living branch
from the tree of life,

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:26.980 align:middle line:10%
always portrayed as
green, by the way.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.010 align:middle line:84%
We see Akhenaten
with the key of life,

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:34.380 align:middle line:84%
conducting streams of water,
which also symbolize this life

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.220 align:middle line:90%
force energy.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.270 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned, the
Ouas Scepter is commonly

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:41.600 align:middle line:90%
called the Key of the Nile.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's a key
piece of information.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:48.070 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians subscribe to
Thoth's law, "as above, so

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.380 align:middle line:90%
below; as within, so without."

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:54.070 align:middle line:84%
When we're talking
about the Nile in Egypt,

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:57.890 align:middle line:84%
we're not just talking
about the earthly river that

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.760 align:middle line:90%
runs through Egypt, the Nile.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.420 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the
heavenly Nile, the river

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.890 align:middle line:90%
of life, the Milky Way.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:09.359 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is that this
staff, or rod, in their hand

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:12.310 align:middle line:84%
somehow conducted
this substance that

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:16.349 align:middle line:90%
originates in the Milky Way.

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:19.940 align:middle line:10%
In my DVD "Egypt,
Shadow of Atlantis,"

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:22.510 align:middle line:10%
I gave a talk on Egyptian
stargate metaphysics

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.329 align:middle line:10%
and the Dimension
of the Blessed.

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:27.800 align:middle line:10%
And I show this Egyptian
princess aboard her craft,

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:32.220 align:middle line:10%
sailing along the Nile.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Again, she's probably not
sailing on the earthly Nile.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:39.550 align:middle line:84%
She's sailing on the waters
of the heavenly Nile.

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:43.190 align:middle line:10%
She's prepared herself
to ride this craft, which

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:48.340 align:middle line:10%
looks like a wormhole,
into eternity upon the Nile

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.620 align:middle line:10%
in the heavens.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:53.260 align:middle line:10%
This rod conducted
the vivifying sap,

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:54.990 align:middle line:10%
the nourishing sap,
the [? highly ?]

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:57.940 align:middle line:10%
of the philosophers, the
word of the Christians that

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.345 align:middle line:10%
originates in our galaxy.

00:18:00.345 --> 00:18:03.380 align:middle line:90%


00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.370 align:middle line:84%
In "Stargate 2012,"
I talked about how

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.610 align:middle line:84%
I researched the
Maya and their belief

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:09.940 align:middle line:84%
that in 2012, we're
going to see the return

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:12.800 align:middle line:90%
of this sap substance.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And as I like to
say, I consulted

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:17.530 align:middle line:90%
god, or a form of God, Google.

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And I typed in "cosmic
sap." "What is cosmic sap?"

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.870 align:middle line:84%
The first entry
talks about the Maya

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.490 align:middle line:84%
and their belief in this
Itz, or this substance

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:28.110 align:middle line:90%
called cosmic sap.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:middle line:84%
Then we come down a few lines,
and it says "high energy

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.740 align:middle line:90%
cosmic phenomena."

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.000 align:middle line:10%
Oh, OK, what we're
talking about with sap,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.680 align:middle line:10%
what that stands for
is Sub-Atomic Particle.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:45.040 align:middle line:10%
What these ancients had, maybe
even at the time of Atlantis,

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:50.060 align:middle line:10%
was an ability to conduct
subatomic particles,

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.200 align:middle line:10%
to conduct cosmic rays.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.090 align:middle line:84%
I go into this in my
book. "The Illuminator,"

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:57.460 align:middle line:84%
and talk about how
Mary Magdalene was

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.680 align:middle line:90%
harnessing cosmic rays.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is what she actually
utilized to make the anointing

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.260 align:middle line:84%
oil that she used
to anoint Jesus that

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.610 align:middle line:90%
proclaimed him the Christos.

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm excited, because
there's a number of authors

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.860 align:middle line:84%
now that, beginning
this fall in 2006,

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.410 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see a whole
trail of books talking

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:19.310 align:middle line:84%
about the ancients and their
understanding of cosmic rays.

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:22.950 align:middle line:10%
And so that's something
to really look forward to,

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.940 align:middle line:10%
because what it all points
to me is that we are

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.520 align:middle line:10%
on a threshold of awakening.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:33.530 align:middle line:84%
We are beginning to understand
that, hey, I'm a star traveler.

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.530 align:middle line:84%
I didn't originate
on this planet.

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:40.570 align:middle line:84%
I might have come from any of
the other 450 billion galaxies

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:45.460 align:middle line:84%
that inhabit the known universe,
which comprises about 10%

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:48.010 align:middle line:84%
of what we think is
actually out there.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:49.840 align:middle line:90%
Think about that for a second.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:54.120 align:middle line:84%
I came from out there, and
I am presently inhabiting

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.040 align:middle line:90%
this vehicle right here.

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.380 align:middle line:90%
I am a stargate traveler.

00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.630 align:middle line:90%
How do I know that?

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm in a human body, and
we now know, at least according

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:07.000 align:middle line:84%
to William Henry,
that the human body

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.510 align:middle line:84%
is, in fact, a
stairway to heaven.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:13.190 align:middle line:84%
That's the value of
being in this body.

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And so to the extent that we
learn how to operate that,

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.750 align:middle line:84%
we are on this place
of awakening right now.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:21.960 align:middle line:84%
We can see in the
very big, and we

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.030 align:middle line:84%
can see through our
electron microscopes

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:27.140 align:middle line:84%
into the very tiniest
level of reality.

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.030 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
quantum physics now.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:33.880 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about 10 and
11 dimensions, possibly more.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:37.320 align:middle line:84%
We stand at that
threshold of awakening

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:41.260 align:middle line:84%
with the above above us and the
below below us as a conduit,

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.040 align:middle line:90%
as a conductor.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And what a phenomenal
time to be alive

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.790 align:middle line:84%
and to be investigating
these mysteries.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:53.150 align:middle line:84%
"Messianic consciousness,"
awakened consciousness,

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:56.680 align:middle line:84%
what we're striving
for, "is not something

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.290 align:middle line:90%
that comes in the future.

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:01.640 align:middle line:90%
It is our intrinsic nature.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And don't let any moron standing
in a pulpit tell you otherwise.

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.300 align:middle line:90%
It is our intrinsic nature.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:14.290 align:middle line:84%
It is our birthright available
to all of us here and now"

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:16.010 align:middle line:90%
for the asking.

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:17.670 align:middle line:84%
"Although obscured
over the millennia

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:20.820 align:middle line:84%
by clouds of
ignorance"-- and we won't

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.700 align:middle line:84%
go into who are the
priests of ignorance.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.390 align:middle line:90%
You all know who they are.

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:30.240 align:middle line:84%
"Its light continues to
shine in the divine sparks

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.620 align:middle line:90%
at the core of our being."

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Rabbi David Cooper in a
book called "God is a Verb."

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Could not have said
it better myself.

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:41.440 align:middle line:84%
"Messianic consciousness
is not something

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.670 align:middle line:90%
that comes in the future.

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.450 align:middle line:90%
It is our intrinsic nature."

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:47.400 align:middle line:84%
It ought to be written
above every courthouse

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.870 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:50.570 align:middle line:90%
This is law number one.

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:55.280 align:middle line:84%
It is our birthright, available
to all of us here and now.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And no Patriot Act,
no Homeland Security,

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:02.070 align:middle line:84%
no idiot living in a
cave in Afghanistan

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:05.810 align:middle line:84%
can take this away from
us, as much as they try.

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:07.580 align:middle line:84%
"Although obscured
over the millennia

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.650 align:middle line:84%
by clouds of
ignorance, its light

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:11.810 align:middle line:84%
continues to shine
in the divine sparks

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:13.150 align:middle line:90%
at the core of our being."

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:14.860 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have
to connect with it.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.670 align:middle line:84%
They can try and
control my body.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:20.820 align:middle line:84%
I am no longer a
passenger on an airliner.

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.820 align:middle line:90%
I am a prisoner.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:25.540 align:middle line:90%
I know that because I fly a lot.

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And from the second I
arrive at the airport,

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:31.920 align:middle line:90%
I am the prisoner of the TSA.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.290 align:middle line:84%
If I step a little bit to
the left or a little bit

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:38.280 align:middle line:90%
to the right, I'm in jail.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.440 align:middle line:90%
I am considered a terrorist.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.560 align:middle line:84%
But I would respond
to them that I'm not

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.010 align:middle line:90%
part of your war on terror.

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:51.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm part of the battle for tara,
compassion and enlightenment,

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:54.130 align:middle line:84%
and the rise of
messianic consciousness

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:56.490 align:middle line:84%
on this planet,
Christ consciousness,

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:58.340 align:middle line:90%
if you want to call it that.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:00.110 align:middle line:84%
When you hear the
politicians, especially

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:01.520 align:middle line:84%
those with a
Southern accent, say

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:06.960 align:middle line:84%
we're winning the war
on "tara," I'm thinking,

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:11.170 align:middle line:84%
you are winning the war against
compassion and enlightenment?

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Oh, no, no, we don't
want to support that.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:16.240 align:middle line:90%
This is our natural habitat.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:21.330 align:middle line:84%
This garden of galaxies,
which represents the farthest

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:23.280 align:middle line:84%
distance our Hubble
Space telescope can see,

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.420 align:middle line:90%
is our natural habitat.

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.555 align:middle line:84%
And we have to begin to connect
ourselves with these realms.

00:23:28.555 --> 00:23:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
going to enable

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:31.882 align:middle line:90%
the flip on the earthly realm.

00:23:31.882 --> 00:23:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise,
we're just going

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:35.340 align:middle line:84%
to keep tightening this
knot that we've got

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.420 align:middle line:90%
going on this planet right now.

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And all that's going to lead
to is ultimate destruction.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:46.870 align:middle line:10%
In Egypt, Osiris was
overlaid upon the earth--

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:47.810 align:middle line:10%
interesting concept.

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:51.390 align:middle line:10%
He was Egypt.

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:56.820 align:middle line:10%
His companion, Isis,
was the star Sirius.

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:59.500 align:middle line:10%
Her light renewed
Osiris each year

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.800 align:middle line:10%
with the flooding of the Nile.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.910 align:middle line:10%
Sirius' annual appearance
just before dawn

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:07.211 align:middle line:10%
at the summer solstice heralded
the coming rise of the Nile.

00:24:07.211 --> 00:24:08.710 align:middle line:84%
What we're beginning
to understand--

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:10.350 align:middle line:84%
and there's a really
wonderful book

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:12.170 align:middle line:84%
called "The Lost Star
of Myth and Time"

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:15.240 align:middle line:84%
by Walter Cruttenden that
explains this in detail--

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.170 align:middle line:84%
is that it looks like
Sirius is actually

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:21.669 align:middle line:84%
our binary star,
our companion star.

00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:23.710 align:middle line:84%
What the ancient Egyptians
appeared to have known

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:28.300 align:middle line:84%
is that there are, as Walter
Cruttenden describes it,

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:32.420 align:middle line:84%
an electromagnetic field
that comes from Sirius.

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Together, our
binary star rotates

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.350 align:middle line:84%
around another grand
center as well that's

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:42.140 align:middle line:84%
constantly feeding,
bathing us in this energy.

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:45.840 align:middle line:84%
At certain times, we
enter into that field.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.090 align:middle line:90%
These produced golden ages.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:50.890 align:middle line:10%
At other times, we're
away from that field,

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:53.350 align:middle line:10%
and we need a
technology in order

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:57.460 align:middle line:10%
to reach up and grab a hold of
that bathing or enlightening

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.710 align:middle line:10%
energy.

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:01.394 align:middle line:10%
And this happened once
a year around January 1

00:25:01.394 --> 00:25:03.560 align:middle line:10%
in Egypt when the Earth and
Sun are at their closest

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.480 align:middle line:10%
point of contact, and
the Earth's meridian

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.480 align:middle line:10%
was pointed toward Sirius.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:11.320 align:middle line:84%
It's like our planet's
meridian pointed directly

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:16.320 align:middle line:84%
to the source of
renewing energy.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is cited as evidence
that our solar system

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:24.160 align:middle line:84%
is, in fact, moving
towards our companion star.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Ptah is an ancient Egyptian
god who is directly

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:29.310 align:middle line:90%
connected with Sirius.

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:31.160 align:middle line:84%
Some researchers,
like Stephen Mehler,

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:35.020 align:middle line:84%
who upholds the indigenous
tradition of ancient Egypt,

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:39.700 align:middle line:84%
tells us that Ptah
actually came from Sirius.

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.262 align:middle line:10%
I find it fascinating to
look at Ptah's business card.

00:25:42.262 --> 00:25:44.220 align:middle line:10%
It says he's the architect
of heaven and earth;

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.930 align:middle line:10%
the master craftsman
in working metals;

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:49.640 align:middle line:10%
sculptor, designer, and
fashioner of the bodies of men.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:53.980 align:middle line:10%
He was a blacksmith, sculptor,
and mason of the gods.

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:55.790 align:middle line:84%
What we note in
his hieroglyph is

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:59.320 align:middle line:84%
that he appears to have a
double helix in his hieroglyph.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.330 align:middle line:84%
Egyptologists think
that's ridiculous.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:05.580 align:middle line:84%
They say what that is is
simply string or flax.

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Oh, come on-- you've
got to be kidding me.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.730 align:middle line:84%
If it looks like a duck
and walks like a duck

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:14.220 align:middle line:84%
and the guy is the fashioner
of the bodies of men,

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:17.700 align:middle line:84%
then why can't that
be a double helix?

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, because the ancients
didn't have that knowledge.

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Only we have that
knowledge today.

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:25.470 align:middle line:90%
Wrong.

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:28.990 align:middle line:84%
I think that there is
a direct connection

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:31.700 align:middle line:84%
between these
high-energy cosmic rays,

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:35.840 align:middle line:84%
this electromagnetic field of
Sirius that activates latent

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.260 align:middle line:90%
capabilities within our DNA.

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And gods such as Ptah were
responsible for creating

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:47.270 align:middle line:84%
the body and depositing these
instructions, this code,

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:50.010 align:middle line:84%
within our DNA, so
that when we encounter,

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:53.500 align:middle line:84%
for example, the Osiris device
or other rods and rings,

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:57.810 align:middle line:84%
it activates this latent
capability within our DNA,

00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:01.570 align:middle line:84%
enables us to transform
ourselves into Ptah, or Osiris,

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:04.670 align:middle line:90%
as Ptah is portrayed here.

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:10.050 align:middle line:84%
Isis, or Sirius, is actually
identified as the soul of Isis.

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:12.810 align:middle line:84%
In fact, an inscription at the
Temple of Hathor at Dendera

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:16.930 align:middle line:84%
reads, "Her Majesty Isis shines
into the temple on New Year's

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Day, and she mingles
her light with that

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:22.170 align:middle line:90%
of her father on the horizon.

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:25.010 align:middle line:84%
It is on this day that
Sirius bathes the courtyard

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:27.100 align:middle line:90%
of the temple with its light."

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And what do we find at the
temple of Hathor at Dendera?

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:32.340 align:middle line:10%
Well, in the crypt we see what
appeared to be cathode ray

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:38.460 align:middle line:10%
tubes, light bulbs, evidence
of advanced technology,

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:40.470 align:middle line:10%
featuring the TET
pillar, or power pillar,

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:43.550 align:middle line:10%
we saw in the
hieroglyph of Osiris,

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:48.330 align:middle line:10%
often cited as evidence of an
advanced pre-flood civilization

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:50.480 align:middle line:10%
that understood the
same things we do today.

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:54.280 align:middle line:84%
A cathode ray tube, that's
what we call a television.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.116 align:middle line:90%
That's our computer screen.

00:27:56.116 --> 00:27:57.490 align:middle line:84%
So when people
say, well, there's

00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:59.590 align:middle line:84%
no evidence in the ancient
world of Coke bottles,

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:02.287 align:middle line:84%
they didn't leave any
Pepsi cans around,

00:28:02.287 --> 00:28:03.370 align:middle line:90%
well, they didn't have to.

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:05.650 align:middle line:84%
They left us something
even more extraordinary

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:07.770 align:middle line:84%
than that that suggests
they, in fact, had

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:09.820 align:middle line:90%
this ancient technology.
