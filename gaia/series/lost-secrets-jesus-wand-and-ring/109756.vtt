00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>>I want to talk now about
the Holy Grail in Nashville.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.330 align:middle line:84%
Our link to the Holy
Grail in Nashville

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.275 align:middle line:84%
is FDR, shown here on the right
with his two-term secretary

00:00:21.275 --> 00:00:25.400 align:middle line:84%
of agriculture culture and
third-term VP Henry A. Wallace.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.530 align:middle line:84%
Most Americans don't know that
in 1934 FDR and Henry Wallace

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.770 align:middle line:90%
engaged in a Holy Grail quest.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.820 align:middle line:10%
The third person in this
trio of archetypal wise men

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.760 align:middle line:10%
was Nicholas Roerich, a
world-famous Russian mystic

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.450 align:middle line:10%
and guru who had spent
the 1920s following

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.530 align:middle line:10%
Jesus' alleged
trail from Palestine

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.670 align:middle line:10%
through Iran-Iraq all the way
through Afghanistan, Pakistan,

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.880 align:middle line:10%
India.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.780 align:middle line:10%
Wait, that sounds like the
evening news or something--

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.592 align:middle line:10%
Iran, Iraq, Pakistan.

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:04.580 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, all these places-- very
interesting and very loaded

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.290 align:middle line:84%
with ancient mysteries that
are still yet to be solved.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.700 align:middle line:84%
But Roerich had spent the '20s--
he said, hey, where did Jesus

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.670 align:middle line:90%
spend those missing 18 years?

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Hit the books and found
out, oh, he went to India.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.900 align:middle line:90%
Oh, he went to Tibet.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.350 align:middle line:90%
Oh, he went to Mongolia.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And so he followed
this trail and claimed

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.720 align:middle line:84%
that he trained in the same
monasteries where he heard all

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.490 align:middle line:84%
the stories about Issa, as Jesus
was called in Central Asia--

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Saint Issa-- read the books,
even brought some evidence

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.500 align:middle line:84%
home, claimed he entered
Shambhala, the immortal realm

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.760 align:middle line:90%
of the gods.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And then he came back to
America in the late 1920s

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.030 align:middle line:84%
and convinced FDR
and Henry Wallace

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.730 align:middle line:84%
that if they sent
him back to Mongolia

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.360 align:middle line:84%
that he would return with
the secrets of the Holy Grail

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.050 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even evidence
of the reincarnated Jesus.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.790 align:middle line:84%
This is a painting
by Roerich's son

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.000 align:middle line:84%
showing him holding
this casket, which

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.370 align:middle line:84%
comes up in a very important
way for us here in moment.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And the casket holds
the stone, which

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.759 align:middle line:84%
is another term for
the Holy Grail itself.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.680 align:middle line:84%
The grail is considered to be
a cup, a bloodline, a stone,

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.144 align:middle line:90%
and also, in my view, a tone.

00:02:20.144 --> 00:02:21.560 align:middle line:84%
This is one of
Roerich's paintings

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.870 align:middle line:84%
here of Saint Issa before
the dead head of God.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.730 align:middle line:84%
We know what he is
actually standing

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.280 align:middle line:84%
in front of is not a
decapitated cranium of a person.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.320 align:middle line:84%
The dead head is the
symbol for the cosmic axis,

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.620 align:middle line:84%
for the ladder or
stairway to heaven.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And when I see
paintings like this

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.640 align:middle line:84%
and put it together the
other pieces of the puzzles

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.190 align:middle line:84%
that Roerich provided,
it suggests to me

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.120 align:middle line:84%
that what Issa was looking
for in Central Asia

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.870 align:middle line:84%
were these secrets of the ladder
to heaven, of the stairway

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.240 align:middle line:84%
to heaven, or even you
might even think of it

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.330 align:middle line:90%
as the stargate of the gods.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.700 align:middle line:84%
We know that after the
cataclysm, or perhaps even

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.440 align:middle line:84%
before the cataclysm
of Atlantis,

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.470 align:middle line:84%
there were repositories
of ancient knowledge.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:14.360 align:middle line:84%
Egypt is often cited-- Tibet,
the Himalayas, Mongolia, Peru

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.900 align:middle line:84%
are often cited as places
where the Atlantean priests had

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.210 align:middle line:84%
taken and stored knowledge of
the Atlantean civilization.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And it suggests to many that
what Issa was looking for,

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.860 align:middle line:84%
what Jesus was looking
for in this trek,

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.010 align:middle line:90%
was ancient, ancient knowledge.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Roerich symbolized
the stone, the object

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.740 align:middle line:84%
of his quest in this grail
quest, by three circles

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.190 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.980 align:middle line:84%
Story is told that only an
immortal being can enter

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.172 align:middle line:90%
Shambhala and come back out.

00:03:45.172 --> 00:03:46.130 align:middle line:90%
So what did Roerich do?

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.930 align:middle line:84%
He sent his pony in. [LAUGHING]
And the pony came back out.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And so Roerich painted the
pony with the three circles

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.350 align:middle line:84%
that represent the
ultimate grail secrets

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.170 align:middle line:90%
in a flame on his pony's back.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.350 align:middle line:84%
So the three circles,
that's a trinity symbol.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.650 align:middle line:84%
The flames, that's
frequency and vibration.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.450 align:middle line:84%
What was it that
Roerich actually

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.410 align:middle line:90%
retrieved from Shambhala?

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, he painted the
Magdalene holding

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:22.190 align:middle line:84%
this same symbol on a silk
or a linen type of banner.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.460 align:middle line:84%
He called this symbol, the
three circles within a larger

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.130 align:middle line:90%
circle, the banner of peace.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And he had hoped that
this banner of peace

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.700 align:middle line:84%
would fly over all cultural
centers during World War I

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.420 align:middle line:84%
and also during World War
II-- the Roerich Peace Pact,

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.940 align:middle line:90%
as it came to be known.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.730 align:middle line:10%
We should also note that
these three orbs in a circle

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.330 align:middle line:10%
are the three golden apples that
rested at the top of the tree,

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.870 align:middle line:10%
a metaphor for the spine
and the cosmic axis

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.570 align:middle line:10%
in the Greek myth of the
Garden of the Hesperides.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.900 align:middle line:10%
It was guarded by a dragon, and
the tree and the three apples

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.240 align:middle line:10%
were known as Ladon.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.660 align:middle line:10%
After slaying Ladon, Hercules
took the three apples,

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.670 align:middle line:10%
and like Prometheus, he
stole the fire from heaven.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.820 align:middle line:10%
And it was Prometheus who told
him how to find the apples.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.160 align:middle line:10%
So when we're looking
at three circles here,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.670 align:middle line:10%
these are the same as the
Golden Apples of the Hesperides,

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.170 align:middle line:10%
the symbol of fire stolen from
heaven, of tremendous power,

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.910 align:middle line:10%
in fact, god-like power.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.890 align:middle line:90%
It looks like Mr. Bill--

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:26.700 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.260 align:middle line:84%
--but actually what that is
also called to the alchemists

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.500 align:middle line:90%
is the dead head.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.450 align:middle line:84%
This is the dead head
symbol to the alchemists,

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.510 align:middle line:84%
the symbol of their
craft, the symbol

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.390 align:middle line:84%
of the ultimate
power of the gods,

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:47.030 align:middle line:84%
maybe even going back to
Enki and Ptah in Egypt.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And so we see the dead
head and the three circles

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.150 align:middle line:84%
within a circle are
interchangeable symbols.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is the Apples
of the Hesperides,

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.300 align:middle line:84%
the fruit of the gods,
that we're looking at here.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.050 align:middle line:10%
It's interesting that the
Druids use three feathers,

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.440 align:middle line:10%
or three rods or rays of light,
signifying the eyes of light,

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.240 align:middle line:10%
or the radiating
light of intelligence.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe
that when we see

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.490 align:middle line:84%
that, when we see
the three circles,

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.496 align:middle line:84%
that these could actually
be the tips of rays.

00:06:20.496 --> 00:06:21.620 align:middle line:90%
You follow what I'm saying?

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.400 align:middle line:10%
So if a ray is coming
down, three of them

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.210 align:middle line:10%
together, this would be what
they looked like from the tips.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.160 align:middle line:10%
But this is what they would
look like from a side view, OK?

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And so it appears that the
Druids picked up this symbolism

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.590 align:middle line:84%
and used it as three
rods or rays of light.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.680 align:middle line:10%
This is important because
at Chartres Cathedral,

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.610 align:middle line:10%
Mary with Jesus on her
lap sitting on the throne

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.640 align:middle line:10%
is portrayed with these
three rods or rays

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.040 align:middle line:10%
or what are called chords.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have no idea what these
three blue rays or chords are,

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.990 align:middle line:84%
but here in Nashville, if you've
got three chords and the truth,

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.573 align:middle line:84%
you've got what's
called a hit song.

00:06:59.573 --> 00:07:01.510 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.860 align:middle line:84%
So maybe there's some kind
of frequency, musical,

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.260 align:middle line:84%
or vibratory component
to these three rays.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Here we see Mary's
head is encircled

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.540 align:middle line:84%
by a blue halo bordered
with blue pearls,

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.020 align:middle line:84%
as they're described, and
topped by a rich crown

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.350 align:middle line:84%
with the blue stone
in the center.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.320 align:middle line:84%
I believe those blue pearls
are also blue apples, which

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.040 align:middle line:90%
are other-dimensional apples.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.820 align:middle line:10%
They don't exist in the,
quote unquote, "real world."

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.780 align:middle line:10%
They exist in the
other-dimensional world.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Above her we see
the three blue rays

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.060 align:middle line:84%
pour from the beak of a
dove of the Holy Spirit

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.308 align:middle line:90%
and end at Mary's halo.

00:07:39.308 --> 00:07:40.840 align:middle line:10%
The reason I'm
going into this is

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.330 align:middle line:10%
because these three rays or
three rods or three chords

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.790 align:middle line:10%
then show up in this painting,
"The Madonna of the Book"

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:51.520 align:middle line:10%
by Botticelli, where again
we see Mary and Jesus.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.970 align:middle line:84%
But as we look closely, we
see that Jesus has in his hand

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:01.860 align:middle line:84%
a golden ring and three
small golden spears.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.310 align:middle line:84%
According to Margaret Starbird,
these three small golden spears

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.560 align:middle line:84%
may be thought to
represent the nails he

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.110 align:middle line:84%
was to suffer on the
cross, but more probably,

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.810 align:middle line:84%
she says, they are
the esoteric symbol

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:15.130 align:middle line:84%
for the triple shafts
of enlightenment,

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:18.880 align:middle line:84%
a popular motif of medieval
alchemists and Rosicrucians.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
I think they are,

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.670 align:middle line:84%
the triple shafts of
enlightenment-- the three rods,

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.500 align:middle line:84%
the three rays,
the three circles

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.040 align:middle line:90%
that go inside the golden ring.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:34.049 align:middle line:84%
These are the three rods and
the ring together once again.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:36.809 align:middle line:90%


00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:39.539 align:middle line:84%
This is a photograph taken
of the Roerich expedition

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:43.799 align:middle line:84%
when he was sent to Mongolia in
1934 by FDR and Henry Wallace.

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:46.510 align:middle line:84%
He was given a letter
of introduction by FDR.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.410 align:middle line:84%
He flew the American
flag everywhere

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:51.280 align:middle line:84%
he set up his camp,
because he believed

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.970 align:middle line:84%
he was an agent of the
United States government.

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm convinced he
found something.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.080 align:middle line:84%
We don't know for
sure what it was.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.469 align:middle line:84%
National security, all
that business comes in.

00:09:04.469 --> 00:09:06.010 align:middle line:84%
But I'm convinced
he found something.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And one of the pieces of
circumstantial evidence

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.660 align:middle line:84%
that I cite is this
symbol here on the right.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.820 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever seen that before?

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.980 align:middle line:10%
The all-seeing eye-- it's on
the back of the dollar bill.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.170 align:middle line:84%
This symbol was designed in
1776 under the watchful eye

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.680 align:middle line:84%
of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas
Jefferson, and John Adams.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.530 align:middle line:84%
It's the logo for the
American enterprise.

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:31.900 align:middle line:84%
Like corporations
have a logo, this

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:35.260 align:middle line:84%
is America's corporate
logo, in effect.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And while it was designed in
1776, it was never really used.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.870 align:middle line:84%
You ask a Mason what
that symbol represents,

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.730 align:middle line:84%
though, they'll tell you that's
the all-seeing eye of Christ

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.780 align:middle line:84%
returning to the pyramid
of human civilization.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.540 align:middle line:84%
Christ is referred to as
the missing cornerstone,

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.190 align:middle line:84%
or capstone, the
one that isn't there

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:57.490 align:middle line:84%
but which will return
to human civilization.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And here it is on the
back of the dollar bill.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:06.930 align:middle line:84%
Beside it is the simple logo for
Meru, the center of Shambhala,

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:11.371 align:middle line:84%
where Roerich went looking for
the secrets of the Holy Grail.

00:10:11.371 --> 00:10:15.680 align:middle line:84%
They are symbolically
identical symbols.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.040 align:middle line:84%
How did that symbol get placed
on the back of the dollar bill?

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, it happened
in March of 1935,

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.890 align:middle line:84%
when at the request of Nicholas
Roerich and Henry A. Wallace,

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:29.220 align:middle line:84%
FDR ordered that simple stamped
on the back of the dollar bill.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And what that suggests to me
is that Roerich found something

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:35.970 align:middle line:90%
in Mongolia.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And when they put that symbol
on the back of the dollar bill,

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.450 align:middle line:84%
it symbolized the
return of Christ

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.950 align:middle line:84%
to this realm, not as a person
but as a body of knowledge,

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.620 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, or as an energy
or a vibration or something

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:52.370 align:middle line:84%
capable of bringing that
vibration into this realm.

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.890 align:middle line:84%
To me, putting that symbol on
the back of the dollar bill

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.610 align:middle line:84%
is very important,
because when we

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:03.080 align:middle line:84%
carry around a $1
bill in our pocket,

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.110 align:middle line:84%
it connects us with
these mysteries.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:10.910 align:middle line:84%
This is not just
a piece of paper.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.700 align:middle line:90%
This is called a magical sigil.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you've got one
of these in your pocket,

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:20.010 align:middle line:84%
you are part of this enterprise,
whether you realize it or not.

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Our subconscious mind
absorbs these symbols,

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:26.090 align:middle line:84%
and at some level, it may or
may not understand what it is,

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:31.240 align:middle line:84%
but this connects us
energetically to this project.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.390 align:middle line:84%
This is why the Information
Awareness Office also

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.505 align:middle line:84%
uses the all-seeing
eye logo now, too.

00:11:35.505 --> 00:11:39.590 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a dark
use of this logo.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:42.980 align:middle line:84%
So what we've got here is
something very profound.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.710 align:middle line:84%
It's the possibility
that this symbol

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.890 align:middle line:84%
on the back of the dollar
bill to unify America

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:52.380 align:middle line:84%
but also to sort of run a
flag up a pole to those in the

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.520 align:middle line:84%
know that America
is open for business

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.090 align:middle line:84%
as far as the fulfillment of the
return of the Christ or Messiah

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:01.730 align:middle line:90%
is concerned.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:03.510 align:middle line:84%
So they found
something in Mongolia.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:06.000 align:middle line:84%
We're not positive
about what it is.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.820 align:middle line:90%
We don't have direct evidence.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:12.090 align:middle line:84%
But what we do have
is a stack of letters

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:14.690 align:middle line:84%
written by Henry Wallace
to Nicholas Roerich

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:16.850 align:middle line:84%
during the course
of this expedition.

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And these letters indicate to
me that Nashville, Tennessee,

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:23.690 align:middle line:84%
is one of the places where
they're going to return

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.820 align:middle line:90%
the secrets of the Grail.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.750 align:middle line:90%
This is one of those letters.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:31.740 align:middle line:90%
Its date is March 12, 1933.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:35.090 align:middle line:84%
The opening salutation
says, Dear Guru.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:37.970 align:middle line:84%
This is because
Wallace and Roerich had

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:40.430 align:middle line:90%
a guru-disciple relationship.

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:42.030 align:middle line:90%
Wallace was the student.

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:45.890 align:middle line:84%
Roerich was the
master, of the teacher.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Wallace signs the letter,
"May peace, joy, and fire

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:50.090 align:middle line:90%
attend you always.

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:52.465 align:middle line:90%
G."

00:12:52.465 --> 00:12:55.640 align:middle line:84%
G is short for
Galahad, the nickname

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.150 align:middle line:84%
that Nicholas Roerich's wife
Helena had given to Roerich.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Galahad is the last night of
the roundtable to find the Grail

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:04.550 align:middle line:90%
and to see Christ.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:07.970 align:middle line:84%
So right off the bat, we have
two key pieces of information.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:11.760 align:middle line:84%
One, Roerich and Wallace have
a guru-disciple relationship,

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.430 align:middle line:84%
and Wallace, the Secretary of
the Department of Agriculture

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:20.490 align:middle line:84%
and third-term VP,
thinks he's Sir Galahad.

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:23.660 align:middle line:84%
He thinks he's on a Grail
quest, because he is.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And he is playing
the role of Galahad

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:32.355 align:middle line:84%
and Wallace is FDR's
hand-picked successor.

00:13:32.355 --> 00:13:33.920 align:middle line:84%
In the first paragraph
in the letter,

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.030 align:middle line:84%
he says, I have been thinking of
you holding the casket-- well,

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:41.840 align:middle line:84%
we saw a painting of Roerich
holding a casket a moment ago--

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.460 align:middle line:84%
the sacred, most
precious casket,

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.051 align:middle line:84%
and I have thought of the
new country going forth

00:13:46.051 --> 00:13:48.300 align:middle line:84%
to meet the seven stars under
the sign of three stars,

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.890 align:middle line:84%
and I have thought of the
admonition, await the stone.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:54.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, historians
read this letter,

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:58.460 align:middle line:84%
and it just goes,
whoosh-- all of us.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:02.390 align:middle line:84%
They have no idea as
we look down here who

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:05.660 align:middle line:84%
the successor of Buddha is
and the lightning flashes

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.640 align:middle line:90%
and the breaking of the new day.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.220 align:middle line:84%
What the hell are
you talking about?

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is because
traditional historians

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.910 align:middle line:84%
like Pulitzer Prize
winners Arthur Schlesinger,

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:16.640 align:middle line:84%
who have analyzed
these letters, don't

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.530 align:middle line:90%
have any occult background.

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:20.260 align:middle line:84%
They have no esoteric
understanding.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.810 align:middle line:84%
They don't know that the new
day is called aurora consurgens

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:24.710 align:middle line:90%
by the alchemists.

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:29.720 align:middle line:84%
It's the mystical dawning
of a new, enlightened age.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Nor do they recognize
that the new country

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:35.330 align:middle line:84%
is America, which
prophetically is called the New

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis based on the novel "The
New Atlantis" by Sir Francis

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Bacon, which became the
guiding light, the inspiration

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.110 align:middle line:90%
of the founding fathers.

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And so it's America
that is going forth

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.760 align:middle line:84%
to meet the seven stars under
the sign of the three stars.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And he says, "I have thought
of the admonition await

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:54.510 align:middle line:90%
the stone."

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:56.250 align:middle line:90%
That's so easy for us.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:58.850 align:middle line:84%
We know that the
stone is another name

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:02.730 align:middle line:84%
for the Grail, the Grail stone
with the alchemical secrets

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:05.600 align:middle line:84%
written upon it, just like the
emerald tablet of Hermes that

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.240 align:middle line:84%
had the secrets of
transmutation written upon it.

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.810 align:middle line:84%
So Wallace is clearly
saying to Roerich, hey,

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:15.520 align:middle line:84%
we're waiting the Grail
in the new country.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And he says this
specific place, at least

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:20.580 align:middle line:84%
I interpret it as a
place, where the seven

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:23.340 align:middle line:84%
stars are found under the
sign of the three stars.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.570 align:middle line:90%
Where is that?

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Where in America do
you find seven stars

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.860 align:middle line:90%
under the sign of three stars?

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:36.047 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I did is I started
with my almanac of state flags.

00:15:36.047 --> 00:15:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you look into the
almanac of state flags,

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:40.980 align:middle line:84%
you find that there's only
one flag in the union that

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.210 align:middle line:90%
has three stars on it.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Most state flags
don't even have stars.

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:46.770 align:middle line:90%
They have animals or symbols.

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:50.030 align:middle line:84%
The only state flag in the
union that has only three stars

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:52.920 align:middle line:84%
is the flag of the state
of Tennessee, which is

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.440 align:middle line:90%
three stars inside of a circle.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.230 align:middle line:84%
So I began to wonder,
is it possible

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:01.140 align:middle line:84%
that Wallace is
talking about Tennessee

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.480 align:middle line:84%
as the location where
they're going to return

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.550 align:middle line:90%
the secrets of the Grail?

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:08.070 align:middle line:84%
The flag of the
state of Tennessee

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:13.350 align:middle line:84%
is a perfect match for the
three orbs inside of a circle,

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:14.790 align:middle line:90%
symbolically interchangeable.

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:17.430 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if that's
why he chose that.

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:19.680 align:middle line:84%
In early Christian
symbolism, we find

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:25.590 align:middle line:84%
three stars in a circle
with three fish added-- hm.

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.870 align:middle line:84%
This says "Christ"
right up here.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:30.540 align:middle line:84%
So what we're learning here
from early Christian symbolism

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:34.530 align:middle line:84%
is that three stars inside
of a circle with three fish

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:37.860 align:middle line:90%
is the symbol for Christ.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's intriguing, because
we find the exact same symbol

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:45.990 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Egypt with the eye of
light, or the circle of light,

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:49.170 align:middle line:84%
the symbol of enlightenment,
in the center, three

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:50.910 align:middle line:90%
fish inside a circle.

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:53.910 align:middle line:90%


00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Actually, three
stars in a circle

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:57.810 align:middle line:84%
is only one level
of interpretation

00:16:57.810 --> 00:16:59.790 align:middle line:84%
of the flag of the
state of Tennessee.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:01.920 align:middle line:84%
It's what your
conscious mind sees.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.849 align:middle line:84%
What your subconscious mind does
is it looks into the background

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:08.760 align:middle line:84%
here, and it sees this
symbol, which today

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:12.240 align:middle line:90%
is the logo for Mitsubishi.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.380 align:middle line:84%
This is three fish swimming
away from one another,

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.200 align:middle line:90%
is what symbolists tell us.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.810 align:middle line:84%
Can you all, by the
way, pull this symbol

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:24.119 align:middle line:84%
out of the blue area
here in the flag

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:27.510 align:middle line:90%
and the state of Tennessee?

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Relax your gaze,
and you're going

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.570 align:middle line:84%
to see that in the
center of the three stars

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:38.460 align:middle line:84%
is a second logo, which
is this symbol right here.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:41.850 align:middle line:84%
What this symbol is right
here is a Nordic symbol,

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:46.980 align:middle line:84%
read Aryan equals Atlantean
symbol for divine power

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.720 align:middle line:90%
and protection.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.380 align:middle line:84%
So actually, the flag of
the state of Tennessee

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:58.530 align:middle line:84%
is a symbol of divine
power and protection.

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:03.100 align:middle line:84%
All three of these symbols
are interchangeable.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:07.200 align:middle line:10%
They tell the same story, that
this place, or this symbol,

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.926 align:middle line:10%
identifies a location of
divine power and protection.

00:18:10.926 --> 00:18:14.370 align:middle line:90%


00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:16.540 align:middle line:10%
This takes us back to the
rod and ring of Jesus,

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:20.880 align:middle line:10%
which has the rod topped by
the three orbs with the ring

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.450 align:middle line:10%
beside it.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:26.760 align:middle line:84%
So I'm operating on the
premise that the three stars

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.070 align:middle line:84%
that Wallace references
in his letter

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:31.080 align:middle line:90%
is the state of Tennessee.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And so then the question
becomes, where in Tennessee

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:36.690 align:middle line:84%
do you find seven stars
under the sign of the three

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:38.850 align:middle line:90%
stars, the flag of the state?

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, now I'm looking at
star legends and star lore.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And you find out that there's
two groups of seven stars that

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.479 align:middle line:84%
appear over and over again
in myth and scripture.

00:18:49.479 --> 00:18:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And both of them have
significant Tennessee

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:52.770 align:middle line:90%
connections.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:56.280 align:middle line:84%
The first group of seven
stars is the Pleiades.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And when you go over
to East Tennessee,

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.590 align:middle line:84%
you're introduced to Cherokee
Indian creation mythology,

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:03.570 align:middle line:84%
documented or released
for the first time

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:07.530 align:middle line:84%
by Dhyani Ywahoo in her book,
"Voices of our Ancestors."

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:10.680 align:middle line:84%
After we landed a man
on the moon in 1969,

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.800 align:middle line:84%
she was given permission
to publish Cherokee

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.780 align:middle line:90%
Indian creation mythology.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And what that mythology says
is that the Cherokee believe

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:21.900 align:middle line:84%
that they were created
by beings of light who

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.950 align:middle line:84%
came from the Pleiades who rode
a sound wave through a hole

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:30.450 align:middle line:84%
in space over East Tennessee
and created the Cherokee,

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:33.420 align:middle line:84%
as one of 12 tribes
whose assignment was

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:37.740 align:middle line:84%
to guard or protect one
of the 12 vortexes spread

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.740 align:middle line:90%
around this planet.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.300 align:middle line:84%
That's Cherokee Indian
creation mythology.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.100 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thinking,
well, is Wallace

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.770 align:middle line:90%
referencing East Tennessee?

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:48.540 align:middle line:84%
If so, that would
be very interesting,

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.520 align:middle line:84%
because after General
Leslie Groves built

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.880 align:middle line:84%
the Pentagon, the world's
largest building, for FDR,

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.390 align:middle line:84%
he came to East
Tennessee to Oak Ridge

00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:00.120 align:middle line:84%
and built a mysterious,
or mystery village,

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:04.260 align:middle line:84%
of 75,000 people, where they
did important, secret work

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.920 align:middle line:84%
for the Manhattan Project,
building the A-bomb.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Why did General Leslie
Groves pick East Tennessee?

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, he said he liked something
about the geology of the area.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.350 align:middle line:90%
Like what?

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:22.560 align:middle line:84%
So that's a possibility, that
the seven stars under the three

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.530 align:middle line:84%
stars is the seven stars of the
Pleiades under East Tennessee

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:27.360 align:middle line:90%
in the state of Tennessee.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:32.426 align:middle line:84%
The other group of seven stars
is Ursa Major-- Ursa Major.

00:20:32.426 --> 00:20:35.620 align:middle line:90%


00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:38.800 align:middle line:90%
We call it the Big Dipper.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.400 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what
it's always been called.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.960 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient past, it's
been called the Chariot

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:48.800 align:middle line:90%
of Arthur, the wagon of Arthur.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.740 align:middle line:84%
It's been called the
casket of Osiris.

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:53.540 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wait a minute.

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:56.270 align:middle line:90%


00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Wallace talked about a casket,
a sacred casket, in his letter

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.170 align:middle line:90%
to Roerich.

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Is he talking about the casket
of Osiris, Ursa Major, the Big

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.540 align:middle line:90%
Dipper?

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.230 align:middle line:90%
Ursa Major is also called Meru.

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:09.260 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wait a minute.

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:13.120 align:middle line:84%
There's that Meru or Mer
vibration all over again,

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Meru being the name of
the Capitol of Atlantis.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.790 align:middle line:84%
But when you dig
down to the deepest

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:21.800 align:middle line:84%
level of star legends
and star lore,

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.620 align:middle line:84%
you find out that the Arabs
who named the constellations

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:28.390 align:middle line:90%
called Ursa Major "Nash."

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And what Nash meant was the
Great Casket, the Sacred

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.857 align:middle line:90%
Coffin.

00:21:34.857 --> 00:21:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's at that
time that I learned

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:40.490 align:middle line:84%
that Nashville, Tennessee,
was a giant Indian burial

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:44.510 align:middle line:84%
ground, where vast numbers
of bodies had been interred.

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:47.110 align:middle line:10%
So I began to wonder,
is it possible

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:50.840 align:middle line:10%
that Nashville, Tennessee,
is the place of the seven

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.570 align:middle line:10%
stars under the
sign of three stars

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:55.060 align:middle line:10%
that Wallace is talking about?

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And I start
investigating Nashville.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.690 align:middle line:84%
I find that the seal
of Nashville Davidson,

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:02.080 align:middle line:84%
which is the full
name of this city,

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.460 align:middle line:84%
shows an Indian holding
a decapitated cranium

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:05.930 align:middle line:90%
in his hand.

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:08.800 align:middle line:84%
But nobody knows why this
Indian is holding a dead head

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.140 align:middle line:90%
in his hand-- nobody.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in the 1930s, the
local paper, "The Tennessean,"

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:16.250 align:middle line:84%
ran a contest for
the best explanation

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:19.010 align:middle line:84%
for the seal of
Nashville-- no kidding.

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And they agreed that what
this is a Cherokee Indian

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:24.570 align:middle line:84%
chief holding this
skull, Hamlet-style.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:26.919 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:26.919 --> 00:22:28.460 align:middle line:84%
You believe what
you want to believe,

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:29.918 align:middle line:84%
but what I believe
is that when you

00:22:29.918 --> 00:22:32.990 align:middle line:84%
see that dead head at
a place, it's saying,

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:35.210 align:middle line:84%
this is where these
secrets are stored.

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:38.060 align:middle line:84%
That dead head is the
symbol that is head held

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.370 align:middle line:90%
by Isis, by Mary Magdalene.

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Roerich painted Issa in
front of the dead head.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And here it appears
yet again in Nashville.

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:50.670 align:middle line:10%
By the way, Nashville Davidson--
who is David's son again?

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:51.470 align:middle line:10%
Oh, that's right.

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:52.850 align:middle line:10%
It's Solomon.

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:55.600 align:middle line:10%
That's right.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.510 align:middle line:10%
So I'm thinking the Indian here
in Solomon's city, Nashville

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:03.200 align:middle line:10%
Davidson, is actually
holding the dead head

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.780 align:middle line:10%
of the alchemists.

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's indicating
that this place

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:09.830 align:middle line:84%
is a repository for these
secrets of the dead heads,

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:11.620 align:middle line:90%
of the alchemists.

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, "nash" is one
of those funny words,

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:17.030 align:middle line:84%
because the Hebrew word
"nachash" means serpent,

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:20.320 align:middle line:84%
and the Hebrew word
"neshama" means soul.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.460 align:middle line:84%
So Nashville,
"Nachashville," could

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.644 align:middle line:90%
be Serpent City or Soul Town.

00:23:24.644 --> 00:23:26.060 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of
different ways you

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.460 align:middle line:90%
can play with that word "nash."

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.500 align:middle line:84%
But it all goes
around this whole idea

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.610 align:middle line:84%
of this as a potential
place of secrets,

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:38.250 align:middle line:84%
and the symbolism used in
this place marks it as such.

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:41.200 align:middle line:84%
So I'm tooling around
Nashville saying, OK,

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.590 align:middle line:90%
where's the Holy Grail?

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'm driving along
Jefferson Street,

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:48.740 align:middle line:84%
and I see this giant,
red granite monolith.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And I see this
pattern etched on it.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:51.670 align:middle line:90%
And I look at that.

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:52.560 align:middle line:90%
I say, wait a minute.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.650 align:middle line:90%
I've seen that before.

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:59.330 align:middle line:10%
And I go home, and
I get out my book

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:04.060 align:middle line:10%
on sacred mountains of Asia,
and I pull out my diagram

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.970 align:middle line:10%
from a second-century
Chinese manuscript of Meru,

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:12.850 align:middle line:10%
the cosmic axis, the ladder to
heaven, the stairway to heaven.

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And I compare it
with a line drawing

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:17.690 align:middle line:84%
of the Tennessee Bicentennial
Capitol Mall laid out

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.730 align:middle line:84%
at the base of
our state capitol.

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.950 align:middle line:90%
And I say, you know what?

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Those places are
strikingly similar.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying
they're identical,

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.690 align:middle line:84%
but I'm saying that there's
a very interesting similarity

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:30.800 align:middle line:90%
between the two.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.340 align:middle line:10%
Here is the Meru Axis,
which, by the way,

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:37.060 align:middle line:10%
this is the center of Shambhala,
the realm of the immortals.

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:40.790 align:middle line:10%
A Meru axis was once at the
center of Atlantis as well.

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:42.850 align:middle line:10%
Mongolian myth says
that the immortals

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:45.780 align:middle line:10%
dwelled at Meru because of the
energy emitted from this thing.

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:47.840 align:middle line:10%
It looks like an
antenna because that's

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:51.280 align:middle line:10%
what it was, a bond
between Heaven and Earth.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:55.120 align:middle line:10%
And as we look at it here, it's
got these sheets that represent

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.390 align:middle line:10%
heavenly realms, it turns out.

00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:59.150 align:middle line:10%
Each of these
vertebrae-looking things

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:02.980 align:middle line:10%
are actually dimensions
that one travels through

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:06.160 align:middle line:10%
as they ascend the cosmic axis.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.880 align:middle line:84%
At the top of it, it has
this triangular apex.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:14.110 align:middle line:84%
That symbolizes Shambhala,
the realm of the immortals.

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And so the Meru axis
is the ladder to heaven

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:20.410 align:middle line:84%
that takes you to the
realm of the immortals.

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And so here's a bird's eye view
of the Tennessee Bicentennial

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Capitol Mall, a 2,200-foot-long
magician's rod laid out on 19

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:32.170 align:middle line:84%
acres at the base of
our state capitol.

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:33.670 align:middle line:90%
Here it is in fall.

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And we see the Ring of the
Chord of Three Stars at the top.

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:38.230 align:middle line:90%
This is a rod.

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:39.580 align:middle line:90%
That's a ring.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're looking
at is the primordial symbol

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:44.410 align:middle line:90%
of the rod and ring.

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:47.770 align:middle line:10%
And here's a comparison between
the two diagrams, which again,

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:50.230 align:middle line:10%
I'm not saying they're
identical, but here are

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:51.880 align:middle line:10%
the points of similarity.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:55.840 align:middle line:10%
They both have a
circular platform

00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:00.670 align:middle line:10%
upon which a
vertical pillar sits.

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:04.450 align:middle line:10%
The Meru diagram is
topped by a triangular

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:06.910 align:middle line:10%
apex that symbolizes Shambhala.

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:09.010 align:middle line:10%
The Tennessee
Bicentennial Capitol Mall

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:13.310 align:middle line:10%
is topped by three stars in
the pattern of a triangle.

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:16.750 align:middle line:10%
What I'm suggesting
here is this.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Let's imagine we
take a 1905 Model

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:23.140 align:middle line:84%
T. We go down to a garage,
and we hoist it up on a hoist,

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:24.940 align:middle line:84%
and we look at it
from underneath.

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:26.750 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to see?

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:30.940 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see four tires,
a drive train, and an engine,

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:31.740 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's take a
2007 Lamborghini,

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:42.690 align:middle line:84%
a yellow one with leather
seats, eight speakers.

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Hoist it up in the garage
next to the 1905 Model T,

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.280 align:middle line:90%
look at it from underneath.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.380 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to see?

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:53.030 align:middle line:90%
Essentially the same thing.

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:56.320 align:middle line:84%
The Lamborghini is going to
look a little bit more complex.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:59.020 align:middle line:84%
But an alien person
looking at it from outside

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:03.130 align:middle line:84%
with no knowledge of
what these automobiles do

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:05.320 align:middle line:84%
would recognize, hey,
there's some similarity here.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.690 align:middle line:84%
It looks like these two
are interchangeable.

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm
suggesting is happening here.

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:14.350 align:middle line:90%
These are both rods or antennas.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:16.810 align:middle line:10%
And I believe that what
we can assign to this,

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:19.630 align:middle line:10%
we can also assign to the
Bicentennial Capitol Mall.

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:22.250 align:middle line:10%
We can look at it
through that lens.

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, as soon as I
made the connection

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.860 align:middle line:84%
between these diagrams,
I faxed a copy

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:28.720 align:middle line:84%
over to the architect
who designed

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.500 align:middle line:90%
the bicentennial capitol mall.

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.257 align:middle line:84%
And he called me
back right away.

00:27:32.257 --> 00:27:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, yeah, I can see
wide to the untrained eye you

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.330 align:middle line:84%
might see a similarity
between those two diagrams,

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:39.510 align:middle line:90%
but they're not alike at all.

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:42.370 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, oh, OK.

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, by the way,
where did you get that drawing?

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:47.440 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:51.250 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh, well,
tables just turned.

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:53.539 align:middle line:84%
I got it out of a book of
sacred mountains of Asia.

00:27:53.539 --> 00:27:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, why don't you
send me that reference?

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yeah, let me
finish scratching my forehead.

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.040 align:middle line:90%
I'll send it right over.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.570 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:04.165 align:middle line:90%
I don't send it.

00:28:04.165 --> 00:28:06.910 align:middle line:84%
Guy kind of stepped
on me a little bit.

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:07.720 align:middle line:90%
30 days go by.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.177 align:middle line:90%
I get a call from him again.

00:28:09.177 --> 00:28:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Hey, you said you were
going to send that diagram.

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:12.710 align:middle line:90%
Where did you get that?

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:13.510 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's right.

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:15.820 align:middle line:90%
Gosh, thanks for reminding me.

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:17.470 align:middle line:90%
So I still don't send it.

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:20.290 align:middle line:90%
Another 30 days, same thing.

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:23.650 align:middle line:84%
Finally, it gets to be the
first of the year, January 2.

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:25.270 align:middle line:84%
I get a letter in
the mail from him.

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Hey, where did you
get that diagram?

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm thinking, hm, OK, whatever.

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And I still don't
send it to him.

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:35.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's that spring that
I start conducting walks,

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:38.200 align:middle line:84%
like we're going to do today,
taking a walk through the park.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And I've got 15,
20 people with me.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.590 align:middle line:90%
We're in this area.

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And a guy enters the
Court of Three Stars,

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:44.710 align:middle line:90%
and he's got a camera.

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And he starts taking
pictures of us.

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:48.040 align:middle line:90%
It's him.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.710 align:middle line:90%
It's the architect.

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:52.150 align:middle line:84%
He says, oh, I like to come
down here on Sundays, see

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:53.930 align:middle line:90%
how people are using the park.

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've been there 70
Sundays since that day, never

00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:58.810 align:middle line:90%
seen him since.

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Never seen him any other
time there, for that matter.

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And so I kind of step back
and say, gang, here's the man.

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:05.410 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:06.490 align:middle line:90%
Fire away.

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:08.739 align:middle line:84%
First thing out of his mouth
is, there's nothing weird

00:29:08.739 --> 00:29:10.050 align:middle line:90%
going on down here.

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, who say
anything about weird?

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:14.250 align:middle line:90%
We're just out taking a walk.

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:18.992 align:middle line:84%
And so the first question
is, what is up with all this?

00:29:18.992 --> 00:29:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, first
of all, everything you

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:23.140 align:middle line:90%
see here is purely decorative.

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.930 align:middle line:84%
It serves no purpose other
than to commemorate Tennessee's

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:29.470 align:middle line:84%
bicentennial and to provide an
unobstructed view of the state

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:30.760 align:middle line:90%
capitol.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Oh, OK, so we spent $55 million
to build a place that nobody

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:39.180 align:middle line:90%
knows about and nobody goes to.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:42.370 align:middle line:90%
This isn't adding up.

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:45.410 align:middle line:84%
So I just kind of
continued on my merry way.

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:49.360 align:middle line:84%
He appreciates my interest
in bringing people down

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.670 align:middle line:84%
to the park, although
I'm misguided.

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:53.080 align:middle line:90%
Well, whatever.

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:57.250 align:middle line:10%
So my take is look at the
Meru axis, the cosmic axis.

00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:00.070 align:middle line:10%
Compare it to a human vertebrae.

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:02.856 align:middle line:10%
Isn't there an interesting
correspondence between the two?

00:30:02.856 --> 00:30:04.480 align:middle line:10%
I mean, can't you
readily see that this

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.852 align:middle line:10%
could be human vertebrae that
we're actually looking at here?

00:30:07.852 --> 00:30:10.060 align:middle line:10%
It's kind of a stretch, but
it's interesting to think

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.980 align:middle line:10%
of it in those terms
to compare our body

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:16.030 align:middle line:10%
with the cosmic access,
the ladder to heaven.

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:19.360 align:middle line:84%
This looks nothing like
a spinal cord system.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.010 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm going
to show you is

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:24.460 align:middle line:84%
that each of the seven
chakras are perfectly marked

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:28.886 align:middle line:84%
with appropriate symbolism
here, all by chance.

00:30:28.886 --> 00:30:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And I say "by chance" because
the designer, the architect,

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:34.270 align:middle line:84%
sees no similarity
in the diagrams

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:36.520 align:middle line:84%
and certainly had no
intention to build

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:40.300 align:middle line:84%
a temple of initiation, one
where each of the seven chakras

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.400 align:middle line:84%
are perfectly marked with
appropriate symbolism

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.070 align:middle line:84%
and that people could come
from all over the world

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:48.940 align:middle line:84%
to get educated, maybe
even to get awakened.

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:50.470 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what we're
looking at here

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:52.180 align:middle line:90%
is a model of the perfect human.

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:55.600 align:middle line:84%
It's even topped by a
triangle with the three orbs,

00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:01.586 align:middle line:84%
or three entwined--
the circuit at the top.

00:31:01.586 --> 00:31:03.910 align:middle line:90%
Is this a blueprint?

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:05.340 align:middle line:90%
It's a possibility.

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:08.609 align:middle line:84%
I was in Florida once giving
a lecture on this about FDR

00:31:08.609 --> 00:31:10.900 align:middle line:84%
and the Grail, and a scientist
came up to me afterward,

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.940 align:middle line:84%
and he said, I was
basically asleep

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:16.930 align:middle line:84%
through your presentation until
you put up that blueprint.

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:18.107 align:middle line:90%
What blueprint?

00:31:18.107 --> 00:31:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And he went through
my slides until he

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:23.200 align:middle line:84%
came to this diagram right here,
and he said, that blueprint.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.720 align:middle line:84%
He said, I design particle-beam
weapons for a living,

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.517 align:middle line:84%
you know,
Star-Wars-like weapons.

00:31:27.517 --> 00:31:29.350 align:middle line:84%
He says, do you realize
that's the blueprint

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.547 align:middle line:90%
for a particle-beam weapon?

00:31:31.547 --> 00:31:33.130 align:middle line:84%
He said, here's the
weapon right here.

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:35.440 align:middle line:84%
It's designed to rotate
on this platform.

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.910 align:middle line:84%
These pinscher-looking
things, they

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:39.190 align:middle line:84%
modulate the
electromagnetic pulse that's

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:40.690 align:middle line:90%
emanating from the weapon.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:44.180 align:middle line:84%
That's why it
looks like a sword.

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:47.590 align:middle line:84%
Why were FDR and Adolf
Hitler so interested

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:50.110 align:middle line:84%
in the secrets of
the Holy Grail?

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Because they knew that
knowledge could be weaponized.

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.530 align:middle line:90%
Why else?

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:58.190 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't for any
spiritual purpose.

00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:00.400 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
this this diagram,

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.620 align:middle line:84%
while it comes from a
second-century Chinese

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:06.850 align:middle line:84%
manuscript, is probably
much, much older than that.

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:11.680 align:middle line:84%
I would jump off a cliff and
say that's an Atlantean diagram.

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Meru was the name
the pillar of light

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:17.890 align:middle line:84%
at the center of Atlantis, and
I think that what it originally

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:20.620 align:middle line:90%
was was a particle accelerator.

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:23.140 align:middle line:10%
So I took the bait from the
scientist, and I came home,

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:25.994 align:middle line:10%
and I googled
"particle accelerator."

00:32:25.994 --> 00:32:27.410 align:middle line:10%
Here what we have
is a comparison.

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:32.320 align:middle line:10%
This is a diagram from
Ernest Lawrence's cyclotron,

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:36.040 align:middle line:10%
a particle accelerator that was
used in this Manhattan Project

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.200 align:middle line:10%
to split the atom.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.300 align:middle line:10%
And I see where that
scientist is coming from.

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:45.340 align:middle line:84%
These two diagrams do bear a
very interesting similarity

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:47.020 align:middle line:90%
to one another.

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And the question
then emerges, well,

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:51.370 align:middle line:84%
what is a diagram for a
cyclotron or a particle

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:53.620 align:middle line:84%
accelerator doing in a
second-century Chinese

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:55.240 align:middle line:90%
manuscript?

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:58.280 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a carryover
from ancient, ancient times.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
modern scientists,

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:03.760 align:middle line:84%
theoretical physicists, say,
hey, space-based particle

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:06.770 align:middle line:84%
accelerators will one day
be the tool that we use,

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:11.186 align:middle line:84%
the instrument, the
device to open wormholes.

00:33:11.186 --> 00:33:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And here's what I think
the actual gate is.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:17.320 align:middle line:10%
This is what I think this is
actually trying to tell us.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:20.110 align:middle line:10%
On the left is a
diagram of Meru.

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:23.510 align:middle line:84%
On the right is the female
reproductive system.

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Any questions about what
we're talking about here?

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.620 align:middle line:90%
The human body is that gateway.

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:33.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm absolutely convinced of it.

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:36.512 align:middle line:90%
