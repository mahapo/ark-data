00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Let's begin now,
as we have before,

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.970 align:middle line:10%
with the energy field
awareness practice.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.410 align:middle line:10%
Simply close your eyes and
tune into the feeling of energy

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.290 align:middle line:10%
in and around your body.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And also observe
what is currently

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.860 align:middle line:90%
in your mind and your emotions.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.700 align:middle line:84%
This provides a baseline to
see energetic and consciousness

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.870 align:middle line:84%
changes at the end
of this practice.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, we will begin the
next level of construction

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.730 align:middle line:90%
of your grid of life.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Start by putting your attention
at the very top of your head

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.760 align:middle line:90%
at the crown chakra.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And move your awareness
straight up vertically,

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.360 align:middle line:84%
until you find the first
energy center above your head.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.410 align:middle line:84%
This is the place that was
the top of the golden triangle

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.570 align:middle line:90%
in episode one.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.300 align:middle line:84%
This energy center
above your head

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.500 align:middle line:84%
will feel like a place of
increased light and vibration,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.750 align:middle line:84%
and it will feel like
a platform where you

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.630 align:middle line:90%
can rest your attention on it.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.300 align:middle line:84%
Apply zero-point centering
to the first center

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.510 align:middle line:84%
above your head, which is
moving all of your energy

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.620 align:middle line:84%
and attention into the
epicenter of that energy

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.740 align:middle line:84%
center above your head,
then allowing its activated

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.860 align:middle line:84%
energy to stream
outwards to become

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.550 align:middle line:84%
a radiant golden sun of
divine light above your head.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.270 align:middle line:90%
This is the radiance technique.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, move your energy and
awareness to stream energy

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.180 align:middle line:84%
down from that sun
above your head,

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.950 align:middle line:84%
to stream that divine golden
light down into the crown

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.680 align:middle line:90%
center at the top of your head.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.140 align:middle line:84%
Then begin to vertically
move your awareness

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.070 align:middle line:84%
straight down the golden
thread of the central column

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:90%
in the midline of the body.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.440 align:middle line:84%
As you move your awareness
down from the crown,

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.370 align:middle line:84%
be aware of the structures
intersecting the middle pillar,

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.670 align:middle line:84%
feeling the golden thread
move through the center

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.640 align:middle line:84%
of the third eye tunnel
in the cave of Brahma,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.860 align:middle line:84%
which we activated
with the cubicle cross

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.070 align:middle line:90%
exercise in episode two.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.350 align:middle line:84%
Move your attention
down the golden thread

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.740 align:middle line:84%
of the middle pillar, down
from the cave of Brahma,

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.140 align:middle line:90%
down into the throat.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And then follow the middle
pillar down the upper chest

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.560 align:middle line:84%
to connect to the heart chakra
in the center of the chest.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.050 align:middle line:84%
Note that whereas the
physical heart is slightly

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.500 align:middle line:84%
offset to the left side of
the chest in most people,

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.130 align:middle line:84%
the heart chakra is located
on the vertical center

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.940 align:middle line:90%
line, the middle pillar.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.550 align:middle line:84%
This downwards flow
of divine light

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.270 align:middle line:84%
connects to the heart
chakra on the middle pillar.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Use zero-point centering to
move your energy and awareness

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.990 align:middle line:84%
into the epicenter
of your heart chakra.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.530 align:middle line:90%


00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Relax more deeply into
the center of your heart,

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.730 align:middle line:84%
experiencing and
inwardly tasting

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:27.330 align:middle line:84%
the beautiful divine love
nectar held in your heart.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Then as you've
activated the energy

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.600 align:middle line:84%
in the center of
the heart chakra,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.780 align:middle line:84%
allow its activated
energy to stream outwards

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.520 align:middle line:84%
to become a dynamic
rose-colored sun radiating out

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.580 align:middle line:90%
from your chest.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.220 align:middle line:84%
Now that we have
activated the heart chakra

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.210 align:middle line:84%
on the middle pillar, we can
activate the vital connections

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.150 align:middle line:84%
between the heart
and all the centers

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.850 align:middle line:84%
on the right and
left pillars, which

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.270 align:middle line:84%
rely on the heart to
provide divine balancing

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.180 align:middle line:90%
to their polarized energies.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.220 align:middle line:84%
For time purposes, we will not
describe activating these six

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.840 align:middle line:84%
center on the right
and left pillars

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.680 align:middle line:84%
with the zero-point centering
and radiance methods.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.730 align:middle line:84%
However, you should,
in your own practice,

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.180 align:middle line:84%
devote time to fully activating
all these centers in addition

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.860 align:middle line:84%
to the connections to the heart
center we will describe here.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, send out rays of
light from the heart

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.360 align:middle line:84%
to connect to the
little known energy

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.190 align:middle line:84%
centers above your
right shoulder

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.210 align:middle line:84%
and above your left shoulder,
which you used in episode one

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.180 align:middle line:84%
to stabilize the bottom
of the golden triangle

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.380 align:middle line:90%
around your head.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Feel the divine love
from your heart activate,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.060 align:middle line:84%
balance, and support these two
centers above your shoulders.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.710 align:middle line:84%
Next, we have two energy centers
located in your upper chest

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.510 align:middle line:84%
at the top of the lungs on
the left and right pillars.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.100 align:middle line:84%
Feel their vibration in
your upper chest and lungs.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Send rays of light
from your heart

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.590 align:middle line:84%
to connect to the energy
center in the upper right

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.100 align:middle line:84%
top of your lungs and
then from the heart

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.870 align:middle line:84%
to the center in the upper
left top of your lungs.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.410 align:middle line:84%
Feel the divine love
from your heart activate,

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:28.180 align:middle line:84%
balance, and support these two
chest centers for breathing.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And now we have the two energy
centers located in your liver,

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.510 align:middle line:84%
at the base of your rib
cage on the right side,

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.820 align:middle line:84%
and in your spleen, at the base
of your ribs on the left side.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Feel the vibration of these
energy centers located

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.960 align:middle line:90%
in these two powerful organs.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Send rays from your
heart to connect

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.120 align:middle line:84%
to the energy
center in your liver

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.360 align:middle line:84%
and to the center
in your spleen.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Feel the divine love
from your heart activate,

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:04.810 align:middle line:84%
balance, and support
your liver and spleen.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, simply activate
the vertical lines

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.660 align:middle line:84%
connecting three centers
on the right pillar.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Create a line of
light moving downwards

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.000 align:middle line:84%
from the center above
the right shoulder

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.890 align:middle line:84%
to move down to link to the
center in the upper right lung

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:27.150 align:middle line:84%
and from there downwards to
link to the center in the liver.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll do the same
for the left pillar.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.640 align:middle line:84%
Start by creating a
line of light emanating

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.630 align:middle line:84%
downwards from the center
above the left shoulder

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.380 align:middle line:84%
to link to the center
in the upper left lung

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:45.560 align:middle line:84%
and then down to link to
the center in the spleen.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And to complete the
activation of this section

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.920 align:middle line:84%
of the grid of life, we're
going to activate the three

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.180 align:middle line:84%
horizontal lines of energy
between the parallel centers

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.300 align:middle line:90%
on the right and left pillars.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Link with horizontal
lines of light

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.670 align:middle line:84%
the two centers
above the shoulders,

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.380 align:middle line:84%
then create a
horizontal line of light

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.130 align:middle line:84%
to link the two centers
in the upper lungs,

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.140 align:middle line:84%
and then a horizontal
line of light

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:18.450 align:middle line:84%
to link the two centers
in the liver and spleen.

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.690 align:middle line:84%
You have now created a
beginning level activation

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:27.780 align:middle line:84%
in your energy field of the
first eight of the ten centers.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.780 align:middle line:84%
This completes the
structure around your heart

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:35.250 align:middle line:84%
and the heart's middle
pillar emanations to support

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.940 align:middle line:84%
and activate both the
left and right pillar.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.780 align:middle line:84%
It is this connection to the
centers on the middle pillar

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.870 align:middle line:84%
that helped to balance
and integrate the energies

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.265 align:middle line:90%
on the left and the right.

00:07:47.265 --> 00:07:49.860 align:middle line:90%


00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.410 align:middle line:10%
Now, simply close your
eyes for a moment,

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:55.960 align:middle line:10%
and we're going to do the energy
field awareness practice again,

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.310 align:middle line:10%
so that you can perceive what
changes happened in your energy

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.880 align:middle line:10%
field and your awareness
from this practice.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Simply tune in to the feeling of
energy in and around your body.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:09.910 align:middle line:90%


00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Then become aware of
what is in your thoughts

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.760 align:middle line:90%
and in your emotions.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.920 align:middle line:84%
How has this practice changed
your internal feeling?

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.340 align:middle line:84%
Changed your state
of consciousness?

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Can you feel the
structures that have

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.155 align:middle line:84%
been created in your energy
body through this practice?

00:08:28.155 --> 00:08:30.940 align:middle line:90%


00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.960 align:middle line:10%
You have now created a beginning
level activation in your energy

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:38.669 align:middle line:10%
field for the first eight of the
ten centers of the grid of life

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:41.940 align:middle line:10%
design by activating
first the golden triangle

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.790 align:middle line:10%
around your head and
then, in this episode,

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:49.800 align:middle line:10%
the energy matrix around the
rose light of your heart.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.560 align:middle line:10%
We will complete the grid of
life design in your energy

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.490 align:middle line:10%
field in a later episode by
adding in the two final centers

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.830 align:middle line:10%
on the middle pillar,
which will ground us

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.670 align:middle line:10%
into physical incarnation
and link us to the Earth.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.370 align:middle line:10%
This is, of course, only
a very basic introduction

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.430 align:middle line:10%
to this profound sacred
geometry energy pattern

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:12.480 align:middle line:10%
and to methods that we
can use to activate it.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.630 align:middle line:10%
