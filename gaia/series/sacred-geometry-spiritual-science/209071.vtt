00:00:22.095 --> 00:00:23.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Welcome.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.330 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Dr.
Robert J. Gilbert.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.300 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we will
explore the hidden powers

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.140 align:middle line:10%
of the most famous forms
in sacred geometry--

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.660 align:middle line:10%
the five Platonic
solids, which are

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.360 align:middle line:10%
the forms for the four
elements of nature

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.450 align:middle line:10%
and the mysterious
fifth element.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.170 align:middle line:84%
You'll then learn a little
known Rosicrucian practice,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.830 align:middle line:84%
using these powerful forms
to expand your consciousness

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.030 align:middle line:84%
and help you to open up
perception of higher worlds.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.900 align:middle line:10%
In our previous episodes, we
showed the power of the sphere

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.950 align:middle line:10%
as the perfect sacred geometric
container for new life

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.980 align:middle line:10%
and for all of creation.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.490 align:middle line:84%
We saw the sacred geometry
transformation of the sphere

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.850 align:middle line:84%
from a containing form to become
a dynamic energy activation

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.650 align:middle line:90%
form--

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.390 align:middle line:90%
the torus.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.460 align:middle line:10%
The Platonic solids
are also derived

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.610 align:middle line:10%
from the primal sacred
geometry form of the sphere,

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.610 align:middle line:10%
but they have undergone a
different transformation

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.435 align:middle line:10%
than the torus.

00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:27.080 align:middle line:90%


00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.530 align:middle line:84%
The divine packed thought form
behind the Platonic solids

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.800 align:middle line:84%
is that they are the
only five perfect ways

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.140 align:middle line:90%
to divide a sphere.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Each way of dividing it
creates a different form, which

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.200 align:middle line:90%
releases a different power.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Every face on a particular
solid has the same shape,

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.100 align:middle line:84%
either a triangle,
square, or a pentagon.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.680 align:middle line:84%
The same number of faces
meet at every corner

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.780 align:middle line:90%
or a vertex of the form.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And every line on every face
is the exact same length.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.640 align:middle line:84%
The original forms of the
Platonic solids are spherical.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Then each face is flattened
to make the Platonic solids

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.650 align:middle line:84%
as they were taught
to the Greeks

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.889 align:middle line:84%
and as they are
popularly known today.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Our oldest historical artifacts
of the Platonic solids

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.890 align:middle line:84%
are from Scotland where
many ancient stone

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.390 align:middle line:84%
forms have been found, which
are well over 3,500 years old.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, in
these oldest artifacts,

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.420 align:middle line:84%
the Platonic solids
always appear

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.290 align:middle line:84%
in their primordial
spherical form.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.080 align:middle line:84%
The familiar flattened
faces that we

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.040 align:middle line:84%
know today were popularized by
the Greek school of Pythagoras

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.070 align:middle line:84%
with information likely
gathered from ancient Egypt

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.590 align:middle line:90%
and Babylonia.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.750 align:middle line:84%
We know from the
writings of Plato

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.960 align:middle line:84%
that the Greeks knew that the
Platonic solids were connected

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.930 align:middle line:84%
to the hidden energy
grids of the Earth.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.270 align:middle line:84%
In our first episode,
we showed the net

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.420 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth grids, the
energy patterns of the Earth,

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.240 align:middle line:90%
based on the Platonic solids.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Each of the five ways
of dividing the sphere

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.640 align:middle line:84%
creates a form connected
to one of the four

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.110 align:middle line:90%
elements of nature--

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.650 align:middle line:90%
Earth, water, air, and fire.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.380 align:middle line:84%
The fifth form is
connected to the mystery

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.160 align:middle line:84%
of the fifth element, which
the Greeks called the ether.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.120 align:middle line:84%
This is the dynamic
energy of life itself.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.080 align:middle line:84%
The tetrahedron is the form
behind the power of fire.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.870 align:middle line:90%
It has four triangular faces.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.950 align:middle line:84%
The octahedron is the form
behind the power of air.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.710 align:middle line:90%
It has eight triangular faces.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.340 align:middle line:84%
The cube is the form
behind the power of Earth.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.250 align:middle line:90%
It has six square faces.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.210 align:middle line:84%
The icosahedron is the form
behind the power of water.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.330 align:middle line:90%
It has 20 triangular faces.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.150 align:middle line:84%
The fifth and final
form, the form

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.370 align:middle line:84%
kept hidden in the
writings of Plato

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.980 align:middle line:84%
and the Pythagorean
school in Greece,

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.100 align:middle line:84%
because of its tremendous
potential power,

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.090 align:middle line:84%
is the fifth element, the ether,
the dynamic life force itself,

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.660 align:middle line:84%
which is the source of
the four earthly elements.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.970 align:middle line:84%
This is the dodecahedron
with 12 pentagonal faces.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Each of these Platonic solids
is a deep world within itself,

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.750 align:middle line:84%
full of embedded
knowledge and power.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.490 align:middle line:84%
Each one is a packed thought
form from the mind of God.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.410 align:middle line:90%
The best known of these forms--

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.100 align:middle line:84%
the cube of Earth with
six square faces--

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.160 align:middle line:84%
we will explore in greater
detail in a future episode

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.890 align:middle line:84%
where we will see that it
is the form for creating

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.380 align:middle line:90%
the physical plane itself.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.070 align:middle line:84%
The cube is a sealed
chamber, an alchemical retort

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.490 align:middle line:84%
we are placed in as young
spiritual beings in order

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.970 align:middle line:84%
to go through deep spiritual
transformation processes

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.470 align:middle line:90%
during our earthly life.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.160 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's dive deeper now into the
mysteries of the other four

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.480 align:middle line:90%
Platonic solids.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.060 align:middle line:84%
The first and simplest
of the Platonic solids

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.790 align:middle line:84%
is the tetrahedron of fire
with four triangular faces.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.970 align:middle line:84%
The tetrahedron is the
minimal, most fundamental

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.920 align:middle line:84%
three-dimensional
form, which can

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.530 align:middle line:90%
be created with straight lines.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.410 align:middle line:84%
One of the key thought
forms from the mind of God

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.780 align:middle line:84%
behind the
tetrahedron is that it

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.820 align:middle line:84%
holds the pattern
of the original one

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.440 align:middle line:84%
point of the divine unity,
which is being solidly supported

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.240 align:middle line:84%
by the three points of a trinity
for manifestation purposes.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.310 align:middle line:84%
In the Christian
tradition, this packed

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.530 align:middle line:84%
thought form of
the tetrahedron is

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.980 align:middle line:84%
the principle of the divine
unity, the true Godhead,

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.900 align:middle line:84%
resting on the trinity of
father, son, and Holy Spirit.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.060 align:middle line:10%
In the structure of
the human energy field,

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.020 align:middle line:10%
this trinity of support
becomes the human divine spirit

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.360 align:middle line:10%
being supported by three anchor
points for the human soul, also

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.130 align:middle line:10%
known in the Western esoteric
tradition as the astral body.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.070 align:middle line:84%
In an upcoming episode, we
will explore these three

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.750 align:middle line:90%
anchor points of the soul.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see how they support
the spirit in the human body,

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.950 align:middle line:84%
just as the three points
of the triangle at the base

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.580 align:middle line:84%
of a tetrahedron support
the one point directly

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.980 align:middle line:90%
above the triangle.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.800 align:middle line:84%
As the fundamental
three-dimensional form,

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.720 align:middle line:84%
the tetrahedron
holds the principle

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.580 align:middle line:84%
of fire, which is classically
always connected to spirit.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.380 align:middle line:84%
The tetrahedron creates
fundamental stability

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.000 align:middle line:84%
and a strong structure for
physical manifestation,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.610 align:middle line:84%
just as the spirit
is the foundation

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.780 align:middle line:84%
behind the crystallization
of physical matter.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Buckminster Fuller
demonstrated that the triangle

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.590 align:middle line:84%
and the tetrahedron are the most
important structural support

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.040 align:middle line:84%
forms which exist,
applying it to his creation

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.380 align:middle line:90%
of geodesic domes.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.860 align:middle line:84%
If you make all of the Platonic
solids with flexible corners,

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.340 align:middle line:84%
they all collapse, except
for the tetrahedron,

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.700 align:middle line:84%
which even with flexible
rubber corners still

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.490 align:middle line:90%
stands erect and strong.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.910 align:middle line:84%
The tetrahedron has to be
completely turned inside out

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.670 align:middle line:84%
in order for any corner
to buckle inwards,

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:16.890 align:middle line:84%
giving it more resilience than
any other Platonic solid form.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.650 align:middle line:84%
When the tetrahedron is
combined with a form for air,

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.400 align:middle line:84%
the octahedron, together they
create tremendously strong

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.130 align:middle line:84%
trusses to support
physical weight

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:29.720 align:middle line:84%
and withstand
high-pressure loads.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Bucky Fuller called
this the tet octa truss.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Hidden inside of the structural
strength of the tetrahedron

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.410 align:middle line:84%
is another key-packed
thought form

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.560 align:middle line:84%
in the mind of God,
which is to stabilize

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.990 align:middle line:84%
the center, with
the center being

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.960 align:middle line:90%
the gateway to the divine plane.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.150 align:middle line:84%
Again, it was
Buckminster Fuller who

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.660 align:middle line:84%
publicized that the tetrahedron
was the minimal form

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:59.910 align:middle line:84%
to anchor and hold fixed a point
in the center of a structure.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:01.920 align:middle line:84%
To explain what
this means, if you

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.170 align:middle line:84%
put a small ball on
the end of a string

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:06.490 align:middle line:84%
and have just one
point of restraint,

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.400 align:middle line:84%
which is where you
would hold the string,

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.350 align:middle line:84%
then the ball can
move in any direction.

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:14.680 align:middle line:84%
If you add a second
point of restraint,

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.460 align:middle line:84%
the ball can still move
along a full 360 degrees

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.950 align:middle line:90%
along a two-dimensional plane.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.140 align:middle line:84%
If you add a third
point of restraint,

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.750 align:middle line:84%
then the ball can only
move back and forth

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.450 align:middle line:90%
on a one-dimensional line.

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:32.080 align:middle line:84%
When you add the fourth point of
restraint, which means the four

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.049 align:middle line:84%
points of the
tetrahedron, each corner

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:39.070 align:middle line:84%
point holding a line connected
to the central ball or center

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.000 align:middle line:84%
point, then the sphere is
anchored and immobilized

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.730 align:middle line:84%
in the center of
the tetrahedron.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And so the principle of
stabilizing the divine center

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:55.040 align:middle line:84%
is another hidden divine thought
form within the tetrahedron.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Buckminster Fuller also taught
that the most fundamental

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:03.110 align:middle line:84%
physical entity, the photon of
light, is itself a tetrahedron.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.770 align:middle line:84%
When light creates the
world, it is the tetrahedron

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.830 align:middle line:90%
creating the world.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:12.740 align:middle line:84%
The next Platonic
solid is the octahedron

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.920 align:middle line:84%
of air with eight
triangular faces.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.200 align:middle line:84%
The octahedron is a
form which manifests

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.960 align:middle line:84%
from the creation of
physical space, which

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.850 align:middle line:90%
is filled with air.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.120 align:middle line:10%
It is created by connecting
the ends of the three

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.975 align:middle line:10%
axes of the cubical cross,
which defines the three

00:09:29.975 --> 00:09:34.190 align:middle line:10%
90-degree angles that create
three-dimensional physical

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:35.450 align:middle line:10%
space.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:38.090 align:middle line:84%
When the ends of the
three-dimensional cross

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:43.260 align:middle line:84%
are all connected together, this
creates the octahedron form.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.770 align:middle line:84%
The octahedron can also be seen
as essentially two pyramids,

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.710 align:middle line:84%
one pointing upwards and
one pointing downwards,

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.660 align:middle line:90%
connected at their base.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.560 align:middle line:84%
This is the true hidden origin
of the pyramid, the form used

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.350 align:middle line:84%
by traditions all over
the world as a place

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.480 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual initiation.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:06.390 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid is, in reality,
an octahedron cut in half.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Just as the octahedron is based
on the cubical cross, which

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.090 align:middle line:84%
is a thought form
in the mind of God

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.460 align:middle line:84%
which creates the three
dimensions of physical space,

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:18.330 align:middle line:84%
so the octahedron
itself is the basis

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.040 align:middle line:84%
for the form for
human soul travel,

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.490 align:middle line:84%
which has been popularized
in modern times

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:27.450 align:middle line:84%
as the Merkaba or
star tetrahedron

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:32.580 align:middle line:84%
and which technically is known
as the stellated octahedron.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Stellation is the technical term
for turning a flat-sided form

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.060 align:middle line:90%
into a star form.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:42.720 align:middle line:84%
The octahedron is stellated
or turned into a star form

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.020 align:middle line:84%
by lifting up the center
point of each face

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.420 align:middle line:84%
and then connecting
that raised center

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.720 align:middle line:84%
point to the three
corners of that triangular

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.030 align:middle line:90%
face of the octahedron.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.730 align:middle line:84%
This can also be seen
from another perspective,

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.890 align:middle line:84%
that this stellation
essentially adds

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:02.220 align:middle line:84%
on to every one of the eight
faces of the octahedron,

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:07.860 align:middle line:84%
the form for air, a
tetrahedron, the form for fire.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:12.600 align:middle line:84%
Amazingly, this also then
converts the entire octahedron

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.720 align:middle line:84%
into a form looking like two
interpenetrating tetrahedra,

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:21.230 align:middle line:84%
fire with the
octahedron form for air,

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:25.280 align:middle line:90%
which fuels fire hidden inside.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.980 align:middle line:84%
This stellated
octahedron, better known

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.310 align:middle line:84%
to the public today
as a star tetrahedron,

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:34.280 align:middle line:84%
is a form which is
part of the subtle body

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.130 align:middle line:84%
system of the human
being related to higher

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:39.950 align:middle line:90%
initiation and soul travel.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:43.280 align:middle line:84%
We will explore the star
form and the hidden secrets

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.910 align:middle line:84%
of the Merkaba vehicle
of soul travel in detail

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:50.030 align:middle line:84%
in a later episode
of this series.

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:52.040 align:middle line:84%
The octahedron
holds many secrets

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.770 align:middle line:84%
for how spirit creates
the physical world.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:59.810 align:middle line:84%
For example, a sacred geometry
secret of the Tibetan tradition

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:03.200 align:middle line:84%
was only made public
recently in the book titled

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.320 align:middle line:84%
"Sacred Dimensions
of Time and Space"

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.690 align:middle line:84%
by Tarthang Tulku,
published in 1997.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:12.850 align:middle line:10%
In this book, a Tibetan
master describes

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:16.820 align:middle line:10%
how time has a structure
with past, present,

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.950 align:middle line:10%
and future, creating the
three points of a triangle.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.950 align:middle line:84%
These triangles are
connected in a linear flow

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:27.400 align:middle line:90%
of what we conceive of as time.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.280 align:middle line:84%
These triangles emerge
from two dimensions

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.570 align:middle line:84%
to three dimensions as
octahedral diamonds, which

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:39.790 align:middle line:84%
are the units of the
flow of time itself.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.990 align:middle line:84%
The next Platonic solid
form is the icosahedron

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.710 align:middle line:84%
of water with 20
triangular faces.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:48.630 align:middle line:84%
Just as the
octahedron is created

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:52.540 align:middle line:84%
on a framework of the three
axes of physical space,

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:57.060 align:middle line:84%
so the icosahedron is created
using a different framework

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.930 align:middle line:84%
on top of the same three
90-degree axes that

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:02.850 align:middle line:90%
create physical space.

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.760 align:middle line:10%
Instead of using simple
one-dimensional lines that

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.790 align:middle line:10%
create the octahedron,
the icosahedron

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:13.050 align:middle line:10%
is manifested from three
golden mean rectangles,

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.630 align:middle line:10%
which are each two dimensional.

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:18.810 align:middle line:10%
The golden mean, also
known as the phi ratio,

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:22.080 align:middle line:10%
is a major sacred geometry
pattern intimately linked

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.420 align:middle line:10%
to life energy,
which we will explore

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.360 align:middle line:10%
in a later episode
of this series.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.790 align:middle line:84%
The icosahedron is the
Platonic solid related

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:33.450 align:middle line:84%
to water, which is the element
that is understood today

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:37.680 align:middle line:84%
as the basic prerequisite
for life as we know it.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.900 align:middle line:84%
Simple biological
life, which live

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.500 align:middle line:84%
in liquid, such as
protozoa in the ocean,

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:47.250 align:middle line:84%
often take on a pure
icosahedral form.

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:50.910 align:middle line:84%
One of the simplest and
smallest biological life forms

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:52.500 align:middle line:90%
are viruses.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:56.220 align:middle line:84%
It is perhaps no surprise, then,
that the Platonic solid form

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.310 align:middle line:84%
for water, the
icosahedron, has been

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.560 align:middle line:84%
found in modern
scientific research

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.280 align:middle line:84%
to be the actual
form of many viruses.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.300 align:middle line:84%
This is the case, for example,
with herpes virus, adenovirus,

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.040 align:middle line:90%
and many others.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.730 align:middle line:10%
The final and ultimate
Platonic solid

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:19.570 align:middle line:10%
is the dodecahedron with
12 pentagonal faces.

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:23.490 align:middle line:84%
This is the form that is in
resonance with the ether.

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.290 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Greek
concept of the ether

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:28.920 align:middle line:84%
has always been understood as
the dynamic life force which

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.730 align:middle line:84%
fills all of space and is
connected to the heavens

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.370 align:middle line:90%
surrounding the Earth.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.010 align:middle line:84%
This concept was
virtually universal

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:41.880 align:middle line:84%
among all classical traditions
with a variety of names

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.460 align:middle line:84%
given to the ether in
different cultures.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.670 align:middle line:84%
For example, it is
called prana in India.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:52.050 align:middle line:84%
It was the basis for the ka
energy body in ancient Egypt.

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And in China, it was referred
to as the universal chi field.

00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:59.700 align:middle line:10%
Although the
existence of the ether

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.150 align:middle line:10%
is denied by modern Western
materialistic science,

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:05.670 align:middle line:10%
it has, in reality,
simply been brought

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.670 align:middle line:10%
in through the back door
and given a different name

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:10.710 align:middle line:10%
to fit modern materialism.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:14.280 align:middle line:84%
For example, now being
referred to as the quantum

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:19.710 align:middle line:84%
vacuum field or the
quantum energy field.

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:24.480 align:middle line:10%
In February 2003, NASA
released their new mapping

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.480 align:middle line:10%
of cosmic background
radiation data

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:31.230 align:middle line:10%
from the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe,

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:35.340 align:middle line:10%
or the WMAP, which reveals
the actual physical structures

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.030 align:middle line:10%
of space.

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:42.450 align:middle line:10%
Then in October 2003, a group of
cosmologists with mathematician

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:47.340 align:middle line:10%
Jeffrey Weeks analyzed this data
to create a new, accurate model

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.960 align:middle line:10%
for the shape of the universe.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.140 align:middle line:84%
According to Jeffrey
Weeks, the solution

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:55.020 align:middle line:84%
which fits the
mathematical data indicated

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.750 align:middle line:84%
that the universe
is finite and shaped

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:00.810 align:middle line:84%
like a dodecahedron,
which also contains

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:04.950 align:middle line:84%
within it geometric manifolds
of other Platonic solids.

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And so once again,
modern science

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.900 align:middle line:84%
confirms the sacred
geometry knowledge

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.580 align:middle line:90%
of ancient spiritual traditions.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:16.680 align:middle line:84%
The dodecahedron is deeply
connected to the number five.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.050 align:middle line:84%
It is the only
Platonic solid with

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:21.930 align:middle line:90%
five-sided pentagonal faces.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:23.910 align:middle line:84%
As we will see in
a later episode,

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:26.790 align:middle line:84%
five-sided geometries
like the pentagram

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:29.430 align:middle line:84%
are directly connected
to etheric life

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:35.040 align:middle line:84%
force, the human etheric
body, and the phi ratio.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.570 align:middle line:84%
The dodecahedron can perfectly
hold inside of it five cubes so

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:42.270 align:middle line:84%
that one of the 12
lines on each cube

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:46.260 align:middle line:84%
creates one line connecting
two non-adjacent points

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.200 align:middle line:84%
on each face of
the dodecahedron.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.510 align:middle line:84%
When all five
cubes are in place,

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.870 align:middle line:84%
they create a pentagram,
a five-pointed star,

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:57.870 align:middle line:84%
on every face of
the dodecahedron.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:00.180 align:middle line:84%
The pentagram is
a pure thi ratio

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.880 align:middle line:84%
form with golden
mean proportioning

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.490 align:middle line:90%
throughout the pentagram.

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:07.710 align:middle line:10%
The human etheric
life body is itself

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:11.790 align:middle line:10%
a pentagram, connecting the
heart to the five extremities--

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:16.290 align:middle line:10%
the head, two
hands, and two feet.

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:18.240 align:middle line:84%
The dodecahedron
occurs naturally

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.780 align:middle line:84%
in chemical structures
and features prominently

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.540 align:middle line:84%
in many modern
scientific theories

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.930 align:middle line:84%
on the atomic structure
behind all matter.

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, interestingly, the
noble gas xenon's structure,

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:35.160 align:middle line:84%
as found in chemistry
textbooks, is based

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:39.000 align:middle line:90%
on a dodecahedra around a cube.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Xenon is, in reality, an
extremely psychotropic gas

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.610 align:middle line:84%
used for inducing spiritual
experiences in clinics

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:49.620 align:middle line:90%
in the Czech Republic.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, we see that
this power may be

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:54.120 align:middle line:84%
linked to its geometric
form, the cube

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.150 align:middle line:84%
of the materialized physical
world being surrounded

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:01.260 align:middle line:84%
by the dodecahedron, the
opening to the etheric life

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:05.630 align:middle line:84%
force, the gateway
to higher spirit.

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:08.930 align:middle line:84%
The dodecahedron opens up a
gateway to the etheric life

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:10.250 align:middle line:90%
force itself.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:14.240 align:middle line:84%
For that purpose, it is used
by esotericists and energy

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:18.070 align:middle line:84%
researchers in many
different forms,

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:21.090 align:middle line:84%
ranging from making
dodecahedron-shaped chambers

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:23.820 align:middle line:84%
to do healing
practices inside of,

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.120 align:middle line:84%
to cutting crystals
into dodecahedron forms

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.030 align:middle line:84%
to use on the body
and energy field.

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Before we can reveal the
deeper, hidden powers

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:35.710 align:middle line:84%
of the dodecahedron,
we must first

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:38.080 align:middle line:84%
know that each of
the Platonic solids

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.540 align:middle line:84%
has a complementary
opposite form,

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:44.370 align:middle line:90%
known as its Platonic dual.

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Every Platonic solid has
a specific number of faces

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:51.810 align:middle line:84%
and a specific number of corner
points, each one of which

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:54.750 align:middle line:84%
is known technically as a
vertex or in the plural are

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.580 align:middle line:90%
called vertices.

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.860 align:middle line:84%
These numbers of
vertices perfectly

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:02.760 align:middle line:84%
match the number of faces on
a different Platonic solid

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.190 align:middle line:90%
referred to as its dual form.

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And in return, the number
of faces on this Platonic

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:12.990 align:middle line:84%
solid matches the number
of vertices on its dual.

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:16.530 align:middle line:84%
The thought form in the mind of
God behind the Platonic duals

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:20.130 align:middle line:84%
is that when the duals are
placed inside one another,

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:23.400 align:middle line:84%
each vertex or
corner of both forms

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:28.650 align:middle line:84%
appear in the exact center
of a face of its dual.

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:30.930 align:middle line:84%
This principle is connected
to the divine thought

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:34.410 align:middle line:84%
form of the point in the
center of the circle.

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:37.590 align:middle line:84%
The corner of the
Platonic solid is a point.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And the face shape
of its dual form

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.660 align:middle line:90%
is the surrounding boundary.

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:46.590 align:middle line:84%
So just as air and Earth are
two complementary opposite

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:49.890 align:middle line:84%
polarities, so the
octahedron of the air

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:53.850 align:middle line:84%
and the cube of the
Earth are Platonic duals.

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.400 align:middle line:84%
There are six square
faces on the cube

00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:00.810 align:middle line:84%
in the center of which perfectly
fit the six corners or vertices

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:02.880 align:middle line:90%
of the octahedron.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:06.660 align:middle line:84%
There are eight triangular
faces on the octahedron

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:11.010 align:middle line:84%
in the center of which fit the
eight vertices of the cube.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:14.020 align:middle line:84%
The physical element
essential for life is water.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Water is the basis of living
beings animated by the ether.

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:20.880 align:middle line:84%
For the ether to operate
in a living body,

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.900 align:middle line:90%
water must be present.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.740 align:middle line:10%
And so we find that the
icosahedron of water

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.560 align:middle line:10%
and the dodecahedron of
the etheric life force

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.740 align:middle line:10%
are Platonic duals,
complementary matched

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.230 align:middle line:10%
polarities.

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:37.530 align:middle line:84%
There are 20 triangular
faces on the icosahedron

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:41.370 align:middle line:84%
in the center of which the
20 vertices of a dodecahedron

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:45.390 align:middle line:84%
fit and 12 pentagonal
faces on the dodecahedron

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:48.930 align:middle line:84%
in the center of which the 12
vertices of the icosahedron

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:49.860 align:middle line:90%
fit.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:53.520 align:middle line:84%
This, of course, leaves one
Platonic solid left over--

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.890 align:middle line:90%
the tetrahedron of fire.

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.230 align:middle line:84%
The tetrahedron is
paired with itself.

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:00.030 align:middle line:90%
It is self-dual.

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:02.790 align:middle line:84%
The tetrahedron has
four faces in which

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:07.430 align:middle line:84%
fit the four corners of
an inverted tetrahedron.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:10.790 align:middle line:84%
This Platonic dual with its
upright and inverted pair

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:13.520 align:middle line:84%
of nested tetrahedra
is connected

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:17.030 align:middle line:84%
to movements of energy
upwards and downwards,

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:20.150 align:middle line:84%
based on the direction, the
point of each tetrahedra

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:21.680 align:middle line:90%
is oriented.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.550 align:middle line:84%
This is connected to the form of
the human Merkaba soul vehicle

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:29.150 align:middle line:84%
as the star tetrahedron,
which we mentioned earlier

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:32.690 align:middle line:84%
and which we will explore
in a later episode.

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:35.780 align:middle line:84%
These Platonic solid
forms and their duals

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.700 align:middle line:84%
can be applied to
the human energy

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:41.240 align:middle line:84%
field for powerful energetic
and spiritual purposes.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.170 align:middle line:90%


00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Returning now to our
discussion of the dodecahedron,

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.480 align:middle line:84%
in addition to the
dodecahedron being paired

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.630 align:middle line:84%
with the icosahedron
as its Platonic dual,

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:56.680 align:middle line:84%
there is also a very deep
esoteric tradition regarding

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.480 align:middle line:90%
the double dodecahedra.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.540 align:middle line:84%
In other words, two
dodecahedrons connected

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.610 align:middle line:90%
face to face.

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:06.190 align:middle line:10%
In the work of the great
European Rosicrucian

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.880 align:middle line:10%
teacher, Rudolf Steiner,
the double dodecahedra

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.150 align:middle line:10%
was used as the foundation
stone for creating

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:17.350 align:middle line:10%
a new Temple of the Grail, which
was the building known today

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:20.620 align:middle line:10%
as the first Goetheanum,
which was built in Dornach,

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:24.280 align:middle line:10%
Switzerland, during
World War I. Tragically,

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.070 align:middle line:10%
this amazing Rosicrucian
Temple of the Grail

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:31.180 align:middle line:10%
was destroyed, burned to the
ground by a Nazi saboteur

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:34.090 align:middle line:10%
shortly after it was completed.

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:36.610 align:middle line:84%
A copper double
dodecahedron was placed

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:39.520 align:middle line:84%
in the Earth as the
foundation stone

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:43.130 align:middle line:84%
for this new Temple
of the Grail.

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:46.160 align:middle line:84%
It represented the
union of the macrocosm

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.860 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual world,
which was the larger

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:52.640 align:middle line:84%
dodecahedron with the microcosm
of our physical world,

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:55.190 align:middle line:90%
the smaller dodecahedron.

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:57.650 align:middle line:84%
The double
dodecahedra was echoed

00:22:57.650 --> 00:22:59.480 align:middle line:84%
in the construction
of the building

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.690 align:middle line:84%
by the twin domes
over the temple.

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:04.940 align:middle line:10%
An important aspect
of the dodecahedron

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:07.520 align:middle line:10%
is that this form
was obscured or kept

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.750 align:middle line:10%
hidden in some
ancient traditions,

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:12.730 align:middle line:10%
including the ancient
Greek tradition.

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:16.370 align:middle line:84%
As the form related to the
dynamic life force itself,

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:19.480 align:middle line:84%
which stands above all the
other Platonic solids, all

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.480 align:middle line:84%
the other elements of
nature, there was the concern

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.090 align:middle line:84%
that the misuse
of this form could

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:29.600 align:middle line:84%
lead to unleashing catastrophic
forces of destruction.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.260 align:middle line:84%
This concern proved
to be prophetic.

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:35.650 align:middle line:10%
During my time as a nuclear,
biological, chemical warfare

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:38.920 align:middle line:10%
defense instructor for
the US Marine Corps,

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:43.000 align:middle line:10%
I discovered declassified photos
from the Manhattan Project

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.890 align:middle line:10%
related to one of the first
forms of the atomic bomb.

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:50.530 align:middle line:10%
During the creation of the
atomic bomb in the Manhattan

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:53.170 align:middle line:10%
Project of World War
II, it was discovered

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:55.060 align:middle line:10%
that to create the
critical mass leading

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:59.740 align:middle line:10%
to the explosion of the bomb
called Fat Man, a plutonium

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.650 align:middle line:10%
implosion device,
the bomb required

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:06.910 align:middle line:10%
being shaped as a
dodecahedron so that when

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:10.250 align:middle line:10%
the outer spherical shell
of the bomb was removed,

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:13.330 align:middle line:10%
there were inside 12
pentagonal sections

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:19.230 align:middle line:10%
which acted as lenses to make
the atomic explosion possible.

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:22.985 align:middle line:10%
The dodecahedron was the
form of the atomic bomb.

00:24:22.985 --> 00:24:26.228 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:26.228 --> 00:24:29.644 align:middle line:90%
[EXPLOSION]

00:24:29.644 --> 00:24:31.120 align:middle line:90%


00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.180 align:middle line:84%
With the atomic explosion,
the ancient warning

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.970 align:middle line:84%
of the destructive power,
if the dodecahedron

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:39.700 align:middle line:84%
of the etheric life force
were ever to be misused,

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:43.030 align:middle line:84%
was shown to be
true and prophetic.

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Nuclear weapons literally
disintegrate matter out

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:49.690 align:middle line:90%
of physical existence entirely.

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:52.630 align:middle line:84%
One of the major scientists
in the Manhattan Project,

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Robert Oppenheimer,
famously said a quote

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:59.020 align:middle line:84%
from the Hindu holy text,
the "Bhagavad Gita,"

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:03.010 align:middle line:84%
when he saw the destructive
power of the atomic blast.

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:08.840 align:middle line:10%
"Now I am become death,
the destroyer of worlds."

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.440 align:middle line:10%
One of the scientists in
the Manhattan Project,

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.010 align:middle line:10%
Professor Robert Moon from
the University of Chicago,

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:17.530 align:middle line:10%
later published his
insights into how

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:20.470 align:middle line:10%
the entire periodic
table of elements, which

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:23.410 align:middle line:10%
is the identification of
literally every element which

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:26.480 align:middle line:10%
creates physical
matter, is, in fact,

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:30.390 align:middle line:10%
based on the Platonic solids.

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:33.210 align:middle line:10%
The Robert Moon model
of the periodic table

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:36.910 align:middle line:10%
suggests that the atomic
number for each element,

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:38.940 align:middle line:10%
in other words, the
number of protons,

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.850 align:middle line:10%
is linked to a hidden geometry.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:45.840 align:middle line:10%
Each proton is positioned
exactly at a vertex,

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.790 align:middle line:10%
in other words,
one of the corners

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:53.010 align:middle line:10%
of multiple Platonic solids
nested inside one another.

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:55.620 align:middle line:10%
In the Robert Moon
model, element number

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:58.800 align:middle line:10%
8 on the periodic
table, oxygen, is

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.080 align:middle line:10%
created from each
of its eight protons

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:04.800 align:middle line:10%
being at one of the eight
corners of the cube.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.900 align:middle line:10%
Just as the ancients
said that the cube is

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:10.650 align:middle line:10%
the form for creating the Earth
element, so element number 8,

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:14.130 align:middle line:10%
oxygen, which makes
the cube, comprises

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:20.070 align:middle line:10%
62.55% of all the atoms
in the Earth's crust.

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:23.820 align:middle line:10%
Adding in the six vertices
to create the octahedron

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:26.440 align:middle line:10%
brings us up to
element number 14,

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:30.540 align:middle line:10%
which is silicon, which makes
up the next largest number

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:32.190 align:middle line:10%
of atoms in the Earth's crust--

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:35.340 align:middle line:10%
21.22%.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.920 align:middle line:84%
So the combined
cube and octahedron,

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:43.530 align:middle line:84%
which materialize oxygen and
silicon on the periodic table,

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:48.600 align:middle line:84%
then together make up
84% of the Earth's crust.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Adding in the icosahedron's
12 vertices brings us up

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:53.820 align:middle line:90%
to element 26--

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:54.990 align:middle line:90%
iron.

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Then adding in the
dodecahedron's 20 vertices

00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:00.600 align:middle line:84%
brings us up to
element number 46--

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.090 align:middle line:90%
palladium.

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, note that the
tetrahedron is not

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:07.710 align:middle line:84%
part of the nested
forms in the Moon

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:10.080 align:middle line:90%
model of the periodic table.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.450 align:middle line:84%
It was described
by Professor Moon

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:16.050 align:middle line:84%
as being used for
positions of the neutrons.

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Also, remember what
we said before,

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:21.090 align:middle line:84%
that the tetrahedron is the
only one of the Platonic solids

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:24.630 align:middle line:84%
which does not have a different
Platonic solid as a dual.

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:27.780 align:middle line:90%
It is self-dual.

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Robert Moon then
realized that creating

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:34.290 align:middle line:84%
a second set of these
nested Platonic solids

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:39.960 align:middle line:84%
creates two full dodecahedra
with internal Platonic solids.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:43.890 align:middle line:84%
These two dodecahedra
connect on a pentagonal face

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:49.380 align:middle line:84%
at element number 86, the
radioactive gas radon.

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:52.110 align:middle line:84%
From a spiritual perspective
of the Platonic solids,

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:56.430 align:middle line:84%
this double dodecahedra can be
seen as the first dodecahedron

00:27:56.430 --> 00:28:00.420 align:middle line:84%
being the etheric life force
of the heavens, the first 46

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:03.660 align:middle line:84%
lighter elements on the
periodic table joined

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:08.010 align:middle line:84%
with the etheric life force of
the Earth, the final 46 denser

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:11.310 align:middle line:84%
elements, which creates the
total number of naturally

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:12.900 align:middle line:90%
occurring elements on Earth--

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.260 align:middle line:90%
92.

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:18.080 align:middle line:10%
We discussed earlier the
Rosicrucian understanding

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.720 align:middle line:10%
from before the time of
the Manhattan Project

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.810 align:middle line:10%
and the Robert
Moon elements model

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:26.600 align:middle line:10%
of the double
dodecahedron as the union

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:32.330 align:middle line:10%
of heaven and Earth, the
macrocosm and the microcosm.

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:34.730 align:middle line:84%
As there are 92
naturally occurring

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:37.730 align:middle line:84%
elements on the periodic
table to create elements

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:42.050 align:middle line:84%
beyond radon, more corners
on the twin dodecahedra

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:46.340 align:middle line:84%
must become available for
protons to manifest there.

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:48.980 align:middle line:84%
In the Robert Moon
model, this happens

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:53.450 align:middle line:84%
through the face connection
between the dodecahedra,

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:57.980 align:middle line:84%
breaking apart like a hinge to
make more proton nesting sites

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.950 align:middle line:90%
available for later elements.

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:05.540 align:middle line:10%
To create element number
91, protactinium, the line

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:07.850 align:middle line:10%
of connection must
break to then have

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:10.610 align:middle line:10%
only one point of connection.

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:13.730 align:middle line:10%
This means to create the final
naturally occurring element

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:15.170 align:middle line:10%
on the periodic table--

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:18.890 align:middle line:10%
radioactive uranium--
the two dodecahedra

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:21.750 align:middle line:10%
must break apart completely.

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:25.200 align:middle line:84%
From a spiritual perspective
of the dodecahedron

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:29.040 align:middle line:84%
as the form of the ether,
the vital life force,

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.560 align:middle line:84%
this breaking apart the
connection between the life

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.890 align:middle line:84%
force of the Earth and the
life force of the heavens

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:39.300 align:middle line:84%
leads to the destruction we
see with nuclear weapons.

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.970 align:middle line:84%
From an engineering
perspective, breaking apart

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:46.080 align:middle line:84%
the connection between the
two nuclear proton dodecahedra

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:49.140 align:middle line:90%
creates instability.

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:51.990 align:middle line:10%
This results in element
number 92, uranium,

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:55.540 align:middle line:10%
releasing toxic radiation
and makes possible

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.140 align:middle line:10%
the fission of uranium.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.120 align:middle line:10%
Fission was a
critical breakthrough

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.910 align:middle line:10%
in which Robert Moon
himself participated

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:05.730 align:middle line:10%
during the Manhattan
Project at the University

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:09.150 align:middle line:10%
of Chicago, leading
to the use of uranium

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:12.150 align:middle line:10%
and later man-made
elements like plutonium

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:16.200 align:middle line:10%
to create devastating nuclear
weapons which literally

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.660 align:middle line:10%
vaporize physical
matter out of existence

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:21.090 align:middle line:10%
in the blink of an eye.

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:24.630 align:middle line:10%
The use of the dodecahedron
for the first nuclear weapon

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:27.750 align:middle line:10%
and the deeper geometric
structures behind that,

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:31.260 align:middle line:10%
explained in Professor
Robert Moon's model,

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:34.710 align:middle line:10%
show the true power and
the fundamental nature

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:38.410 align:middle line:10%
of the Platonic solids for
the creation of our world.

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:42.960 align:middle line:84%
It is also a warning of the
destructive power of the misuse

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:46.320 align:middle line:90%
of sacred geometry knowledge.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.680 align:middle line:10%
However, just as the
misuse of the dodecahedron

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:53.520 align:middle line:10%
form of the etheric life force
gave rise to nuclear weapons

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:57.570 align:middle line:10%
annihilating life, so
the wise use of this form

00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:00.840 align:middle line:10%
is fundamentally linked
to the giving of life

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:06.390 align:middle line:10%
and even transmuting deadly
materials into safe forms.

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:10.440 align:middle line:10%
We saw that element
number 46, palladium,

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.990 align:middle line:10%
was the form of
the first completed

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:16.710 align:middle line:10%
dodecahedron in the Robert Moon
model of the periodic table

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:18.330 align:middle line:10%
of elements.

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:20.820 align:middle line:84%
With the dodecahedron
being known as the gateway

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.550 align:middle line:84%
to the ether, the
vital life force itself

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:25.860 align:middle line:84%
in ancient teachings,
this indicates

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:29.130 align:middle line:84%
that palladium, the
completed dodecahedron,

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:32.190 align:middle line:84%
may have unusual
alchemical, energetic,

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:34.150 align:middle line:90%
and life-protecting effects.

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, this has recently
been scientifically proven.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:40.920 align:middle line:10%
Researchers at Pennsylvania
State University

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:44.790 align:middle line:10%
found that lethal chemicals,
such as military grade nerve

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:47.250 align:middle line:10%
agents, could be
rendered completely

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:51.030 align:middle line:10%
harmless through interaction
with, you guessed it,

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:52.200 align:middle line:10%
palladium.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:56.220 align:middle line:10%
Palladium causes the toxic
chemicals to oxidize,

00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:01.050 align:middle line:10%
breaking down the lethal nerve
agent or other toxic substances

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:06.720 align:middle line:10%
to water and carbon dioxide,
along with other harmless ions.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.270 align:middle line:84%
The palladium converts
water and oxygen

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:14.520 align:middle line:84%
into hydrogen peroxide, a
powerful oxidizing agent.

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:18.870 align:middle line:84%
This is an incredible fact that
the element palladium indicated

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:22.560 align:middle line:84%
in the Robert Moon model as
the completed dodecahedron,

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:25.290 align:middle line:84%
the etheric life
force itself, has now

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:27.720 align:middle line:84%
been proven to transform
the deadliest chemical

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.180 align:middle line:84%
substances into
basic elements which

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:32.940 align:middle line:90%
do not harm living beings.

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:36.810 align:middle line:84%
In fact, palladium and its
closely related element,

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:39.270 align:middle line:84%
platinum, have
been found to have

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:43.590 align:middle line:84%
a wide range of unusual
energetic and detoxifying

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:46.840 align:middle line:90%
properties.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.910 align:middle line:84%
They are used in
catalytic converters

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:52.510 align:middle line:84%
to break down the harmful
exhaust from cars.

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:56.320 align:middle line:10%
Palladium and platinum have been
used as the cathode and anode,

00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:00.430 align:middle line:10%
simply meaning the negative and
positive poles for cold fusion

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:04.210 align:middle line:10%
experiments which created
much more energy than put

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:07.930 align:middle line:10%
into the system, essentially
gating energy to enter in,

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:10.660 align:middle line:10%
from outside the system.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:12.580 align:middle line:84%
We described in
our first episode

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:15.400 align:middle line:84%
the net of geometric
energy which stands

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.440 align:middle line:90%
behind all physical matter.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And this net appears
to be connected

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:24.850 align:middle line:84%
to the excess energy generated
in cold fusion experiments.

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:26.800 align:middle line:84%
This connection
to the net concept

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.890 align:middle line:84%
is also demonstrated by one
of the alternative names

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:34.060 align:middle line:84%
for cold fusion, which is
lattice-assisted nuclear

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:36.850 align:middle line:84%
reactions with the
lattice meaning

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:39.700 align:middle line:90%
what we have called the net.

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:41.860 align:middle line:84%
The containing of the
other Platonic solids

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:44.290 align:middle line:84%
within the dodecahedron
has also been

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:49.130 align:middle line:84%
used in a variety of
esoteric healing systems.

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:52.760 align:middle line:10%
One example is the work
of Theo Gimbel of Britain

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:56.630 align:middle line:10%
who used combinations of
color and Platonic geometry

00:33:56.630 --> 00:34:01.340 align:middle line:10%
to target and heal different
functional systems of the body.

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:04.910 align:middle line:84%
In Gimbel's system, the
red tetrahedron of fire

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:07.130 align:middle line:84%
is used to activate
the nerve sense

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:09.780 align:middle line:90%
system rooted in our head.

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:13.969 align:middle line:84%
The yellow octahedron of air
is used to activate and balance

00:34:13.969 --> 00:34:18.199 align:middle line:84%
the respiratory system in
the throat and upper chest.

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:20.900 align:middle line:84%
The blue icosahedron
of water is used

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:23.690 align:middle line:84%
to activate and balance
the metabolic system

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:25.100 align:middle line:90%
in the abdomen.

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And the green cube of Earth
is used to ground and balance

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:32.270 align:middle line:90%
at the base of the abdomen.

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Note that in Gimbel's
system, which was partially

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:37.820 align:middle line:84%
based on the Rosicrucian
work of Rudolf Steiner,

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:42.380 align:middle line:84%
the double dodecahedron is used
over the top and bottom halves

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.880 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.659 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have surveyed
the Platonic solids,

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:50.480 align:middle line:84%
the five perfect
divisions of the sphere.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.610 align:middle line:84%
We can now see
the larger context

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:55.969 align:middle line:84%
of the information presented
in our first episode

00:34:55.969 --> 00:34:57.860 align:middle line:84%
where we showed
how the Earth grid

00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:01.220 align:middle line:84%
itself is related to
these Platonic solids,

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:06.320 align:middle line:84%
particularly to the Platonic
duals of the dodecahedron

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:10.000 align:middle line:90%
with the icosahedron.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.940 align:middle line:10%
We can now experience
the power of these forms

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:17.260 align:middle line:10%
directly through an extremely
important, but little known

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:21.670 align:middle line:10%
Rosicrucian practice which
uses these forms to activate

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:25.150 align:middle line:10%
new circuits in the human mind.

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:27.670 align:middle line:84%
In episode 2, we explored
how the human mind

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:31.180 align:middle line:84%
is a microcosm of
the divine mind which

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:33.370 align:middle line:84%
means that we can both
access packed thought

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:38.800 align:middle line:84%
forms from higher beings and
also generate these ourselves.

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:41.680 align:middle line:84%
One method which helps
to activate this power

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:44.290 align:middle line:84%
is visualizing the
Platonic solids

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:48.910 align:middle line:84%
and moving them through
specific transformations.

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Some people say they
are unable to visualize.

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:54.790 align:middle line:84%
However, unless they
were born blind,

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:56.980 align:middle line:90%
this is not actually true.

00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Rather, the truth is that
they simply have not fully

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.980 align:middle line:84%
activated that internal
energy pathway which

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.900 align:middle line:90%
allows them to visualize.

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:09.820 align:middle line:84%
That pathway exists, but it's
not strong or stable yet.

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Just as physical muscles atrophy
if not used and exercised,

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:17.020 align:middle line:84%
so these inner spiritual
activation pathways

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:20.080 align:middle line:84%
are weak until we
flex them regularly

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.900 align:middle line:90%
through internal exercises.

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:26.500 align:middle line:84%
By visualizing these key
thought forms in the mind of God

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:29.110 align:middle line:84%
within our own
mind and exploring

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:31.630 align:middle line:84%
their transformations,
we can greatly

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:34.150 align:middle line:84%
strengthen our own
capacity to perceive

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:37.870 align:middle line:84%
the sacred geometry thought
forms from other beings

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:42.280 align:middle line:84%
and our ability to create
packed thought forms ourselves.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.860 align:middle line:84%
This opens up higher
states of consciousness

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:48.310 align:middle line:84%
and more conscious
communication with other people.

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:52.720 align:middle line:84%
This shift of consciousness
can also transform and optimize

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:55.140 align:middle line:90%
our spiritual destiny.

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:57.030 align:middle line:84%
If you'd like to do
the practice now,

00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:00.330 align:middle line:84%
please see the companion
video for this episode.

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, please
set an intention

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:06.370 align:middle line:84%
to come back and do the
practice at a later time.

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Join us for our
next episode when

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:11.340 align:middle line:84%
we will discover the
sacred geometric form which

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:14.700 align:middle line:84%
holds the secret of
balancing and blending

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:17.220 align:middle line:90%
powerful opposite energies.

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.920 align:middle line:84%
This form even holds
the key to understanding

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.530 align:middle line:84%
the different types
of nonphysical beings

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:25.260 align:middle line:84%
that every person will
encounter on the path

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:28.620 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual development and
how to discern between those

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:31.620 align:middle line:84%
whose influences are
harmful and those

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.020 align:middle line:90%
who are highly beneficial.

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.940 align:middle line:84%
You will also learn
how to activate

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:39.090 align:middle line:84%
the next level of the
grid of life design

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:40.680 align:middle line:90%
in your energy body.

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:44.310 align:middle line:84%
Activating this core pattern
can help transform your life

00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:46.230 align:middle line:90%
and your spiritual destiny.

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:47.040 align:middle line:90%
See you then.
