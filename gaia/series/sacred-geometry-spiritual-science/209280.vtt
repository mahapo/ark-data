00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:22.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Welcome back.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.450 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Dr.
Robert J. Gilbert.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.660 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we will explore
the ancient Egyptian energy

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.480 align:middle line:84%
science we introduced
back in episode one,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.120 align:middle line:84%
to its modern rebirth
in Egypt today

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.750 align:middle line:84%
as a truly universal
energy science.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.750 align:middle line:84%
This is the amazing
story of biogeometry

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.210 align:middle line:84%
and its founder, the
Egyptian architect

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.720 align:middle line:84%
and natural scientist,
Dr. Ibrahim Karim.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.230 align:middle line:84%
I've been very fortunate to
have known Dr. Karim for over 20

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.670 align:middle line:84%
years and to have him as my
own mentor in biogeometry.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.810 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO LOGO]

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.920 align:middle line:10%
The practical vibrational
energy science in biogeometry

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.870 align:middle line:10%
is more extensive, more
precise, clearer, and safer

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.350 align:middle line:10%
than anything previously
revealed to the public.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Before we get into the specifics
of the remarkable practical

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.920 align:middle line:84%
applications of this
new energy science,

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.060 align:middle line:84%
let's look at one of Dr. Karim's
most important new discoveries.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.330 align:middle line:84%
He identified a
profound natural power

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.710 align:middle line:84%
which can harmonize the energy
field of all living beings,

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.610 align:middle line:84%
and which was not known at
all to the French researchers.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim asked
the question, what

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.600 align:middle line:84%
is the vibrational quality,
the power of the center

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.210 align:middle line:90%
rather than the outer boundary?

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And with that question he
opened up a vast new world

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.110 align:middle line:84%
for balancing the
energy of living beings.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim was able to identify
the energy quality coming

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.410 align:middle line:84%
from the center,
discovering that it

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.930 align:middle line:84%
is a universal power without
polarized specialization.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.450 align:middle line:84%
It is very different
from any of the 12 band

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.930 align:middle line:84%
vibrations discovered
by French researchers.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.949 align:middle line:84%
Bands which nature uses to
create specialized powers,

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:13.970 align:middle line:84%
which makes things individual
and different from one another.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.620 align:middle line:84%
The energy of the center
performs a very different task.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.460 align:middle line:84%
It unites and harmonizes
all the diverse powers

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.090 align:middle line:84%
of creation which manifests
through the different bands

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.790 align:middle line:84%
so that they can all
work together in harmony,

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.990 align:middle line:84%
rather than creating
chaos and destruction.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.100 align:middle line:84%
This vibrational field of the
center of any physical form

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.640 align:middle line:84%
holds a powerful resonance
with the original unified field

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.130 align:middle line:84%
state, which spiritual
traditions refer

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.170 align:middle line:90%
to as the divine plane.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.770 align:middle line:84%
The unified source of
all creation, the one

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.020 align:middle line:90%
from which all things come.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.820 align:middle line:84%
The fractal nature
of the universe

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.720 align:middle line:84%
creates a microcosm in
every physical object,

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.640 align:middle line:84%
in every physical body of the
original zero-dimensional point

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.840 align:middle line:84%
which gave rise to creation
which modern physics calls

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.220 align:middle line:90%
the singularity.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.660 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO LOGO]

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.770 align:middle line:84%
This original center created
the sphere of space and time

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.240 align:middle line:84%
out from it, in what
physicists call the Big Bang.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.210 align:middle line:84%
This original center,
the singularity

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.450 align:middle line:84%
is what appears
microcosmically in the center

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.850 align:middle line:90%
of all physical objects.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Every center resonates
with, and channels

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:29.960 align:middle line:90%
into the physical world.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.840 align:middle line:84%
The energy quality of that
original unified field energy.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.870 align:middle line:84%
As Dr. Karim himself
puts it, the center

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.430 align:middle line:84%
is a transcendental gateway
beyond space and time.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.770 align:middle line:90%
He means this quite literally.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.820 align:middle line:84%
The center is a gateway
to a vast inner world.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim began to put together
the puzzle pieces regarding

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.260 align:middle line:84%
how ancient spiritual
texts are in fact advanced

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.970 align:middle line:90%
books of physics.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.520 align:middle line:84%
A physics of energy
quality which

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.290 align:middle line:84%
goes far beyond our modern
physical science of quantity.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.750 align:middle line:84%
As a simple example,
we described

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.450 align:middle line:84%
how ancient traditions
understood the point

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.850 align:middle line:84%
in the center of
the circle to be

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.620 align:middle line:84%
the thought form
in the mind of God

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.410 align:middle line:90%
behind all physical creation.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.990 align:middle line:84%
This symbol was the
image for the Godhead,

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.830 align:middle line:84%
for the Freemasons,
and the Rosicrucians,

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.950 align:middle line:84%
the symbol of the
sun for astrology

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.180 align:middle line:84%
and the symbol for
gold in alchemy.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.690 align:middle line:10%
However, this pattern is
actually an energy circuit

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.080 align:middle line:10%
diagram showing
initiates where to find

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.940 align:middle line:10%
the energy of the one, the
unified field, the Godhead

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.700 align:middle line:10%
in the center of
all physical forms.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.810 align:middle line:84%
The surrounding sphere shows the
crystallized physical boundary

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.360 align:middle line:84%
around all physical
objects which

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.110 align:middle line:84%
holds the different specialized
powers and functions

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.630 align:middle line:84%
of the 144 sub bands of
the vibrational spectrum.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.620 align:middle line:84%
In summary, we can say that the
French radiesthesia researchers

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.790 align:middle line:84%
had cracked the code of all
the different specialized

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.820 align:middle line:84%
vital energies which
give physical beings

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.900 align:middle line:84%
and systems their unique
powers through their discovery

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.420 align:middle line:84%
of the vibrational
spectrum bands which

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.780 align:middle line:84%
appear on the periphery
of all objects.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.050 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim then added
the missing master key

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.620 align:middle line:84%
which unlocks nature's
vital energy system.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.350 align:middle line:84%
The discovery and
practical application

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.650 align:middle line:84%
of the energy quality
of the center.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.620 align:middle line:84%
This is the gateway to
the unified field which

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.760 align:middle line:84%
balances all living beings,
which harmonizes and centers

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.320 align:middle line:84%
all the diverse energies of
the vibrational spectrum.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.130 align:middle line:10%
With this, the keys to the lost
ancient Egyptian vibrational

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.520 align:middle line:10%
science have been
restored in our lifetime

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.180 align:middle line:10%
through the work of a
modern Egyptian researcher.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.480 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Karim and over 50
years of intensive research

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.800 align:middle line:10%
found ways to directly detect,
concentrate, and practically

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.250 align:middle line:10%
apply this universal
harmonizing energy

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.310 align:middle line:10%
from the center, along
with the polarized energies

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.720 align:middle line:10%
from the French research.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim calls this power
of the center "the One energy

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.580 align:middle line:90%
quality."

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.480 align:middle line:84%
The unified source
of all that is.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.450 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Karim spent decades
mapping out precisely which

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.360 align:middle line:10%
sacred geometric
shapes, which sounds,

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.840 align:middle line:10%
which number sequences,
movements, angles

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.560 align:middle line:10%
and proportions can
resonate with, and radiate

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.570 align:middle line:10%
this profound harmonizing
energy into the physical world.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.330 align:middle line:84%
This is the foundation
of the new energy

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.390 align:middle line:90%
science of biogeometry.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim was able to develop
a radiesthesia pendulum

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.570 align:middle line:84%
which would emanate this
energy from its tip,

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.630 align:middle line:84%
and which can also detect
the presence of this energy

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:01.170 align:middle line:84%
from any person,
place, or thing.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Students and practitioners
use this pendulum

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.290 align:middle line:84%
to detect the increasing
intensity of this harmonizing

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.220 align:middle line:84%
energy when applying
biogeometry design methods,

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.970 align:middle line:84%
and when transforming the
energy field of living beings,

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.490 align:middle line:84%
or transforming
Earth energy lines,

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.480 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic fields, the
energy in homes and offices,

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.190 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.310 align:middle line:84%
Part of this vibrational
pendulum's resonant design

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.150 align:middle line:84%
is 16 disks which help
manifest the energy

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.520 align:middle line:84%
quality of the center,
which is why it

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.870 align:middle line:90%
is known as the BG16 pendulum.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim has also developed
more advanced versions

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.360 align:middle line:84%
of the French vibrational
tools to detect

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.750 align:middle line:84%
the 12 bands of the
vibrational spectrum which

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:49.140 align:middle line:84%
are also used in practical
biogeometry methods.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.500 align:middle line:10%
These tools can also
differentiate the harmful

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:58.080 align:middle line:10%
from the beneficial components
of each band of energy.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.420 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim found
certain bands within

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:05.250 align:middle line:84%
the French 12-band system, which
resonate particularly strongly

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.620 align:middle line:90%
with the energy of the center.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.890 align:middle line:10%
Early in his research, he had
identified three qualities

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:14.070 align:middle line:10%
within specific
sub band locations

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:19.320 align:middle line:10%
leading to the concept of
the Biogeometry 3, or BG3,

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:23.070 align:middle line:10%
to identify the energy
quality of the center.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:26.460 align:middle line:10%
The term BG3 became known
as the technical name

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:31.290 align:middle line:10%
for this universal harmonizing
energy of the center.

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:33.809 align:middle line:84%
Since that time, Dr.
Karim has gone on

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:36.960 align:middle line:84%
to identify 28
specific sub bands

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.870 align:middle line:84%
within the French
12-band system, which

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.620 align:middle line:84%
resonates intensely with
the energy of the center.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.320 align:middle line:84%
These 28 sub bands
are applied together

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.340 align:middle line:84%
in some advanced biogeometry
energy-balancing tools

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.960 align:middle line:84%
to create very strong
beneficial energy fields.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.900 align:middle line:84%
One of the key components
which resonates with the center

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.940 align:middle line:84%
is what Dr. Karim refers to as
the higher harmonic of gold.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.630 align:middle line:10%
This is a literal
golden energy emanation,

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.810 align:middle line:10%
the same as is described
in spiritual traditions

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:11.590 align:middle line:10%
all around the world.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.470 align:middle line:84%
This is the golden
radiance found

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:17.730 align:middle line:84%
around the heads or the
entire bodies of the saints.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.000 align:middle line:84%
This golden energy quality
resonates more strongly

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.360 align:middle line:84%
in a person's energy field
when they connect to the center

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.140 align:middle line:90%
to the divine.

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.520 align:middle line:84%
So a saint is someone who has
a very strong golden energy

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.430 align:middle line:84%
in their field at all times
because unlike most of us,

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:37.530 align:middle line:84%
they never fall out of their
resonance with the divine plane

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:40.260 align:middle line:84%
into lower states
of consciousness.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.430 align:middle line:84%
This golden energy is the marker
of connecting to the center,

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.770 align:middle line:90%
to the divine plane.

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.650 align:middle line:84%
This golden energy appears
in a person's energy field

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:54.330 align:middle line:84%
during intense inner experiences
of prayer and blessing,

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:58.280 align:middle line:84%
when we literally
connect to the divine.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.740 align:middle line:84%
Ancient traditions knew
that this golden energy

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.050 align:middle line:84%
from the center can
also be manifested

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.600 align:middle line:84%
through temple
science applications,

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.600 align:middle line:84%
of particular sacred
geometry shapes,

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:13.220 align:middle line:84%
of sounds, colors, number
sequences, et cetera, which

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Kareem has rediscovered
in his over 50 years

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.920 align:middle line:90%
of intensive research.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.180 align:middle line:84%
This BG3 energy of the center
is the universal donor,

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.780 align:middle line:84%
the same healing energy as
we connect to in the highest

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.750 align:middle line:90%
levels of prayer and blessing.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Whereas one can
get too much of any

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:34.460 align:middle line:84%
of the 12 bands of
polarized energies

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.250 align:middle line:84%
discovered by the French,
because they push energy

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:42.020 align:middle line:84%
strongly one direction or
another to activate or sedate.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:46.220 align:middle line:84%
The BG3 energy connects
everything directly to center,

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.700 align:middle line:84%
to its own perfect
equilibrium point.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:53.420 align:middle line:84%
You cannot overdose on the
BG3 energy of the center,

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:57.890 align:middle line:84%
but you can overdose on too much
of any polarized energy from

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:02.270 align:middle line:84%
the 12 bands, which would create
imbalance through too much yin,

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.210 align:middle line:84%
or too much yang,
too much sedation,

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:08.000 align:middle line:90%
or too much activation.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim has been able
to make biogeometry

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.480 align:middle line:84%
a truly multidimensional
energy science, going

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.840 align:middle line:84%
far beyond modern materialistic
science which can only

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.400 align:middle line:84%
detect energy on the physical
and electromagnetic levels.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.120 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Karim was able to discover
the geometric forms which

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.360 align:middle line:10%
resonate with the many
different planes of nature

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.760 align:middle line:10%
using the seven
planes model found

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.700 align:middle line:10%
in modern Western esotericism.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.920 align:middle line:84%
He found that the zero
dimensional point--

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.100 align:middle line:84%
the immaterial
center-- is what always

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.230 align:middle line:90%
connects to the divine plane.

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the circle, the
boundary of creation

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:49.370 align:middle line:84%
is the form which resonates
with the physical plane.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim revealed a deep
secret within sacred geometry.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.030 align:middle line:84%
That specific
geometric forms act

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:59.840 align:middle line:84%
as antennas to connect to
energy from specific higher

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.910 align:middle line:90%
planes of creation.

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.010 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Karim was then
able to identify

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:07.340 align:middle line:10%
the geometric forms which
resonate with all seven

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.990 align:middle line:10%
planes of nature.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:10.850 align:middle line:10%
These geometric
patterns are taught

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:13.310 align:middle line:10%
in the advanced
biogeometry trainings,

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:17.990 align:middle line:10%
making it possible to detect
or direct specific vibrations

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:21.050 align:middle line:10%
to, or from, any plane.

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:23.510 align:middle line:84%
In the human body,
these different planes

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:28.560 align:middle line:84%
appear microcosmically as our
physical and subtle bodies.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.610 align:middle line:10%
So for example, the geometric
form which connects us

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:33.200 align:middle line:10%
to the astral plane--

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.350 align:middle line:10%
which is our first subtle
body of consciousness--

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:39.890 align:middle line:10%
is the form of the pyramid
or hemisphere, which

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:42.800 align:middle line:10%
we saw in our last
episode as a form which

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.130 align:middle line:10%
radiates the mysterious
negative green carrier

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.980 align:middle line:10%
wave used in ancient Egypt.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.100 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid and hemisphere
are also then the forms

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.910 align:middle line:84%
which we can use to
detect and direct energy

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:59.060 align:middle line:90%
in our own emotional body.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.230 align:middle line:10%
Because our emotional
body is, in fact,

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:06.740 align:middle line:10%
our microcosmic piece of the
astral plane inside ourselves.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.350 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Karim then discovered
the geometric shapes

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:15.170 align:middle line:10%
which act as tuning antennas for
the sub planes of every plane.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:18.260 align:middle line:84%
These are modifications of
the core geometric shape

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.380 align:middle line:90%
of the overall plane itself.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Here, we see the
geometric forms which

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:27.890 align:middle line:84%
can connect us to the 12 sub
planes of the astral plane,

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:30.140 align:middle line:84%
which again appears
within the human being

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.540 align:middle line:90%
as our emotional subtle body.

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:36.560 align:middle line:84%
This is the true energy
science behind what we think

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.310 align:middle line:90%
of today as sacred geometry.

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Because this energy
science of biogeometry

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.080 align:middle line:84%
is so profound and
far-reaching, it

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:48.140 align:middle line:84%
can be challenging to find
short descriptions to try

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:50.690 align:middle line:90%
to summarize it for the public.

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:52.490 align:middle line:84%
Biogeometry is
sometimes referred

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:56.330 align:middle line:84%
to as the science of
creating sacred power spots,

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.210 align:middle line:84%
because what sacred
power spots really are

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:02.600 align:middle line:84%
is the places where this
divine universal harmonizing

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:06.650 align:middle line:84%
power concentrates
into a particular area.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Every power spot
radiates strong BG3.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:13.100 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it is the defining
characteristic which

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.400 align:middle line:90%
makes an area true power spot.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Biogeometry methods for
detecting the energy quality

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.520 align:middle line:84%
of the center can
detect any power spot

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.380 align:middle line:90%
anywhere on the Earth.

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:28.550 align:middle line:84%
This includes major power spots
such as Giza plateau, or even

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:33.140 align:middle line:84%
tiny power spots which exist
in every home or office, which

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.200 align:middle line:84%
can be amplified through
biogeometry techniques

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.920 align:middle line:90%
to balance energy in a location.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.160 align:middle line:84%
Because the human physical
body is a fractal,

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.940 align:middle line:84%
a microcosm of the
Earth itself, we also

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:50.660 align:middle line:84%
have power spots in our
body just as the Earth does.

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:54.560 align:middle line:84%
We call these power spots in
our body chakras, acupuncture

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.360 align:middle line:90%
points, et cetera.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.410 align:middle line:84%
These power spots, whether on
the Earth or in the human body,

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:04.130 align:middle line:84%
or even out in space with
planets, stars, et cetera,

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:07.160 align:middle line:84%
can be detected at a
distance through photographs

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.680 align:middle line:90%
as easily as in person.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.620 align:middle line:84%
Biogeometry can also create
through design methods

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:18.570 align:middle line:84%
the same energy as found in
natural power spots on Earth

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:22.290 align:middle line:84%
at any location, including
in homes and offices.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:27.510 align:middle line:84%
It is truly the science of
creating sacred power spots.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.630 align:middle line:84%
Another way that biogeometry
is sometimes described

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.360 align:middle line:84%
is as nature's own
design language

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:40.200 align:middle line:84%
of shape, sound, color, motion,
number, angle, and proportion.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.560 align:middle line:84%
It reveals and makes practical
the design methods which

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:47.400 align:middle line:84%
nature itself uses to create
all the energetic functions

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.720 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Biogeometry is also known
as the physics of quality,

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:57.060 align:middle line:84%
a rebirth of ancient knowledge
into a new energy science which

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.240 align:middle line:84%
complements and expands our
current physics of quantity

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:05.140 align:middle line:84%
into a truly holistic and
complete energy science.

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.380 align:middle line:84%
The first 20 years
of Dr. Karim's work

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:11.640 align:middle line:84%
in developing biogeometry were
done quietly in his own home

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.320 align:middle line:84%
while he was known
to the public only

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.900 align:middle line:84%
for his architectural
design work.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.780 align:middle line:10%
Then in the early
1990s, a director

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.090 align:middle line:10%
of the Egyptian
National Research Center

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.520 align:middle line:10%
invited Dr. Karim
to have his work

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.850 align:middle line:10%
in biogeometry evaluated there.

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:29.550 align:middle line:84%
At first, the assembled
scientists and medical doctors

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.820 align:middle line:84%
at the research center were
quite hostile to Dr. Karim

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.940 align:middle line:84%
and to the entire idea
that geometric forms

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.590 align:middle line:84%
could emanate subtle energies
which affect living beings.

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:43.170 align:middle line:84%
They presented Dr.
Karim with a challenge--

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.440 align:middle line:84%
with two fast replicating
yeast cultures placed

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:51.300 align:middle line:84%
in Petri dishes, he was to kill
one using only a geometric form

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:54.260 align:middle line:90%
and leave the other untouched.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim replied that
biogeometry is not

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:01.340 align:middle line:84%
for killing, establishing
at the outset

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:05.599 align:middle line:84%
his firm ethical boundaries in
using this work only for good

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:08.089 align:middle line:90%
and never for harm.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:11.000 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Karim then stated that
he would paralyze the life

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.349 align:middle line:10%
functions in one yeast culture
with a simple geometric form,

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:19.400 align:middle line:10%
stopping its normal
replication, but not killing it

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.400 align:middle line:10%
while leaving the other
culture replicating normally.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.859 align:middle line:84%
This was easy for
Dr. Karim based

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:27.170 align:middle line:84%
on his knowledge of
the specialized powers

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:29.520 align:middle line:84%
of the different
vibrational bands,

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.630 align:middle line:84%
especially the
negative green band.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:34.490 align:middle line:10%
The results of
this first project

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:38.450 align:middle line:10%
are described in the scientific
report titled, "Observations

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle line:10%
on the Interaction of
Bio-geometrical Shapes

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.270 align:middle line:10%
and the Growth of
Microorganisms."

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:48.320 align:middle line:84%
This is from the National
Research Center of Egypt.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.170 align:middle line:84%
It was authored by
Professor Dr. Badr-El

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Din, the head of the Department
of Microbial Chemistry.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:57.980 align:middle line:10%
After stating the success
of the experiment,

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:01.760 align:middle line:10%
the author went on to say,
"Further experimentation

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.330 align:middle line:10%
on this type of interaction
between the bio-geometrical

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:08.570 align:middle line:10%
shapes and a variety
of microorganisms

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:10.860 align:middle line:10%
is a top priority."

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.190 align:middle line:84%
The essence of this
type of interaction

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:15.950 align:middle line:84%
seems to surpass
explanation through

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:21.710 align:middle line:84%
our traditional and classical
knowledge in basic science.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:23.750 align:middle line:84%
This highly
successful result led

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:27.230 align:middle line:84%
to the formation of a working
group at the Egyptian National

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:31.010 align:middle line:84%
Research Center led
by Dr. Karim to study

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:35.500 align:middle line:84%
the effects of geometric
forms on life functions.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:39.160 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is
truly biogeometry.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.560 align:middle line:10%
After proving that
geometric forms emit

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.350 align:middle line:10%
subtle energies which
affect living beings,

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:46.630 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Karim was invited
to participate

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:49.600 align:middle line:10%
in the Egyptian national
hepatitis C research

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.930 align:middle line:10%
project being held at
the pharmaceutical school

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:56.560 align:middle line:10%
of Al-Azhar University in Cairo,
which is one of the oldest

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.750 align:middle line:10%
universities in the world.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.940 align:middle line:10%
Hepatitis C has
been a major issue

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.640 align:middle line:10%
in Egypt and throughout
North Africa,

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.530 align:middle line:10%
leading to this
comparative study

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:10.090 align:middle line:10%
of all available remedies in
both allopathic and alternative

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:11.380 align:middle line:10%
medicine.

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Everything from
Chinese medicine herbs

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:16.090 align:middle line:84%
to pharmaceuticals
such as interferon

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:18.340 align:middle line:90%
were included in the project.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim is not
a medical doctor,

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.860 align:middle line:84%
and he always emphasizes
that he simply does the work

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.020 align:middle line:84%
and then leaves it up to
the medical authorities

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.850 align:middle line:90%
to report on the results.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:31.930 align:middle line:84%
He makes no medical claims
whatsoever for biogeometry.

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:36.640 align:middle line:84%
He lets the medical authorities
describe its empirical effects.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.500 align:middle line:84%
One of the incredible
new methods

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:42.520 align:middle line:84%
which Dr. Karim has developed
is known as biosignatures.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:47.140 align:middle line:84%
In this method, Dr. Karim used
radiesthesia principles to tune

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:49.750 align:middle line:84%
into one specific
band of vibration

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.010 align:middle line:90%
inside the human body.

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And then to painstakingly
trace out the precise movement

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:59.830 align:middle line:84%
pattern of that energy
within an organ, a gland,

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:03.190 align:middle line:90%
or other physical body system.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim had discovered
that the powers

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:07.900 align:middle line:84%
of each vibrational
band become expressed

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:10.660 align:middle line:84%
through specific movement
patterns of energy

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.580 align:middle line:84%
within different parts
of the human body.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.000 align:middle line:84%
One of the key
principles of biogeometry

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.200 align:middle line:84%
is energy into shape
creates function.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.990 align:middle line:10%
This means that
energy is programmed

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:26.830 align:middle line:10%
to perform a specific biological
function through putting

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:30.400 align:middle line:10%
the energy into a
precise movement pattern,

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:34.340 align:middle line:10%
creating what we
think of as a shape.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:38.450 align:middle line:10%
Again this is truly
biogeometry, the programming

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:41.270 align:middle line:10%
of life functions through
the geometric shape

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:46.970 align:middle line:10%
pattern of how vital energy
moves inside the body.

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim had found that
when the energy movement

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:52.080 align:middle line:84%
pattern becomes
distorted in the body,

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:56.240 align:middle line:84%
whether through physical injury,
the presence of pathogens,

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.150 align:middle line:84%
emotional suppression,
et cetera,

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:04.010 align:middle line:84%
that the associated health
function then becomes impaired.

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:07.160 align:middle line:84%
This understanding that correct
internal energy movement

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.790 align:middle line:84%
is essential to health, and
impaired energy movement

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:13.910 align:middle line:84%
leads to illness as
a classical concept

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:18.410 align:middle line:84%
found in Chinese medicine
and many other traditions.

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:21.620 align:middle line:84%
However, Dr. Karim created
an entirely new process

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:23.330 align:middle line:90%
to solve the issue.

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:27.410 align:middle line:10%
He identified many hundreds of
these three dimensional energy

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:30.060 align:middle line:10%
movements inside the human body.

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.570 align:middle line:10%
Then simplified them
down to two dimensional

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:36.260 align:middle line:10%
outlines which he
calls biosignatures.

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim found that
when a person had

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:42.110 align:middle line:84%
this biosignature energy
movement pattern projected

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:45.410 align:middle line:84%
into their energy field, or
if they wore that pattern

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:48.200 align:middle line:84%
on their body, that
the correct energy flow

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.800 align:middle line:84%
pattern of the biosignature
could couple with the impaired

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.110 align:middle line:84%
flow in the body's
energy system,

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:57.110 align:middle line:84%
restoring the correct
flow pattern, and thus

00:21:57.110 --> 00:22:00.170 align:middle line:90%
the needed biological function.

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, when
properly drawn,

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:06.980 align:middle line:84%
the biosignature also emanates
the BG3 energy quality,

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.490 align:middle line:84%
harmonizing the effect
of the polarized power

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:13.190 align:middle line:84%
of the vibrational
bands found within

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:16.160 align:middle line:90%
that particular biosignature.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And so the doctors running the
Egyptian national hepatitis C

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:23.090 align:middle line:84%
research project were surprised
when Dr. Karim told them

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:26.270 align:middle line:84%
that he did not want to
personally meet anyone

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:29.900 align:middle line:84%
in the group of 300 hep
C patients in the group

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:33.140 align:middle line:84%
that he was assigned because
he said that once they saw

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:35.180 align:middle line:84%
the results that he
was going to get,

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:38.030 align:middle line:84%
they would then say that
somehow Dr. Karim had

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:40.490 align:middle line:84%
auto suggested the
results to the patients

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:42.470 align:middle line:90%
if he had met them.

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:46.040 align:middle line:84%
So what Dr. Karim did is
he simply used radiesthesia

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:50.900 align:middle line:84%
to test for which biosignatures
people with hep C needed.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:54.170 align:middle line:84%
This turned out to not only
be biosignatures for the liver

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:57.170 align:middle line:84%
functions, as would
be expected given that

00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:00.200 align:middle line:84%
hep C roots in the
liver, but also required

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.050 align:middle line:84%
the addition of
biosignatures for the heart,

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:05.810 align:middle line:84%
for immunity and
for other functions

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:09.200 align:middle line:90%
to get the full needed effect.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.300 align:middle line:84%
These first
biogeometry medallions

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:15.260 align:middle line:84%
from the 1990s containing
the needed biosignatures

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:19.160 align:middle line:84%
for the patients in Dr.
Karim's hep C research group

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.220 align:middle line:84%
were printed similar
to computer chips.

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Current biogeometry
medallions are

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:27.110 align:middle line:84%
available to the general
public and are not

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:29.150 align:middle line:90%
made for specific illnesses.

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:31.220 align:middle line:84%
They are collections
of biosignatures

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.950 align:middle line:90%
for general wellness.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:35.810 align:middle line:10%
In the first stage
of the project,

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:38.660 align:middle line:10%
the biogeometry medallions
with biosignatures

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:43.550 align:middle line:10%
were given to 300 hep C
patients for six months.

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:47.540 align:middle line:84%
The only treatment they received
was wearing the medallion

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:49.220 align:middle line:90%
with these biosignatures.

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:50.990 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else.

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:55.310 align:middle line:84%
The results were an
astonishing 90% normalization

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:58.280 align:middle line:84%
of enzyme levels, much
higher than anything

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.100 align:middle line:84%
else tested in the
entire project,

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.280 align:middle line:84%
but higher than any other
pharmaceutical, any other type

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.320 align:middle line:90%
of alternative medicine.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.830 align:middle line:10%
The head of the project for the
Egyptian government, Dr. Taha

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:14.120 align:middle line:10%
Khalifa announced the results
on national Egyptian Television.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.200 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.890 align:middle line:90%


00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:22.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Although not all
participants were tested,

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:26.780 align:middle line:10%
some participants also showed
complete viral clearance.

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim has now
made the majority

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:32.600 align:middle line:84%
of biosignatures public with
his recent book entitled,

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.480 align:middle line:84%
"Biogeometry
Signatures, although

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.540 align:middle line:84%
the complete radiesthesia
methods for working with them

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:41.450 align:middle line:84%
are too involved to be
described in the book.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:43.460 align:middle line:84%
The complete
radiesthesia methods

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:46.970 align:middle line:84%
for applying biosignatures are
now available to the public

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:51.670 align:middle line:84%
through international
biogeometry online trainings.

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:54.530 align:middle line:84%
After these successful
results with human subjects,

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:58.210 align:middle line:84%
the next project was to shows
beneficial biogeometry results

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:00.080 align:middle line:90%
with animals.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:03.490 align:middle line:84%
This was first done with the
chick farm pilot project,

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:07.780 align:middle line:84%
with monitoring and reporting
by Dr. Ahmed Hussein and Mahmoud

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Nasr of the Egyptian
Ministry of Agriculture.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.470 align:middle line:10%
In this project, Dr. Karim
had the poultry facility

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:16.690 align:middle line:10%
stop giving
antibiotics and growth

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:19.480 align:middle line:10%
hormones to the chickens,
and instead change

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.840 align:middle line:10%
the vibrational harmonics of
the building in which they

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.370 align:middle line:10%
were kept.

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:27.340 align:middle line:10%
For this project, he used
another of his innovations

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.980 align:middle line:10%
which he calls color balancing.

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:32.290 align:middle line:84%
In this method,
colors are placed

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:35.020 align:middle line:84%
in specific locations
inside the room

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:37.390 align:middle line:90%
to create the needed energies.

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:40.000 align:middle line:84%
However, this is
usually misunderstood

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.760 align:middle line:84%
by those not trained
in biogeometry

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.240 align:middle line:84%
who think that it is similar
to color therapy in using

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.750 align:middle line:84%
the energy from the red band
or the yellow band et cetera

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:51.200 align:middle line:90%
directly.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:55.700 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in this method, the
color used is unimportant.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:58.690 align:middle line:84%
It is not that color,
which creates the effect.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:01.570 align:middle line:84%
It is the placement
of that specific color

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:04.540 align:middle line:84%
in an extremely precise
geometric location

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:07.480 align:middle line:84%
in the room, which then
activates the energy

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.550 align:middle line:90%
of the center of the room.

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:11.980 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
correct geometric placement

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:16.570 align:middle line:84%
of the color creates strong
BG3 inside the entire room

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:18.290 align:middle line:90%
or building.

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:21.650 align:middle line:84%
To create the effect, the
exact placement of any color

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:24.920 align:middle line:84%
must be determined through
direct radiesthesia testing.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:28.640 align:middle line:84%
It's not based on any
rigid pattern of placement.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Different colors will
require placement

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.050 align:middle line:84%
in different
locations of the room

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:36.350 align:middle line:84%
to create the activation
of the center effect, which

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:38.660 align:middle line:90%
creates BG3.

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.580 align:middle line:90%
The results were dramatic.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.710 align:middle line:84%
The chicks stayed
healthy without the use

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:44.450 align:middle line:90%
of any antibiotics.

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:47.420 align:middle line:84%
They reached full
weight in 37 days

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:49.910 align:middle line:84%
rather than the
usual 45 days it took

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:52.880 align:middle line:84%
when using growth
hormones, and the amount

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.890 align:middle line:84%
of food consumed to
reach full weight

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:58.010 align:middle line:84%
was reduced, showing more
efficient utilization

00:26:58.010 --> 00:26:59.360 align:middle line:90%
of the food consumed.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but the flesh
of the chickens was full of BG3

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:06.380 align:middle line:84%
energy quality from
having grown up

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:09.020 align:middle line:90%
in this enriched environment.

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.990 align:middle line:84%
This same effect of having
a growing body integrate

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:15.050 align:middle line:84%
BG3 deep into its
internal structure

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:19.490 align:middle line:84%
can be created for any animal,
plant, or a human being

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:22.880 align:middle line:84%
by using biogeometry
techniques to fill their living

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:26.780 align:middle line:90%
environment with BG3.

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:29.390 align:middle line:84%
The next project was to
prove that the benefits seen

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:34.130 align:middle line:84%
with humans and animals
also applies to plants.

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:37.400 align:middle line:84%
One early project was
conducted at an apple orchard

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.910 align:middle line:84%
with Professor Peter Mols at
an agricultural university

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:42.500 align:middle line:90%
in Holland.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim instructed that
his biogeometry section

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:48.830 align:middle line:84%
of the apple orchard not be
given artificial fertilizer

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:51.110 align:middle line:90%
nor use any pesticide.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:54.500 align:middle line:84%
He was told that if they did not
use pesticides on his apples,

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:58.350 align:middle line:84%
that they would be absolutely
destroyed by pest infestations.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:01.730 align:middle line:84%
So in response, Dr. Karim gave
an incredible demonstration

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:03.530 align:middle line:90%
to the farmers.

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim placed a
color on a wooden stake

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:10.160 align:middle line:84%
and found a plant with an
infesting insect on it.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.160 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim slowly moved the stake
in a circle around the plant.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And when the stake
reached a precise angle,

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.640 align:middle line:90%
the insect jumped off the plant.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.850 align:middle line:84%
When Dr. Karim moved the
stake away from that position,

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:26.090 align:middle line:84%
the insect jumped
back on the plant.

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:29.450 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Karim showed that this
was because this form of color

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:33.020 align:middle line:10%
balancing, having the
color on the stake moved

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:37.850 align:middle line:10%
to a precise angle to the plant
created an emanation of BG3

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:39.740 align:middle line:10%
from the plant.

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:43.070 align:middle line:84%
This neutralized the
weakness vibrational signal

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:45.980 align:middle line:84%
from the plant which
attracted the insect.

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:48.890 align:middle line:84%
As the plant's weakness
vibrational emanation

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:52.130 align:middle line:84%
caused the insect in,
to perform its task

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:56.990 align:middle line:84%
in nature, which is to tear
down and reprocess the plant.

00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And so Dr. Karim
was able to have

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:01.850 align:middle line:84%
zero pest issues
with his test orchard

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:06.200 align:middle line:84%
despite using no
pesticides whatsoever.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.560 align:middle line:84%
In addition to using modified
color balancing techniques,

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim also used
specific biogeometric shapes

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:18.200 align:middle line:84%
which created strong BG3 energy
fields around the apple trees.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:22.520 align:middle line:84%
This included the L pattern,
the 45-degree emitter

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.580 align:middle line:84%
and other biogeometric
patterns taught now

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:28.430 align:middle line:90%
in public online trainings.

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:30.980 align:middle line:84%
The result was that
the biogeometry apples

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:34.580 align:middle line:84%
had higher nutrient counts than
the conventionally grown apples

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.370 align:middle line:84%
with no pesticide
residue, et cetera.

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:40.400 align:middle line:84%
But not only that,
another amazing result

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.310 align:middle line:84%
was seen when the conventionally
grown apples picked

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:46.490 align:middle line:84%
at the same time as the
biogeometry apples were

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:49.070 align:middle line:84%
kept in a heated
apartment for a month.

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:52.250 align:middle line:84%
The conventional apples
completely rotted through,

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:54.320 align:middle line:84%
whereas the
biogeometry apples were

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:58.640 align:middle line:84%
completely fresh after the
month in the heated apartment.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim has commented that
this is an important result

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:03.860 align:middle line:90%
which requires more research.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.690 align:middle line:84%
Today, the food
industry is wanting

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:10.190 align:middle line:84%
to increase toxic irradiation
of fresh fruits and vegetables

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:13.790 align:middle line:84%
to stop the decay process
so that produce lasts longer

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:17.570 align:middle line:84%
on the shelves but this is
killing the enzymatic life

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:20.450 align:middle line:90%
force inside the produce.

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Biogeometry methods are very
different because they increase

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:27.290 align:middle line:84%
the shelf life through
strengthening its vital forces,

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:30.870 align:middle line:90%
not through destroying it.

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Another plant
research project was

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:37.050 align:middle line:84%
conducted with engineer
Adele Amar on the Red Sea

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:39.180 align:middle line:90%
with sweet potatoes.

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:41.040 align:middle line:84%
The Red Sea has some
of the highest salt

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.980 align:middle line:84%
content in the world,
leading to very high cost

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:46.260 align:middle line:90%
for desalinization.

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:49.110 align:middle line:84%
The project was to determine
if salt water could

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:51.540 align:middle line:84%
be used directly
to irrigate crops,

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:54.540 align:middle line:84%
if the vibrational
quality of the salt water

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:56.840 align:middle line:90%
was changed and improved.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.590 align:middle line:84%
The conventional answer
would be that this

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.390 align:middle line:90%
is absurd and impossible.

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:03.450 align:middle line:90%
But Dr. Karim agreed to try it.

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim created
biogeometrically-modified

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:09.780 align:middle line:84%
containers to hold the salt
water from the Red Sea,

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:12.330 align:middle line:84%
and to channel the
water to the growing

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:16.320 align:middle line:84%
sweet potatoes, and to hold the
growing sweet potatoes inside

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.430 align:middle line:90%
of.

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:21.480 align:middle line:84%
These geometric containers
infused strong BG3

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:26.790 align:middle line:84%
into the salt water, but did
not remove any salt whatsoever.

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:30.030 align:middle line:10%
The results of the
project were astonishing.

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:33.570 align:middle line:10%
Those sweet potatoes grown with
the fresh water grew normally,

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:36.240 align:middle line:10%
and those grown with salt
water from the Red Sea

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:40.330 align:middle line:10%
with no vibrational modification
did not grow at all.

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:42.450 align:middle line:10%
However, the sweet
potatoes grown

00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:45.780 align:middle line:10%
with salt water
infused with BG3 energy

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:49.110 align:middle line:10%
grew better than those
with the fresh water.

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:52.950 align:middle line:84%
This result completely upends
the current scientific dogma

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:57.150 align:middle line:84%
that the physical-chemical
constituents are everything,

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:59.850 align:middle line:90%
and that vibration is nothing.

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:01.920 align:middle line:84%
This shows that even
with the high salt

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:06.450 align:middle line:84%
content still present, that this
chemical aspect was completely

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:10.320 align:middle line:84%
secondary to the vibrational
qualities present, which appear

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.287 align:middle line:90%
to be the primary factor.

00:32:12.287 --> 00:32:13.510 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO LOGO]

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Another a major
application of biogeometry

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:21.610 align:middle line:84%
has been an experimental
work with toxic radiations,

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:25.040 align:middle line:90%
such as electromagnetic fields.

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.700 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Karim was invited to the
village of Hamburg, Switzerland

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.910 align:middle line:10%
following the installation
of a large cell tower array

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:36.170 align:middle line:10%
into the center of town, which
led to terrible problems.

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Swiss national media reported
that citizens in the town

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:42.230 align:middle line:84%
had to move to sleep
in their root cellars

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:46.580 align:middle line:84%
to try to get away
from the radiation.

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And that the song birds
and mammals left the area,

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:53.660 align:middle line:84%
and that farm animals that
could not leave the area

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.750 align:middle line:84%
miscarried, or had
tumors on their organs

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:59.180 align:middle line:90%
when slaughtered for food.

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim used
biogeometric shapes

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.740 align:middle line:84%
to harmonize the
emissions from the cell

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:06.350 align:middle line:84%
towers and other
electromagnetic sources

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:10.400 align:middle line:84%
in the area, leading
to a dramatic recovery.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.030 align:middle line:84%
These geometry corrective
forms are not electrical.

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:18.380 align:middle line:10%
They are based on pure geometric
shapes used in combination

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:22.580 align:middle line:10%
with tuning in specific
energetic angles, which produce

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:26.510 align:middle line:10%
both BG3 as well as
strengthening energies

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:29.570 align:middle line:10%
from the 12 vibrational bands.

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:32.720 align:middle line:84%
The results were so positive,
with a huge remission

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:36.980 align:middle line:84%
of local electro-sensitivity
issues that Dr. Karim was given

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:41.000 align:middle line:84%
the key to the city by the
Hamburg town council, which

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.730 align:middle line:84%
then petitioned the Swiss
national government to make

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:47.630 align:middle line:84%
the same modifications to the
entire cellular communications

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:50.890 align:middle line:84%
grid in the country
of Switzerland.

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:53.560 align:middle line:84%
This led to Dr. Karim
making similar corrections

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:57.040 align:middle line:84%
for the nearby village of
Hirschberg, Switzerland,

00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:00.310 align:middle line:84%
this time while being observed
by the Swiss authority

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:04.300 align:middle line:84%
for mobile communication,
with similar highly beneficial

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.570 align:middle line:90%
results.

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:07.840 align:middle line:84%
However, all the
projects were completely

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.870 align:middle line:84%
paid for out of Dr.
Karim's own pocket,

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:13.659 align:middle line:84%
and no funding was offered
by the Swiss government

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:15.820 align:middle line:90%
for any further work.

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Swiss national media reported
on the incredible results,

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.790 align:middle line:84%
from the transformation
of the cellular networks

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:23.800 align:middle line:84%
in these cities,
and how they formed

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:28.060 align:middle line:84%
a blueprint for electromagnetic
field remediation work,

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:30.655 align:middle line:84%
possible now throughout
the entire world.

00:34:30.655 --> 00:34:33.409 align:middle line:90%


00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:37.040 align:middle line:84%
In other biogeometry research
on radiation reported

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:41.360 align:middle line:84%
on by the World Journal of
Medical Sciences in 2014,

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.120 align:middle line:84%
radioactive building
materials were purchased

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.400 align:middle line:90%
to make cages for mice.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.679 align:middle line:84%
Mice kept in the
radioactive cages

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:51.929 align:middle line:84%
began to develop
tumors, as expected.

00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:53.989 align:middle line:84%
However, the World
Journal Report

00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:57.440 align:middle line:84%
authored by multiple specialists
from the Egyptian National

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Research Center noted
that those rats kept

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:03.290 align:middle line:84%
in the same kind of
radioactive cages

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:07.310 align:middle line:84%
but with special biogeometrical
shapes next to the cage

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:12.450 align:middle line:84%
did not develop the pathological
lung, liver, kidney,

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:17.120 align:middle line:84%
and thyroid tissue effects
from the radioactive cages.

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:20.540 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Karim was also a friend
of the late Japanese water

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:23.750 align:middle line:10%
researcher, Masaru
Emoto, who showed

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:27.230 align:middle line:10%
how beneficial energies
create beautiful geometric

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:31.430 align:middle line:10%
crystallization
patterns in water.

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:36.240 align:middle line:10%
It was Dr. Karim who introduced
Emoto's work to Egypt.

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.300 align:middle line:10%
Emoto commented
that when he made

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.700 align:middle line:10%
images of water
crystallization changes

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:43.850 align:middle line:10%
from environmental energies,
that only a small number

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:45.680 align:middle line:10%
of the pictures
came out perfectly.

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.870 align:middle line:10%
And these are the ones
that you see in his books.

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:51.110 align:middle line:10%
Emoto noted that
the energy fields

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:53.090 align:middle line:10%
from the biogeometry cube--

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:56.720 align:middle line:10%
as seen here-- and from
other biogeometry tools

00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:00.230 align:middle line:10%
made the most consistent
beneficial crystallizations

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:05.630 align:middle line:10%
in water that he had seen
from any source in the world.

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:08.960 align:middle line:84%
Biogeometry training makes
deeply esoteric concepts

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:12.050 align:middle line:90%
practical and easy to apply.

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:14.000 align:middle line:84%
For example, as
mentioned earlier,

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.200 align:middle line:84%
biogeometry techniques make it
possible to identify weaknesses

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.800 align:middle line:84%
which can be corrected at any
of the seven planes levels.

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.860 align:middle line:84%
It also allows testing to
be done at all sub plane

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:27.380 align:middle line:90%
levels for all seven planes--

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:32.660 align:middle line:84%
for human beings, animals,
plants, minerals, locations,

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:35.930 align:middle line:90%
homes, and offices, et cetera.

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:38.870 align:middle line:10%
These geometric forms
which act as antennas

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:42.350 align:middle line:10%
to allow us to test energies
on specific sub planes

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:47.240 align:middle line:10%
can also be modified to help to
correct the energetics of any

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.290 align:middle line:10%
of these subtle levels.

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:50.860 align:middle line:90%


00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.050 align:middle line:84%
It's been fascinating
for me personally

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:57.400 align:middle line:84%
to see the precise imbalances
needing correction in people

00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:01.810 align:middle line:84%
and in their homes on specific
levels of the emotional plane,

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:05.860 align:middle line:84%
or the mental plane, revealing
the energetic background

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:10.070 align:middle line:84%
behind the issues which
arise on the physical plane.

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:13.040 align:middle line:10%
These methods allow us to
make visible and conscious

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:16.760 align:middle line:10%
what was described in the
ancient world as the net,

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:19.910 align:middle line:10%
the complete matrix
of invisible energies

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:23.720 align:middle line:10%
and higher planes which affect
the energy and consciousness

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.980 align:middle line:10%
of every human being.

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And to then find powerful
corrections and activations

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:34.460 align:middle line:84%
to help manifest our
full spiritual potential.

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:37.730 align:middle line:84%
This brief introduction
barely scratches the surface

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:40.520 align:middle line:84%
of the power and
practical applications

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.830 align:middle line:90%
within biogeometry.

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:46.100 align:middle line:10%
There is so much more,
such as the precise methods

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:49.640 align:middle line:10%
to turn toxic Earth
energies at any location

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:53.630 align:middle line:10%
into a power spot full of BG3.

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:middle line:84%
Or the pattern from the
Egyptian temple walls,

00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:00.800 align:middle line:84%
which is used in biogeometry
to navigate multi-dimensionally

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:05.120 align:middle line:84%
through the human energy
field, or how biogeometry uses

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:06.320 align:middle line:90%
the torus pattern--

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.570 align:middle line:84%
which we described
earlier in this series--

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:12.500 align:middle line:84%
for advanced space-time
navigation, and then

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.020 align:middle line:84%
applies that pattern
to tune and balance

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:17.870 align:middle line:84%
the hemispheres of
the human brain.

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Or the story of how Dr.
Karim used radiesthesia

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:25.550 align:middle line:84%
to pinpoint and excavate
the location of the 12 water

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:28.100 align:middle line:84%
springs in the
Sinai, which Moses

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:33.290 align:middle line:84%
found with his staff for the
12 tribes during the exodus.

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:35.060 align:middle line:84%
As the higher
harmonic of gold is

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:37.760 align:middle line:84%
the hallmark of the
divine plane energies,

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:42.620 align:middle line:84%
so Dr. Karim has noted that
the true purpose of biogeometry

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.690 align:middle line:84%
is to help manifest
the great goal

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:49.100 align:middle line:84%
of so many spiritual traditions
throughout human history--

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:53.120 align:middle line:84%
the creation of
a new golden age.

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.430 align:middle line:84%
I hope you'll choose
to join us in helping

00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:59.010 align:middle line:84%
to create this new golden
age for all of humanity

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:01.040 align:middle line:90%
and for all life on Earth.
