00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.910 align:middle line:10%
I'm Dr. Robert J. Gilbert,
your host for this series.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.940 align:middle line:10%
In this episode,
we're going to explore

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.390 align:middle line:10%
one of the most important
patterns in sacred geometry.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.620 align:middle line:84%
This pattern holds the secret of
creating a portal to the divine

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.620 align:middle line:84%
through balancing
opposite polarities.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.790 align:middle line:84%
It also holds the key to one of
the most misunderstood topics

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.260 align:middle line:84%
in all of spiritual science, how
to identify the different types

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.990 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual beings
and influences

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.070 align:middle line:84%
which we will all encounter
on the spiritual path.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.440 align:middle line:84%
This pattern will lead
us into hidden aspects

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.420 align:middle line:84%
of the tree of
life, where we will

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.570 align:middle line:84%
see that it has deep roots in
the ancient Egyptian temple

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.710 align:middle line:90%
science.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.250 align:middle line:10%
You will then learn how to
activate in your energy field

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.010 align:middle line:10%
a key part of the
grid of life design,

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.130 align:middle line:10%
or GOLD, which can
transform your life

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.950 align:middle line:10%
and your spiritual destiny.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.700 align:middle line:84%
So what is this sacred geometry
pattern I've been referring to?

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.570 align:middle line:84%
It is the form known classically
as the vesica piscis,

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.080 align:middle line:84%
and today is better known
as the vesica pisces.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.300 align:middle line:84%
It is called the vesica
pisces because it

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.810 align:middle line:84%
is the origin of the fish
symbol of Christianity, which

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.250 align:middle line:84%
is called the
ichthys, with Pisces

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.610 align:middle line:84%
being the sign of the
fish in the Zodiac.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.460 align:middle line:84%
Christianity developed
as a major religion

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.220 align:middle line:84%
during the Age of
Pisces, when the sun

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.330 align:middle line:84%
rises on the vernal equinox,
the first day of spring,

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.805 align:middle line:84%
in front of the
constellation Pisces.

00:01:51.805 --> 00:01:54.900 align:middle line:90%


00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.760 align:middle line:84%
In previous
episodes, we explored

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.070 align:middle line:84%
how the circle
and the sphere are

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.360 align:middle line:84%
the primordial perfect forms
for containing new life.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.810 align:middle line:84%
The egg in a human
mother's womb is a sphere

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.120 align:middle line:84%
which, upon
fertilization, becomes

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.680 align:middle line:84%
the primordial container of the
new living human being, coming

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.030 align:middle line:84%
from spirit into
the physical world.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Within embryology are keys
to many secrets of creation.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.970 align:middle line:84%
When fertilized, the egg
will divide into two.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.360 align:middle line:84%
This is the recreation,
with every living being,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.090 align:middle line:84%
of the original
primordial movement

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.640 align:middle line:84%
from the unified
field of the divine

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.980 align:middle line:84%
into the manifested world,
through polarity and duality.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.310 align:middle line:84%
The movement from divine unity
into physical manifestation

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.090 align:middle line:84%
through duality is one key
part of the pact thought

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.550 align:middle line:84%
form in the mind of God, which
manifests as the vesica pisces.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.110 align:middle line:90%


00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.510 align:middle line:10%
There's a very important
spiritual reason

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.210 align:middle line:10%
for this movement from unity
to duality and polarity.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.330 align:middle line:84%
That is that duality
creates movement,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.140 align:middle line:84%
such as the attraction and
repulsion between polarities

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.990 align:middle line:84%
and magnets, or the
flow of electrons

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.820 align:middle line:90%
in electrical systems.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Only through the reunion
of opposite polarities

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.030 align:middle line:84%
does new life come
into the world.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Another important divine thought
form behind the vesica pisces

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.560 align:middle line:84%
is that it is a
spiritual portal.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.950 align:middle line:84%
The almond-shaped
vesica pisces portal

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.000 align:middle line:84%
is formed whenever there is a
perfect connection between two

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.840 align:middle line:84%
circles or spheres holding
opposite complementary

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.560 align:middle line:84%
energies, between yin
and yang, hot and cold,

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.040 align:middle line:84%
masculine and feminine,
light and dark.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.500 align:middle line:84%
The perfect divine
union of the two

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.340 align:middle line:84%
occurs when the outer physical
boundary of each circle

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.840 align:middle line:84%
connects to the divine center
of its complementary circle.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Then, between these two centers,
the almond-shaped vesica portal

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.300 align:middle line:90%
appears.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.910 align:middle line:84%
This is the portal
between the worlds.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.960 align:middle line:84%
This opening up of a spiritual
portal to higher energies

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.720 align:middle line:84%
is not simply an
abstract philosophy.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.560 align:middle line:84%
It's linked to modern science
and ongoing new energy

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.240 align:middle line:90%
research.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.570 align:middle line:84%
These magnetic and electrical
polarity movements of energy

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.920 align:middle line:84%
are the foundation of all
of our modern technology.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.720 align:middle line:84%
We even see the vesica oval form
being created in magnetic field

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.900 align:middle line:90%
lines.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.710 align:middle line:84%
Note that this vesica
form in the field lines

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.430 align:middle line:84%
only appears when two opposite
polarities are adjacent

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.300 align:middle line:84%
and attracting, not when
two similar polarities

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.450 align:middle line:90%
are adjacent and repelling.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.990 align:middle line:10%
Modern cutting-edge research
into scalar energies

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.230 align:middle line:10%
indicates that it is possible
to generate more energy

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.980 align:middle line:10%
in a physical system than
is contained originally

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.680 align:middle line:10%
in the physical components
through creating

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.160 align:middle line:10%
a gating effect, which brings
in energy from somewhere

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.580 align:middle line:10%
outside of our
three-dimensional system.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.380 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways
which has been found

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.340 align:middle line:84%
to create these unusual
energy gating effects

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.520 align:middle line:84%
is to buck two opposing
electrical currents together,

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.540 align:middle line:84%
creating an opening to
higher-dimensional scalar

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.010 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.790 align:middle line:10%
This is seen in scalar and
zero point technology circuit

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:25.930 align:middle line:10%
designs.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.450 align:middle line:10%
The interaction of
these two energy fields

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.940 align:middle line:10%
when they come
together into a center

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.480 align:middle line:10%
is postulated to open
up a hyperspace portal

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.000 align:middle line:10%
beyond the
three-dimensional world.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.120 align:middle line:84%
This concept is directly
related to the interactions

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.110 align:middle line:84%
of two opposite-polarity energy
fields in the overlapping

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.320 align:middle line:84%
circles, the boundary
of each one touching

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.500 align:middle line:84%
the center of the other
circle, creating the unity

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.800 align:middle line:84%
portal of the vesica
in their interaction.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.350 align:middle line:84%
Another aspect of
the vesica pattern

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.800 align:middle line:84%
is that it can be extended
into a larger net,

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.830 align:middle line:84%
popularized in modern
times under the name

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.910 align:middle line:84%
the flower of life to describe
the net created by overlapping

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.390 align:middle line:84%
circles which then
manifest multiple vesicas,

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.930 align:middle line:84%
which look like flower
petals in the design.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.800 align:middle line:84%
The term flower of life is a
recent name for this pattern.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.830 align:middle line:84%
It had other names
in the ancient world.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Sacred geometry expert
Keith Critchlow from Britain

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.800 align:middle line:84%
has commented that this
ancient pattern should not

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.890 align:middle line:84%
be called the flower of
life, but rather is better

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.560 align:middle line:90%
termed the flower of creation.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.550 align:middle line:84%
This is because it holds a
six-sided hexagonal pattern

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.690 align:middle line:84%
related to crystal and mineral
forms of physical creation,

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.830 align:middle line:84%
whereas life is related to
five-fold pentagonal forms

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.140 align:middle line:90%
and the golden mean proportion.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.950 align:middle line:84%
The movement of the vesica
from duality into multiplicity,

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.610 align:middle line:84%
as in the flower pattern, is
the sacred geometry archetype

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.910 align:middle line:84%
for the same process
in biological life.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.820 align:middle line:84%
We see this when the single
fertilized egg divides

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.990 align:middle line:84%
into two, and then into
four, then into eight, then

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.160 align:middle line:84%
continues this binary process
into higher multiplicity.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.800 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.510 align:middle line:84%
This exact same pattern of
unity to duality to multiplicity

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.635 align:middle line:84%
is also found in the important
pattern of the Chinese "I

00:07:25.635 --> 00:07:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Ching," which is the same
pattern found in modern binary

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:34.200 align:middle line:84%
computer technology, and in the
biological structure of the DNA

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.510 align:middle line:90%
human genetic code.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.360 align:middle line:84%
The "I Ching" is called
The Book of Changes.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.780 align:middle line:10%
It shows how a series
of 64 hexagrams

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.090 align:middle line:10%
reveals every
possible change which

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:50.860 align:middle line:10%
can occur in any situation
or in any living system.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.060 align:middle line:84%
From the original unity, the
Wuji, the original circle

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.520 align:middle line:84%
or sphere of creation,
a split into two

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.130 align:middle line:90%
occurs, creating yin and yang.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:04.270 align:middle line:10%
These two then divide themselves
into two again, making four,

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:09.220 align:middle line:10%
then divide again to become
eight, then 16, then 32, then

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.690 align:middle line:10%
64.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.710 align:middle line:84%
This is the divine thought form
behind the creation of the 64

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:16.960 align:middle line:90%
hexagrams of the "I Ching."

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.620 align:middle line:10%
The first split from 1 to 2
creates the primordial yin

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.370 align:middle line:10%
and yang polarity, then
the split from 2 to 4

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.100 align:middle line:10%
creates the bigrams
of the "I Ching,"

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.700 align:middle line:10%
then the split from 4 to
8 creates the trigrams,

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.650 align:middle line:10%
continuing through
the progression

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:38.830 align:middle line:10%
until the 32 splits into the
64 hexagrams of the "I Ching."

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.570 align:middle line:10%
Modern genetic
scientists discovered

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:42.760 align:middle line:10%
that the exact
same coding system

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:47.140 align:middle line:10%
as found in the "I Ching"
stands behind our human DNA,

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.995 align:middle line:10%
creating the 64 codons of
the human genetic code.

00:08:50.995 --> 00:08:56.260 align:middle line:90%


00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.120 align:middle line:84%
The vesica portal
from the divine

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:02.620 align:middle line:84%
to physical manifestation was
often used in sacred design,

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.400 align:middle line:84%
often without always showing its
source in the perfect overlap

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.430 align:middle line:90%
of two complementary circles.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Modern analyses of stone
circles from megalithic Europe

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:16.600 align:middle line:84%
show that the vesica pisces
was the basis for laying out

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.990 align:middle line:90%
many classic stone circles.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:21.820 align:middle line:84%
We find the vesica
in the patterns

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:25.390 align:middle line:84%
for laying out a temple or
creating a sacred mandala

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:27.190 align:middle line:90%
all around the world.

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:29.470 align:middle line:84%
We find it in the
Holy Grail tradition,

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:33.940 align:middle line:84%
on the lid of Chalice Well
in Glastonbury, England.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.330 align:middle line:84%
We find it in the design for
the concentric vesica portals

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.270 align:middle line:84%
into the holy interiors
of cathedrals.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:43.600 align:middle line:10%
When seen in cathedral portals,
the concentric vesicles

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.550 align:middle line:10%
often have their bottom part
cut off for design purposes.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual beings who hold the
perfect balance between heaven,

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:56.590 align:middle line:84%
the divine source, and Earth,
physical manifestation,

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.530 align:middle line:90%
are shown inside the vesica.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.230 align:middle line:10%
In the West, the
Christ being is often

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:05.950 align:middle line:10%
shown inside the vesica pisces.

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:09.070 align:middle line:10%
Now that we have some essential
knowledge about the vesica,

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:11.830 align:middle line:10%
we can explore how this
pattern holds a key

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:14.320 align:middle line:10%
to two of the most
important mysteries

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.660 align:middle line:10%
of spiritual initiation.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.390 align:middle line:84%
The first mystery
is how to discern

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:21.910 align:middle line:84%
the nature of different
nonphysical beings

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.640 align:middle line:84%
we will encounter on
the spiritual path

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.340 align:middle line:90%
so that we are not led astray.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:31.600 align:middle line:10%
The second mystery is how the
same vesica pattern actually

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.530 align:middle line:10%
manifests in the human energy
field as a key sacred geometry

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:38.860 align:middle line:10%
grid, which we can
activate to accelerate

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:43.120 align:middle line:10%
our spiritual development and
optimize our spiritual destiny.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.430 align:middle line:90%


00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Let's go into a deep dive,
now, into the first mystery.

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual seekers must
develop deep discernment

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.030 align:middle line:84%
between spiritual
beings of a beneficial

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.700 align:middle line:84%
versus a harmful
nature, particularly

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.520 align:middle line:84%
when those harmful beings
often present themselves

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.930 align:middle line:90%
as being benevolent.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:07.140 align:middle line:84%
This discernment also can
give us powerful insight

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:11.220 align:middle line:84%
into how other people's thoughts
and actions are influenced

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.980 align:middle line:84%
by these different types
of spiritual beings, who

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.560 align:middle line:84%
have been spoken of
in esoteric traditions

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.990 align:middle line:90%
for many thousands of years.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, one consequence
of modern materialism

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:26.040 align:middle line:84%
is that our culture has very
little understanding anymore

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.580 align:middle line:84%
of the real nonphysical
beings and processes

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.070 align:middle line:90%
spoken of in earlier traditions.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:36.210 align:middle line:84%
We dismiss these often as
myths, metaphors, or symbolism,

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.480 align:middle line:90%
not spiritual realities.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.860 align:middle line:84%
The European Rosicrucians used
the phrase "occult materialism"

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.620 align:middle line:84%
to describe how we
distort higher realities

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.200 align:middle line:84%
into materialistic
thought forms, which

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.630 align:middle line:84%
are based on physical
plane conditions,

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:54.900 align:middle line:84%
not on the realities
of higher planes.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:58.290 align:middle line:84%
A simple example is thinking
that beings on higher planes

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.840 align:middle line:84%
look like human beings,
that they communicate

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.450 align:middle line:84%
through earthly languages,
that they are solid

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:06.870 align:middle line:84%
and take up physical space,
rather than understanding

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:09.600 align:middle line:84%
the true nonphysical,
highly dynamic,

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.990 align:middle line:84%
interpenetrating nature
of beings on higher plane.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:16.670 align:middle line:90%


00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Occult materialism is the
consequence of our culture

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:23.900 align:middle line:84%
having lost our understanding
of multidimensional reality,

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:27.620 align:middle line:84%
of the exact nature of
higher planes of existence.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Using our seven-plane
model, we can

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:33.210 align:middle line:84%
explore how the pattern
and principle of the vesica

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:37.520 align:middle line:84%
pisces guides us on
different planes.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.980 align:middle line:84%
The divine thought form
of the vesica pattern

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:44.510 align:middle line:84%
teaches us, on the physical,
vitality, and emotional plane

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:47.930 align:middle line:84%
levels, that we must
balance opposite polarities

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.170 align:middle line:84%
and be centered in
order to achieve health

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:54.200 align:middle line:84%
and inner balance, just
as the Chinese medicine

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:58.190 align:middle line:84%
tradition understands that
an excess of yin or yang

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:00.380 align:middle line:90%
creates illness.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.620 align:middle line:84%
On the mental plane, the
vessel becomes the concept

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.320 align:middle line:84%
of good being in the
middle between two

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:10.190 align:middle line:84%
opposite unbalanced polarities,
not a simple polarity

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.870 align:middle line:90%
between good and evil.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Only by understanding that good
is the center between extremes

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.580 align:middle line:84%
can we then discern where
these polarized imbalances are

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:23.360 align:middle line:84%
manifesting dangerously so
we can protect ourselves.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.090 align:middle line:84%
We can find these dangerously
unbalanced tendencies

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:29.300 align:middle line:84%
in ourselves, in the
people around us,

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:32.330 align:middle line:84%
in distorted
metaphysical information,

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:36.180 align:middle line:84%
in unhealthy trends in modern
politics and culture, et

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:37.520 align:middle line:90%
cetera.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.160 align:middle line:84%
On the causal
plane, our karma is

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.340 align:middle line:84%
determined by how
skillfully or unskillfully

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.760 align:middle line:84%
we apply the vesica balance
principles to our actions

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:51.860 align:middle line:84%
in the world which help or
harm ourselves and others.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:55.610 align:middle line:84%
On the spiritual plane, the
two unbalanced polarities

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:58.550 align:middle line:84%
and the balanced center
manifest as groups

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:01.820 align:middle line:84%
of real nonphysical
spiritual beings who

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:05.120 align:middle line:84%
manifest these tendencies
in their inner nature

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.865 align:middle line:84%
and in their influences
on human beings.

00:14:07.865 --> 00:14:10.620 align:middle line:90%


00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.140 align:middle line:84%
We can see that the
spiritual plane itself

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:16.770 align:middle line:84%
is a very high plane of
existence, where things we

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:20.520 align:middle line:84%
think of as symbols or metaphors
in our materialistic culture

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.010 align:middle line:84%
actually manifest from
the highest divine

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:26.700 align:middle line:84%
plane as real nonphysical
spiritual beings.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:30.140 align:middle line:90%


00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.360 align:middle line:84%
We have lost so
much understanding

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.570 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual plane
and spiritual beings.

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:38.570 align:middle line:84%
We are like fish who are
terrified of seeing the water

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:41.030 align:middle line:84%
we are immersed in,
and so we pretend

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:45.510 align:middle line:84%
that the spiritual realities
all around us don't exist.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.260 align:middle line:84%
However, the activation
of our latent organs

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.620 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual perception
must happen gradually,

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.530 align:middle line:84%
in tandem with
having a healthy body

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:58.280 align:middle line:84%
and a healthy structure of
our physical life on Earth

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.100 align:middle line:84%
in order to remain
grounded and rational

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:05.600 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of perceiving
these higher realities.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.110 align:middle line:84%
The great Rosicrucian
initiate Rudolf Steiner once

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.900 align:middle line:84%
commented that higher
levels of clairvoyance

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:15.800 align:middle line:84%
are almost like a type
of controlled psychosis,

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.200 align:middle line:84%
requiring tremendous
inner discipline

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.480 align:middle line:84%
and grounding in
the physical world

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.360 align:middle line:84%
to be able to stay
healthy and to integrate

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:28.280 align:middle line:84%
nonphysical perceptions
properly into a person's psyche.

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Mental hospitals
are full of people

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:33.260 align:middle line:84%
whose spiritual organs
of nonphysical perception

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.890 align:middle line:84%
opened up prematurely, making
them unable to properly

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:39.140 align:middle line:84%
navigate between
physical reality

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:42.800 align:middle line:84%
and perceptions of nonphysical
beings and processes

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.700 align:middle line:84%
which are perceived in a
distorted and unhealthy way.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.910 align:middle line:84%
This distorted perception
of spiritual realities,

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:53.420 align:middle line:84%
combined with lack of proper
grounding in the physical body,

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:57.080 align:middle line:84%
creates reactions on the mental
and emotional planes which

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.030 align:middle line:90%
lead to psychological illness.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:02.840 align:middle line:84%
So it is very important
that we really understand

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.470 align:middle line:84%
the nature of higher
realities and ground this

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:09.920 align:middle line:84%
in a healthy, balanced
life in the physical body

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.070 align:middle line:84%
in order to safely and
effectively open up

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:17.180 align:middle line:84%
these vitally needed new subtle
organs of perception which

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:21.440 align:middle line:84%
can accurately perceive
higher realities.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.470 align:middle line:10%
A key teaching of
multiple world traditions

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:27.140 align:middle line:10%
is that every human
being has a divine spirit

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:31.970 align:middle line:10%
core, a flame from the ocean of
fire that is the Godhead, just

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:33.710 align:middle line:10%
is the Christ does.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.380 align:middle line:84%
The early teaching of
the Christian church,

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.830 align:middle line:84%
found in the book called
"On First Principles,"

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:43.370 align:middle line:84%
written by Origen in
Alexandria, Egypt,

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:48.410 align:middle line:84%
around 1,800 years ago
is that the Christ being

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:51.860 align:middle line:84%
is the Godhead reduced
in scale to a level where

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:56.090 align:middle line:84%
human beings can see and
interact with this being.

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Human beings also have
the same divine essence,

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:01.070 align:middle line:84%
but we are reduced
in scale of one step

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:04.770 align:middle line:84%
further to the
microcosmic level.

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Every human being incarnates
as a young spiritual

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.950 align:middle line:84%
being into the
physical plane in order

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:15.660 align:middle line:84%
to develop experience,
knowledge, wisdom, compassion,

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.770 align:middle line:84%
and independence, balanced
with the capacity for love

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:21.390 align:middle line:90%
and service.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:23.339 align:middle line:84%
We can activate
the divine powers

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:25.710 align:middle line:84%
which slumber within
us once we reach

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:30.145 align:middle line:84%
the maturity needed to use these
powers to help and not to harm

00:17:30.145 --> 00:17:30.945 align:middle line:90%
others.

00:17:30.945 --> 00:17:33.750 align:middle line:90%


00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:35.210 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
important teachings

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.480 align:middle line:84%
in all of spiritual science
is the Buddhist teaching

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.510 align:middle line:84%
of the vesica
principle, once again,

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:44.480 align:middle line:84%
that evil is not an
opposite polarity to good.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.410 align:middle line:84%
Good is always the middle
way, the perfect balance

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:52.160 align:middle line:84%
point between complementary
opposite extremes.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Our physical, psychological,
and spiritual health

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.040 align:middle line:84%
relies on cultivating
the central balance

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:03.470 align:middle line:84%
point, the vesica, between
opposite unbalanced extremes.

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.720 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Greek
teaching from Plato

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.180 align:middle line:84%
is that the world's
soul is crucified

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.760 align:middle line:84%
on the cross of the
physical world, which

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:14.960 align:middle line:84%
is based on the cubical cross
of the three 90-degree axes that

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.390 align:middle line:90%
create physical space.

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Every human being is a
microcosm of the world's soul.

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:26.120 align:middle line:84%
We are all crucified within
the cross of the physical body.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:30.210 align:middle line:84%
When we incarnate from spirit
into our dense material body,

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:33.230 align:middle line:84%
this is an experience we
all carry subconsciously

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:36.920 align:middle line:84%
within ourselves as a
crucifixion experience,

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:41.070 align:middle line:84%
being trapped in the cross
of the physical body.

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:44.600 align:middle line:10%
This opens us up to
potentially great suffering

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:49.500 align:middle line:10%
in the body of flesh and bone,
which is our cross to bear.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.500 align:middle line:10%
This is why every
incarnating human

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.710 align:middle line:10%
being is on a hero's
journey in order

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:58.010 align:middle line:10%
to go through the experiences
we need on the physical plane

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:02.330 align:middle line:10%
to actualize our full
spiritual potential.

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:06.370 align:middle line:84%
The European Rosicrucians
see Christ as a divine being,

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:09.410 align:middle line:84%
the being of the
sun, the solar logos,

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:13.130 align:middle line:84%
incarnated into a human
body in the physical world

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:16.640 align:middle line:84%
as an act of solidarity
with humanity.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.800 align:middle line:84%
This is why European
Rosicrucians call

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:23.240 align:middle line:84%
the Christ being the
representative of humanity,

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.400 align:middle line:84%
and call the
spiritual significance

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.730 align:middle line:84%
of Christ's crucifixion
between the two thieves

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:32.030 align:middle line:90%
the mystery of Golgotha.

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.890 align:middle line:84%
The divine thought
form in the mind

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:36.950 align:middle line:84%
of God behind this
mystery drama of Christ

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:41.480 align:middle line:84%
crucified between two thieves
is that the two side crosses are

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.990 align:middle line:84%
within the opposite circles
of the vesica pisces,

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:47.870 align:middle line:84%
with the Christ held in
the center of the vesica

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:50.930 align:middle line:84%
of perfect balance,
and holding open

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:55.430 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual portal between
the opposite polarities.

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:57.980 align:middle line:10%
The two thieves on
either side of Christ

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.200 align:middle line:10%
are described in the
esoteric tradition

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.960 align:middle line:10%
as having two
opposite qualities.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.360 align:middle line:10%
The thief on the
left side cross is

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:10%
full of unbalanced spirituality.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.980 align:middle line:10%
The thief on the
right side cross

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:15.660 align:middle line:10%
has been consumed by
unbalanced materialism.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.600 align:middle line:10%
This left side thief
is the representative

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:21.450 align:middle line:10%
of a particular group of
spiritual beings known

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:24.660 align:middle line:10%
to the Western tradition under
the name of their leader,

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:28.110 align:middle line:10%
Lucifer, meaning light bearer.

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:30.300 align:middle line:84%
These spiritual beings
do not understand

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:32.400 align:middle line:84%
the purpose of
physical incarnation

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.850 align:middle line:84%
for humanity and the
suffering it brings.

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:38.430 align:middle line:84%
The influence of
these beings attracts

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:42.210 align:middle line:84%
us to unbalanced forms
of illusory, one-sided

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:46.560 align:middle line:84%
spirituality, which can
manifest in many different ways.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:50.490 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, it takes the form
of seeking constant ecstatic

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:54.000 align:middle line:84%
states and avoiding
painful or difficult

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.730 align:middle line:84%
day-to-day physical
realities, which

00:20:56.730 --> 00:21:00.330 align:middle line:84%
can lead to uncontrolled
substance abuse.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.490 align:middle line:84%
The Luciferic beings
do not understand

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:06.250 align:middle line:84%
the purpose of physical
incarnation in a balanced way,

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:08.430 align:middle line:84%
and do not understand
that human beings can only

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:10.470 align:middle line:84%
go through the
stages of development

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:14.880 align:middle line:84%
we need through a series
of physical incarnations.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.920 align:middle line:84%
However, these
Luciferic beings, with

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.700 align:middle line:84%
their one-sided spirituality,
are believed in the rosicrucian

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.700 align:middle line:84%
tradition to be
redeemable if they

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:27.210 align:middle line:84%
come to understand the
purpose of physical life,

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:32.070 align:middle line:84%
to balance physical life
with spiritual development.

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:35.070 align:middle line:10%
The thief on the right-hand
side, on the other hand,

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:37.230 align:middle line:10%
turns his head away
from the Christ,

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:40.650 align:middle line:10%
refusing to acknowledge
the principle of balance.

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:43.740 align:middle line:10%
This thief manifests
another important group

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:46.140 align:middle line:10%
known to the esoteric
tradition, who

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:48.780 align:middle line:10%
are the opposite
polarity to Lucifer's

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.420 align:middle line:10%
unbalanced spirituality.

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.170 align:middle line:84%
These beings embody
unbalanced materialism,

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:58.950 align:middle line:84%
encouraging human beings to
focus only on physical life,

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:02.790 align:middle line:84%
to deny and even ridicule
the existence of spirit

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.910 align:middle line:84%
and all higher
meaning or purpose.

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:08.850 align:middle line:84%
These beings encourage
humanity to see ourselves

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:12.270 align:middle line:84%
as an accidental result
of purely random material

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:15.390 align:middle line:84%
chemicals, with no moral
code beyond serving

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:18.630 align:middle line:84%
our own selfish interest,
regardless of the harm

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:20.980 align:middle line:90%
we do to others.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:22.740 align:middle line:84%
These spiritual
beings, of course,

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.900 align:middle line:84%
know that spirit
exists, but they

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.380 align:middle line:84%
have fallen in love with
matter and the physical world.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.810 align:middle line:84%
In the deep esoteric
tradition, it

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:33.480 align:middle line:84%
is understood that these
nonphysical beings are much

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.880 align:middle line:90%
more ancient than human beings.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.270 align:middle line:84%
They played a major role in
the process of crystallizing

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:41.850 align:middle line:84%
the divine sacred
geometry thought forms

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:46.680 align:middle line:84%
from the mind of God into
the forms of physical matter.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.990 align:middle line:84%
In this process,
they became obsessed

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:51.250 align:middle line:84%
with matter and
the physical world,

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:55.950 align:middle line:84%
which they feel they created
and they now desire to control.

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Their subtle psychological
influence on human beings

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:01.710 align:middle line:84%
has increased
significantly on the Earth

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:05.100 align:middle line:84%
in recent times, which we
see mirrored historically

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:10.710 align:middle line:84%
in the extreme materialism which
has overtaken modern culture.

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:13.800 align:middle line:84%
On a personal level,
these materialistic beings

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.130 align:middle line:84%
seek to influence
human beings to reject

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:22.320 align:middle line:84%
all thoughts of unity,
compassion, love, metaphysics,

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.560 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality,
and to act only out

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.290 align:middle line:90%
of materialistic self-interest.

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:30.210 align:middle line:10%
The spiritual beings
which encourage

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:34.320 align:middle line:10%
this unbalanced materiality were
known in the ancient Persian

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.630 align:middle line:10%
Zoroastrian tradition
through the name

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:39.240 align:middle line:10%
of their leader, Ahriman.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.880 align:middle line:10%
This Zoroastrian tradition,
long before the advent

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.000 align:middle line:10%
of Christianity, described
the Redeemer being,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.810 align:middle line:10%
our true spiritual
guide, as Ahura Mazda,

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:53.025 align:middle line:10%
meaning the spiritual being
seen in the aura of the sun.

00:23:53.025 --> 00:23:56.610 align:middle line:90%


00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:58.830 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian tradition
knew the being

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:00.680 align:middle line:84%
which the Persians
called Ahriman

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:04.250 align:middle line:90%
by the name Set, the adversary.

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.530 align:middle line:84%
When Moses led the
Exodus from Egypt,

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:10.400 align:middle line:84%
Set became the
Hebrew word Ha-Satan,

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.440 align:middle line:90%
meaning the adversary.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.320 align:middle line:84%
The Jewish tradition
saw Ha-Satan

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:19.610 align:middle line:84%
as the being which prevents us
from connecting to the divine.

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:24.860 align:middle line:84%
In later Europe, the Hebrew term
Ha-Satan became simply Satan.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:28.570 align:middle line:90%


00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:31.900 align:middle line:10%
Most of the Western tradition
lost the major distinction

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:35.110 align:middle line:10%
between Lucifer and
Satan, thinking them

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:39.370 align:middle line:10%
the same being, which is full
of logical contradictions.

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Lucifer's name
means light bearer,

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:45.070 align:middle line:84%
a great spiritual being
of brilliant light

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:46.750 align:middle line:90%
from the heavens.

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Ahriman, or Satan, is shown
completely differently,

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:53.170 align:middle line:84%
as a sclerotic figure
who dwells in darkness

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:55.210 align:middle line:90%
deep inside the Earth.

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:57.370 align:middle line:84%
Lucifer and Ahriman
are polar opposites

00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:00.760 align:middle line:84%
in the esoteric tradition,
not the same being.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.160 align:middle line:84%
However, both
beings can blind us

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.430 align:middle line:84%
to the middle way
of the Christos.

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:09.790 align:middle line:84%
This image of Christ crucified
between the two thieves,

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:12.190 align:middle line:84%
holding the balance
between the twin extremes

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:15.310 align:middle line:84%
of unbalanced spirituality
and materialism,

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:18.010 align:middle line:84%
it is the vesica
principle made flesh,

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:20.350 align:middle line:84%
with the two thieves on
either side of the Christ

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:21.160 align:middle line:90%
in the middle.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.650 align:middle line:84%
Opposite polarity
pillars to either side

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:25.900 align:middle line:84%
with a perfect
middle pillar holding

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.350 align:middle line:84%
the balance in the center
is also the sacred geometry

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:31.600 align:middle line:84%
pattern from the
mind of God, which

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:35.530 align:middle line:84%
is the key to unlocking hidden
powers in the human energy

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:36.920 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:40.150 align:middle line:84%
This pattern is best known
today through the tree of life

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:41.980 align:middle line:90%
from the Jewish Kabbalah.

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:44.020 align:middle line:10%
However, what is
not well known today

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:46.540 align:middle line:10%
is that this pattern
was also activated

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:51.340 align:middle line:10%
in secret practices in ancient
Egypt and among the Essenes.

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:55.840 align:middle line:84%
The tree of life's net pattern
is based on three pillars.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Only the middle pillar
goes all the way up

00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:00.310 align:middle line:90%
to heaven and down to Earth.

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:04.360 align:middle line:84%
The two side pillars do not
reach all the way up or down.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.730 align:middle line:84%
In the Jewish Kabbalah,
the side pillars

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:10.060 align:middle line:84%
are known as the pillars
of mercy and severity,

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:14.380 align:middle line:84%
complementary opposites balanced
by the harmonizing middle

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:15.670 align:middle line:90%
pillar.

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:18.490 align:middle line:84%
It has almost been forgotten
today that the tree of life

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:23.050 align:middle line:84%
also holds a hidden encoding
of the geometric movement

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:25.660 align:middle line:84%
from the zero-dimensional
divine plane

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:28.990 align:middle line:84%
to our three-dimensional
physical world.

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:33.460 align:middle line:84%
The topmost center, keter, which
connects to the divine source,

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:36.370 align:middle line:84%
is the zero-dimensional
single point.

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:41.020 align:middle line:84%
Then the next two centers
create the one-dimensional line.

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:44.200 align:middle line:84%
The next three centers
create the triangle,

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:48.220 align:middle line:84%
the simplest two-dimensional
form made with straight lines.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:52.090 align:middle line:10%
And the final four centers
create the tetrahedron,

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:56.260 align:middle line:10%
the simplest three-dimensional
form made with straight lines.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:59.530 align:middle line:84%
This is how the movement
from zero to three dimensions

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:05.350 align:middle line:84%
is sacred geometrically
encoded into the tree of life.

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:08.380 align:middle line:84%
It is rarely understood
today that the tree of life

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:12.040 align:middle line:84%
is based on the vesica
sacred geometry pattern,

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.670 align:middle line:84%
nor how exactly the tree of
life appears in the human energy

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:16.750 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Nor is it understood the
methods through which

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:21.040 align:middle line:90%
its power can be activated.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.020 align:middle line:84%
There are hints of
the secret teaching

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.990 align:middle line:84%
that the tree of life
pattern is holographic,

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:29.230 align:middle line:84%
appearing both as a
glyph of cosmic creation

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:32.050 align:middle line:84%
and also microcosmically
appearing

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:34.520 align:middle line:90%
inside the human body.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.420 align:middle line:84%
One such hint is in the
name of the highest energy

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:41.680 align:middle line:84%
center on the tree of life
being called keter in Hebrew.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:45.040 align:middle line:84%
Keter means crown,
indicating to the initiate

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:49.300 align:middle line:84%
that this is the first energy
center directly above the top

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.860 align:middle line:90%
of the human head.

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Because the ancient practices
for activating the tree of life

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:57.280 align:middle line:84%
in the human energy field
were kept very secret,

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.070 align:middle line:84%
in modern times, there have
been different theories

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:02.500 align:middle line:84%
of where the energy
centers on the tree of life

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:05.630 align:middle line:90%
correspond to in the human body.

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:09.290 align:middle line:10%
For example, the best known
modern metaphysical model,

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:12.530 align:middle line:10%
coming from the English
Golden Dawn system,

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:16.580 align:middle line:10%
is that the lowest, most
materialized center of malchut

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:20.480 align:middle line:10%
corresponds to the energy
center at the base of our feet.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.860 align:middle line:10%
However, in the 1980s, a
great Greek Christian hermetic

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:28.130 align:middle line:10%
initiate became revealed to
the public under the name

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:32.240 align:middle line:10%
of Daskalos, a Greek
term meaning teacher.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Daskalos was known for
incredibly advanced

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.740 align:middle line:90%
spiritual abilities.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:41.060 align:middle line:84%
For example, he fully remembered
all of his past incarnations,

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.720 align:middle line:84%
and he could read, write, and
speak all of the languages

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.010 align:middle line:84%
that he knew from
previous lives,

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:49.640 align:middle line:84%
including ancient
Egyptian hieroglyphs.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.160 align:middle line:84%
Daskalos was asked
how he developed

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.800 align:middle line:84%
his incredible
abilities, and he said

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.570 align:middle line:84%
they were the
result of practices

00:28:56.570 --> 00:29:00.520 align:middle line:84%
he learned as a heirophont
in ancient Egypt.

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:03.580 align:middle line:84%
This practice was with the
original Egyptian version

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:05.500 align:middle line:84%
of the tree of life
that he referred

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:09.280 align:middle line:84%
to as the symbol of life,
which predates and was

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:13.810 align:middle line:84%
the source for the later tree
of life in the Jewish Kabbalah.

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:17.140 align:middle line:10%
Daskalos then published a book
with lost knowledge regarding

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:19.960 align:middle line:10%
the symbol of life,
which included

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.560 align:middle line:10%
Egyptian hieroglyphic
text related to activating

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:27.250 align:middle line:10%
the symbol in the human energy
field, which he remembered

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:30.030 align:middle line:10%
from his ancient
Egyptian lifetime.

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:33.900 align:middle line:10%
Daskalos corrected the error in
modern metaphysical practices

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:36.930 align:middle line:10%
with the tree of life,
showing that the lowest energy

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:39.960 align:middle line:10%
center on this powerful
sacred geometry pattern

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.150 align:middle line:10%
is, in reality,
over the genitals

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:46.110 align:middle line:10%
and the base of the
abdomen, not at the feet.

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:48.240 align:middle line:10%
We will, in this
series, refer to

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:51.930 align:middle line:10%
this powerful sacred geometry
grid in the human energy field

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:55.530 align:middle line:10%
as the grid of life
design, or referred to

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:59.280 align:middle line:10%
in short by the acronym GOLD.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:03.450 align:middle line:10%
This GOLD pattern manifests the
vesica principle in our energy

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:06.300 align:middle line:10%
field, with the two circles
to either side becoming

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:09.180 align:middle line:10%
the polarized left
and right pillars

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:12.060 align:middle line:10%
and the vesica perfect
balance portal becoming

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.530 align:middle line:10%
the middle pillar.

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:15.600 align:middle line:84%
The three pillars
in our energy field

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:19.140 align:middle line:84%
are based on the same vesica
sacred geometry principle

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:23.460 align:middle line:84%
as the three crosses at
the mystery of Golgotha.

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.340 align:middle line:84%
In Episode 1, we
constructed the first part

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:29.310 align:middle line:84%
of the grid of life
design, which is the Golden

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:31.650 align:middle line:90%
Triangle around the head.

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:33.630 align:middle line:10%
This started with the
first energy center

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:36.990 align:middle line:10%
above the head, which is where
the divine energy above us

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:40.530 align:middle line:10%
enters into our middle
pillar, the ultimate energy

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:42.990 align:middle line:10%
channel in the human
body, which runs straight

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:46.230 align:middle line:10%
down the midline of our
body from the crown chakra

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:50.130 align:middle line:10%
to the perineum at the
base of the abdomen.

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:52.710 align:middle line:84%
This first energy center at
the top of the middle pillar

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:55.830 align:middle line:84%
we then connected to the
little known energy centers

00:30:55.830 --> 00:31:00.330 align:middle line:84%
above each shoulder, at the top
of the left and right pillars

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:04.440 align:middle line:84%
in our energy field, creating
a golden triangle of energy

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.660 align:middle line:90%
around our physical head.

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.690 align:middle line:84%
This golden triangle created
between the highest energy

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:13.980 align:middle line:84%
centers of our metal pillar
and our left and right pillars

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:19.470 align:middle line:84%
holds our head and consciousness
inside a divine golden light.

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:22.410 align:middle line:84%
We can now add the next
part of the pattern,

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:25.320 align:middle line:84%
moving from the golden
triangle around our head

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:30.270 align:middle line:84%
to activating the section of
this pattern around our heart.

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:32.970 align:middle line:84%
We will also build on some
of the skills and concepts

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.340 align:middle line:84%
you learned in previous
episodes, particularly

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:38.490 align:middle line:84%
the zero point centering
and radiance methods.

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:40.920 align:middle line:84%
We will use these techniques
to more powerfully

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:44.490 align:middle line:84%
activate each energy
center in this pattern

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:48.660 align:middle line:84%
by moving dynamically into the
very epicenter of that energy

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:51.750 align:middle line:84%
center and then radiating
its activated energy

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:54.540 align:middle line:90%
outwards like a sun.

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:56.700 align:middle line:84%
There are multiple
methods for activating

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.950 align:middle line:84%
the structures of the
grid of life design

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:00.690 align:middle line:90%
in your energy field.

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:03.390 align:middle line:10%
We will use a
simplified method which

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:07.650 align:middle line:10%
activates first the center in
your middle pillar for balance

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:10.380 align:middle line:10%
and then activates
its connections

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:13.490 align:middle line:10%
to the left and right pillars.

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:15.410 align:middle line:84%
If you'd like to do
the practice now,

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:18.650 align:middle line:84%
please see the companion
video for this episode.

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, please
set an intention

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:25.670 align:middle line:84%
to come back and do the
practice at a later time.

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:28.430 align:middle line:10%
We will complete the grid of
life design in your energy

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:32.360 align:middle line:10%
field in a later episode by
adding in the two final centers

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.700 align:middle line:10%
on the middle pillar,
which will ground us

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:38.690 align:middle line:10%
into physical incarnation
and link us to the Earth.

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:42.380 align:middle line:10%
In secret teachings from
Egypt, Israel, the Essenes,

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:44.840 align:middle line:10%
and early Christianity,
the activation

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:47.180 align:middle line:10%
of the grid of life in
the human energy field

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.100 align:middle line:10%
was understood to
be one of the most

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:53.480 align:middle line:10%
powerful and destiny-changing
practices in all

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:57.000 align:middle line:10%
of spiritual and
vibrational science.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.050 align:middle line:10%
I hope that in this episode, you
have learned why the vesica is

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:03.650 align:middle line:10%
such an essential sacred
geometry pattern, so much

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:05.930 align:middle line:10%
so that I named my
research and teaching

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:10.130 align:middle line:10%
organization The Vesica
Institute for Holistic Studies.

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:12.890 align:middle line:90%


00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Please join me for
our next episode, when

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.870 align:middle line:84%
we will explore the sacred
geometry secrets which

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:20.900 align:middle line:84%
make it possible for
our spirit to incarnate

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:23.300 align:middle line:84%
into a physical
body, and you will

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.400 align:middle line:84%
learn to activate an
almost forgotten pattern

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:30.920 align:middle line:84%
essential for your merkaba,
the body of soul travel.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.920 align:middle line:90%
I'll see you then.

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:38.000 align:middle line:90%
