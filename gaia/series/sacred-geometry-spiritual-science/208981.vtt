00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.350 align:middle line:10%
>> This simple exercise will
allow you to experience how

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.340 align:middle line:10%
energy centers connect through
lines of energy to create

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.810 align:middle line:10%
two-dimensional sacred geometry
forms in your own energy body.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.750 align:middle line:10%
Remember that all the
centers we are working

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.080 align:middle line:10%
with in this exercise and
throughout this series

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.240 align:middle line:10%
already exist invisibly within
the nets of your energy body.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.320 align:middle line:10%
We are simply using our mind
power to become aware of them

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.630 align:middle line:10%
and to activate them.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Before we begin any
spiritual practice,

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.230 align:middle line:84%
we can start by seeing
what our baseline of energy

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.250 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness is before
we start the practice.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.770 align:middle line:84%
This is very important
because, this way, we

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.910 align:middle line:84%
can observe changes that occur
as a result of the practice.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.170 align:middle line:84%
This helps us to know the exact
effects any practice has on us

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.720 align:middle line:84%
rather than relying on
another person's word

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.480 align:middle line:90%
about what those effects are.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.770 align:middle line:84%
We call this first and last
step of any spiritual exercise

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.710 align:middle line:84%
the energy field awareness
practice or EFAP for short.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.300 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.340 align:middle line:84%
Just close your
eyes for a moment

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.640 align:middle line:84%
and tune into the feeling of
energy in and around your body.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.285 align:middle line:84%
What does it feel like
at the energy level?

00:01:39.285 --> 00:01:42.080 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Then observe what is currently
in your mind and emotions.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.890 align:middle line:84%
What is in your thoughts and
in your emotional feelings

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.680 align:middle line:84%
here at the beginning
of the practice?

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.170 align:middle line:84%
It's important that you
don't try to change anything.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.020 align:middle line:84%
The energy field
awareness practice

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.650 align:middle line:84%
is just about seeing what is
actually present inside of you

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.090 align:middle line:90%
here at the beginning.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Now we can begin
the practice itself.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.949 align:middle line:84%
Become aware of the crown
center at the top of your head

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:13.660 align:middle line:84%
feeling the vibration
of that chakra.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Slowly move your awareness
straight up above your crown

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.980 align:middle line:84%
center until you find
the first location, which

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.340 align:middle line:84%
feels like a miniature
sun of energy and light

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.110 align:middle line:90%
above your head.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Place your attention
into the very epicenter

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.050 align:middle line:84%
of that first chakra
above your head.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.140 align:middle line:84%
This is the initial
sacred geometry

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.140 align:middle line:84%
point to activate with your
attention for this practice.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Next, we will activate
two hidden energy centers,

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.920 align:middle line:84%
one above each shoulder, which
have been almost forgotten

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.780 align:middle line:90%
in modern times.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Start by placing your
attention at the top

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.700 align:middle line:90%
of your right shoulder.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Move your attention slowly
above your right shoulder

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.590 align:middle line:84%
until you, again, become aware
of a miniature sun of energy

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.500 align:middle line:90%
and light at this location.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Put your attention
into the very epicenter

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.240 align:middle line:84%
of the power spot above your
right shoulder to activate it.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.420 align:middle line:84%
With that point above the
right shoulder activated,

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.940 align:middle line:84%
now move your attention
to your left shoulder.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Move your attention
above your left shoulder

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.600 align:middle line:84%
until you find the miniature
sun of light and energy

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.910 align:middle line:90%
at that location.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Put your attention
into the very epicenter

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.360 align:middle line:84%
of the power spot above your
left shoulder to activate it.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.600 align:middle line:84%
You now have three of these
energy centers activated

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.450 align:middle line:90%
in your energy field.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.900 align:middle line:84%
With your mind power,
draw a line of light

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.540 align:middle line:84%
from the center above
the right shoulder

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.900 align:middle line:84%
to the center above
the left shoulder.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.870 align:middle line:84%
You have now created
a one-dimensional line

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.460 align:middle line:90%
between these two energy points.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Then using your
mind power, connect

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.180 align:middle line:84%
to the epicenter of the
energy center above your head.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And draw a line of
energy from the center

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.840 align:middle line:84%
above your head to the center
above your right shoulder

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.649 align:middle line:84%
and then another line of light
from the center above your head

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:21.050 align:middle line:84%
down to the center
above your left shoulder

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.950 align:middle line:84%
so that both are now connected
to the center above your head.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.790 align:middle line:84%
This now has created a
two-dimensional plane

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.850 align:middle line:84%
around your head in the
form of the simplest

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.070 align:middle line:84%
two-dimensional
geometric form made

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.400 align:middle line:84%
with straight
lines, the triangle.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Held within the triangle of
force anchored on the three

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.890 align:middle line:84%
points, the one above
your head and the two

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.970 align:middle line:84%
above the shoulders, is
the golden divine light

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.480 align:middle line:84%
inside this triangle, which
is used in many traditions

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.470 align:middle line:84%
around the world to attune a
person to higher consciousness

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.000 align:middle line:90%
states.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Pull in golden light
from the sun of energy

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:03.770 align:middle line:84%
above the head to fill up the
2D triangle around your head.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Feel that golden, divine
light stabilized in a triangle

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.240 align:middle line:90%
of force around your head.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Allow that golden, divine light
to clear detrimental thought

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.080 align:middle line:84%
forms from your
head and to bring

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.100 align:middle line:84%
in powerful spiritual
awakening forces.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Feel that golden divine light
penetrate any dark space

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.470 align:middle line:84%
in your head and your
brain opening and clearing

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:35.100 align:middle line:84%
every aspect of your thoughts
and your higher consciousness.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.560 align:middle line:84%
Allow any blockages
or stuck energy

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.400 align:middle line:84%
in your head to melt away
with the radiant, golden light

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.850 align:middle line:84%
inside the triangle,
like dew evaporating

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.490 align:middle line:90%
in the light of the sun.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.610 align:middle line:84%
This golden triangle is
very powerful by itself

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.310 align:middle line:84%
if properly
activated and infused

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.530 align:middle line:90%
with divine golden light.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.320 align:middle line:10%
However, it is simply
one part of the larger

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.880 align:middle line:10%
grid of life design in
the human energy field.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.700 align:middle line:84%
This is also a very
simple practice for you

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.090 align:middle line:84%
to experience the movement
from the zero dimensional point

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.050 align:middle line:84%
to the one-dimensional line
to a two-dimensional plane

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.610 align:middle line:90%
shape in your energy field.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.670 align:middle line:84%
So this is an easy
first practice

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.940 align:middle line:84%
to begin activating and
stabilizing in your own body

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.540 align:middle line:84%
the sacred geometry forms
used for advanced spiritual

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.010 align:middle line:90%
development.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.260 align:middle line:84%
This practice could, of
course, be taken further

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.550 align:middle line:90%
into three-dimensional forms.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.720 align:middle line:84%
For example, if we added
in points of energy

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.140 align:middle line:84%
in front of the throat
chakra and at the back

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.290 align:middle line:84%
of the neck in the rear
of the throat chakra,

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.960 align:middle line:84%
we could then connect
all the points together

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.980 align:middle line:84%
into the form of a pyramid
around the head, for example.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.290 align:middle line:84%
At that point, the
triangle around the head

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.100 align:middle line:84%
will pop out to become a
three-dimensional pyramid.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.350 align:middle line:84%
However, that is
simply an example.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.830 align:middle line:84%
It is not a part of the simple
beginning practice which

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.410 align:middle line:84%
starts our construction
of the grid of life

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.770 align:middle line:90%
design in our energy body.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Now we'll take this building
of the golden triangle

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.160 align:middle line:84%
around the head and the building
of other sacred geometry

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.640 align:middle line:84%
grids in the human
energy field much further

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.950 align:middle line:90%
in our upcoming episodes.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.440 align:middle line:10%
