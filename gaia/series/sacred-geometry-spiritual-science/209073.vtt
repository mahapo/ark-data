00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Our practice will be
to mentally construct

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.060 align:middle line:10%
the octahedron and cube
Platonic duals pair and then

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.360 align:middle line:10%
to transform their
size and color.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.840 align:middle line:84%
We will be observing also
how this practice activates

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.530 align:middle line:84%
new circuits in the mind,
feeling the energetic shifts

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.160 align:middle line:84%
in the head which accompany
our actively visualizing

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.030 align:middle line:84%
and transforming
these geometric forms.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.880 align:middle line:84%
Please remember that you can
pause the video of my teaching

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.070 align:middle line:84%
you this practice
whenever you would like

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.830 align:middle line:90%
more time to perform each step.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.760 align:middle line:84%
We will begin with our energy
field awareness practice

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.370 align:middle line:84%
to get a baseline for
our beginning state

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.860 align:middle line:84%
so that we can then perceive
the changes in ourselves

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.989 align:middle line:90%
from doing this practice.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Simply close your eyes
for a moment and tune

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.490 align:middle line:84%
into the feeling of energy
inside and around your body.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Don't try to change or
manipulate anything.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.360 align:middle line:84%
Just observe the feelings in
different parts of your body

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.510 align:middle line:84%
and throughout your
entire energy field.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Then observe what
emotions or thoughts

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.800 align:middle line:84%
are present as a background
in your current state.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.390 align:middle line:84%
Now we can begin
the practice itself.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.570 align:middle line:84%
We will show you on
the video some stages

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.530 align:middle line:84%
of the exact visualization you
will need to do as a guide.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.680 align:middle line:84%
However, please be aware that
simply watching the video

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.520 align:middle line:84%
will not activate these
internal circuits fully.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.130 align:middle line:84%
To get the full benefits,
you must do the practice

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.000 align:middle line:84%
yourself with eyes closed,
mentally generating

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.570 align:middle line:84%
and transforming
each form internally.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.170 align:middle line:84%
You will be creating in this
exercise three Platonic solids

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.640 align:middle line:90%
nested inside of one another.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.640 align:middle line:84%
So make the first
form you visualize

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.789 align:middle line:84%
in the exercise fairly
large in your mind space,

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.030 align:middle line:84%
so you have space for
the other two forms

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.760 align:middle line:90%
to be created inside of it.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Now we will create this first
large form in your mind space.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Begin by visualizing a single
point of light in space,

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.400 align:middle line:84%
the zero dimensional gateway
to the divine plane, the zero

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.930 align:middle line:90%
point.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.760 align:middle line:84%
From this point, draw a line
of light upwards and downwards,

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.260 align:middle line:84%
creating a one-dimensional line
of light, the first dimension

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.450 align:middle line:84%
in space connecting
heaven and earth.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Then draw a line of light
from the original point

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.140 align:middle line:84%
out to the right and
left sides 90 degrees

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.640 align:middle line:84%
to the top-down line, creating
the second dimension of space

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.180 align:middle line:84%
and creating an equilateral
cross of light on a flat plane.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Then draw a line of light
out from the central point

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.980 align:middle line:84%
to both the front and
the back at 90 degrees

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.350 align:middle line:84%
to both other lines
you've created.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.350 align:middle line:84%
This will create a
three-axis cross,

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.100 align:middle line:84%
which we described previously
as the cubicle cross which

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.920 align:middle line:84%
makes up the three
dimensions of physical space.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.330 align:middle line:84%
Make sure all the lines of
light extend the same distance

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.400 align:middle line:84%
outwards from the
central point of light.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.710 align:middle line:84%
What energy movements
or shifts do you

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.055 align:middle line:84%
feel in your head or body from
creating this form in your mind

00:03:36.055 --> 00:03:36.855 align:middle line:90%
space?

00:03:36.855 --> 00:03:40.850 align:middle line:90%


00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Now make a line of
light connecting

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.620 align:middle line:84%
the top point of
the three-axis cross

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.640 align:middle line:84%
to both ends of the
side-to-side axis line

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.280 align:middle line:84%
and then from the top
point to both ends

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.590 align:middle line:90%
of the front-back axis line.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.630 align:middle line:84%
Then create lines of light that
connect the front-back points

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.310 align:middle line:84%
to the side points
so that all four

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.370 align:middle line:84%
of the front-back and
side-to-side points

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.725 align:middle line:84%
are now connected
together into a square.

00:04:10.725 --> 00:04:13.770 align:middle line:90%


00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.560 align:middle line:84%
You have now constructed a
three-dimensional pyramid

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.730 align:middle line:84%
of light at the
top of the cross.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Now make a line of light
connecting the bottom point

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.470 align:middle line:84%
of the three-axis cross to both
ends of the side-to-side axis

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.380 align:middle line:84%
line and then to both ends
of the front-back axis line.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.840 align:middle line:84%
You have now constructed
two pyramids of light,

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.770 align:middle line:84%
one up and one down,
sharing the same base.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.340 align:middle line:84%
This is the octahedron, the
Platonic solid for the air.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.430 align:middle line:84%
We see now how it is
constructed out of the three

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.310 align:middle line:90%
axes of physical space.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Fill in the triangular
sides of the octahedron

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.600 align:middle line:84%
so that they are not hollows but
become flat, triangular, solid

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.500 align:middle line:90%
faces.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.720 align:middle line:84%
What energy movements
or shifts do you

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.040 align:middle line:84%
feel in your head or body from
creating this octahedral form

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.930 align:middle line:90%
in your mental space?

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Now place your attention
on the very center

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.970 align:middle line:84%
of each of the four triangular
faces on the top pyramid

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.580 align:middle line:90%
of the octahedron.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Draw straight lines
of light connecting

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.280 align:middle line:84%
the center of each of the
four faces to the center

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.730 align:middle line:90%
of each adjacent face.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.430 align:middle line:84%
This creates a square
of light connecting

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.800 align:middle line:84%
the centers of the four top
faces of the octahedron.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Now place your attention
on the very center

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.160 align:middle line:84%
of each of the four triangular
faces on the bottom pyramid

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.510 align:middle line:90%
of the octahedron.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Now draw straight lines
of light connecting

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.250 align:middle line:84%
the center of each
of the four faces

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.310 align:middle line:84%
to the center of
each adjacent face.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.970 align:middle line:84%
This creates another square
connecting the centers

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.010 align:middle line:90%
of the four bottom faces.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.800 align:middle line:84%
This square hovers
directly below the square

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.820 align:middle line:84%
connecting the centers
of the four top faces.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Now simply draw a straight
vertical line of light

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.970 align:middle line:84%
to connect each of the
corners of the bottom square

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.900 align:middle line:84%
to the corner directly
above it of the top square.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Fill in the sides
of all six square

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.610 align:middle line:90%
faces to make them solid.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.640 align:middle line:84%
You have now created
the cube, the dual form

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.650 align:middle line:90%
of the octahedron.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.890 align:middle line:84%
Now place your attention
on the very center

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.970 align:middle line:84%
of each of the six
square faces of the cube.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Draw lines of light
from the center

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.640 align:middle line:84%
of the top square directly to
the centers of the four side

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.950 align:middle line:90%
faces.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Then connect with lines of light
the centers of each of the four

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.490 align:middle line:84%
side faces to the center
of both adjacent faces.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.620 align:middle line:84%
You have now constructed a
pyramid inside of the cube.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Now draw lines of
light connecting

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.850 align:middle line:84%
the centers of the four
side faces of the cube

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.640 align:middle line:84%
to the center of the
bottom square face,

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.070 align:middle line:90%
creating an octahedron.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Make the eight triangular
faces of the octahedron solid.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.270 align:middle line:84%
You have now used the
Platonic dual method

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.870 align:middle line:84%
to connect divine centers,
which then manifests

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.720 align:middle line:84%
the outer forms of
the octahedron of air

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.790 align:middle line:90%
and the cube of earth.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:27.630 align:middle line:84%
You now have an
octahedron within a cube

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.750 align:middle line:90%
within an octahedron.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Now use your mental power to
make the large outer octahedron

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.980 align:middle line:90%
a blue color.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:42.970 align:middle line:84%
Then make the middle
cube a green color.

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:47.770 align:middle line:84%
Then make the small inner
octahedron a red color.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.050 align:middle line:84%
What energy movements
or shifts do you

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.840 align:middle line:84%
feel in your head or
body from adding color

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.040 align:middle line:84%
to these three forms and
holding that inner visualization

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.630 align:middle line:90%
steady?

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Is the image of the three forms
and their colors rock steady

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:06.850 align:middle line:84%
on your internal mental screen,
or does it fade in and out

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:10.450 align:middle line:84%
as you need to continually
remind yourself and recreate

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.070 align:middle line:90%
the form?

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Just observe how strong your
visualization power is right

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.570 align:middle line:84%
now, knowing it will get
stronger very quickly

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:23.110 align:middle line:84%
every time you repeat this
practice in the future.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.770 align:middle line:84%
This mental strengthening
is key to developing

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:31.600 align:middle line:84%
creative visualization
and manifestation powers.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.059 align:middle line:84%
Keeping the cube
steady and immobile

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:36.880 align:middle line:84%
between the two
octahedra, rotate

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.090 align:middle line:84%
the outer blue
octahedron clockwise.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Then rotate the inner red
octahedron counterclockwise.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.610 align:middle line:84%
You now have two octahedra
of different sizes

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:52.930 align:middle line:84%
and different colors,
counterrotating

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:56.290 align:middle line:84%
with an immobile green
cube between them.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.870 align:middle line:84%
What energy movements
are shifts do you

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:02.740 align:middle line:84%
feel in your head or body from
creating and counterrotating

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.220 align:middle line:84%
these forms in
your mental space?

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.430 align:middle line:84%
If you are sensitive, you may
have noticed specific energy

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.400 align:middle line:84%
activations in your
head or your body

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.360 align:middle line:84%
when making and transforming
these Platonic solid forms.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.540 align:middle line:84%
You may have felt a specific
energy activation in your head

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.970 align:middle line:84%
or body when adding
in the colors

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.280 align:middle line:84%
and then felt a very
different energy

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.090 align:middle line:84%
activation when you began
to rotate and counterrotate

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:30.310 align:middle line:90%
the forms.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:33.220 align:middle line:10%
This classical practice
with creating and rotating

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.280 align:middle line:10%
sacred geometry forms
is just the beginning

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:41.290 align:middle line:10%
of this path, which can develop
great mind power within us.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:44.350 align:middle line:84%
This type of practice can
activate key energy circuits

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.680 align:middle line:84%
in the head and body,
developing our capacity

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.720 align:middle line:84%
to perceive and create
forms on the mental plane.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.990 align:middle line:84%
These mental forms we
create are not abstractions.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.110 align:middle line:84%
They can be perceived
by true clairvoyants

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.950 align:middle line:84%
and by higher spiritual beings,
such as the angelic beings

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:06.050 align:middle line:84%
described in the
Western tradition.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.980 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it is easier for
higher spiritual beings

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:12.250 align:middle line:84%
to perceive these kinds
of geometric thought forms

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.980 align:middle line:84%
that we generate than it
is for them to perceive

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.380 align:middle line:90%
our physical bodies.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:21.430 align:middle line:84%
This ability to create mental
images on higher plane levels

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:25.030 align:middle line:84%
leads in time to more advanced
stages of inner development

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.610 align:middle line:84%
as we strengthen our
ability to perceive

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.190 align:middle line:84%
and communicate
with higher worlds

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:33.370 align:middle line:90%
through this new mind power.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.130 align:middle line:84%
If you had difficulty
visualizing the forms

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:40.180 align:middle line:84%
or adding color or adding
movement, don't despair.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.090 align:middle line:84%
Simply observe what
parts were easy for you

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:45.940 align:middle line:84%
and which were
difficult. This shows you

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.180 align:middle line:84%
the area you now need
to work on to strengthen

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.420 align:middle line:90%
that aspect of your mind power.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:55.900 align:middle line:84%
As we mentioned at the outset,
these kinds of mental practices

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.290 align:middle line:84%
require activating a
particular energy pathway

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:03.500 align:middle line:84%
in your head, which is similar
to flexing a physical muscle,

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.510 align:middle line:84%
and just like a physical muscle,
you will strengthen it greatly

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:11.776 align:middle line:84%
every time you use it
in practices like this.

00:11:11.776 --> 00:11:14.470 align:middle line:84%
This exercise starts the
process of opening up

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:18.850 align:middle line:84%
your internal vision on the
first nonphysical consciousness

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:21.430 align:middle line:84%
level, which is known
in the Western tradition

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.830 align:middle line:90%
as the astral plane.

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:28.210 align:middle line:84%
The term "aster" means star,
meaning a source of light

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:30.940 align:middle line:90%
in the cosmic darkness.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:34.330 align:middle line:10%
