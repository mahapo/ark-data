00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.550 align:middle line:10%
>> Join me now as we apply
the sacred geometry form

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.350 align:middle line:10%
of the torus to activate and
clear our entire energy field

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.010 align:middle line:10%
and experience how we are
ourselves in reality a grail

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.630 align:middle line:10%
cup, which receives the divine
essence from above and below

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.340 align:middle line:10%
to activate our central channel
of energy and the torus around

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.400 align:middle line:10%
our entire energy field.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.640 align:middle line:10%
We'll start with our energy
field awareness practice

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.980 align:middle line:10%
which we used
previously as the way

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.190 align:middle line:10%
to get a baseline reading
on your energy field

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.140 align:middle line:10%
before beginning any
energetic practice.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.520 align:middle line:84%
So you can then more clearly
see the effects of that practice

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.950 align:middle line:90%
afterwards.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Simply close your eyes and
tune into the feeling of energy

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.740 align:middle line:90%
in and around your body.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.670 align:middle line:90%
What does the energy feel like?

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.130 align:middle line:84%
Then observe what is
currently in your thoughts

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.270 align:middle line:90%
and in your emotions.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.030 align:middle line:90%


00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Remember, you are just observing
what is present inside you

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.420 align:middle line:84%
before the practice to
get a baseline reading.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.320 align:middle line:84%
You're not trying to change
or manipulate anything.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, we begin the
torus practice.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Stand up with your feet
shoulder-width apart.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.400 align:middle line:10%
We will mirror with our hands
the movement of the energy

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.500 align:middle line:10%
flowing in the torus.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.180 align:middle line:84%
The first part of
the practice will

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.980 align:middle line:84%
be to run the
energy in the torus

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.120 align:middle line:84%
through your central channel
from below to above and then

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.360 align:middle line:90%
around the body.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.420 align:middle line:90%
This is the earthly energy flow.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.800 align:middle line:90%


00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.530 align:middle line:84%
On the inhalation, you
will pull the earth energy

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.610 align:middle line:84%
up your central channel to the
area above your crown center.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.280 align:middle line:84%
To the height of where
your middle fingertips,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.830 align:middle line:84%
touch the central
column above your head

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.590 align:middle line:84%
when your arms are
fully extended.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.380 align:middle line:84%
You will start with your
attention at an equal distance

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.900 align:middle line:84%
below the feet as
the distance which

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.290 align:middle line:84%
your middle fingertips extend
above your head in the column

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.520 align:middle line:90%
above.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Make a mental note now
of where this point

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.840 align:middle line:84%
is in the earth between
and below your feet.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.510 align:middle line:84%
When you have fully
inhaled, your hands

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.360 align:middle line:84%
will then be fully
extended above your head

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.580 align:middle line:84%
with the middle
fingertips touching

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.020 align:middle line:84%
the top of the torus in
the column above your head.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.650 align:middle line:84%
On the exhalation, the
energy will flow downward

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.200 align:middle line:84%
from this point above
your head around you

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.990 align:middle line:84%
to all sides of
the body, showing

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.060 align:middle line:84%
the extent of the
torus energy movement

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.760 align:middle line:90%
to all sides of your body.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Your hands will mirror the
energy flow down the sides,

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.520 align:middle line:84%
until at the end
of the exhalation,

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.860 align:middle line:84%
you have return to
the starting point,

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.660 align:middle line:84%
pointing both hands down to
the point below the feet.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.900 align:middle line:84%
A very important note is
that although our arms will

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.830 align:middle line:84%
be mirroring the flow of energy
along the sides, in reality

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.800 align:middle line:84%
the torus flow is all
around us like a sphere.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.890 align:middle line:84%
So make sure you
consciously extend

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.550 align:middle line:84%
the energy just as far behind
you and in front of you

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.030 align:middle line:84%
as you do out to the two sides
even though your hands are not

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.500 align:middle line:84%
showing the flows to the front
and back, only to the sides.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.600 align:middle line:84%
Be aware that most
people unconsciously

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.660 align:middle line:84%
project their energy much
further forward than they

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.340 align:middle line:84%
do to the back, which creates
a subtle energetic imbalance.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.430 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you extend the torus
energy as a perfect sphere

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.790 align:middle line:84%
all around you to
both sides and front

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.200 align:middle line:84%
and back equally in a
perfect spherical form.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.990 align:middle line:84%
This exercise is very
valuable for restoring

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.210 align:middle line:84%
the correct geometric
flow pattern

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.730 align:middle line:84%
to the energy field
around our body

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.090 align:middle line:84%
rather than the squashed
and distorted form it takes

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.870 align:middle line:90%
unconsciously for most people.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.380 align:middle line:84%
We will now do a practice
run of the earthly torus flow

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.730 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Start by putting your attention
at the point between your feet

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.100 align:middle line:90%
down in the ground.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Place your fingertips together
with your hands pointing down

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.630 align:middle line:90%
between your legs.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Inhale and pull the earth
energy up from beneath you,

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.090 align:middle line:84%
up between your feet
between the legs.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And then when the energy reaches
the level of your fingertips,

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.580 align:middle line:84%
which are pointing
down, let your hands

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.060 align:middle line:84%
start to rise with the
fingertips staying together,

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.500 align:middle line:84%
moving your hands up to mirror
the energy movement all the way

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.350 align:middle line:90%
up as the energy ascends.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.590 align:middle line:84%
Feel when the energy
penetrates into the perineum

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.940 align:middle line:84%
at the base of your abdomen
and continues upward

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.820 align:middle line:84%
through your central
column until it exits out

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.090 align:middle line:84%
your head at the crown
center and then reaches

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.610 align:middle line:84%
the top of the torus
at the place where

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.360 align:middle line:84%
your middle fingertips touch,
when your arms are fully

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.010 align:middle line:84%
extended above your head at
the end of the inhalation.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, exhale, letting
your hands part

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.610 align:middle line:84%
and mirror the flow of
energy down along your sides

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.160 align:middle line:84%
with your arms at
full extension,

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.230 align:middle line:84%
until at the end
of the exhalation,

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.680 align:middle line:84%
the fingertips come back
together with hands pointing

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.860 align:middle line:84%
to the base of the torus
between and beneath your feet

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.180 align:middle line:90%
back to the starting point.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.720 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.240 align:middle line:84%
For your regular
practice after this show,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.100 align:middle line:84%
do a total of seven repetitions
of this earthly flow each time.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.700 align:middle line:10%
Now, close your eyes while
you let your hands rest

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.050 align:middle line:10%
by your side.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Once again, do the energy
field awareness practice.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.010 align:middle line:84%
So you can now feel how your
energy has shifted from doing

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.560 align:middle line:90%
this earthly flow practice.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.430 align:middle line:10%
With your eyes closed, tune
into the feeling of the energy

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.780 align:middle line:10%
in and around your body.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.080 align:middle line:10%
How does your energy
feel different to you

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.920 align:middle line:10%
after doing the earthly
torus flow practice?

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Note that common sensations
with the earthly torus flow

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.980 align:middle line:84%
are increased heat
and energy flow

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:19.410 align:middle line:84%
in the body along with a feeling
of stability and groundedness.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.030 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you will
be particularly

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.070 align:middle line:84%
aware of areas of
your body where

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.790 align:middle line:84%
the energy was blocked or
stagnant as the increased

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:30.390 align:middle line:84%
energy flow makes you aware
of these problem areas needing

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.750 align:middle line:84%
to be cleared and have
their full power restored

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:38.550 align:middle line:84%
through more repetitions of
the torus energy movement.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, we will experience the
complementary opposite flow,

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.960 align:middle line:84%
the heavenly flow,
from above downwards.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.570 align:middle line:84%
The practice is the same
as with the earthly flow,

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:53.190 align:middle line:84%
only now we are reversing
the flow directions.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.010 align:middle line:84%
Please join with me as we
go through the essentials

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.630 align:middle line:90%
of the practice.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Start with your arms at full
extension above your head,

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.900 align:middle line:84%
fingertips together at
the top of the torus.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.360 align:middle line:84%
As you inhale, you
will pull the energy

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.620 align:middle line:84%
from this point above your
head, bringing the divine energy

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.730 align:middle line:84%
into your crown center,
feeling the profound impact

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:18.420 align:middle line:84%
of this energy flow into
your central channel.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Let your hands mirror the
movement of the energy

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.570 align:middle line:84%
through your central
channel until it exits out

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.810 align:middle line:84%
the perineum at the
base of your abdomen,

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.230 align:middle line:84%
reaching the point between
and below your feet

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:35.310 align:middle line:84%
at your full inhalation, with
your arms at full extension,

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:39.390 align:middle line:84%
pointing downwards with the
fingertips together aimed

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.150 align:middle line:84%
at the location
between your feet.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Then exhale and bring the energy
up in all directions around you

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.800 align:middle line:84%
along the sphere
boundary of the torus,

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.770 align:middle line:84%
mirroring the energy
movement with your arms

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.220 align:middle line:84%
extended outwards to
the sides rising up,

00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:00.150 align:middle line:84%
until the fingertips come
back together at full arm

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:05.530 align:middle line:84%
extension above your head at
the end of the exhalation.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:08.020 align:middle line:84%
We'll do this practice
together three times.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.360 align:middle line:90%


00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.870 align:middle line:84%
When you practice this
heavenly flow in the future,

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:20.390 align:middle line:84%
do seven full repetitions of
this energy flow every time.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:24.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, relax and let your
arms drop to your sides.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Close your eyes and again do
the energy field awareness

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.520 align:middle line:84%
practice, tuning in to the
changed feeling of energy

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.450 align:middle line:90%
in and around your body.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:36.350 align:middle line:84%
How does your energy
feel different now?

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:40.820 align:middle line:84%
The energy sensations of this
downwards heavenly energy flow

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.780 align:middle line:84%
can be quite different from the
upwards earthly energy flow,

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.290 align:middle line:84%
although both can create
significant heat and energy

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.120 align:middle line:90%
movement in the body.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Each direction of flow
has its own effects

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:56.300 align:middle line:84%
for clearing and recharging
your energy field.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.850 align:middle line:84%
You could choose to do
either direction of flow

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.850 align:middle line:84%
or do them one after
another as we have done here

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.990 align:middle line:90%
to get the benefits of both.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.170 align:middle line:84%
There is another
more advanced method

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.390 align:middle line:84%
for the torus flow,
one which tends

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.210 align:middle line:84%
to be quite hidden in
classical traditions

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.160 align:middle line:90%
and which is very potent.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.140 align:middle line:84%
This is the advanced
practice of running

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.630 align:middle line:84%
the earthly and heavenly
flows simultaneously.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:23.660 align:middle line:84%
In other words, both
directions at the same time.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:27.860 align:middle line:84%
This is a major secret of
advanced energy practices.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.640 align:middle line:10%
When two complementary energy
flows collide together,

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.600 align:middle line:10%
this can open up a gating effect
for higher dimensional energies

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.210 align:middle line:10%
to enter into a system.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.400 align:middle line:84%
This is the same
alchemical principle

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.030 align:middle line:84%
as the union of opposite
complementary female yin

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:48.110 align:middle line:84%
and male yang energies opening
up a gating for a new life

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:50.680 align:middle line:90%
to enter into the world.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.470 align:middle line:84%
For this exercise,
we will use one hand

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:56.710 align:middle line:84%
to mirror the upward
moving earthly flow

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:00.220 align:middle line:84%
and the other hand will mirror
the downward moving heavenly

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.150 align:middle line:90%
flow.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.990 align:middle line:10%
It is fine to use whichever
hand you prefer for each flow.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:08.440 align:middle line:84%
If you have no preference,
then start with your right arm

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.170 align:middle line:84%
at full extension
connecting to the top

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:15.580 align:middle line:84%
of the torus above your head and
your left arm at full extension

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.100 align:middle line:84%
pointing down to the
bottom of the torus

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.890 align:middle line:90%
between and beneath your feet.

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:24.100 align:middle line:84%
For this practice, you
will, on the inhalation,

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:27.490 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously breathe energy
down the central channel

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:30.160 align:middle line:84%
from the point above
the head and up

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.760 align:middle line:84%
the central channel from
the point beneath the feet.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.860 align:middle line:84%
These two flows will
pass through one

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:39.310 align:middle line:84%
another creating the gating
effect for higher level

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:40.750 align:middle line:90%
energies.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Each hand will
mirror the movement

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.280 align:middle line:90%
of each directional flow.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Your hands moving in
opposite directions

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:50.800 align:middle line:84%
will pass by one
another around the level

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.190 align:middle line:84%
of the navel at the
midpoint of your inhalation.

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:56.890 align:middle line:90%


00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Join me now as we practice the
coordination of the breathing

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:02.920 align:middle line:84%
with the movement of
energy, which is mirrored

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.960 align:middle line:90%
in your hands' movement.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.080 align:middle line:84%
With one arm fully extended down
and one arm fully extended up,

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.980 align:middle line:84%
breathe in and pull the energy
down from the top of the torus

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.500 align:middle line:84%
above your head and
into the crown center

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:18.700 align:middle line:84%
to descend down the central
column mirrored by your hand

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:22.660 align:middle line:84%
movement downwards to the same
height as the descending energy

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.460 align:middle line:90%
you are focusing on.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.910 align:middle line:84%
While simultaneously, you are
breathing in and pulling up

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:30.820 align:middle line:84%
the energy from the bottom of
the torus beneath your feet,

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:34.720 align:middle line:84%
mirroring the energy movement
upwards with your hands.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.560 align:middle line:84%
As you pull in the energy on
the inhalation from both the top

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.650 align:middle line:84%
and the bottom of the
torus simultaneously,

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:45.760 align:middle line:84%
be aware when the ascending
and descending focal points

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.700 align:middle line:84%
are passing through one
another around the level

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.060 align:middle line:90%
of your abdomen.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.410 align:middle line:84%
This is when your two
hands pass one another.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:56.020 align:middle line:84%
Although we are focusing on
just one part of each energy

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.410 align:middle line:84%
movement with our hands
moving upwards and downwards,

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:02.980 align:middle line:84%
in reality, there are two
complete rotating torus

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:03.940 align:middle line:90%
movements.

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And the entirety of
both Taurus fields

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:11.410 align:middle line:84%
are moving through one another
throughout the practice.

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Then at the end of
the full end breath,

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.530 align:middle line:84%
your arms will again be
extended upwards and downwards,

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:21.520 align:middle line:84%
only now the opposite arm is
at the top or bottom position

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.790 align:middle line:90%
than when you began in breath.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Then, with the
exhalation, each hand

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.760 align:middle line:84%
will again mirror your focal
point of the complete movement

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.060 align:middle line:84%
of the energy as they
sweep off to each side

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.820 align:middle line:84%
to show the spherical
boundary of the torus going

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.990 align:middle line:84%
up and down on opposite
sides simultaneously,

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:44.140 align:middle line:84%
until at the full
exhalation the hands are

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.200 align:middle line:84%
back in their original
fully extended positions

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:52.780 align:middle line:84%
up and down, in place to begin
the next inhalation and energy

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.160 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.670 align:middle line:84%
This exercise not only opens
up a gate for higher level

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:59.500 align:middle line:90%
energies to enter your system.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:03.370 align:middle line:84%
It also is excellent for
activating and coordinating

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.850 align:middle line:84%
both brain hemispheres through
the simultaneous counter

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:10.210 align:middle line:84%
movements of both
sides of the body.

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:13.030 align:middle line:84%
As you experience
this practice, focus

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:16.720 align:middle line:84%
on the feeling of these
two divine nectars:

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.890 align:middle line:84%
the illuminating heavenly flow
energy and the strengthening

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:23.710 align:middle line:84%
earthly flow energy
as they alchemically

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:29.090 align:middle line:84%
connect like lovers inside
your body and all around you.

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Be aware of the exquisite
nectar, the flavor, the quality

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.980 align:middle line:84%
of the dynamic flow of
both energies through one

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:40.690 align:middle line:84%
another streaming in
and around your body.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.600 align:middle line:84%
Let's now do the movement
three times together.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.576 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:47.576 --> 00:14:19.910 align:middle line:90%


00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.400 align:middle line:84%
In the future, do
seven repetitions

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:26.300 align:middle line:84%
when you do this practice
to get the full power of it.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Remember to close your eyes
at the end of the practice

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:32.360 align:middle line:84%
and relax, dropping
your arms by your sides.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Use the energy field
awareness practice

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:39.830 align:middle line:84%
to simply observe how the energy
feels in and around your body.

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:43.490 align:middle line:84%
How has this counter-rotating
movement of the two torus

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:45.980 align:middle line:84%
affected your energy
and consciousness?

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.840 align:middle line:84%
How does this feel
different to you

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:52.760 align:middle line:84%
from the simple earthly or
heavenly torus flow practices?

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.890 align:middle line:84%
If the energy generated
by these practices

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:57.890 align:middle line:84%
feels too intense for you,
it is important to know

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:01.940 align:middle line:84%
that the safe place to gather
and store energy in your body

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.010 align:middle line:90%
is in the lower abdomen region.

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:07.790 align:middle line:84%
It is not safe to store
intense energy accumulations

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.650 align:middle line:90%
in the chest or in the head.

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:12.710 align:middle line:84%
So if you feel too much
energy in your body

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:15.560 align:middle line:84%
from these practices,
simply focus your attention

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.780 align:middle line:84%
at an area about
an inch and a half

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:21.920 align:middle line:84%
below the level of the navel
in the center of your body.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Spin the energy
there in a vortex,

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.750 align:middle line:84%
either clockwise or
counterclockwise,

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:29.240 align:middle line:84%
whichever feels more
comfortable to you,

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:34.580 align:middle line:84%
into this location to pull in
and gather the energy there.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.150 align:middle line:84%
This is a safe place to collect
and store the excess energy

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.460 align:middle line:90%
that you have generated.

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:43.370 align:middle line:84%
You can now activate the torus
in your energy field any time

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.440 align:middle line:84%
you choose, bringing
the clearing

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and recharging divine energies
into the grail cup of your body

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.280 align:middle line:90%
through using this practice.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.730 align:middle line:84%
There are many other powerful
and important torus energy

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:59.390 align:middle line:84%
activations for the human
body and energy field.

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:01.880 align:middle line:10%
You can learn these
advanced activations

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:07.730 align:middle line:10%
through the online courses
