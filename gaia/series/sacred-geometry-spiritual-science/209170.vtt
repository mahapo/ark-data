00:00:02.465 --> 00:00:22.185 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:26.280 align:middle line:10%
>> The 10 energy centers of the
grid of life design are linked

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.180 align:middle line:10%
together through pathways, or
we could also call them energy

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.800 align:middle line:10%
channels.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.130 align:middle line:84%
There are exactly three
horizontal pathways

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.880 align:middle line:84%
just as there are three anchor
points for the astral body.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Seven vertical pathways just as
there are seven anchor points

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.910 align:middle line:90%
for the etheric life body.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And 12 diagonal pathways just
as there are 12 anchor points

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.310 align:middle line:90%
for the physical body.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.880 align:middle line:84%
This brings us now to
completing the work we began

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.450 align:middle line:84%
in our earlier episodes of
constructing the grid of life

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.710 align:middle line:90%
design in our own energy field.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.770 align:middle line:84%
First, close your
eyes for just a moment

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.220 align:middle line:84%
and use the energy field
awareness practice we discussed

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.100 align:middle line:84%
in earlier episodes
to simply tune

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.690 align:middle line:84%
in to the feeling of energy
in and around your body.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And to become aware of what your
current level of consciousness

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.000 align:middle line:84%
is, what thoughts and
emotions you currently have.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.210 align:middle line:84%
This will provide a baseline
so that you can clearly

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.660 align:middle line:84%
observe changes after you
perform the practice which

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.570 align:middle line:90%
we are about to do.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.940 align:middle line:84%
You can now open
your eyes and we

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.480 align:middle line:90%
will do the practice together.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Previously, we constructed
the first eight centers

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.050 align:middle line:84%
of this powerful initiation
pattern and the pathways

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.820 align:middle line:84%
connecting them into an
active net or matrix.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.550 align:middle line:84%
We will now activate
the final two centers

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.920 align:middle line:84%
and build the last
energy pathways

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.300 align:middle line:84%
which complete the grid of life
design in our energy field.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.870 align:middle line:84%
The pattern which can transform
our consciousness and energy,

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.630 align:middle line:84%
not only in our
current lifetime,

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.260 align:middle line:84%
but into all of our future
spiritual destiny as we

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.380 align:middle line:90%
described previously.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.620 align:middle line:84%
Begin by becoming aware of
the centers and pathways

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.800 align:middle line:84%
you have already constructed
in your energy body

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.740 align:middle line:90%
in the previous episodes.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.750 align:middle line:84%
Become aware of
the middle pillar

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.320 align:middle line:84%
centers, the center above your
head, and the heart center.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Connect these two centers
together with a line of light.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, become aware of the
right side pillar centers,

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.830 align:middle line:84%
the center above
the right shoulder,

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.760 align:middle line:84%
the center in the
upper right chest,

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.670 align:middle line:90%
and the center in the liver.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Connect these three centers
together with a line of light.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, become aware of the
left side pillar centers,

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.380 align:middle line:84%
the center above
the left shoulder,

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.740 align:middle line:84%
the center in the
upper left chest,

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.860 align:middle line:90%
and the center in the spleen.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.200 align:middle line:84%
Connect these three centers
together with a line of light.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Connect the center
above the head

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.600 align:middle line:84%
and the two centers
above the shoulders

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.010 align:middle line:84%
into a triangle of golden
light surrounding your head.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.650 align:middle line:84%
Then connect in lines
of light, the two

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.450 align:middle line:84%
center above your shoulders,
to the heart center

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.080 align:middle line:90%
in another triangle of light.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Then connect the two
center in your upper lungs

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.780 align:middle line:84%
to the heart center in
another triangle of light.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Then connect the two center
at your liver and spleen

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.710 align:middle line:84%
to the heart center in
another triangle of light.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, we will add in
the remaining section

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.220 align:middle line:90%
of the grid of life design.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Both of the remaining centers
are on the middle pillar.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.020 align:middle line:84%
These centers ground the gold
pattern into our lower body

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.920 align:middle line:84%
and thus into the earth
itself to complete

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.329 align:middle line:84%
the process of our full physical
incarnation into the body.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.010 align:middle line:84%
Become aware of the energy
you feel at your solar plexus,

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.960 align:middle line:84%
not just in the
front of the body

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.260 align:middle line:84%
but in the center
of your body also.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Use the zero-point
centering practice

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.580 align:middle line:84%
we described in
previous episodes

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.740 align:middle line:84%
to move all of your
energy and awareness

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:39.190 align:middle line:84%
into the center of the center of
the center of the solar plexus

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.450 align:middle line:84%
until you make contact with
the divine absolute center

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.580 align:middle line:90%
of the solar plexus.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.910 align:middle line:84%
As you touch that divine
center of the solar plexus,

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.750 align:middle line:84%
then use the radiance technique
that we explored previously

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.320 align:middle line:84%
to allow the activated
center of the solar plexus

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.220 align:middle line:84%
to radiate out energy
in all directions

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.640 align:middle line:84%
into a spherical sun
of light and warmth.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.180 align:middle line:90%


00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Now that the solar
plexus is activated,

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.200 align:middle line:84%
you can connect the
liver and spleen centers

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.630 align:middle line:84%
to the solar plexus center
in another triangle of light.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.140 align:middle line:84%
Be aware this triangle is
very shallow in the human body

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.510 align:middle line:84%
compared to how
the triangle looks

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.620 align:middle line:84%
when seen on the cosmological
diagram of the tree of life.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, we will activate our
final grounding center

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.870 align:middle line:90%
on the tree of life.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Become aware of a
sphere of energy

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.390 align:middle line:84%
in the center of your
lower abdomen, which

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.850 align:middle line:84%
holds within it the
area from the top

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.280 align:middle line:84%
of the pubic bone
to the perineum

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.350 align:middle line:90%
at the base of the trunk.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.960 align:middle line:84%
This sphere of light and
energy holds within it

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.000 align:middle line:84%
the genitals and the
base of the spine,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.070 align:middle line:90%
including the entire sacrum.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Note that this
sphere essentially

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.140 align:middle line:84%
holds within it both
the sex and the base

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:06.140 align:middle line:84%
chakras from the seven anchor
points of the etheric body.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, allow the
solar plexus center

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.320 align:middle line:84%
to radiate a line of light
down the middle pillar

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.520 align:middle line:84%
to this grounding sphere
of the grid of life design,

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.330 align:middle line:84%
activating and energizing
this final center.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.240 align:middle line:90%


00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Use the zero-point
centering practice

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.920 align:middle line:84%
to move all of your
energy and awareness

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.780 align:middle line:84%
into the center of the center
of the center of the sphere

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.020 align:middle line:84%
of the lower abdomen
until you make contact

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.680 align:middle line:84%
with the divine absolute
center of this grounding

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.130 align:middle line:90%
and energizing sphere.

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.970 align:middle line:84%
When you do, use the
radiance technique

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.450 align:middle line:84%
to then radiate out
energy in all directions

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.020 align:middle line:84%
into a spherical sun
of light and warmth

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.480 align:middle line:84%
that encompasses the
sphere around the genitals,

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.060 align:middle line:84%
the base of the
abdomen, and the sacrum.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:08.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, one last step and the
gold pattern will be completed.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.850 align:middle line:84%
Connect the liver and spleen
center in lines of light

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.570 align:middle line:84%
to the grounding base
of the abdomen center,

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:21.840 align:middle line:84%
creating our final triangle of
golden light in the pattern.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And now, also become aware
of your middle pillar

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.890 align:middle line:84%
of a continuous line of light
through the absolute center

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:33.210 align:middle line:84%
of your body from the
sphere above your head

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.930 align:middle line:84%
to the sphere at your heart
to the sphere of light

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.870 align:middle line:84%
and warmth at your
solar plexus, and then

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.680 align:middle line:84%
grounding into the sphere
of light and warmth

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.500 align:middle line:90%
at the base of the abdomen.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.350 align:middle line:84%
You have now completed
this entire sacred geometry

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:53.350 align:middle line:84%
initiation pattern
which has the potential

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:58.090 align:middle line:84%
through ongoing practices with
it to activate and manifest

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:01.330 align:middle line:90%
your spiritual destiny.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Become aware now of the
total pattern of power

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.420 align:middle line:84%
which you have now activated
in your energy system.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.870 align:middle line:84%
The 10 centers which have been
activated into radiating sun

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.510 align:middle line:90%
spheres.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.990 align:middle line:84%
These centers are linked through
the complete net pattern,

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:21.970 align:middle line:84%
the three horizontal pathways,
the seven vertical pathways,

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:25.570 align:middle line:90%
and the 12 diagonal pathways.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:29.200 align:middle line:84%
Take slow deep breaths
and use the vital power

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.429 align:middle line:84%
in the breath to activate
the pattern further.

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Feel all 10 sun spheres
and 22 energy pathways

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:43.570 align:middle line:84%
increase the intensity of
its warmth and vibration

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:46.270 align:middle line:84%
through using the
power of the breath

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:50.760 align:middle line:90%
to build up their intensity.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:56.730 align:middle line:84%
In your mind's eye, see the
10 suns and 22 energy pathways

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.180 align:middle line:84%
radiate light more
brilliantly with every breath,

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.180 align:middle line:90%
becoming incandescent.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.500 align:middle line:84%
Feel that this pattern is
your true spiritual blueprint

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:12.270 align:middle line:84%
around which the physical
and subtle bodies form.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.840 align:middle line:84%
When activated, you will feel
that the grid of life design

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.930 align:middle line:84%
is your true
immortal body and you

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.600 align:middle line:84%
may lose awareness
of your physical body

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:28.320 align:middle line:84%
as you dwell deeply within the
gold, the grid of life design.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Then with your eyes closed,
use the energy field awareness

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.690 align:middle line:84%
practice to just observe the
after effects of this practice

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.880 align:middle line:90%
in your energy field.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Ask yourself the
silent question,

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:46.597 align:middle line:84%
how has this practice
structured my body of energy?

00:09:46.597 --> 00:09:48.180 align:middle line:84%
How does your
consciousness and energy

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.420 align:middle line:84%
feel different after
having done this practice

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:55.110 align:middle line:84%
to activate your spiritual
power and your destiny

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:58.330 align:middle line:84%
through the sacred
geometry pattern?

00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.920 align:middle line:90%
Then you can open your eyes.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.800 align:middle line:90%


00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.490 align:middle line:84%
We have in this episode explored
key sacred geometry patterns
