00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:23.060 align:middle line:10%
>>ROBERT J. GILBERT: Welcome.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.490 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host Dr.
Robert J. Gilbert.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.520 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we will
explore a key sacred geometry

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.790 align:middle line:10%
pattern which is essential
for recharging energy

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.540 align:middle line:10%
in the human body.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.450 align:middle line:84%
This pattern not only exists
throughout the human body,

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.800 align:middle line:84%
it is also a key energy
source from the subatomic

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.650 align:middle line:84%
all the way up to the
Galactic level and even

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.570 align:middle line:90%
connects to higher dimensions.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Spiritually, this
is the same pattern

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.110 align:middle line:84%
which creates the form of the
chalice of the Holy Grail.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.140 align:middle line:84%
You will learn, in this
episode, three essential methods

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.520 align:middle line:84%
to use the sacred geometry
pattern to clear and energize

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.910 align:middle line:84%
your entire body
and energy field.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Every form in sacred
geometry is like a letter

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.490 align:middle line:90%
of a divine alphabet.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.470 align:middle line:84%
These letters are
formed, then combined

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.180 align:middle line:84%
into words which are complex
combinations of sacred geometry

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.840 align:middle line:84%
patterns which create
all levels of reality.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Sacred geometry is
sometimes described

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.570 align:middle line:84%
as the divine
language of creation

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.260 align:middle line:84%
or as an angelic language
because higher spiritual beings

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.710 align:middle line:84%
can communicate and create
through the language

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.840 align:middle line:90%
of sacred geometry.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.540 align:middle line:84%
This divine language of
sacred geometry forms

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.210 align:middle line:84%
was also known as
the secret script

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.430 align:middle line:90%
in some spiritual traditions.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.030 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.910 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual initiation
process of humans learning

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.280 align:middle line:84%
to read this divine
language has been

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.920 align:middle line:84%
expressed in many
different ways,

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.380 align:middle line:84%
as learning to read
in the Book of Nature.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.580 align:middle line:84%
We saw in our last episode
that sacred geometry patterns

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.090 align:middle line:84%
are at their highest level,
thought forms and the mind

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.840 align:middle line:84%
of God which provides the energy
blueprints for the creation

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.180 align:middle line:90%
of all physical existence.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.330 align:middle line:84%
These patterns hold the
secret of materialization.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.320 align:middle line:84%
How to control the manifestation
of energy and spirit

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.700 align:middle line:90%
into solid physical matter.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.670 align:middle line:84%
In our previous episode, we
introduced the first pattern

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.640 align:middle line:84%
or what we could
call the first letter

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.550 align:middle line:84%
in the language of
sacred geometry, which

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.670 align:middle line:84%
was the point in the
center of the circle.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.120 align:middle line:84%
The point in the center is
the zero dimensional gateway

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.230 align:middle line:90%
to the divine plane.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.110 align:middle line:90%


00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.550 align:middle line:84%
The point in the
center is called

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.040 align:middle line:90%
the singularity in physics.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.960 align:middle line:84%
It is the unified
field where everything

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.360 align:middle line:90%
is united into the one.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.530 align:middle line:84%
The point then expands outwards
to create a circle or a sphere

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.940 align:middle line:90%
in three dimensions.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.760 align:middle line:84%
This sphere is the
container for materializing

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.460 align:middle line:90%
the physical world.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.620 align:middle line:84%
In our previous
episode, we experienced

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.220 align:middle line:84%
how the point in the center
of the circle or sphere image

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.980 align:middle line:84%
is the secret for
activating any energy

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.500 align:middle line:90%
center in the human body.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.800 align:middle line:84%
As you learn, then, how to
use this energy pattern to

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.740 align:middle line:84%
activate the cave of
Brahma in the center

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.450 align:middle line:84%
of your head, which then creates
the golden sphere of activated

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.210 align:middle line:84%
consciousness around
your entire head.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.500 align:middle line:10%
We also saw from modern
Egyptian biogeometry,

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.750 align:middle line:10%
the geometric shapes
which resonate

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.870 align:middle line:10%
with specific levels
of manifestation, which

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.390 align:middle line:10%
are the planes of creation.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.390 align:middle line:84%
The zero dimensional
point, the center point

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.840 align:middle line:84%
is the literal gateway
for the divine plane.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.900 align:middle line:84%
The circle or the
sphere is the container

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.070 align:middle line:90%
of the physical plane.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.650 align:middle line:90%


00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.420 align:middle line:84%
The circle and the
sphere are considered

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.660 align:middle line:84%
to be the perfect forms
in the divine alphabet

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.460 align:middle line:84%
of sacred geometry because
they are perfectly balanced.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Every point on the periphery
of the circle or sphere,

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.660 align:middle line:84%
the boundary of creation
is the exact same distance

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.910 align:middle line:84%
from the divine
plane at the center.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Let's read in the
Book of Nature and see

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.000 align:middle line:84%
how the sphere is a
key to manifesting

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.149 align:middle line:84%
energy and consciousness
from higher worlds

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:19.519 align:middle line:90%
into physical matter.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.730 align:middle line:84%
Ancient diagrams of spiritual
creation of the world

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.030 align:middle line:84%
are filled with images
of circles and spheres

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.160 align:middle line:90%
which hold creation.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.860 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Egypt,
the scarab beetle

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.920 align:middle line:84%
was considered sacred,
linked to protection

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.730 align:middle line:84%
and magical rejuvenation because
it creates spheres out of dung,

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.650 align:middle line:84%
which will then burst
forth with its children.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.710 align:middle line:84%
This is a microcosm
of the divine sphere

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.870 align:middle line:90%
of all of creation.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.940 align:middle line:84%
The scarab was also
linked to the power

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.660 align:middle line:84%
of the sun, the sphere which
rolls across the sky giving

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.820 align:middle line:90%
life to the world.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.190 align:middle line:84%
We see physical reality because
we have the sphere of our eye.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.740 align:middle line:84%
All of our current
technology is based

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.740 align:middle line:84%
on electromagnetic energy,
which is usually thought

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.960 align:middle line:90%
of as two dimensional waves.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.840 align:middle line:84%
But new research is showing that
rather than flat sine waves,

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.380 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic
energy is, in reality,

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.080 align:middle line:90%
three dimensional spheres.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.930 align:middle line:84%
The experiments of
Engineer Larry Spring

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.220 align:middle line:84%
showed that the frequency of
so-called electromagnetic waves

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.100 align:middle line:84%
actually indicates
the physical size

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.420 align:middle line:84%
of an electromagnetic
sphere, which is rotating

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.560 align:middle line:90%
while traveling in space.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.240 align:middle line:84%
This means that the positive and
negative alternation of the two

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.420 align:middle line:84%
dimensional wave is, in fact,
simply a two dimensional

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.050 align:middle line:84%
outline of part of the
boundary of the rotating

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.030 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetic sphere.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, Acoustic Imaging
Expert John Stuart Reid

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.570 align:middle line:84%
of Britain has shown
that sound waves

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:00.570 align:middle line:84%
are, in fact, spheres pulsating
bubbles of acoustic energy.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.430 align:middle line:84%
We'll explore John's
breakthrough work

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:08.190 align:middle line:84%
in cinematic sound imaging in
a later episode of this series.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.970 align:middle line:84%
The European masons who built
the great cathedrals of Europe

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.090 align:middle line:84%
called their work,
The Royal Art.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.310 align:middle line:10%
The Royal Art is
the transformation

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.820 align:middle line:10%
of the physical world
into the new golden age

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.595 align:middle line:10%
through applying the divine
patterns of sacred geometry.

00:06:23.595 --> 00:06:26.500 align:middle line:90%


00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.640 align:middle line:10%
Just as the masons transformed
stones and trees into temples,

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:36.220 align:middle line:10%
into physical chalices for
the divine to pour into,

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.760 align:middle line:10%
the royal art is a high secret
of original Masonic initiation,

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.200 align:middle line:10%
which is the establishing on
Earth of the sacred geometry

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.900 align:middle line:10%
patterns for the next
round of human evolution.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.370 align:middle line:84%
But tragically, it has been
almost forgotten today.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.340 align:middle line:84%
The Masonic image of
the compass and square

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.950 align:middle line:84%
is based on the
practical tools to create

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:01.210 align:middle line:84%
circular and square
forms in sacred design.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.900 align:middle line:84%
The great sacred builders of
the past from Europe, Egypt,

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.510 align:middle line:84%
India, and every other
great world culture

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.540 align:middle line:84%
knew that each time they
created a circle or sphere

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.170 align:middle line:84%
in their designs, they were
recreating the original act

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.990 align:middle line:90%
of creation from the Godhead.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Very few human beings can
draw a perfect circle freehand

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.520 align:middle line:84%
because to do so, requires
that the person be perfectly

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.540 align:middle line:84%
anchored in the divine center
around which the circle

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.980 align:middle line:90%
rotates.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.490 align:middle line:84%
In earlier times when people
saw a master artist draw

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.160 align:middle line:84%
a perfect circle
freehand, they understood

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.160 align:middle line:84%
that this was a sign of the
high spiritual attainment

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.230 align:middle line:90%
of that person.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.260 align:middle line:84%
The drafting compass works
by first establishing

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.110 align:middle line:84%
a stable fixed divine
center and then

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.510 align:middle line:84%
the perfect circular
rotation around that center

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.730 align:middle line:90%
becomes possible for everyone.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Master masons would
sometimes be buried

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.830 align:middle line:84%
with their personal
drafting compass, which

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.670 align:middle line:84%
had been filled with their own
energy and with divine energy

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.690 align:middle line:84%
through a lifetime of
movements around the center.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Ancient adepts in Egypt
and other cultures

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.420 align:middle line:84%
knew the power of the
circle and the sphere

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.470 align:middle line:84%
as primordial sacred geometry
patterns of creation.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Ancient Egyptian adepts
used the spiritual practice

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.560 align:middle line:84%
of encirclement
which was putting

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.350 align:middle line:84%
a person in the energetic
boundaries of a circle,

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.810 align:middle line:84%
either to contain
a dangerous person

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.510 align:middle line:90%
or to protect a person in need.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.690 align:middle line:84%
This later evolved into
the use of encirclement

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.419 align:middle line:84%
in medieval Europe
with the construction

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:36.789 align:middle line:84%
of the protective
circle for the magician

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:39.549 align:middle line:84%
to stand within during
times of exposure

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:43.000 align:middle line:84%
to dangerous
non-physical forces.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.150 align:middle line:84%
In episode 2, we introduced
the sacred geometry secret

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.300 align:middle line:84%
that we can activate
aspects of our energy field

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.410 align:middle line:84%
through applying sacred
geometry movement patterns.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.930 align:middle line:10%
In both ancient
and modern times,

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:59.440 align:middle line:10%
methods of bioenergy
healing teach how to feel

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.040 align:middle line:10%
and how to project life
energy for healing purposes.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.340 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
fundamental practices

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:10.420 align:middle line:84%
is to create within the
hands an energy sphere which

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.910 align:middle line:84%
is programmed for
a specific function

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:17.380 align:middle line:84%
by the vibrational power
of a color given to it.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Gold light vibrations,
for example,

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.540 align:middle line:84%
could be used to repair
tears to the subtle energy

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:27.890 align:middle line:84%
nets of the body or to activate
connections to the divine.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Rose color could be used to
activate love and compassion

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:33.020 align:middle line:90%
within the heart.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Green can be used to
dissolve toxicity, et cetera.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:41.110 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, thought forms
of what a person desires

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:44.590 align:middle line:84%
to manifest are placed
within the sphere of energy

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:48.280 align:middle line:90%
and sent out into the world.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.800 align:middle line:84%
In cases where what
is desire to manifest

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.620 align:middle line:84%
is the healing of a
person, the sphere

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.930 align:middle line:84%
is filled with the color
of vibration, which

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.790 align:middle line:90%
will manifest that healing.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And the energy sphere is
projected-- either in-person

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.700 align:middle line:84%
or at a distance into
the appropriate energy

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.360 align:middle line:90%
center of a person's body.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.190 align:middle line:84%
We can now explore
how the sphere

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.980 align:middle line:84%
can be converted from a
container of energy and thought

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.600 align:middle line:84%
forms into a dynamic energy
recharging and circulation

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.840 align:middle line:84%
form, which is
known as the torus.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the sphere
is a container

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.860 align:middle line:84%
to hold new life
and other content,

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.370 align:middle line:84%
the torus is a pact thought
formed from the mind of God

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:31.330 align:middle line:84%
to preserve the balanced form
of the sphere where, once again,

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.220 align:middle line:84%
the center point
of the divine plane

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:37.690 align:middle line:84%
is equidistant from every point
on the perimeter of the sphere,

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.330 align:middle line:84%
while alchemically
transforming the container

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:45.310 align:middle line:84%
function of the sphere into a
dynamic flow between the center

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:48.430 align:middle line:90%
and the periphery.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:52.060 align:middle line:84%
The torus can maintain the
balanced sphere energetics

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.100 align:middle line:84%
while actively
circulating energy

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:58.090 align:middle line:84%
between the divine center
and the physical periphery.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.520 align:middle line:84%
To transform the
sphere into a torus,

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.840 align:middle line:84%
a vortex opens up at the top
and the bottom of the sphere,

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.650 align:middle line:84%
creating an open channel through
the center of the sphere.

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:12.070 align:middle line:84%
This open channel in the
sphere follows the geometry

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:16.360 align:middle line:84%
of a double vortex, in its
being at its widest extent

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.540 align:middle line:84%
at the outer boundary,
drawing in sharply

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:23.980 align:middle line:84%
to become the most narrow
at the center of the sphere.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.200 align:middle line:84%
This creates a kind
of hourglass form

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.200 align:middle line:84%
in the interior of the
sphere known, technically,

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.850 align:middle line:90%
as a hyperbola.

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:34.630 align:middle line:84%
This hyperbola can be created
by having two vortices meeting

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:38.495 align:middle line:84%
at their tips, similar to two
cone geometric forms meeting

00:11:38.495 --> 00:11:39.295 align:middle line:90%
at their tips.

00:11:39.295 --> 00:11:42.070 align:middle line:90%


00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.200 align:middle line:84%
In the esoteric
Christian tradition,

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.590 align:middle line:84%
this hyperbola form is
the geometric foundation

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:49.360 align:middle line:84%
for the chalice
of the Holy Grail.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.570 align:middle line:90%


00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:55.120 align:middle line:90%
The Grail cup.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.060 align:middle line:84%
The entire human
body is a Grail cup,

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.300 align:middle line:84%
which receives the flow
of divine nectar from both

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:06.190 align:middle line:84%
above the heavenly flow into
the crown center while also

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.290 align:middle line:84%
receiving through the
base of the abdomen

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:11.440 align:middle line:90%
from below the earthly flow.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.380 align:middle line:84%
This grail cup hyperbola
in the human body

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.350 align:middle line:84%
is connected to the
entire sphere of energy

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.050 align:middle line:84%
constantly flowing
around our body,

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:22.510 align:middle line:84%
creating the torus
circulation running

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:25.780 align:middle line:84%
through our entire
central channel.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:29.290 align:middle line:84%
Today, the essential practice
of activating our entire energy

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:33.280 align:middle line:84%
field to become a grail
chalice for divine energies

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.530 align:middle line:90%
has been almost forgotten.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.260 align:middle line:84%
This same grail
cup torus geometry

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:42.250 align:middle line:84%
we have on the vertical axis
of our central column also

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:45.370 align:middle line:84%
manifests within
the horizontal axis

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:50.290 align:middle line:84%
of the major front-back
chakra pairs in the body.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:54.800 align:middle line:84%
There are various forms that the
torus takes in natural systems.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Some are more
perfectly spherical

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.700 align:middle line:84%
and some are flattened
like a bagel or donut.

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Some have wider
internal openings

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:06.610 align:middle line:84%
of the donut and others
come to a very tight center

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:09.250 align:middle line:90%
of the hyperbolic movement.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.490 align:middle line:84%
There is also another very
important but little known

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:15.220 align:middle line:84%
significance to the
torus related to higher

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.230 align:middle line:90%
dimensional realities.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:19.180 align:middle line:84%
We discussed in
our first episode

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.880 align:middle line:84%
how higher dimensional
geometric forms

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:26.200 align:middle line:84%
can appear as shadows on
lower dimensional levels.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.640 align:middle line:84%
As an example, we can see that
a fourth dimensional hypercube

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:35.620 align:middle line:84%
is generated in the movement
from zero to four dimensions.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Seen from one
particular perspective,

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.690 align:middle line:84%
the fourth dimensional
hypercube can

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:44.950 align:middle line:84%
appear with an eight-pointed
star form inside of it

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:48.460 align:middle line:84%
when projected onto a two
dimensional flat plane.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.230 align:middle line:84%
There are also
shadows which we can

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:53.080 align:middle line:84%
see as two dimensional
flat projections of even

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.930 align:middle line:84%
higher dimensional
cubes such as these

00:13:55.930 --> 00:14:00.090 align:middle line:84%
for the fifth root
the eighth dimensions.

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:01.830 align:middle line:84%
There are other
perspective views

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:05.250 align:middle line:84%
on how a fourth dimensional
hypercube can manifest

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.560 align:middle line:84%
within the three
dimensional world, which

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.810 align:middle line:90%
our senses perceive.

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:13.140 align:middle line:84%
One of the most important
alternative perspectives

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:17.440 align:middle line:84%
described in scientific
text is this hypercube form,

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:22.260 align:middle line:84%
which looks like a larger
cube around a smaller cube.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, a 3D sphere
becomes a hypersphere

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:30.540 align:middle line:84%
in the fourth
dimension of space.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.390 align:middle line:84%
When projected onto a
two dimensional surface,

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:36.150 align:middle line:84%
the fourth dimensional
hypersphere

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:40.080 align:middle line:84%
appears as a circle
within a circle.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Projected into three
dimensions, the hypersphere

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.900 align:middle line:90%
appears as a torus.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:49.080 align:middle line:84%
This reveals that the torus is
actually the three dimensional

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.690 align:middle line:84%
shadow of the higher
fourth dimensional

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.510 align:middle line:84%
form of the
hypersphere, which is

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:58.290 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual archetype
of the sphere of creation

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:01.980 align:middle line:90%
from a higher nonphysical realm.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.760 align:middle line:84%
This higher dimensional
hypersphere of the torus

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.090 align:middle line:84%
is also deeply connected to
modern scientific concepts

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:10.770 align:middle line:90%
of hyperspace--

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:12.750 align:middle line:84%
including being able
to move from one

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:16.560 align:middle line:84%
point in space immediately
to a distant point of space

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.280 align:middle line:84%
without crossing the
space in between.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:24.060 align:middle line:84%
This is connected to the concept
of a black hole where gravity

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.530 align:middle line:84%
becomes so strong
that it creates

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:28.770 align:middle line:84%
a distortion of
spacetime itself.

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:31.080 align:middle line:84%
The gravity literally
tears a hole

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.720 align:middle line:84%
in the net which we
described in episode 1,

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.200 align:middle line:84%
the sacred geometry
of spacetime itself.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.480 align:middle line:84%
When the net of
spacetime is torn,

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.170 align:middle line:84%
modern physics indicates that
this can create the hyperbola

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:46.380 align:middle line:84%
form, the interior
form of a torus

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.900 align:middle line:84%
which may link one
space time reference

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.480 align:middle line:90%
point to a distant point.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.690 align:middle line:84%
This hyperspace portal
is also known in physics

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:58.170 align:middle line:90%
as an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Some theorists believe that the
black hole, which takes things

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:03.360 align:middle line:84%
out of physical
existence, may lead

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.930 align:middle line:84%
to a white hole from
which new creation emerges

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:09.210 align:middle line:90%
into physical space time.

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:12.660 align:middle line:84%
This entire process takes
the form of the hyperbola--

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:16.800 align:middle line:90%
the grail cup within the torus.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.890 align:middle line:10%
Just as the torus is
linked to higher dimensions

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:22.800 align:middle line:10%
and to black holes,
when it crystallizes

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.580 align:middle line:10%
into physical matter, it appears
at every scale of creation,

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:30.540 align:middle line:10%
from the Galactic down
to subatomic levels.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.840 align:middle line:84%
At the Galactic level, torus
structures have been seen

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:39.720 align:middle line:84%
or theorized with large cosmic
structures such as galaxy M87

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.450 align:middle line:84%
where the black hole in
the center of the galaxy

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:46.110 align:middle line:90%
is the center of the torus.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:47.970 align:middle line:84%
At the opposite
end of the scale,

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:50.370 align:middle line:84%
torus geometric
forms have been found

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:53.010 align:middle line:90%
throughout subatomic structures.

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Atomic force microscopy
reveals subatomic structures

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.290 align:middle line:90%
which have toroidal shapes.

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:02.790 align:middle line:84%
For example, iron particles
can create a microscopic series

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:05.849 align:middle line:84%
of torus on a copper
surface which appears

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:08.220 align:middle line:90%
as a spherical lattice pattern.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.619 align:middle line:84%
Superstring theory
in modern physics

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:13.470 align:middle line:84%
describes the smallest
aspects of matter

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:18.000 align:middle line:84%
as being different vibrational
modes of one dimensional lines

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.650 align:middle line:90%
or strings.

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Superstring theory
requires there

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:25.740 align:middle line:84%
to be at least 10 dimensions
in order for their math

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.119 align:middle line:90%
to work out.

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:29.220 align:middle line:10%
Two of these hidden
dimensions are

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:33.750 align:middle line:10%
theorized as being held in
tremendously small torus forms

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:37.350 align:middle line:10%
within the subatomic matrix.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.240 align:middle line:84%
So we see the
divine pack thought

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.630 align:middle line:84%
form of the torus
manifest physical creation

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:45.570 align:middle line:84%
from the hypersphere
on higher dimensions

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.180 align:middle line:84%
to then crystallize
into physical matter

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:52.590 align:middle line:84%
at all levels of scale from
the Galactic to the subatomic.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Between these extremes of
large and small scales,

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.830 align:middle line:84%
we have the scale of our
lived human experience

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:02.970 align:middle line:84%
where the torus
occurs everywhere.

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:06.000 align:middle line:84%
We find the torus as the
protective energy structure

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.490 align:middle line:90%
around the entire Earth itself--

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:12.660 align:middle line:84%
in the magnetic field
and Van Allen belts.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:16.470 align:middle line:84%
In the magnetic field
around a bar magnet,

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.540 align:middle line:84%
in the form of the
fruits which we

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:23.640 align:middle line:84%
eat to sustain our lives such as
the toroidal form of an apple,

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:28.020 align:middle line:84%
in the energy field around
the entire human body,

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:31.450 align:middle line:84%
in the energy field created
around the human heart,

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:34.680 align:middle line:84%
which creates nested
torus forms, one inside

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.380 align:middle line:84%
of another, in the
electromagnetic field

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.520 align:middle line:90%
of the human body.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Every time our heart beats,
it creates these tourist

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.450 align:middle line:90%
structures.

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Living energy
systems are dynamic,

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.730 align:middle line:84%
constantly increasing
or decreasing

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.710 align:middle line:90%
their internal energy level.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:54.800 align:middle line:10%
The torus allows the perfect
spherical circulation

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.530 align:middle line:10%
to grow to a larger
spherical field

00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:00.290 align:middle line:10%
when the energy level
increases and then

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:04.400 align:middle line:10%
to morph to a smaller, perfect
spherical field when the energy

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.250 align:middle line:10%
level decreases all
the time keeping

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:10.190 align:middle line:10%
the perfect balance
between the divine center

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:12.830 align:middle line:10%
and the earthly boundary.

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Some groups take advantage
of the natural toroidal field

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:20.540 align:middle line:84%
around old growth trees to
place or plant at their roots

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:24.020 align:middle line:84%
specific stones which have
beneficial vibrational

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:27.590 align:middle line:84%
properties needed by
the larger environment.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:31.280 align:middle line:84%
These energetic properties of
the torus in biological life

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.280 align:middle line:84%
also apply to modern
electrical systems

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.810 align:middle line:84%
where the toroidal
shape has been

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:39.830 align:middle line:84%
found to be optimal for
electrical transformers.

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:42.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, toroidal
nuclear fusion reactors

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.900 align:middle line:84%
are currently being
developed, which

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:48.860 align:middle line:84%
could provide unlimited clean
energy for the entire planet

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and replace fossil fuels
through fusing together

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:55.670 align:middle line:90%
hydrogen atoms from water.

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:59.900 align:middle line:84%
These torus-shaped reactors can
create the same fusion reaction

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.310 align:middle line:90%
which powers the sun.

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:04.090 align:middle line:90%


00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:07.600 align:middle line:84%
Now that we have unpacked many
aspects of the pack thought

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.480 align:middle line:84%
form of the torus
sacred geometry,

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.970 align:middle line:84%
we can apply this
powerful pattern now

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:15.610 align:middle line:90%
to our own energy field.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:18.700 align:middle line:84%
We can apply sacred
geometry forms to activate

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:24.250 align:middle line:84%
or modify our internal sacred
geometry energy structures.

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Only when these sacred
geometry patterns are directly

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.980 align:middle line:84%
applied to your own
energy field will

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:34.690 align:middle line:84%
the power and benefit of these
forms become real for you.

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:36.580 align:middle line:84%
We showed earlier
that energy channels

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:39.670 align:middle line:84%
in the human body with
opposite vortex pairs

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:43.720 align:middle line:84%
are, in reality, a torus either
on a vertical or horizontal

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.490 align:middle line:90%
orientation.

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:47.860 align:middle line:84%
The vertical energy flow
between the perineum

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:50.140 align:middle line:84%
at the base of the
abdomen and the crown

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:54.220 align:middle line:84%
center at the top of the head
is the most important torus

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.810 align:middle line:90%
in the human body.

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:58.750 align:middle line:84%
It is our heaven and
Earth axis, which

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:00.640 align:middle line:90%
makes us able to stand erect.

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.100 align:middle line:84%
It runs through the midline
central channel of the body.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:07.910 align:middle line:84%
The most important energy
axis of the human body,

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:12.670 align:middle line:84%
which is not the same as the
energy flow up the spine.

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:16.430 align:middle line:84%
This episode has two
practical applications.

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:19.630 align:middle line:84%
The first is the healing
energy sphere practice,

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:23.260 align:middle line:84%
where you will learn to contain
and transmit vital energy

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.930 align:middle line:90%
within a sacred geometry form.

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:30.340 align:middle line:84%
The second is the torus
energy activation practice,

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:35.680 align:middle line:84%
which recharges and vitalizes
the entire human energy field.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.780 align:middle line:84%
If you'd like to do
the practice now,

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:41.080 align:middle line:84%
please see the companion
videos for this episode.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.060 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, please
set an intention

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:47.490 align:middle line:84%
to come back and do the
practice at a later time.

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Please join us for
our next episode when

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.190 align:middle line:84%
we explore the most famous
forms in sacred geometry--

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:55.470 align:middle line:84%
the Platonic solids,
and you'll learn

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:57.930 align:middle line:84%
how to use them for
a powerful expansion

00:21:57.930 --> 00:21:59.790 align:middle line:90%
of your consciousness.

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:00.600 align:middle line:90%
We'll see you then.
