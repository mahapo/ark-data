00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.730 align:middle line:10%
>> We will begin, as usual,
with the energy field awareness

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.880 align:middle line:10%
practice to get a baseline
for your current energy

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.960 align:middle line:10%
and consciousness level so that
at the end of the exercise you

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.110 align:middle line:10%
can then see how these
changed from the practice.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:84%
So please simply close your
eyes for a moment and tune

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.630 align:middle line:84%
into the feeling of energy
in and around your body.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.665 align:middle line:84%
What does the energy inside
you feel like right now?

00:00:47.665 --> 00:00:50.170 align:middle line:90%


00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Also, observe your
mind and emotions

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.740 align:middle line:84%
to see what state they
are in to begin with.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.260 align:middle line:84%
What is in your thoughts
and in your feeling life?

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Now we can begin
the practice, which

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.610 align:middle line:90%
needs to be done standing.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Stand up with your feet
shoulder width apart,

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.700 align:middle line:84%
your arms out straight to your
sides, and your head held high.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Become aware of the pentagram
created between your head,

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.460 align:middle line:90%
your hands, and your feet.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.000 align:middle line:84%
This pentagram holds
the golden proportion.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Begin by placing your awareness
in the center of your chest

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.060 align:middle line:84%
at the location of
the heart chakra.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Use the zero-point
centering technique

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.370 align:middle line:84%
to move all of your
energy and awareness

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:43.180 align:middle line:84%
into the center of the center of
the center of the heart chakra.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.490 align:middle line:84%
As you move your
attention dynamically

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.790 align:middle line:84%
into the epicenter
of the heart chakra,

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.150 align:middle line:84%
take a moment to
experience and savor

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.640 align:middle line:84%
the vibration, the
warmth, power, light,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.620 align:middle line:84%
and unique flavor of this
powerful energy center.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Become aware of the beautiful
rose light of divine

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.780 align:middle line:84%
love, the Mer, which
lives inside your heart.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.970 align:middle line:84%
As you move your
energy and awareness

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.490 align:middle line:84%
deeper into the core
of the heart chakra,

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.490 align:middle line:84%
you touch its
divine plane center.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.010 align:middle line:90%


00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Now allow the energy activated
from the divine center

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.750 align:middle line:84%
of your heart chakra to
radiate straight upwards,

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.450 align:middle line:84%
straight up the middle
pillar of the body,

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.735 align:middle line:84%
to stream into your head
to the crown chakra.

00:02:34.735 --> 00:02:37.330 align:middle line:90%


00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Experience the warmth of
the rose light of the heart,

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.140 align:middle line:84%
warming your
thoughts, transforming

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.090 align:middle line:90%
your consciousness.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Feel the rose light
relaxing and releasing

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.770 align:middle line:90%
any tension in your head.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.160 align:middle line:84%
Feel the rose light illuminating
and clearing any blocked areas

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.010 align:middle line:84%
in your head or in
your consciousness,

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.300 align:middle line:84%
bringing divine
light to dark places.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Feel the divine love, the
Mer, healing your thoughts

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.500 align:middle line:90%
and your consciousness.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Feel the warmth of the
rose light of the heart

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.860 align:middle line:84%
activate the
opening of the crown

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.610 align:middle line:84%
to the divine energy streaming
down into it from above.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.220 align:middle line:84%
This is the flow of heavenly Chi
in the Chinese Taoist tradition

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.860 align:middle line:84%
and the streaming in of the
Holy Spirit in Christianity.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Continue streaming rose light
from your heart to your head,

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.050 align:middle line:84%
and now release streams of
rose light from the heart,

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.100 align:middle line:84%
down your arms,
to your two hands.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.460 align:middle line:84%
Guide this energy by putting
your mind and attention

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.090 align:middle line:84%
along the pathways
down the arms.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.010 align:middle line:84%
The rose light
energy of your heart

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.790 align:middle line:84%
will follow your mind
power to go to the hands.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Feel the warmth of the
rose light fill your hands,

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.330 align:middle line:84%
feeling the rose
light of love flow

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.770 align:middle line:84%
into the powerful energy
centers of your palms

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.980 align:middle line:84%
and then into the fingers to
the end of the fingertips.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Feel the rose light
warmth activate and heal

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.080 align:middle line:84%
the acupuncture meridians,
the currents of life energy

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.770 align:middle line:84%
which feed the organs of
your body, which are attached

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.360 align:middle line:84%
to your fingertips, including
your large and small intestine,

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.600 align:middle line:84%
your lungs, and
your physical heart.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Feel how your heart
activates your hands

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.080 align:middle line:84%
as receptors of
light and energy,

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.870 align:middle line:84%
experiencing what was
expressed in ancient Egypt

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:53.110 align:middle line:84%
in the receptive form of the
hands in the ka hieroglyph.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Continue streaming the
rose light from your heart

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.190 align:middle line:84%
into your head and
into your hands.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Now release streams of
rose light down your body,

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.040 align:middle line:84%
down your legs,
into your two feet.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Feel the warmth of the rose
light from your heart stream

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.990 align:middle line:84%
into your toes,
energizing and healing

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.380 align:middle line:84%
the acupuncture meridians
which feed energy

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:25.410 align:middle line:84%
into your kidneys, your
spleen, urinary bladder, gall

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.580 align:middle line:90%
bladder, and your liver.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Now close your eyes, if
they are not closed already,

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.520 align:middle line:84%
and feel inside of you the
complete five-pointed seba,

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.020 align:middle line:84%
the star of ancient Egypt,
streaming love, the Mer,

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.920 align:middle line:84%
from your heart into the five
outer points of your body

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:51.130 align:middle line:84%
and into your entire
etheric body, the ka.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Keeping your eyes closed,
you can drop your arms

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.550 align:middle line:90%
to the other side and relax.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Use the energy field awareness
practice once again to tune

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.950 align:middle line:84%
into your energy field and ask
yourself the silent question,

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.670 align:middle line:84%
how has this practice
structured my body of energy?

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.240 align:middle line:84%
How does my energy feel
different after doing

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.870 align:middle line:84%
this practice than it
did when I began it?

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.020 align:middle line:84%
What is in my mind
and emotions compared

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.150 align:middle line:90%
to when I began the practice?

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.370 align:middle line:84%
After you feel the
changes this practice has

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.410 align:middle line:84%
made to your
energetic structure,

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.560 align:middle line:90%
you can open your eyes.
