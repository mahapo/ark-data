00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Welcome back.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.650 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Dr.
Robert J. Gilbert.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.900 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we will
explore the patterns

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.110 align:middle line:10%
behind some of our deepest
longings, our greatest

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.860 align:middle line:10%
pleasures, and our most
profound suffering.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.260 align:middle line:84%
The sacred geometry
of relationships

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.020 align:middle line:84%
holds vital keys to
how we create misery

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.140 align:middle line:90%
or joy in our earthly lives.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.090 align:middle line:84%
By learning to
recognize the patterns

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.960 align:middle line:84%
behind our own attempts to find
happiness with other people,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.870 align:middle line:84%
we can transform any
dysfunctional patterns

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.920 align:middle line:84%
and avoid endless cycles
of unnecessary suffering.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.300 align:middle line:84%
We can find what it
is that we truly want

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.910 align:middle line:90%
and need to have in our life.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.019 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with the largest
sacred geometry patterns

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.720 align:middle line:84%
behind our relationships,
and then we'll

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.200 align:middle line:84%
dive deep into our
very personal patterns.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Our deepest
emotional experiences

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.410 align:middle line:84%
are often microcosms of great
macro cosmic principles.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.430 align:middle line:84%
In our previous episodes, we saw
how each human being descends

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.150 align:middle line:84%
into a lonely isolated
individual existence

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.160 align:middle line:84%
from our original state of
unity in the one, the Godhead,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.110 align:middle line:84%
the unified field state where
we are united with all that is.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.490 align:middle line:84%
We all carry within ourselves
a deep subconscious memory

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.760 align:middle line:84%
of that paradise
state of being united

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.280 align:middle line:90%
in the one with other beings.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.910 align:middle line:84%
We carry the longing to
return to that state of unity

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.670 align:middle line:84%
or merging with another
being rather than

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.490 align:middle line:90%
our lonely separate existence.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.070 align:middle line:84%
In the microcosm of
our earthly life,

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.230 align:middle line:84%
this is mirrored
in our gestating

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.980 align:middle line:84%
inside the body of
the mother, then

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.690 align:middle line:84%
being born into a separate
isolated physical body.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Here, in our
individual existence,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.780 align:middle line:84%
we are given the gift of
free will and free choice

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.120 align:middle line:90%
to develop independence.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.660 align:middle line:84%
But this requires successfully
completing the initiation

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.380 align:middle line:84%
trials of loneliness
and of feeling cut off

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.850 align:middle line:90%
from the rest of life.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Just as there are
angelic ranks known

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.960 align:middle line:84%
to the ancient
traditions, which went

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.660 align:middle line:84%
through their stage
of becoming self-aware

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.840 align:middle line:84%
in previous rounds of
spiritual evolution,

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.410 align:middle line:84%
so humanity is the latest
group of spiritual beings

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.490 align:middle line:84%
to now go through our
self-awareness stage,

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.740 align:middle line:84%
a challenging time of spiritual
adolescence full of desire,

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.260 align:middle line:90%
grasping, yearning.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Our goal for this
round of evolution

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.170 align:middle line:84%
is to become a spirit
of love and freedom

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.190 align:middle line:84%
holding in perfect balance our
independence with our ability

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.000 align:middle line:84%
to love and unite
with others as one.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.610 align:middle line:84%
This is a very high
goal, which requires

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.070 align:middle line:84%
developing exquisite internal
balance, strength, and clarity.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Every one of us will
stumble multiple times

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.550 align:middle line:84%
on our rocky road to
this high destination.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.920 align:middle line:84%
In the original
unity state, where

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.670 align:middle line:84%
we were one with everything,
we exist in the divine plane

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.370 align:middle line:84%
point, the source of
all creation, which

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.040 align:middle line:84%
is in the center of
the circle or sphere

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.100 align:middle line:84%
of the manifested
physical world.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Our physical life
begins with the sphere

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.360 align:middle line:84%
of creation, which appears micro
cosmically as the original egg

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.420 align:middle line:84%
in the mother's womb,
which, when fertilized,

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.420 align:middle line:84%
splits into the
vesica piscis to start

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.980 align:middle line:84%
the process of creating a
new independent multicellular

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.580 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.190 align:middle line:84%
This brings us to
the I Ching process

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.090 align:middle line:84%
of repeated binary splits
to create our multicellular

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.840 align:middle line:84%
organism, as seen in the yin
yang splitting repeatedly,

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.770 align:middle line:84%
to create the hexagons of the
I Ching and our genetic code.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.200 align:middle line:10%
We end up in our own sphere,
now manifesting micro cosmically

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.079 align:middle line:10%
as the amniotic
sac as we prepare

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.510 align:middle line:10%
to leave the womb of
the mother and become

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.120 align:middle line:10%
a separate being in the world.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.350 align:middle line:84%
Our larger cosmic process
of spiritual evolution

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.000 align:middle line:84%
is that we go from
being immersed

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.790 align:middle line:84%
in the one at the
divine plane level

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.390 align:middle line:84%
to descending into cycles
of earthly incarnations

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle line:84%
in order to develop independence
and, in time, to reach

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.400 align:middle line:84%
our goal of becoming a
free agent in the universe.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.120 align:middle line:84%
This larger process is
mirrored in our conditions

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.740 align:middle line:84%
in the black cube of physical
plane incarnation, which

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.610 align:middle line:84%
are a microcosm of the macro
cosmic journey from unity

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.060 align:middle line:90%
to independence.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Our time in the mother's
womb is a microcosm

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.780 align:middle line:84%
of being immersed in the
unity of the divine plane.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.260 align:middle line:84%
We feel merged and
one with our mother

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.610 align:middle line:84%
as we float inside a
sphere in a liquid ocean.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Immediately after
our birth, we still

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.940 align:middle line:84%
feel we are part of our
mother, not a separate being.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.390 align:middle line:84%
Separation from the
mother is the primal wound

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.540 align:middle line:84%
in physical life,
just as our separation

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.140 align:middle line:84%
from one of the Godhead
is the primal wound

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.820 align:middle line:90%
in our spiritual life.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.400 align:middle line:84%
Both experiences
are necessary for us

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.640 align:middle line:84%
to evolve into our full
independent spiritual

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.960 align:middle line:90%
potential.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.280 align:middle line:84%
However, that fact doesn't
negate our very real suffering

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.920 align:middle line:90%
from this separation.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.320 align:middle line:84%
As we complete our
inner separation

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.880 align:middle line:84%
from the mother and our family
during our adolescent years,

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.100 align:middle line:84%
our inner soul life
turns to yearning

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.190 align:middle line:84%
for the lost other,
our missing half,

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.430 align:middle line:84%
the person who will be the
target of all of our longing

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.870 align:middle line:90%
and desire.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.830 align:middle line:84%
We want to merge the sphere of
our physical separate existence

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.310 align:middle line:84%
with the sphere of another,
creating the vesica piscis

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.730 align:middle line:84%
form where our bodies
and energy fields

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.940 align:middle line:90%
partially merge into one.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Note that, in this overlapping
of our sphere with the sphere

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.750 align:middle line:84%
of another, each person
then has half of themselves

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.360 align:middle line:84%
merged in the union
with the other

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.100 align:middle line:84%
inside the vesica portal
and half remaining outside

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.240 align:middle line:84%
and independent with
their own inner life.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.360 align:middle line:84%
This is the pattern in the
divine mind of our being

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.120 align:middle line:90%
a spirit of love and freedom.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Our love is in the
central vesica of union

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:53.180 align:middle line:84%
with another, our freedom in
the outer part of our sphere.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.910 align:middle line:84%
It is also the pattern
of the key principle

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.030 align:middle line:84%
that our life sphere
is divided into being

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.920 align:middle line:84%
half devoted to our own needs
and our inner development.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.590 align:middle line:84%
That's the outer
part of our sphere.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And the other half
of the sphere is

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.570 align:middle line:84%
devoted to loving
service to other people

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.900 align:middle line:84%
where we focus on their
needs within the vesica

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.270 align:middle line:90%
of loving union.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.760 align:middle line:84%
There are many vital
keys to understanding

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.310 align:middle line:84%
the sacred geometry
of relationships

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.900 align:middle line:84%
and our own deep yearning and
striving for the other who

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.780 align:middle line:90%
we feel will complete us.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.010 align:middle line:84%
The first key is that, while
the divine plane is about unity,

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.950 align:middle line:84%
a non-physical plane
where everything literally

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.540 align:middle line:84%
inter penetrates and merges,
all physical existence

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.800 align:middle line:90%
is the exact opposite.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.700 align:middle line:84%
It's all about
duality, separation,

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.620 align:middle line:84%
so that the physical
plane becomes

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:52.730 align:middle line:84%
our sealed alchemical
chamber in space and time

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.000 align:middle line:84%
for us to go through
an alchemical change,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.080 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual development
process in our earthly life.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.590 align:middle line:84%
The split of unity into
duality is the foundation

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:07.280 align:middle line:84%
of the polarities of positive
and negative poles that

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.310 align:middle line:84%
provide energy and
movement, such as

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:14.780 align:middle line:84%
in the magnetic and electrical
systems on the physical plane.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:18.020 align:middle line:84%
In biological systems,
the polarity split

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.550 align:middle line:84%
becomes male and female genders,
which are then drawn together

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:27.230 align:middle line:84%
through tremendously powerful
subconscious energy attractions

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.440 align:middle line:84%
to unite and bring
forth children to bring

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.270 align:middle line:90%
new life into the world.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Even in couples of
the same gender,

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:40.730 align:middle line:84%
powerful complementary polarity
dynamics are still in play.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:43.669 align:middle line:84%
Ancient traditions knew
that this polarity split

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:46.700 align:middle line:84%
and the resulting
attraction between opposites

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.670 align:middle line:84%
to unite and return
to the center

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:56.360 align:middle line:84%
is the origin of all change,
all movement, and life itself.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.470 align:middle line:84%
The macro cosmic primal
polarity yin yang split

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:04.940 align:middle line:84%
is reflected micro cosmically
in the male female split.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.490 align:middle line:84%
In the Indian Vedic
system, this is

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:10.610 align:middle line:84%
seen as Shiva,
ultimate consciousness,

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:14.930 align:middle line:84%
united with Shakti,
ultimate energy.

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.720 align:middle line:84%
The cosmic yin and
yang energies which

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.120 align:middle line:84%
allow our individual
spirit core to manifest

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.870 align:middle line:84%
as a child on the physical
plane manifest micro cosmically

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.650 align:middle line:90%
through our mother and father.

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:30.580 align:middle line:84%
The very beginning of modern
psychology in the 1800s

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:33.850 align:middle line:84%
focused on the psychological
effects of our early childhood

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.170 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:38.950 align:middle line:84%
The psychological foundation for
all relationships in our life

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:43.090 align:middle line:84%
is our primal relationship
to our mother and father.

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:47.290 align:middle line:84%
These primal connections form
our personality, our strengths,

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:51.730 align:middle line:84%
and our weaknesses, our
neuroses, and the hidden drives

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.260 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Examining our
relationship patterns

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.610 align:middle line:84%
with our parents
and family is one

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:01.210 align:middle line:84%
of the first steps for the
psychological self-help inner

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:04.570 align:middle line:84%
work which every person
must do in order for us

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:08.740 align:middle line:84%
not to become trapped in our
own childhood conditioning.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Whatever we felt we needed and
did not receive from our mother

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:15.880 align:middle line:84%
and father and family
becomes key inner conflicts

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.270 align:middle line:84%
and neuroses in our lives
until we illuminate them

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.870 align:middle line:84%
with consciousness and
dissolve these inner conflicts.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:25.840 align:middle line:90%


00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.940 align:middle line:84%
At the most
fundamental level, we

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.910 align:middle line:84%
keep trying to recreate
our core traumas,

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.860 align:middle line:84%
casting the people
we meet in our life

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:36.510 align:middle line:84%
into roles in our
own psychodrama.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:40.230 align:middle line:84%
The biggest roles for us to cast
in our subconscious psychodrama

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.430 align:middle line:90%
are the bad mommy and bad daddy.

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:46.220 align:middle line:84%
Once we have given someone
that role, of course

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.260 align:middle line:84%
without informing
them of this, we

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.730 align:middle line:84%
can then form a
relationship with them

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.840 align:middle line:84%
and then fight with them
to endlessly recreate

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.990 align:middle line:84%
our childhood traumas
with the subconscious hope

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.900 align:middle line:84%
that maybe this time it
will turn out differently

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.450 align:middle line:84%
and we'll now get what
it was we needed before.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:06.860 align:middle line:90%


00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.380 align:middle line:84%
In reality, this
dysfunctional casting

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:12.620 align:middle line:84%
of people into roles
in our own psychodrama

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.650 align:middle line:84%
rarely results in our
getting what we need.

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.840 align:middle line:84%
With neither ourselves
nor the other person

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.620 align:middle line:84%
being clear what's happening,
why we're behaving this way,

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.990 align:middle line:84%
we end up in a power
struggle for who

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:26.380 align:middle line:90%
will dominate the other.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:30.510 align:middle line:84%
We seek to punish our stand-in
for bad mommy or bad daddy

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:32.850 align:middle line:84%
whenever they do not play
the role which we have

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:35.040 align:middle line:90%
subconsciously assigned them.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.820 align:middle line:84%
This punishment can range from
our being passive aggressive,

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.640 align:middle line:84%
meaning that we
are energetically

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.330 align:middle line:84%
hostile while pretending on
the surface to be reasonable,

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.760 align:middle line:84%
to escalating with
aggressive insults

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.240 align:middle line:84%
and humiliation to outright
physical brutality.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Of course, this can never result
in the love which we really

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.140 align:middle line:90%
seek.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.330 align:middle line:84%
It only destroys
whatever love was

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:02.040 align:middle line:84%
present at the beginning
of the relationship.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:05.710 align:middle line:84%
When we survey so many
relationships between people,

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:09.540 align:middle line:84%
we see again and again how
many people drawn together

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.590 align:middle line:84%
in the hope of love actually
end up hurting and, in the end,

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:16.030 align:middle line:90%
even hating each other.

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:19.020 align:middle line:84%
So illuminating our
mommy daddy issues

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:22.960 align:middle line:84%
while dismissed by some today
as a cliche is, in fact,

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.420 align:middle line:84%
the unavoidable foundation of
clearing the path for true love

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.300 align:middle line:90%
and connection in our lives.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.790 align:middle line:84%
This is because our
physical mother and father

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:36.360 align:middle line:84%
are the microcosmic reflections
in our lives of the two

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.540 align:middle line:84%
great polarities, yin
and yang, on which

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.300 align:middle line:84%
our physical
incarnation is based.

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.010 align:middle line:84%
They are the primal
relationships

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:48.000 align:middle line:84%
which form the templates
for our adult life, guiding

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.450 align:middle line:84%
how we try to get our hidden
psychological, emotional,

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.350 align:middle line:90%
and sexual needs met.

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Also, very importantly,
from these early years,

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:00.750 align:middle line:84%
we start to create
our patterns regarding

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:05.010 align:middle line:84%
what we will associate
with pleasure and pain.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:08.490 align:middle line:84%
These associations will move
us towards either success

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:12.930 align:middle line:84%
or failure, happiness
or misery in life.

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:17.190 align:middle line:84%
In modern times, the field of
Neurolinguistic Programming,

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:20.820 align:middle line:84%
or NLP for short,
has created a science

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.420 align:middle line:84%
of how we can change our
own lives for the better

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:29.260 align:middle line:84%
by becoming conscious of our
pain, pleasure associations.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.740 align:middle line:84%
This is extremely
powerful because we

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.920 align:middle line:84%
will seek to do whatever
we associate pleasure with

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:38.670 align:middle line:84%
and we will avoid whatever
we associate pain with.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.910 align:middle line:84%
These associations are
often set in place randomly

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:46.200 align:middle line:84%
and subconsciously in our
youth, rather than our choosing

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.580 align:middle line:84%
them, so that we can consciously
create our optimal future.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Having the wrong
pleasure associations

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.290 align:middle line:84%
can create disaster
for ourselves

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.240 align:middle line:90%
or for how we treat others.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Addicts associate pleasure
with their addiction and pain

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.490 align:middle line:84%
with living without
the addiction,

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:06.000 align:middle line:84%
so they continue
their addiction.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000 align:middle line:84%
A person with a healthier
psychology associates

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.780 align:middle line:84%
pain with addiction and how it
limits and corrupts their life

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.390 align:middle line:84%
and associates pleasure
with a full life

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:18.690 align:middle line:90%
free of addictive compulsions.

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:22.830 align:middle line:84%
We may become overweight when
we associate pleasure with food,

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:27.300 align:middle line:84%
often as a balm for our
emotional traumas or needs,

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:31.020 align:middle line:84%
and associating pain with
exercise or more conscious food

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.970 align:middle line:90%
selection.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.150 align:middle line:84%
We need to be clear that this
core driving force of pain

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:39.900 align:middle line:84%
and pleasure is psychological
and is not the same

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.280 align:middle line:90%
as physical pleasure or pain.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.390 align:middle line:84%
It's all a matter
of our associations.

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:48.780 align:middle line:84%
The power of our pain
and pleasure associations

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.530 align:middle line:84%
to pull us towards a future
of happiness or misery

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:55.800 align:middle line:84%
has led to the increased
availability of information

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.920 align:middle line:84%
on how we can change
these associations to help

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:02.190 align:middle line:90%
to create our optimal future.

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:05.910 align:middle line:84%
A major aspect of core spiritual
development for each of us

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:08.220 align:middle line:84%
is to examine the
patterns we ourselves

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:12.420 align:middle line:84%
have created regarding our
subconscious associations

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:16.950 align:middle line:84%
with what we think of as
pleasurable or painful.

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:19.890 align:middle line:84%
As long as a person finds
a dysfunctional behavior,

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:23.490 align:middle line:84%
like addiction, pleasurable,
they will have great difficulty

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:25.740 align:middle line:90%
in changing that pattern.

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:29.640 align:middle line:84%
By changing the association of
the activity to being painful,

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.800 align:middle line:84%
it actually becomes
easy to change.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.510 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing to
struggle against.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:36.870 align:middle line:10%
That's why, in the
early days of NLP,

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:39.930 align:middle line:10%
the quick results from these
life-changing techniques

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:43.290 align:middle line:10%
were often referred to as magic.

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:45.990 align:middle line:10%
However, do be aware
that methods like these

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:48.700 align:middle line:10%
can be used for good or for ill.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Some NLP practitioners have
chosen to use the methods

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:55.050 align:middle line:84%
not to help make people
aware of their own patterns,

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:58.810 align:middle line:84%
so that they can change them
to something more beneficial,

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:02.040 align:middle line:84%
but instead they use the
methods to manipulate people

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:05.160 align:middle line:84%
subconsciously to do what
the practitioner desires

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.420 align:middle line:90%
them to do.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.000 align:middle line:10%
This has become
very common today

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.940 align:middle line:10%
where NLP techniques are
used to manipulate people

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:15.840 align:middle line:10%
to buy products, to guide public
opinion through the media,

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.570 align:middle line:10%
to support particular
political agendas,

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:24.080 align:middle line:10%
to manipulate a person into a
sexual relationship, et cetera.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.620 align:middle line:84%
This primal driving force of
seeking pleasure and avoiding

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:32.750 align:middle line:84%
pain is complicated in our
earthly lives by trauma.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Just as we seek to recreate the
conditions of our primal wounds

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.690 align:middle line:84%
with our parents by
choosing partners

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:42.920 align:middle line:84%
who are similar to our parents,
whether that be by withholding

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:47.660 align:middle line:84%
affection, being undependable,
alcoholic, depressed,

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.900 align:middle line:84%
judgmental,
narcissistic, abusive,

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.900 align:middle line:84%
or any other
characteristic, so we also

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:58.800 align:middle line:84%
keep subconsciously recreating
all of our key traumas.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.970 align:middle line:84%
This can be seen with small
children who have their dolls

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:04.970 align:middle line:84%
and stuffed animals talk
and interact with each other

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.730 align:middle line:84%
to play out the same traumas
they're trying to cope

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:10.720 align:middle line:90%
with in their own lives.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.210 align:middle line:84%
We've all created
subconscious patterns

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:17.380 align:middle line:84%
of how we respond to
trauma and danger.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has heard of the
fight or flight response.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Do we attack the source of
danger, or do we flee from it?

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.849 align:middle line:84%
However, it's now being
recognized in psychology

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:30.790 align:middle line:84%
that there's more to
it with, at minimum,

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:35.950 align:middle line:84%
two polarity pairs of survival
patterns that we might create.

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:40.090 align:middle line:84%
The first polarity
is fight or appease.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Do we choose the
aggressive polarity

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:44.740 align:middle line:84%
and fight against
the danger, or do we

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:48.550 align:middle line:84%
choose the passive polarity and
try to appease the aggressor so

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.680 align:middle line:90%
that they don't harm us?

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:53.950 align:middle line:84%
In your relationships when your
partner is being difficult,

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:56.860 align:middle line:84%
which option do you tend
to choose most often,

00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:00.340 align:middle line:84%
to fight them or
to appease them?

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Is that the same
option you choose

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.960 align:middle line:84%
when you're in conflict
with the police officer

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.300 align:middle line:84%
or in a conflict
with an employer?

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.970 align:middle line:84%
Do you have anger
that, when you've

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:13.810 align:middle line:84%
had to appease a person who
is in a superior position,

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:16.240 align:middle line:84%
that you then take
your frustration out

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:20.920 align:middle line:84%
with the opposite fight
response on someone weaker?

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.680 align:middle line:90%
This is very common.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.470 align:middle line:84%
If we don't fight or
appease, we might instead

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:31.030 align:middle line:84%
be in the second polarity
of freeze or flight.

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Do we freeze up in the
face of danger and trauma

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.220 align:middle line:90%
or do we literally run from it?

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.670 align:middle line:84%
This can be a literal
freezing immobile or running

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:42.040 align:middle line:90%
away as fast as we can.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Or it can be adapted to
common social situations.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.070 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
freezing can be being

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:50.620 align:middle line:84%
shocked into silence
and immobility

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:54.340 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of a difficult
relationship situation.

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Or flight can be our having
the pattern of physically

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:02.470 align:middle line:84%
leaving any difficult situation
immediately rather than talking

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:04.870 align:middle line:90%
it through and dealing with it.

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Note that there is no
one set superior option

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:09.970 align:middle line:90%
in these polarities.

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Different situations call for
different optimal responses.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.480 align:middle line:84%
In some extreme
situations, fighting

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.530 align:middle line:84%
will get you killed and
appeasing will assure survival,

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:23.870 align:middle line:84%
whereas, in other situations,
fighting will save your life

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and appeasing will
get you killed.

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:29.980 align:middle line:84%
So the issue is which patterns
we have subconsciously adopted

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.740 align:middle line:84%
and whether we have developed
through inner freedom

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.740 align:middle line:84%
to choose whatever response
is optimal in a particular

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:39.520 align:middle line:84%
situation rather than
staying stuck in one

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.910 align:middle line:90%
rigid subconscious pattern.

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:45.040 align:middle line:84%
Rather than these
extreme polarities,

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.710 align:middle line:84%
more balanced responses
are possible when

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.800 align:middle line:84%
we are fully present
and empowered, when

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.550 align:middle line:84%
we are able to think clearly
and rationally in the situation

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:57.400 align:middle line:84%
rather than being
overwhelmed and defaulting

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.220 align:middle line:90%
to our subconscious programming.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.760 align:middle line:84%
These patterns of how we respond
to others through our childhood

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:08.320 align:middle line:84%
conditioning and our traumas
are not simply abstract patterns

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.790 align:middle line:90%
in our consciousness.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:14.290 align:middle line:84%
They absolutely manifest as
distorted sacred geometry

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:17.860 align:middle line:84%
patterns in our
own energy field.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.710 align:middle line:84%
Barbara Brennan popularized
models of the human energy

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:23.110 align:middle line:84%
field structures, which
healers will often

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:26.335 align:middle line:84%
encounter in her books
such as "Hands Of Light."

00:20:26.335 --> 00:20:30.190 align:middle line:90%


00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:34.360 align:middle line:84%
Inner psychological states,
such as masochistic, schizoid,

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:38.320 align:middle line:84%
hysteric, et cetera, manifest
from the mental and emotional

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:43.630 align:middle line:84%
subtle bodies into the vitality
body with these distortions.

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Our energy field can mirror
our emotional and mental trauma

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:51.040 align:middle line:84%
states with creating
sharp projections outward

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:55.060 align:middle line:84%
to fend other people off
the way a porcupine does.

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:58.390 align:middle line:10%
Or we can have a collapse of
energy around parts of the body

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:02.050 align:middle line:10%
or have the physical body
become off-center and imbalanced

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:06.880 align:middle line:10%
in the energy field or
many other variations.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.400 align:middle line:10%
Our psychological
states can also then

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:13.270 align:middle line:10%
manifest from our vitality
body, our energy field,

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:17.840 align:middle line:10%
into visible distortions
in the physical body.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.800 align:middle line:84%
One very simple, yet profound,
physical manifestation

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:25.600 align:middle line:84%
of our trauma was identified
by psychologist Wilhelm Reich.

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:29.020 align:middle line:84%
Reich did pioneering
research in the early 1900s

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:32.740 align:middle line:84%
regarding how we somatize
trauma and we repress

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:36.190 align:middle line:84%
forbidden feelings,
including sexual energies,

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:39.850 align:middle line:84%
which we are not allowed to
express in a healthy way.

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:43.120 align:middle line:84%
It was Reich who, in fact,
started the entire field

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.060 align:middle line:84%
of modern mind-body
therapies where

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.130 align:middle line:84%
we can work with
the physical body

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:52.840 align:middle line:84%
to address deeper emotional
and mental issues.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Reich's clinical work found
that when a person suppressed

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:59.800 align:middle line:84%
their natural life energy
from trauma or from societal

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:03.940 align:middle line:84%
repression of free expression
this leads to subconsciously

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:07.960 align:middle line:84%
restrict our breath so that
the energy in our body cannot

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.120 align:middle line:90%
pulsate naturally.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:13.240 align:middle line:84%
It also leads us to hold
very tight and rigid

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.690 align:middle line:84%
those areas of the body
where unacceptable emotions

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:19.360 align:middle line:90%
or needs are felt.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.700 align:middle line:84%
Reich called this
chronic life energy

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:25.210 align:middle line:84%
suppressing tension
in the body armoring.

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:27.550 align:middle line:84%
He identified multiple
areas of the body

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:30.940 align:middle line:84%
where people commonly
hold tight, armored,

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:34.720 align:middle line:84%
in order to suppress various
types of memories, feelings,

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.800 align:middle line:90%
or expressions.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.270 align:middle line:84%
For example, thoughts which
we feel we cannot express

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:44.620 align:middle line:84%
or painful events we do not want
to remember or think about lead

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.470 align:middle line:84%
to chronic tension in the
muscles around the forehead

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:49.780 align:middle line:90%
and the eye areas.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Reich noted that
ocular armoring, which

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:56.530 align:middle line:84%
is tension held around the
eyes, is tremendously widespread

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:58.990 align:middle line:84%
today and can be
easily seen in many,

00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:02.650 align:middle line:90%
if not most, modern people.

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:05.710 align:middle line:84%
Holding back things we
need to say and express

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:09.680 align:middle line:84%
leads to armoring around
the jaw and the throat.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Suppressing painful
emotions leads

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:14.870 align:middle line:84%
to armoring around
the chest, the heart,

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.210 align:middle line:90%
and the solar plexus.

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Suppressing life energy in
general and sexual feelings

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:24.380 align:middle line:84%
in particular leads to armoring
around the muscles of the lower

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.230 align:middle line:84%
abdomen and genitals
and retracting

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:30.140 align:middle line:90%
the pelvis backwards.

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.810 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
remarkable things

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:35.110 align:middle line:84%
about armoring in the body
is that it becomes so chronic

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:37.630 align:middle line:84%
that we don't even
know we're doing it.

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Armoring becomes
our background state

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:43.840 align:middle line:84%
that we just think of as normal,
and we might subconsciously

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.740 align:middle line:84%
feel that we will be too
vulnerable or exposed if we

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.660 align:middle line:90%
do not armor.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.360 align:middle line:84%
For example, we
might not associate

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.940 align:middle line:84%
the psychological
and emotional tension

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.550 align:middle line:84%
being held in our
forehead, in our neck

00:23:57.550 --> 00:24:00.880 align:middle line:84%
and shoulders with our
constant headaches,

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.190 align:middle line:90%
brain fog, et cetera.

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Or we might not associate the
tension we hold in the pelvis

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:11.620 align:middle line:84%
to our stomach problems, to our
chronic constipation or colon

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:15.340 align:middle line:84%
issues, to our reproductive
system dysfunctions,

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.400 align:middle line:84%
to unnatural growths
in our internal organs

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:24.250 align:middle line:84%
from the suppression of life
energy pulsation, et cetera.

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Along with the development
of mind-body therapies

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:31.000 align:middle line:84%
to free up our life energy and
neurolinguistic programming

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.270 align:middle line:84%
to identify our
pain/pleasure associations

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:38.700 align:middle line:84%
and to transform them, another
important modern development

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:43.440 align:middle line:84%
was what became known as
transactional analysis.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Transactional analysis
means examining interactions

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:51.490 align:middle line:84%
between people, the patterns
we create in our relationships.

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.100 align:middle line:10%
It looks at how
our sense of self

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.100 align:middle line:10%
is operating, whether
we are held back

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:58.440 align:middle line:10%
at the stage of
acting like a child,

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.390 align:middle line:10%
or do we act like a parent?

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:05.530 align:middle line:10%
Or optimally, do we finally
learn how to become an adult?

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:07.750 align:middle line:10%
Transactional analysis
also developed

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:12.070 align:middle line:10%
the idea of life scripts,
how we internalize rules

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:15.520 align:middle line:10%
from our environment to create
our own narrative about what

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:19.150 align:middle line:10%
our life is about, who
we are, and all the rules

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:21.980 align:middle line:10%
we have made for our lives.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.040 align:middle line:84%
What are your subconscious
rules about what

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.200 align:middle line:90%
you need to be happy?

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Is it large amounts of
money, material possessions,

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:35.620 align:middle line:84%
social status, the love of a
particular specific individual?

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Did you make a rule
that your happiness

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:42.130 align:middle line:84%
depends on particular actions
by other people, people

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:45.880 align:middle line:84%
who you will never be able to
control, people who are flawed

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.820 align:middle line:84%
and struggling in their
own lives, who are highly

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:52.420 align:middle line:84%
unlikely to be dependable in the
actions which you require them

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.715 align:middle line:84%
to take in order
for you to be happy?

00:25:54.715 --> 00:25:57.193 align:middle line:90%


00:25:57.193 --> 00:25:58.610 align:middle line:84%
What are your rules
for what makes

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:01.010 align:middle line:90%
a relationship successful?

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:04.850 align:middle line:84%
Is it that it lasts forever
and is never changing?

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.980 align:middle line:84%
If so, you're setting
yourself up for failure

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:11.490 align:middle line:84%
and suffering because
people evolve and change.

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:14.500 align:middle line:84%
Or did you make a rule that
a relationship was successful

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:18.090 align:middle line:84%
if it created beautiful
moments, if it woke something up

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:20.820 align:middle line:84%
in you and the other
person, if it helped you

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:23.580 align:middle line:84%
both on your path
when it was right

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:27.510 align:middle line:84%
and you separated lovingly
and without anger or hurt

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:30.140 align:middle line:90%
when it had run its course?

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:32.620 align:middle line:84%
Which set of rules do you think
is more likely to bring you

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:35.620 align:middle line:90%
peace and happiness?

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:37.480 align:middle line:90%
Relationships are not static.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Like everything alive,
they are dynamic.

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And they must change and
evolve just as the people

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:45.620 align:middle line:90%
in the relationship do.

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Today, it is common
to see people

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:51.200 align:middle line:84%
in intimate relationships
argue and blame their partner

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.870 align:middle line:84%
for their own
unhappiness, saying things

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:58.820 align:middle line:84%
like, you changed, as if change
is not permitted or healthy,

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:02.960 align:middle line:84%
or saying, you promised me you
would do a particular thing

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.180 align:middle line:84%
forever when the
other person is now

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:07.520 align:middle line:84%
a very different person than
they were when they made

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:11.030 align:middle line:90%
that promise years previously.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:13.460 align:middle line:84%
We have to understand
that no one can honestly

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:17.600 align:middle line:84%
promise how they will feel
in any future situation.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.150 align:middle line:10%
We can be honest about
how we feel right now,

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:22.520 align:middle line:10%
but we're lying
to ourselves if we

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:26.930 align:middle line:10%
think we can commit to a feeling
that our future self will have

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:29.420 align:middle line:10%
or even a perspective
on our relationship

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.010 align:middle line:10%
that our future self will have.

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:34.770 align:middle line:84%
Most of us can think back
to a time in our adolescence

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:38.610 align:middle line:84%
when we were desperately madly
in love with another person.

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:40.770 align:middle line:84%
We wanted a love
relationship with them

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:42.990 align:middle line:90%
that would last forever.

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:47.040 align:middle line:84%
When that relationship ended
or never came to fruition,

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.810 align:middle line:84%
we felt like this was
the worst thing that

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:51.390 align:middle line:84%
has ever happened
to any being ever

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:53.070 align:middle line:90%
in the history of the world.

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:54.840 align:middle line:84%
We felt like all of
our hopes and dreams

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:59.370 align:middle line:84%
were crushed, that our suffering
was beyond measure, perhaps

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:01.230 align:middle line:84%
leading to days,
months, sometimes

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:05.110 align:middle line:84%
even years of depression
and inner collapse.

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:07.380 align:middle line:84%
However, looking back
on it years later,

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:11.130 align:middle line:84%
we often think, thank god I
didn't end up with that person.

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:13.290 align:middle line:84%
What a catastrophe
that would have been.

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:16.360 align:middle line:90%
I dodged a bullet.

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.880 align:middle line:84%
To really understand the
range of relationships

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.860 align:middle line:84%
we can create in
our lives, we have

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:22.570 align:middle line:84%
to understand that
we are dynamically

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:26.860 align:middle line:84%
evolving multidimensional
beings living on multiple planes

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:29.170 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously.

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:32.540 align:middle line:10%
We carry a portion of each of
the seven planes inside of us.

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:35.020 align:middle line:84%
They are the literal
source of our subtle bodies

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.430 align:middle line:90%
and our physical body.

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:40.300 align:middle line:84%
We can create relationships
based on any of these planes,

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:44.980 align:middle line:84%
or a particular relationship
can encompass multiple planes.

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:47.020 align:middle line:10%
Real spiritual
development requires

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:50.620 align:middle line:10%
that we become fully
conscious on each plane

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:52.690 align:middle line:10%
through activating
and illuminating

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:57.700 align:middle line:10%
our corresponding subtle
body level inside ourselves.

00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Forming relationships
with other people

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:03.890 align:middle line:84%
on each level, the physical
level, the vitality level,

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:06.610 align:middle line:84%
which is also the
source of our sexuality,

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:09.850 align:middle line:84%
the emotional, mental,
spiritual, et cetera,

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:13.630 align:middle line:84%
this is what helps us become
conscious of and to activate

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:16.540 align:middle line:90%
each level within ourselves.

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:20.650 align:middle line:84%
Relationships on all of these
levels are essential in order

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:25.790 align:middle line:84%
for us to feel connected and
not have a lonely isolated life.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:29.060 align:middle line:84%
We need contact on the
physical and energy levels

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:33.560 align:middle line:84%
through in-souled, loving
touch, which in our adult lives

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.830 align:middle line:84%
can also become deep
sexual intimacy where

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:41.330 align:middle line:84%
we exchange life energy
through our physical bodies.

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:44.390 align:middle line:84%
We need contact on the
emotional and mental levels

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:46.430 align:middle line:84%
so that we feel we have
people in our lives

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:49.400 align:middle line:84%
who really know us,
who really see us,

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:52.160 align:middle line:90%
who really understand us.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.710 align:middle line:84%
As we develop further,
our relationships

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:57.770 align:middle line:84%
can extend into the causal
realm with an awareness

00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.290 align:middle line:84%
of the karmic connections
we develop with people

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:04.670 align:middle line:84%
over multiple lifetimes
and then go even further

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:08.360 align:middle line:84%
into spiritual
and divine levels.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:12.470 align:middle line:84%
It's deeply unrealistic to
think that one other person can

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:18.020 align:middle line:84%
be our perfect optimal match
on all seven levels unchanging

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:19.250 align:middle line:90%
forever.

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.890 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is a
magical world where

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:23.660 align:middle line:84%
we can encounter
and explore life

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:26.870 align:middle line:84%
with a vast range of
other human beings.

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:30.440 align:middle line:84%
We also have to understand
that we are being deeply unfair

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.830 align:middle line:84%
to any person we get into a
relationship with who we then

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:37.610 align:middle line:84%
saddle with the burden of
requiring them to provide all

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:40.670 align:middle line:84%
of our connection
needs on all levels.

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:42.680 align:middle line:84%
This just sets them
up for failure,

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.860 align:middle line:84%
for disappointing us because
they're living their own life,

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:46.760 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:50.790 align:middle line:84%
They're not here just to play
an assigned role in our script.

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:54.230 align:middle line:84%
We simply have to ask
ourselves, are we a match

00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:56.180 align:middle line:90%
with the other person?

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:59.270 align:middle line:90%
If so, on what levels?

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Is what I need and have
to offer a match for what

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:06.110 align:middle line:84%
this person needs
and has to offer

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:10.980 align:middle line:84%
on a particular level, whether
it be sexual, emotional,

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:13.850 align:middle line:90%
mental, spiritual?

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:16.730 align:middle line:84%
That one change in our
thoughts about relationships,

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:20.720 align:middle line:84%
to see clearly whether or
not we are simply a match,

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:24.380 align:middle line:84%
can make a huge contribution
to our replacing suffering

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:27.030 align:middle line:90%
in our life with happiness.

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:29.750 align:middle line:84%
All the anger and
resentment and blaming

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:31.940 align:middle line:84%
we carry from
intimate relationships

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:34.610 align:middle line:84%
can be released and
replaced with simply seeing

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:37.640 align:middle line:84%
if it's a match or
not with no need

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:40.850 align:middle line:84%
to assign blame or make
one person the villain

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:43.800 align:middle line:90%
and the other person a victim.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:48.700 align:middle line:84%
As the old saying goes, the
only constant in life is change.

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.480 align:middle line:84%
So what was once a match
with another person

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.390 align:middle line:90%
at a particular level may end.

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:56.220 align:middle line:84%
It's also possible
the relationship can

00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:01.800 align:middle line:84%
transform so that the two people
now match on a different level.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Many of our monogamous
relationships

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:08.490 align:middle line:84%
are initially based on sexual
attraction and connection.

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:11.160 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, for
most people, this

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:15.580 align:middle line:84%
is the level that falls
away the most quickly.

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.830 align:middle line:84%
When we connect at
the divine level,

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:21.970 align:middle line:84%
we experience the true
nature of the term namaste,

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:27.540 align:middle line:84%
the divine in me sees and
recognizes the divine in you.

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:30.690 align:middle line:84%
At that stage, we can
truly merge into one.

00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:34.350 align:middle line:84%
A healthy relationship is based
on truly seeing and loving

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:37.830 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual individuality
of our partner,

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:41.190 align:middle line:84%
supporting them in their
dynamic evolution and growth

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:44.730 align:middle line:84%
even if that path takes
them away from us.

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:46.980 align:middle line:84%
The sacred geometry
of relationships

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:50.100 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most profound
topics for our personal growth

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:51.930 align:middle line:84%
and happiness,
which we've barely

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:54.090 align:middle line:90%
scraped the surface of here.

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:56.520 align:middle line:10%
For deeper applications
of the sacred geometry

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:59.040 align:middle line:10%
of relationships
in our own lives,

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:05.770 align:middle line:10%
please see my online
resources at www.vesica.org.

00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:08.440 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to leave you
with one final note.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.780 align:middle line:84%
Rather than the gloom
and doom we're constantly

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:12.850 align:middle line:84%
faced with in our
world today, we

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:16.270 align:middle line:84%
can instead choose to create a
bright future with new energy

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:20.170 align:middle line:84%
sciences like cymatics,
vibrational radiesthesia,

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:22.510 align:middle line:90%
and biogeometry.

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:24.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Dr.
Robert J. Gilbert.

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:27.880 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
joining me for this series.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.460 align:middle line:10%
It's been my great privilege
to explore with you

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:33.150 align:middle line:10%
the secrets of Sacred Geometry.

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:40.000 align:middle line:90%
