00:00:21.385 --> 00:00:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT J.GILBERT:
Welcome back.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.220 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host Dr.
Robert J. Gilbert,

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.490 align:middle line:10%
the founder of the Vesica
Institute for Holistic Studies.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.480 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.760 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we
will explore some

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.500 align:middle line:84%
of the most important secrets
behind our human life on Earth.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.160 align:middle line:84%
This will lead us into hidden
aspects of the human vehicle

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.730 align:middle line:84%
of soul travel, the
Merkaba, which have not

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.270 align:middle line:90%
been made public previously.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.770 align:middle line:84%
This will lead at the end of
the episode to your experiencing

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.050 align:middle line:84%
the activation of a little known
Merkaba sacred geometry pattern

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.050 align:middle line:90%
in your own energy field.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.330 align:middle line:84%
The first thing
we must recognize

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.170 align:middle line:84%
when we explore the secrets
behind our physical incarnation

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.000 align:middle line:84%
is that we all struggle to find
deeper meaning in our lives.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Every day we have
to find a reason

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.820 align:middle line:84%
to get out of bed and deal
with all kinds of challenges.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes this
means experiencing

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.230 align:middle line:84%
overwhelming amounts of physical
or emotional pain, stress,

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.320 align:middle line:90%
and disappointment.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.380 align:middle line:84%
These painful and challenging
situations of our earthly life,

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.580 align:middle line:84%
which we all go
through, are one aspect

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.640 align:middle line:84%
of what classical
spiritual traditions refer

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.270 align:middle line:90%
to as initiation trials.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.800 align:middle line:84%
The reality is this, that until
we decide to wake up and fully

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.730 align:middle line:84%
engage with core issues of
our spiritual development,

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.910 align:middle line:84%
our initiation trials
and life lessons

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.970 align:middle line:84%
will be through the
school of hard knocks.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.600 align:middle line:10%
This means really becoming
conscious of our subconscious

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.830 align:middle line:10%
patterns--

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.910 align:middle line:10%
what kinds of
thoughts and emotions

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.260 align:middle line:10%
we are constantly
creating, what actions

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:10%
we are taking or
avoiding taking,

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.110 align:middle line:10%
which create the
conditions of our lives,

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.040 align:middle line:10%
this blundering repeatedly
through the same painful life

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.940 align:middle line:10%
experiences and reacting
destructively to them.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.060 align:middle line:84%
Without seeking the deeper
meaning and patterns behind

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.700 align:middle line:84%
these experiences
is what Buddhists

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.840 align:middle line:90%
refer to as unskillful action.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Just like grades in school,
whatever trials we fail,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.340 align:middle line:84%
we have to repeat until
we finally pass them.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.850 align:middle line:10%
When we are stuck in lower
states of consciousness,

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.420 align:middle line:10%
we may suffer needlessly
through the same trials,

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.810 align:middle line:10%
the same painful situations
and life lessons,

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.210 align:middle line:10%
which we constantly
recreate, not

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.920 align:middle line:10%
just in our current lifetime but
actually in multiple lifetimes.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.760 align:middle line:84%
This can become for us
a kind of hell on Earth

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.430 align:middle line:84%
or, as the Tibetans
would say, a hell

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.040 align:middle line:84%
realm as we constantly cycle
through the same trial lifetime

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.690 align:middle line:84%
after lifetime until
we find the way out.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.420 align:middle line:84%
This way out of
the hell realm we

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.990 align:middle line:84%
have created for ourselves
means consciously understanding

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.560 align:middle line:84%
the situation and
choosing to transform

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.780 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness
and our actions

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.230 align:middle line:84%
to create a different
future for ourselves.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.690 align:middle line:84%
When we spiritually
awaken and learn

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.080 align:middle line:84%
to perceive the key sacred
geometry patterns, which

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.260 align:middle line:84%
guide and control our
earthly existence,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.620 align:middle line:84%
we can then much more
quickly resolve painful life

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.100 align:middle line:84%
situations, successfully
completing the trial

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.660 align:middle line:84%
and moving forward into
actualizing our full potential.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.740 align:middle line:84%
This is what Buddhists
refer to as skillful action.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.270 align:middle line:84%
Human life is itself a
grand initiation trial

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.810 align:middle line:84%
created for the education
and spiritual evolution

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.635 align:middle line:84%
of a young group of spiritual
beings, the human race.

00:04:06.635 --> 00:04:09.230 align:middle line:90%


00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.780 align:middle line:84%
Every one of us on the
path of spiritual awakening

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.800 align:middle line:84%
has at some point the
overwhelming realization

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.390 align:middle line:84%
that we have only a very limited
time in our earthly incarnation

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.060 align:middle line:84%
and that we suffer from
having no clear answers

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.370 align:middle line:84%
to the core existential
questions of our earthly life.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.630 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.470 align:middle line:90%
How did I get here?

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.210 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Do I have a greater purpose
to this lifetime, something

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.350 align:middle line:90%
I am meant to accomplish?

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Or are we all just
what modern materialism

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.770 align:middle line:84%
says we are, simply a
biochemical machine,

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.920 align:middle line:84%
an accidental and meaningless
mixture of chemicals

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.760 align:middle line:84%
with only the illusion of being
conscious, with no existence

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.140 align:middle line:84%
before birth or after
death, no spirit, no greater

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.840 align:middle line:90%
purpose or potential at all?

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Materialism has robbed so many
of us of hope, of purpose,

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.000 align:middle line:84%
of the keys to the great
spiritual knowledge, which

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.460 align:middle line:84%
was gathered together
by the suffering

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.370 align:middle line:84%
and striving of all
of our ancestors.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.480 align:middle line:84%
This is what sacred
geometry can offer us,

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.600 align:middle line:84%
the restoration of the
essential knowledge of what

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.450 align:middle line:84%
it is to be a human
being, to know

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.600 align:middle line:84%
our true nature,
our real potential,

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.140 align:middle line:84%
our unlimited dynamic
possibilities, to become

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.600 align:middle line:84%
so much more than
we are right now.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.610 align:middle line:84%
This leads us to
a great initiation

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.240 align:middle line:84%
saying from the Rosicrucian
tradition of Europe.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.890 align:middle line:90%
In the beginning was the memory.

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.230 align:middle line:84%
To understand the
meaning of the saying,

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.000 align:middle line:84%
we need to see
the patterns which

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.720 align:middle line:84%
were known to the ancients
as the draft of forgetfulness

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.180 align:middle line:90%
and the draft of remembrance.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.410 align:middle line:84%
The draft of forgetfulness
means that every time our spirit

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.320 align:middle line:84%
incarnates into a
new physical body,

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.780 align:middle line:84%
we have a new form
which does not

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.450 align:middle line:84%
hold inside of
its brain and body

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.140 align:middle line:84%
the memories of our
previous incarnations.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.420 align:middle line:10%
These memories are
encoded instead

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.820 align:middle line:10%
within the sacred
geometry structures

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.420 align:middle line:10%
of our subtle bodies, our bodies
of energy and consciousness,

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.070 align:middle line:10%
which stay with us through
multiple incarnations.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.080 align:middle line:84%
These memories are not
in the physical body,

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.170 align:middle line:84%
which falls away
and disintegrates

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:32.830 align:middle line:84%
after every lifetime, ashes
to ashes, dust to dust.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.170 align:middle line:84%
On the path of
spiritual awakening,

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.330 align:middle line:84%
we can perform two
essential types

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.450 align:middle line:84%
of exercises which
allow us to overcome

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.000 align:middle line:84%
the draft of
forgetfulness and to take

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.700 align:middle line:84%
what was known as the
draft of remembrance

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:51.640 align:middle line:84%
to begin to clearly remember
who we are and why we are here.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.980 align:middle line:84%
These first exercises
are designed

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.950 align:middle line:84%
to awaken the
sleeping superpower

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:01.540 align:middle line:84%
in every human being,
which is our mind power.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.910 align:middle line:84%
First, we have to quiet
what is referred to

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:08.500 align:middle line:84%
in the East as the monkey mind
chatter, the constant hyper

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.150 align:middle line:84%
activity of our mind stuck in
loops, which only exhaust us

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and bring no peace or
meaning to our lives.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Overcoming the
monkey mind chatter

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:24.340 align:middle line:84%
is done through clear
mind exercises, where

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.820 align:middle line:84%
we learn to focus on the
still and silent gap, which

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.090 align:middle line:84%
lies between the thoughts
of the internal chatter,

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.550 align:middle line:84%
so that our thoughts
become conscious,

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:39.760 align:middle line:84%
focused, calm instead of
running wild and out of control.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:45.100 align:middle line:84%
The clear mind practices then
lead to mindfulness practices,

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.120 align:middle line:84%
where we use our clear mind
power to be fully present

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.790 align:middle line:84%
and really observe
the true nature

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.670 align:middle line:84%
of our own thinking,
our feelings,

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.710 align:middle line:90%
and our actions in the world.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.810 align:middle line:90%


00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:04.580 align:middle line:84%
We then see and experience the
reality of everything around us

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.470 align:middle line:84%
rather than
distorting everything

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:10.340 align:middle line:84%
through our own filters
and projections.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.070 align:middle line:84%
Once we have harnessed
our divine mind

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.630 align:middle line:84%
power through the clear mind
and then mindfulness practices,

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:21.230 align:middle line:84%
we can then enter into the
deeper spiritual initiation

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:22.640 align:middle line:90%
practices.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.370 align:middle line:84%
These deeper
initiation practices

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:29.570 align:middle line:84%
were known to the ancients to
awaken our subtle bodies, which

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.630 align:middle line:84%
hold the memories of
our previous lifetimes

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:36.559 align:middle line:84%
and the knowledge of our
core spiritual essence.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:40.010 align:middle line:84%
Just as we need the sense
organs of our physical body

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.710 align:middle line:84%
to perceive the
physical world around us

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:45.440 align:middle line:84%
through sight,
hearing, smell, et

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.610 align:middle line:84%
cetera, so we need to
use our mindfulness

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:53.630 align:middle line:84%
apply to our own subtle
bodies to create new organs

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:57.320 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual perception.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.790 align:middle line:84%
In time, this allows us to start
perceiving the invisible worlds

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.160 align:middle line:84%
of energy and
consciousness, which

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.250 align:middle line:84%
creates the physical
world and which connect us

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:10.040 align:middle line:90%
to higher realms of existence.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.950 align:middle line:84%
With this in mind, we can
now enter into the deeper

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.200 align:middle line:84%
sacred geometry
patterns which will

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.350 align:middle line:84%
help reveal the
secrets of who we are

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:22.970 align:middle line:84%
and how we came to be here
in our current earthly life.

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:26.510 align:middle line:84%
The individual spirit beings,
including human beings,

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.820 align:middle line:84%
created as sparks
from the divine fire

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:33.410 align:middle line:84%
ocean of the primordial
unity of the one

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:37.700 align:middle line:84%
are known as holy monads
in some traditions.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.250 align:middle line:10%
These holy monads are
created in groups,

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:44.960 align:middle line:10%
which then go through stages of
awakening to become self aware

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.890 align:middle line:10%
and then to attain higher
cosmic consciousness.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:51.140 align:middle line:84%
In the Western
tradition, these groups

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.820 align:middle line:84%
of monads which attained higher
awareness and powers in cycles

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:59.480 align:middle line:84%
of development long before
the human race was created

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.660 align:middle line:90%
are known as the angelic ranks.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.590 align:middle line:10%
The angels are one step above
us in the evolutionary spiral,

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:11.420 align:middle line:10%
having gone through their self
awareness stage one cycle ago.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.060 align:middle line:10%
The archangels are
two steps above us,

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.480 align:middle line:10%
having attained self
awareness two cycles ago.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.680 align:middle line:84%
The archai are three
steps above us, et cetera.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.410 align:middle line:84%
The European Rosicrucians
have esoteric names

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:27.530 align:middle line:84%
for each of these
angelic ranks, indicating

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:32.400 align:middle line:84%
their esoteric powers and their
functions in the universe.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.410 align:middle line:84%
For example, the oldest and most
developed of the angelic ranks

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:40.100 align:middle line:84%
of which we are aware
are the Seraphim, which

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.770 align:middle line:90%
are the spirits of pure love.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.950 align:middle line:84%
The next most advanced
rank are the Cherubim,

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.050 align:middle line:90%
spirits of harmony.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Then come the Thrones,
spirits of willpower,

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:57.950 align:middle line:84%
then the Kyriotetes, who are
spirits of wisdom, et cetera.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:00.140 align:middle line:84%
The human race is
the latest cycle

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.890 align:middle line:84%
of beings to become self-aware,
which happened recently

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.830 align:middle line:84%
enough that we are still
in a difficult stage

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:10.140 align:middle line:90%
of cosmic adolescence.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.470 align:middle line:84%
The esoteric name for human
beings in the Rosicrucian

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:19.940 align:middle line:84%
tradition is that we are
spirits of love and freedom.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.060 align:middle line:84%
For human beings,
our spiritual power

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:28.010 align:middle line:84%
is based on creating the perfect
balance between love, which

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:33.060 align:middle line:84%
unifies us with other beings,
allowing us to merge with them,

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:37.070 align:middle line:84%
and on the other hand freedom,
which gives us the ability

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:41.450 align:middle line:84%
to be independent and make
our own choices in crafting

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.580 align:middle line:90%
our lives.

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.730 align:middle line:84%
It is this dynamic balancing
of love and freedom

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:51.940 align:middle line:84%
which gives us our greatest
challenges in this lifetime.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:56.950 align:middle line:84%
From our original divine essence
as a microcosmic emanation

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:01.840 align:middle line:84%
of the one, the Godhead,
we then individualize

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:06.370 align:middle line:84%
into a unique spiritual
being in the universe.

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:10.870 align:middle line:84%
Our individual experiences
form our unique self,

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.390 align:middle line:90%
our personality.

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.760 align:middle line:10%
Just as all snowflakes
are crystallized water,

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:20.650 align:middle line:10%
so every human being
is crystallized spirit.

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.380 align:middle line:10%
Just as every snowflake
has a completely unique

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.260 align:middle line:10%
geometric form, so
every human being

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:30.700 align:middle line:10%
has a unique geometric form
of their subtle bodies,

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:35.200 align:middle line:10%
making every person an
irreplaceable unique work

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.050 align:middle line:10%
of art in the cosmos.

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:40.780 align:middle line:84%
It is said in the European
Rosicrucian tradition

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:44.320 align:middle line:84%
that just as our earthly
religions are based on higher

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.810 align:middle line:84%
spiritual beings,
so the religion

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:51.130 align:middle line:84%
of higher spiritual beings
is, in fact, the human race.

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.240 align:middle line:84%
We are their hope
for the future.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.930 align:middle line:84%
We are their children who
are suffering and struggling

00:12:55.930 --> 00:13:01.240 align:middle line:84%
through our cosmic adolescence
to become unique cosmic beings.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Our goal is to complete the
alchemical crystallization

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.330 align:middle line:84%
of our individual
spirit and then

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.570 align:middle line:84%
to become an independent,
creative, free agent

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:16.240 align:middle line:84%
in the cosmos, a future that
is a perfect balance of loving

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.260 align:middle line:84%
service and radical
freedom; a future of almost

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:24.820 align:middle line:84%
unimaginable adventures,
explorations, challenges,

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.650 align:middle line:84%
and pleasures in cosmic worlds
which we barely glimpsed today.

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:32.320 align:middle line:84%
We need to remember this
great spiritual future

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.750 align:middle line:84%
is what we are
working towards when

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:38.380 align:middle line:84%
we get bogged down in
the suffering and density

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:42.120 align:middle line:90%
of everyday physical life.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.870 align:middle line:84%
Beings who are relatively young
in the cosmic ranks of beings,

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.060 align:middle line:84%
such as the human
race, may require

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.090 align:middle line:84%
living in very dense,
physicalized conditions

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:54.030 align:middle line:84%
in order to become
fully self-aware.

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.500 align:middle line:10%
And so the patterns of
energy and consciousness,

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.610 align:middle line:10%
which make up the higher
worlds, the higher plains,

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.250 align:middle line:10%
crystallize into
solid physical matter

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:07.440 align:middle line:10%
to create a kind of nursery for
young beings like ourselves.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.990 align:middle line:84%
We introduced the sacred
geometry structures,

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:13.830 align:middle line:84%
which stand behind this physical
crystallization process, back

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:19.290 align:middle line:84%
in episode one as the net
matrix of all creation, which

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:24.000 align:middle line:84%
was taught in ancient Egypt,
India, and other cultures.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.330 align:middle line:84%
This hidden sacred geometry
net behind the crystallization

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.300 align:middle line:84%
of the physical world
from higher energies

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.130 align:middle line:84%
was known to ancient
traditions to be

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:36.930 align:middle line:84%
linked to the platonic solids,
the forms of the five elements.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.860 align:middle line:84%
The platonic duals of earth
and air, the cube of earth,

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:44.160 align:middle line:84%
and the octahedron of
air are key patterns

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.130 align:middle line:84%
for the crystallization
of the physical world.

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:50.430 align:middle line:84%
The physical world is
based on three dimensions

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:54.480 align:middle line:84%
of space, each one of
them an axis at 90 degrees

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.830 align:middle line:90%
to the other two axes.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:00.960 align:middle line:84%
This is the sacred geometry
form of the cubicle cross.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.290 align:middle line:84%
The cube is known in the
esoteric tradition as the key

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:07.170 align:middle line:84%
to the secret of creating
the physical world.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:10.920 align:middle line:84%
The cube is the hidden form
behind the three-dimensional

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.780 align:middle line:90%
physical plane.

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.630 align:middle line:84%
The cube is a sealed
alchemical retort

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:19.860 align:middle line:84%
into which young spiritual
beings, ourselves, are placed

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:23.730 align:middle line:84%
so that we can undergo the
needed evolutionary processes

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:26.640 align:middle line:90%
to become fully self-aware.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:30.120 align:middle line:84%
This alchemical chamber
needed to form young spirits

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.700 align:middle line:84%
into their higher
potential is referred

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:38.130 align:middle line:84%
to in Western esotericism
as the cube of space.

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Because of this, we find
the cube embedded deeply

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:44.290 align:middle line:84%
into moldable
spiritual traditions.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:47.670 align:middle line:84%
The cube, usually
a black cube, is

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:50.250 align:middle line:84%
used throughout
classical esotericism

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:54.990 align:middle line:84%
to represent the Earth as the
sealed alchemical chamber.

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:58.710 align:middle line:10%
In Judaism, the holy of holies
in the Temple of Solomon

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:middle line:10%
is described in
the Old Testament

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.500 align:middle line:10%
as having the form
of a perfect cube.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.440 align:middle line:84%
In the Jewish tradition,
the black cube

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:11.100 align:middle line:84%
is ritually strapped
onto men 13 years of age

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:15.240 align:middle line:84%
and older through spiral
windings of straps.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Jewish women are not
required to do this practice.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.370 align:middle line:84%
But many have chosen
to do this ritual

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:23.520 align:middle line:84%
in both ancient
and modern times.

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.040 align:middle line:84%
In Judaism, this
black cube takes

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.440 align:middle line:84%
the form of small
black leather boxes

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:32.640 align:middle line:84%
called tefillin, which
contain verses from the Torah.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.320 align:middle line:84%
There is one which goes
on to the upper arm

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:39.960 align:middle line:84%
so that the strap is spiral
wound around the arm, hand,

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.280 align:middle line:90%
and fingers.

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.740 align:middle line:84%
There is also the
head tefillin, which

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.290 align:middle line:90%
is placed on the forehead.

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:50.040 align:middle line:84%
In Islam, the black
cube of the Kaaba

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.550 align:middle line:84%
is in the center of
the holy city of Mecca.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:57.420 align:middle line:84%
Every Muslim is expected to
make the pilgrimage to the Kaaba

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.600 align:middle line:84%
and ritually walk
seven circles around it

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.820 align:middle line:90%
at least once in their lifetime.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:07.119 align:middle line:84%
In Christianity, the
alchemically perfected form

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:10.160 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth is
the new Jerusalem,

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.579 align:middle line:84%
which is described in
the Book of Revelation

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:17.220 align:middle line:84%
as being in the form
of a perfect cube.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:20.640 align:middle line:84%
In geometry, each of
the platonic solids

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:25.050 align:middle line:84%
can be deconstructed into a
two-dimensional form called

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:26.430 align:middle line:90%
a net.

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:30.660 align:middle line:84%
When the cube is deconstructed
into its two-dimensional net,

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.880 align:middle line:90%
it unfolds to become the cross.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.660 align:middle line:10%
The black cube, thus, creates
the sealed alchemical chamber

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.880 align:middle line:10%
of our three-dimensional
world, which

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.310 align:middle line:10%
opens up to become
the black cross

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:46.490 align:middle line:10%
of our dense physical body.

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:50.210 align:middle line:84%
The European Rosicrucians
hold deep esoteric initiation

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:54.410 align:middle line:84%
knowledge within Christianity
using as their symbol

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:59.630 align:middle line:84%
the image of the black
cross with seven red roses.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:02.660 align:middle line:84%
This geometric symbol
shows that the black cross

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.600 align:middle line:84%
of our painful incarnation
into a physical body,

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.440 align:middle line:84%
with all of its initiation
trials and challenges,

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.310 align:middle line:84%
is the foundation for the
flowering and perfection

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:15.710 align:middle line:84%
of the seven chakra
subtle energy

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:19.540 align:middle line:90%
centers in the human body.

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.100 align:middle line:84%
These are the red roses
coming from the black cross

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:28.650 align:middle line:84%
through this initiation process
of our physical incarnation.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.810 align:middle line:84%
This is part of the
ongoing structuring

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:35.010 align:middle line:84%
of our subtle bodies into
a perfected geometric form

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.740 align:middle line:84%
until our consciousness
and our energy

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.020 align:middle line:84%
are activated to
the point that we

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.080 align:middle line:84%
can remain fully conscious
in the spiritual world

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:47.730 align:middle line:84%
after we set aside the
physical body at death.

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:51.630 align:middle line:84%
This is the true Resurrection
of esoteric Christianity,

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:54.480 align:middle line:84%
with the corruptible
physical body giving way

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.650 align:middle line:84%
to the perfected light body for
every human being who completes

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:01.860 align:middle line:90%
the initiation process.

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.560 align:middle line:84%
The same mystery is taught
in Eastern traditions,

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.860 align:middle line:84%
with the development of the
light body and the rainbow

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:08.880 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.500 align:middle line:84%
The esoteric
tradition knows that

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.050 align:middle line:84%
just as every
incarnated human being

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:15.690 align:middle line:84%
has a physical body
on the physical plane

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:19.110 align:middle line:84%
in addition to subtle bodies
which are connected to higher

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:23.610 align:middle line:84%
planes, so also the
planets and stars also

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:26.760 align:middle line:84%
have their physical
crystallization in addition

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:31.410 align:middle line:84%
to their subtle bodies
on higher plane levels.

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:33.750 align:middle line:84%
When we are between
death and rebirth,

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.880 align:middle line:84%
living in only
our subtle bodies,

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.910 align:middle line:84%
and moving towards
our next incarnation

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:43.180 align:middle line:84%
in the physical body, we move
through spiritual spheres,

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:48.270 align:middle line:84%
which are the stars and planets
at their higher plane levels.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.370 align:middle line:84%
These were known to
ancient traditions

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:53.220 align:middle line:84%
as the planetary
spheres, by which

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.770 align:middle line:84%
they meant the subtle energy
layers around the planet

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:58.990 align:middle line:84%
and not the physical
planet itself.

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:01.410 align:middle line:84%
This profound reality
has been forgotten today

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:03.930 align:middle line:84%
in our materialistic
society, which

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.960 align:middle line:84%
says the ancients were simply
ignorant when they presented

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.260 align:middle line:84%
models of the world in which
the Earth was at the center,

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.740 align:middle line:84%
with the planets moving around
it, what is called today

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:17.020 align:middle line:90%
the Ptolemaic worldview.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Modern science looks only
at the physical aspect,

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:22.750 align:middle line:84%
where the Sun is in the center,
with the planets revolving

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:24.370 align:middle line:90%
around it.

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Modern scientists
don't understand

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.320 align:middle line:84%
that the old Earth centered
view was originally

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:33.040 align:middle line:84%
based on the actual
spiritual experience

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.920 align:middle line:84%
that every human
spirit has when we move

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.830 align:middle line:84%
through the subtle
energy planetary spheres

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:42.040 align:middle line:84%
before we incarnate
on the Earth.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.770 align:middle line:84%
It is based on our own
spiritual experiences

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:49.820 align:middle line:84%
moving into the Earth sphere
from the cosmos, where

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:53.030 align:middle line:84%
the Earth is the center
of our destination,

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:56.330 align:middle line:84%
not on the physical plane
mechanics of planets

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:58.920 align:middle line:90%
moving around the Sun.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:02.190 align:middle line:84%
As every human being descends
in their subtle bodies

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:05.520 align:middle line:84%
from the higher stars down
into the subtle energy

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.880 align:middle line:84%
net of our own
solar system, we go

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.120 align:middle line:84%
through an incredible journey,
which the Jewish Kabbalistic

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.570 align:middle line:84%
tradition called the
Hekhalot, meaning the seven

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:17.670 align:middle line:90%
heavenly halls.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:20.280 align:middle line:84%
The seven heavenly
halls are our journey

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:24.120 align:middle line:84%
through the subtle energy levels
of the seven classical planets

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:28.680 align:middle line:84%
of our solar system, from Saturn
on the outer edge to the Moon

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.510 align:middle line:90%
directly adjacent to the Earth.

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:35.020 align:middle line:84%
As we move towards incarnating
into a physical body

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.260 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth, these
seven heavenly halls

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:40.270 align:middle line:84%
were illustrated
in ancient Egypt

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:42.880 align:middle line:84%
in the book of coming
forth into light,

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:46.870 align:middle line:84%
which we call today the
"Egyptian Book of the Dead."

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:48.910 align:middle line:84%
In the Jewish
Kabbalistic tradition,

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:52.510 align:middle line:84%
the Hekhalot school of
the second century AD

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:56.170 align:middle line:84%
described this passage through
the seven heavenly halls

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:59.920 align:middle line:84%
and practiced methods of
conscious astral travel

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.750 align:middle line:84%
through the halls
through the use

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:06.400 align:middle line:84%
of our activated subtle bodies,
which they termed the Merkaba

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.290 align:middle line:90%
or Merkava.

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:11.770 align:middle line:84%
The Merkaba is sometimes
translated into English

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:16.360 align:middle line:84%
as a chariot, as in the
biblical chariots of fire.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.900 align:middle line:84%
This term was interpreted by
materialistic religious artists

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:23.830 align:middle line:84%
as literal wheels within
wheels, when, in fact, what

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:28.510 align:middle line:84%
was being described as a wheel
is a spinning vortex, which

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:31.150 align:middle line:84%
is the sacred geometry form
which creates movements

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:35.860 align:middle line:84%
from one location or one
plane level to another.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:40.000 align:middle line:84%
This description of a higher
level energy vortex as a wheel

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.790 align:middle line:84%
is similar to the
Indian tradition, where

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:46.540 align:middle line:84%
the term chakra for the spinning
vortex of our major energy

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:52.580 align:middle line:84%
centers is literally the
word for wheel in Sanskrit.

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:55.300 align:middle line:84%
The wheel within a
wheel is in reality

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:59.060 align:middle line:90%
a vortex within a vortex.

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.970 align:middle line:84%
This vortex of movement
through higher worlds

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:05.090 align:middle line:84%
is also connected to what
people in near-death experiences

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:08.090 align:middle line:84%
describe as the tunnel
they pass through as they

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:10.370 align:middle line:90%
leave their physical body.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:12.380 align:middle line:84%
The tunnel is the
experience of actually

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:18.670 align:middle line:84%
being inside the vortex
moving through higher worlds.

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:22.840 align:middle line:84%
A key sacred geometry form which
contains the incarnating human

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.350 align:middle line:84%
being is the egg shape
of the aura, which

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:30.490 align:middle line:84%
contains our multiple nested
subtle bodies within it.

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:35.020 align:middle line:84%
Egg shapes generate vortices
and are also the natural form

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.720 align:middle line:90%
to travel through vortices.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:41.050 align:middle line:84%
This means that the egg-shaped
energy field of the human being

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:44.590 align:middle line:84%
is a sacred geometry form
which effortlessly fits

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:49.600 align:middle line:84%
into and moves naturally through
the vortices of higher worlds

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.300 align:middle line:90%
into physical incarnation.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.760 align:middle line:84%
There are also deeper
secrets of the Merkaba

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:59.740 align:middle line:84%
vehicle of soul travel hidden
within the name itself.

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:03.280 align:middle line:84%
The term Merkaba
or Merkava is said

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.400 align:middle line:84%
to come from the root
rachev in Hebrew,

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.550 align:middle line:84%
meaning to ride,
as in a chariot.

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:11.830 align:middle line:84%
However, there is
a deeper secret

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:18.190 align:middle line:84%
here in the name Mer-Ka-ba
based on the original primordial

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:20.830 align:middle line:84%
language, where
every sound carries

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:24.430 align:middle line:84%
a tremendous hidden
divine power.

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:27.250 align:middle line:84%
This knowledge of the
hidden powers of each sound

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:30.310 align:middle line:84%
was called the Hekhau
in ancient Egypt

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and was called the mystery of
the Kabbalistic word in Israel.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Mer is the ancient
Egyptian word for love,

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:44.180 align:middle line:84%
which brings separate
beings back into unity.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:46.310 align:middle line:84%
The ancient
hieroglyph for the mer

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:49.250 align:middle line:90%
is the form of a simple plow.

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:51.380 align:middle line:84%
The plow is what
opens up the body

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:55.610 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, the physical
body, so that seeds of new life

00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:58.400 align:middle line:90%
can grow within that body.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Mer, the divine
vibrational power of love,

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:03.590 align:middle line:84%
is essential for
our subtle bodies

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:08.280 align:middle line:84%
to grow and ripen to
their full potential.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Ka is the ancient Egyptian
word for the subtle body

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:15.760 align:middle line:84%
of vital energy, what
the Indians call prana,

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.800 align:middle line:84%
the Chinese called chi, and
the Greeks called ether.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.140 align:middle line:10%
The ka hieroglyph
in ancient Egypt

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.770 align:middle line:10%
was hands raised in a
posture to receive or send

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:29.850 align:middle line:10%
an energy transmission.

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Ba is the ancient Egyptian
word for the first subtle body

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:37.080 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, which
today we would call the soul

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:42.180 align:middle line:84%
or, in Western esotericism,
we would call the astral body.

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:46.350 align:middle line:84%
The ba was shown by the head of
a person on the body of a bird,

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:49.170 align:middle line:84%
showing the soul and
mind having the ability

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:51.420 align:middle line:90%
to fly through the cosmos.

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Today we refer to
this as astral travel.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:59.660 align:middle line:84%
The term Merkaba
literally tells us

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:02.090 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient
Egyptian language how

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:06.650 align:middle line:84%
to create the activated subtle
body vehicle of soul travel.

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.920 align:middle line:84%
The instruction is
in the name itself.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Merkaba tells us to permeate
our own body of life energy,

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:18.080 align:middle line:84%
the ka, and our own
body of consciousness,

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:23.180 align:middle line:84%
the mind and emotions, the ba,
with the power of pure love,

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.430 align:middle line:90%
mer.

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:28.550 align:middle line:84%
The true power of
divine love alchemically

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:32.330 align:middle line:84%
transforms our subtle bodies
of energy and consciousness,

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:37.550 align:middle line:84%
activating their inner light
and perfecting their structure.

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Our subtle bodies become
light in two ways,

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:44.000 align:middle line:84%
light in the sense of
brilliantly illuminated

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.670 align:middle line:84%
and also light in the
sense of not heavy,

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:50.300 align:middle line:84%
so that they can
literally ascend and fly

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.160 align:middle line:90%
through the higher worlds.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:56.000 align:middle line:84%
The love permeated subtle
bodies are then drawn upwards

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.150 align:middle line:84%
through the higher plains
back toward the divine plane

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:02.780 align:middle line:84%
of unity, an attraction
we experience internally

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:04.970 align:middle line:90%
as true love.

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:07.980 align:middle line:84%
This is not an
abstract philosophy.

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.880 align:middle line:84%
It is a literal
alchemical process

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:15.350 align:middle line:84%
with profound transformations
of the human being to a higher

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:16.580 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:20.270 align:middle line:84%
We can ascend from the black
cube of physical incarnation

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:23.090 align:middle line:84%
but only when we have
learned all the lessons

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:27.140 align:middle line:84%
possible from our physical
plane incarnations.

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:30.500 align:middle line:84%
We must first complete the
alchemy of the subtle bodies

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:34.940 align:middle line:84%
through an unbreakable inner
state of love, the attainment

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.000 align:middle line:90%
of a saint or spiritual master.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.270 align:middle line:10%
If we were to try to
ascend prematurely,

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:43.580 align:middle line:10%
driven by a neurotic
need to escape

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:47.480 align:middle line:10%
the transformative pressure
and suffering of physical plane

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.420 align:middle line:10%
existence through a
false type of ascension,

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:53.370 align:middle line:10%
we would never reach
our full potential.

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:56.510 align:middle line:84%
This would be like opening
up a cocoon of a caterpillar

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:57.560 align:middle line:90%
prematurely.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.560 align:middle line:84%
The gestating butterfly
would be incomplete

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and would never reach its
full beautiful form with wings

00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:06.750 align:middle line:90%
to fly.

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:10.020 align:middle line:84%
This Merkaba sacred
geometry soul vehicle

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:13.230 align:middle line:84%
has been described in some
recent esoteric teachings

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:15.630 align:middle line:90%
as a star tetrahedron.

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:18.270 align:middle line:84%
However, this is only
one geometric aspect

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:20.190 align:middle line:90%
of the Merkaba.

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:22.140 align:middle line:84%
The European rosicrucians
teach that there

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.710 align:middle line:84%
are three key sacred geometry
forms related to three

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:28.230 align:middle line:90%
different levels of creation.

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:31.350 align:middle line:10%
The first level is the
Godhead, manifesting

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:34.200 align:middle line:10%
through the point
in the circle, which

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:37.200 align:middle line:10%
we discussed previously
and experienced directly

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.290 align:middle line:10%
through applying the zero
point centering and radiance

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:43.960 align:middle line:10%
practice in our
own energy centers.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.630 align:middle line:10%
The second level
is the macrocosm,

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:50.890 align:middle line:10%
manifesting through the
hexagram, the six-pointed star

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:54.910 align:middle line:10%
known popularly today
as the Star of David.

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:57.670 align:middle line:10%
The third level
is the microcosm,

00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:00.430 align:middle line:10%
manifesting through
the pentagram.

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:03.730 align:middle line:10%
These grand creative forms are
reflected into the human energy

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:07.210 align:middle line:10%
field as key sacred
geometry structures

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:09.820 align:middle line:10%
of the human Merkaba.

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:13.660 align:middle line:84%
In 1907, the great
rosicrucian initiate

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:17.020 align:middle line:84%
Rudolf Steiner revealed
the secret of the pentagram

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:20.650 align:middle line:84%
form of the human etheric
body of life energy,

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:25.090 align:middle line:84%
the ka of the Egyptian
Merkaba, and the hexagram

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:28.690 align:middle line:84%
form of the human astral
body of consciousness,

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:32.470 align:middle line:90%
the ba of the Egyptian Merkaba.

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Steiner noted at the
time that the pentagram

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.650 align:middle line:84%
of the etheric body
is a flat plane form.

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:41.470 align:middle line:84%
However, the hexagram
six-pointed star form

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:45.930 align:middle line:84%
of the astral body is, in
fact, a three-dimensional form.

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:48.870 align:middle line:84%
This means that the
hexagram of the astral body

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:52.890 align:middle line:84%
is, in fact, a stellated
octahedron, also known

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.900 align:middle line:90%
as a star tetrahedron.

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:58.290 align:middle line:84%
The secret of the
five-pointed pentagram form

00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:01.140 align:middle line:84%
of the human etheric
life energy body

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:04.830 align:middle line:84%
was embedded in the ancient
Egyptian tradition, where

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:08.550 align:middle line:84%
the hieroglyphs called
seba, meaning a star,

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:11.730 align:middle line:84%
showed a raised
central point radiating

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:16.410 align:middle line:84%
five lines in the same direction
as the points of a pentagram.

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:19.170 align:middle line:90%


00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:23.070 align:middle line:84%
In the human body, the
raised center of the seba

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:27.510 align:middle line:84%
is the human heart chakra,
which in spiritual initiation

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:30.960 align:middle line:84%
becomes the organizing
center for all the streams

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.360 align:middle line:90%
in the human etheric life body.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.930 align:middle line:84%
From the heart, energy
streams to the five points

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:39.630 align:middle line:84%
of the pentagram
of the human body--

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:44.540 align:middle line:84%
to the head, the two
hands, and to the two feet.

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Awakening our awareness of
these streams from the heart

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:51.740 align:middle line:84%
is one of the six essential
exercises in the rosicrucian

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:55.460 align:middle line:84%
system of Rudolf Steiner,
designed to activate

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:58.670 align:middle line:90%
and organize our subtle bodies.

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:01.850 align:middle line:10%
As the ancient Egyptian
mysteries gave way in time

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:04.940 align:middle line:10%
to the Christian mysteries,
the pentagram form

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:08.420 align:middle line:10%
of the etheric body
became more commonly shown

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:12.540 align:middle line:10%
than the earlier star form
used in ancient Egypt,

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:15.290 align:middle line:10%
which showed the etheric
body streams from the heart

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:20.300 align:middle line:10%
directly to the five external
points of the human body.

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.600 align:middle line:84%
In reality, both the
ancient Egyptian star

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.050 align:middle line:84%
and the modern pentagram forms
both exist in the human energy

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:28.850 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And each has specific
applications.

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:35.130 align:middle line:10%
The pentagram form
of the etheric body

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:37.590 align:middle line:10%
also holds within it
the key sacred geometry

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:40.680 align:middle line:10%
principle known as the
golden mean proportion,

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.630 align:middle line:10%
or the phi ratio.

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:46.440 align:middle line:10%
This is known classically
as the proportion of beauty.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.780 align:middle line:10%
It is the golden
series of numbers

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.970 align:middle line:10%
which create a
precise proportion

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:54.000 align:middle line:10%
with particular
energetic powers.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Although it has a universe
of manifestations,

00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:59.610 align:middle line:84%
the key to the golden
or divine proportion

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:01.800 align:middle line:84%
is that it manifests
the divine thought

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:05.100 align:middle line:84%
form of perfect
balance and harmony

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.650 align:middle line:90%
through dynamic movement.

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Rather than cutting a line
in half, which creates a more

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.350 align:middle line:84%
static balance, the
divine proportion

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:17.970 align:middle line:84%
cuts the line at the location
where the smaller portion is

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:21.540 align:middle line:84%
in the same proportion
to the larger portion,

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:26.730 align:middle line:84%
as the larger portion is in
proportion to the entire line.

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:29.580 align:middle line:10%
This is an expression
in sacred geometry

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:34.170 align:middle line:10%
of the dynamic relationship
between the macrocosm,

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:37.440 align:middle line:10%
the larger part of the
line, and the microcosm,

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.990 align:middle line:10%
the shorter part of the line.

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:43.230 align:middle line:84%
The golden series begins
with the proportion of 1,

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:48.270 align:middle line:90%
the original unity, to 1.618...

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:51.040 align:middle line:84%
which is a transcendental
number that never ends.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.400 align:middle line:90%
It reaches into infinity.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.160 align:middle line:84%
The numbers in the
golden series continue

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:59.760 align:middle line:84%
so that any two adjacent
numbers in the series

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.850 align:middle line:84%
create the same powerful
proportion, linking

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:06.180 align:middle line:90%
macrocosm and microcosm.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:08.340 align:middle line:10%
The pentagram of
the etheric body

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:12.930 align:middle line:10%
holds the perfect divisions
of the golden proportion.

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:17.100 align:middle line:84%
The golden proportion can also
be expressed in whole numbers

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.890 align:middle line:84%
rather than in fractions
through what is

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:22.560 align:middle line:90%
known as the Fibonacci series.

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:24.990 align:middle line:84%
As the Fibonacci
series progresses,

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:27.750 align:middle line:84%
the proportions between
two adjacent numbers

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:31.110 align:middle line:84%
come closer and closer
to the golden proportion

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:35.520 align:middle line:84%
of 1 to 1.618,
providing a way to use

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:38.280 align:middle line:84%
whole numbers in
energetic design

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.250 align:middle line:90%
the way nature itself does.

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:43.320 align:middle line:84%
The Fibonacci
whole number series

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:47.850 align:middle line:84%
creates the golden spiral, a
dynamic and powerful growth

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:50.610 align:middle line:90%
pattern found in nature.

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:52.860 align:middle line:84%
This Fibonacci series
is a foundation

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:57.250 align:middle line:84%
for harmonious, natural growth
patterns in humans, animals,

00:33:57.250 --> 00:34:00.240 align:middle line:90%
and plants on the Earth.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:03.630 align:middle line:10%
So when we consider the
pentagram of the etheric body

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:07.170 align:middle line:10%
as one part of the
Merkaba soul vehicle,

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:10.380 align:middle line:10%
we can understand that
the pentagram contains,

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:13.590 align:middle line:10%
embedded within it, the
powerful dynamic growth

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:18.370 align:middle line:10%
pattern of the golden
proportion or phi ratio.

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:23.320 align:middle line:84%
This is the sacred geometry of
dynamic life force and growth,

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:27.030 align:middle line:84%
which is the power and purpose
of our etheric life body--

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:30.389 align:middle line:90%
the "ka" of the Merkaba.

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:33.120 align:middle line:84%
The golden proportion
expressed through the pentagram

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:37.360 align:middle line:84%
creates a cascade of
dynamic, energetic effects,

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:40.230 align:middle line:84%
including the creation
of a fractal growth

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:45.550 align:middle line:84%
series of pentagram shapes
reaching into infinity.

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:49.360 align:middle line:10%
We can now conclude this
episode by experiencing

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:54.159 align:middle line:10%
the ancient Egyptian sacred
geometry pattern of the seba--

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:57.820 align:middle line:10%
the star in our own
etheric life body

00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:02.290 align:middle line:10%
as a foundation for
a Merkaba activation.

00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:04.150 align:middle line:84%
If you'd like to do
the practice now,

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:07.450 align:middle line:84%
please see the companion
video for this episode.

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, please
set an intention

00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:13.960 align:middle line:84%
to come back and do the
practice at a later time.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:16.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Dr.
Robert J. Gilbert.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Please join us for our next
episode, where we will explore,

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:22.330 align:middle line:90%
in more detail, the Merkaba.

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And you will also
learn how to complete

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:28.540 align:middle line:84%
the activation of the gold,
the grit of life design,

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:31.090 align:middle line:90%
in your own energy field.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:35.080 align:middle line:84%
This will help us on the path
to take the draft of remembrance

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:39.880 align:middle line:84%
and remember who we are
and why we are here now

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:45.580 align:middle line:84%
in this place and this time
of our current incarnation.

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:47.460 align:middle line:90%
See you then.

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:55.000 align:middle line:90%
