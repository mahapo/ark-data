00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome back.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.970 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Dr.
Robert J Gilbert.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.030 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we will
continue our exploration

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.460 align:middle line:10%
of hidden sacred
geometry patterns

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.850 align:middle line:10%
with a six-pointed star
form of the first level

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.820 align:middle line:10%
of our consciousness, which
in the Western tradition

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.740 align:middle line:10%
is called the astral body.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.030 align:middle line:84%
So while our life body
manifests in space

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.070 align:middle line:84%
as the five-pointed form
of a star or a pentagram,

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.350 align:middle line:84%
the astral body of consciousness
has as one of its forms

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.280 align:middle line:84%
the hexagram in three
dimensions, which

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.790 align:middle line:84%
is known technically as
the stellated octahedron,

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.110 align:middle line:84%
or, more popularly, as
the star tetrahedron.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.569 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at some
of the sacred geometry

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:09.340 align:middle line:84%
secrets behind this form of
our soul body, the astral body

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.120 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.580 align:middle line:84%
This journey into
secrets of the merkaba,

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.130 align:middle line:84%
our activated body
of soul travel,

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.010 align:middle line:84%
will take us into core
sacred geometry blueprints

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.120 align:middle line:90%
from the mind of God.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.710 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.980 align:middle line:84%
In the esoteric tradition,
each of the four elements

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.390 align:middle line:84%
is a manifestation of the
primary subtle body levels.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.880 align:middle line:90%
Earth equals our physical body.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Water equals our
body of life force.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Air equals our soul or
astral body of consciousness.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.630 align:middle line:90%
And fire equals our spirit core.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.880 align:middle line:84%
So from the Hidden
Temple teachings,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.450 align:middle line:84%
the octahedral is the form
which completes and encloses

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.110 align:middle line:84%
the cubital cross by connecting
the ends of the three

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.190 align:middle line:84%
axes of physical space,
whereas the cube encloses

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.500 align:middle line:84%
the cubicle cross
of physical space

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.550 align:middle line:84%
by creating a wall at
the end of each axis.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.639 align:middle line:84%
As we have seen, this makes
the black cube of space,

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.070 align:middle line:84%
the divine thought form
behind the container

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.580 align:middle line:84%
of the physical world for
spirits to incarnate into.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.370 align:middle line:84%
So the octahedron
is the opposite

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.940 align:middle line:84%
polarity to the black cube
container of the physical body.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.180 align:middle line:84%
It is the astral
body of consciousness

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.290 align:middle line:90%
within the physical.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.210 align:middle line:84%
This is the sacred geometry
from the mind of God

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.050 align:middle line:84%
of how our soul life is hidden
within our physical body.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.990 align:middle line:84%
We need to remember that in
the Hidden Temple teachings,

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.750 align:middle line:84%
the term "astral" comes from the
root "aster," meaning "a star."

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.150 align:middle line:84%
A star is a point of
light in the darkness.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.500 align:middle line:84%
So the next part of the
deeper merkaba teaching

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.930 align:middle line:84%
is that many fundamental
sacred geometry

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.960 align:middle line:84%
forms can be turned
into a star form,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.930 align:middle line:90%
a process called stellation.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.580 align:middle line:84%
The basic geometric solid
form is a vessel, a container,

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.660 align:middle line:84%
whereas the star form
radiates outward like a sun

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.150 align:middle line:90%
rather than containing.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.940 align:middle line:84%
You will recall that when we
do the zero point centering

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.940 align:middle line:84%
process, we move all of
our energy and attention

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.990 align:middle line:84%
dynamically into the center
of the center of the center

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.540 align:middle line:84%
of an energetic
location in our body

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.080 align:middle line:84%
in order to connect to the
divine center of that location

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.490 align:middle line:90%
and thereby activate it.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Once we have
activated that center,

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.220 align:middle line:84%
then the radiance
process begins.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.070 align:middle line:84%
The activated center
streams out energy and light

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.830 align:middle line:90%
in all directions like a sun.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.490 align:middle line:84%
This is the master method to
activate any energy center

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.840 align:middle line:90%
in our body.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a key technique for
advanced spiritual practices.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.140 align:middle line:84%
In pure sacred
geometry archetypes

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.130 align:middle line:84%
from the mind of God, a solid
form like a platonic solid

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.090 align:middle line:84%
can turn into a star
through a similar process.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Energy on every face
of the form streams

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.600 align:middle line:84%
into the center of that
face, activating that center

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.720 align:middle line:84%
and raising it vertically
above the face.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Lines of energy then
connect that raised center

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.120 align:middle line:90%
to the base lines of that face.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.990 align:middle line:84%
The octahedron of the air and
astral consciousness stellates

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.959 align:middle line:84%
meets by taking the
divine center of each face

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.050 align:middle line:84%
and moving it straight
upward, then connecting it

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.020 align:middle line:84%
to the triangle
of each face, thus

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.380 align:middle line:90%
making the stellated octahedron.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.110 align:middle line:84%
This also means that the
connection of the raised

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.080 align:middle line:84%
central point to
the triangular base

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.970 align:middle line:84%
makes a tetrahedron on each
face of the octahedron.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.880 align:middle line:84%
These eight
tetrahedrons, one on each

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.730 align:middle line:84%
of the eight faces
of the octahedron,

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.360 align:middle line:84%
then remarkably give the
appearance of the entire form,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.770 align:middle line:84%
now being two
interpenetrating tetrahedra.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.110 align:middle line:84%
This is the reason for
the alternative name

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.400 align:middle line:84%
for the sellated octahedron
being the star tetrahedron,

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.750 align:middle line:84%
a name popularized
by Leonardo da Vinci.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.530 align:middle line:84%
So the activation of the
octahedron into a radiant star

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.250 align:middle line:84%
form creates the stellated
octahedron, which could also

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.710 align:middle line:90%
be seen as a star tetrahedron.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.780 align:middle line:90%
Both perspectives are accurate.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Each one is a different
facet of the jewel

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.160 align:middle line:84%
of this exquisite spiritual
form from the mind of God.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.820 align:middle line:84%
From the second perspective
of adding the tetrahedron

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.070 align:middle line:84%
onto each face and
thereby turning

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.290 align:middle line:84%
the entire form
of the octahedron

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.710 align:middle line:84%
into what appears to be
a double tetrahedron,

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.410 align:middle line:84%
it is important to note
that the tetrahedron is

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.690 align:middle line:90%
the form for fire.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.870 align:middle line:10%
Fire is the element
connected to our spirit core,

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.190 align:middle line:10%
our divine spark from the ocean
of fire of the godhead, which

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.110 align:middle line:10%
gets activated above our heads
during higher initiation.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.650 align:middle line:90%


00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.630 align:middle line:90%
So what does this all mean?

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.190 align:middle line:84%
It means that the merkaba
activation of our subtle bodies

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.520 align:middle line:84%
allows them to become
divine vehicles for us

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.760 align:middle line:84%
to move through higher worlds,
which is one of the greatest

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.950 align:middle line:84%
attainments of
spiritual development

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.120 align:middle line:84%
and a great ancient
secret of initiation.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.610 align:middle line:84%
This activation
of the merkaba is

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.420 align:middle line:84%
based on the activation of our
consciousness, the astral body

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.470 align:middle line:84%
of the octahedron, through
applying the tetrahedron

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.230 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual fire.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.110 align:middle line:84%
This brings us to another
great hidden sacred geometry

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.230 align:middle line:84%
secret of our
activated soul body,

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.380 align:middle line:84%
the star tetrahedron,
that it is formed

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.500 align:middle line:84%
within the incubator
of the black cube

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.140 align:middle line:84%
of physical incarnation,
which unfolds

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.940 align:middle line:84%
into the cross of
our physical body.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.630 align:middle line:84%
This means that it is through
our difficult experiences

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.680 align:middle line:84%
of incarnation in the physical
body in a physical world

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.640 align:middle line:84%
that our activated soul
body of the star tetrahedron

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.670 align:middle line:84%
gestates into its
perfected form,

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:02.140 align:middle line:84%
like a caterpillar in a
cocoon becoming the butterfly.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.380 align:middle line:84%
The star tetrahedron of
our activated soul body

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.880 align:middle line:84%
is thus the fruit of our earthly
physical incarnation, which,

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.220 align:middle line:84%
although often
challenging and painful,

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:17.110 align:middle line:84%
is nonetheless essential for
humanity's spiritual flowering.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.850 align:middle line:84%
When the cube of
space is unfolded

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.130 align:middle line:84%
into the cross of
our physical body,

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.395 align:middle line:84%
the star tetrahedron of
our activated consciousness

00:07:24.395 --> 00:07:25.195 align:middle line:90%
is revealed.

00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:30.470 align:middle line:90%


00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.630 align:middle line:84%
This black cube is
the matrix in which

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.830 align:middle line:84%
our perfected consciousness,
our star tetrahedron soul body,

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.320 align:middle line:84%
gestates in the cocoon
of the physical body

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.250 align:middle line:84%
until we are ready for
full spiritual initiation

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.220 align:middle line:90%
and merkaba activation.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.830 align:middle line:84%
This is the mystery of
the Rosicrucian symbol

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:52.430 align:middle line:84%
of the black cross of the
physical body giving rise

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.870 align:middle line:84%
to the seven red roses
of our activated chakras.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Only through accepting
the density and suffering

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:04.220 align:middle line:84%
of physical incarnation can
we develop the red roses

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:09.860 align:middle line:84%
and develop the star tetrahedron
of our merkaba soul vehicle.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.920 align:middle line:84%
There is also a hidden
complementary mystery

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.290 align:middle line:84%
to the generation of
our activated soul

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:19.950 align:middle line:84%
body within the cube and the
cross of our physical body.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:23.550 align:middle line:84%
This secret is that it is
our activated astral body

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:26.630 align:middle line:84%
which provides a deeper
structural support

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:30.020 align:middle line:90%
for the physical body itself.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.240 align:middle line:84%
The star tetrahedron
is the strength

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.169 align:middle line:84%
of our soul, which keeps our
physical body from collapsing

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:40.390 align:middle line:84%
from all the stresses
of our physical life.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:43.299 align:middle line:84%
This is shown in the work
of Buckminster Fuller.

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:46.570 align:middle line:84%
He demonstrated that a
hollow cube is very unstable

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.320 align:middle line:84%
and collapses unless it
is bracketed internally

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.670 align:middle line:84%
by the tetrahedron and
octahedron triangular forms.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Only these triangular forms have
rigidity and internal strength.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Without this
internal bracketing,

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.090 align:middle line:84%
hollow cube forms
made with soft corners

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.250 align:middle line:90%
will immediately collapse.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Whereas hollow tetrahedra,
with octahedra,

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.130 align:middle line:90%
create unbreakable structures.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.030 align:middle line:84%
This is also the key to
Bucky Fuller's development

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:20.590 align:middle line:84%
of the geodesic dome as the
strongest possible form made

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:24.220 align:middle line:84%
with the minimum of materials
through using the triangular

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.440 align:middle line:90%
truss system.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.500 align:middle line:84%
So we have just seen some
of the hidden secrets

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.500 align:middle line:84%
from the mind of God
related to the activation

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.740 align:middle line:84%
of the human soul within
the merkaba process.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.890 align:middle line:84%
This shows how our
physical existence

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:41.700 align:middle line:84%
is essential to the activation
of the soul body, the star

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.470 align:middle line:90%
tetrahedron.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:46.020 align:middle line:10%
Like so many sacred
geometry mysteries,

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.160 align:middle line:10%
hints of these divine secrets
are given in classical text

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.800 align:middle line:10%
and illustrations.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.960 align:middle line:84%
The star tetrahedron
is usually shown

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.180 align:middle line:84%
in classical
illustrations simply

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.420 align:middle line:84%
as a six-pointed
star, a hexagram,

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.620 align:middle line:84%
as seen here in this
Indian yantra of Ganesh.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Note that this shows the upper
horizontal line of the star

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.950 align:middle line:84%
tetrahedron at the
level of the shoulders

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:14.950 align:middle line:84%
and the lower horizontal line
at the level of the knees.

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:18.690 align:middle line:10%
This is embedded initiation
knowledge regarding

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.730 align:middle line:10%
where the lines of
the star tetrahedron

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:24.400 align:middle line:10%
actually appear
on the human body.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.990 align:middle line:84%
This exact information on where
the upper and lower horizontal

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.240 align:middle line:84%
lines appear on
the body was also

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.710 align:middle line:84%
given in the Western tradition
by Rudolf Steiner in 1907

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.590 align:middle line:84%
when he revealed the secret
of the five-pointed star

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:42.180 align:middle line:84%
and six-pointed star, star
tetrahedron, forms of the human

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.155 align:middle line:90%
and astral bodies.

00:10:43.155 --> 00:10:46.540 align:middle line:90%


00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Traditions all over the
world use these pentagram

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.650 align:middle line:84%
and hexagram patterns in
practices to create health,

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:58.210 align:middle line:84%
to prolong life, and to
protect the energy field, also

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:00.640 align:middle line:84%
to provide wealth and
to connect to higher

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:05.080 align:middle line:90%
beings and spiritual realities.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Our merkaba subtle body
vehicles are only one part

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.290 align:middle line:84%
of the sacred geometry
of our energy fields

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:14.590 align:middle line:84%
which allow us to
incarnate on Earth.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:17.350 align:middle line:84%
For a spirit to incarnate
into a human body,

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.720 align:middle line:84%
there's an intricate
further process

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.080 align:middle line:84%
of creating the physical
and subtle bodies.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.320 align:middle line:84%
In Sanskrit, our bodies
are known as koshas,

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.160 align:middle line:84%
meaning sheaths or
vehicles, for the spirit

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.250 align:middle line:84%
to incarnate on each
plane of existence.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:38.180 align:middle line:84%
For example, the Annamaya Kosha
means literally "the sheath

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.360 align:middle line:90%
made of food."

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.160 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Is our physical body,
which is created out

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:44.510 align:middle line:84%
of the substance of
the physical food

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:47.690 align:middle line:84%
our mother eats while
we're in the womb and then

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:51.740 align:middle line:84%
the physical food that
we eat after our birth.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.660 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
our physical body

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:56.420 align:middle line:84%
is based on forming
physical substance

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:00.440 align:middle line:84%
through the consciousness
and energy grid of the net

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:04.620 align:middle line:84%
into the divine sacred geometry
pattern of the human body

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:08.450 align:middle line:84%
so that our spirit can
act on the physical plane.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:11.600 align:middle line:84%
The next body is
the Pranamaya Kosha,

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.180 align:middle line:90%
the sheath of vital energy.

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Life energy is known to
every classical tradition

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:21.440 align:middle line:84%
and was an essential foundation
of key spiritual and healing

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.910 align:middle line:90%
practices.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:25.290 align:middle line:10%
Life energy was known
by different names,

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:30.410 align:middle line:10%
such as prana in India,
chi in China, qi in Japan,

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:32.390 align:middle line:10%
ether in Greek.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Then there are further
sheaths of the human being

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:38.450 align:middle line:84%
on increasingly
higher plane levels.

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:40.850 align:middle line:84%
There are many different
models of the different planes

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:44.210 align:middle line:84%
and subtle bodies that are
taught in different traditions.

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:47.870 align:middle line:10%
However, they are all united
by a common understanding

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.990 align:middle line:10%
that, just as we are given a
physical body through which

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:54.530 align:middle line:10%
our spirit incarnates to
act on the physical plane,

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:58.010 align:middle line:10%
each of our subtle bodies is
a detachment of the substance

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:02.060 align:middle line:10%
of a particular higher
plane, which we individualize

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:05.930 align:middle line:10%
to become our vehicle so that
we can experience and act

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:07.910 align:middle line:10%
on higher planes.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:11.660 align:middle line:84%
We operate on all the major
planes simultaneously.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.820 align:middle line:84%
We experience this
as simultaneously

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.970 align:middle line:84%
having sensations in
the physical body,

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and in our energetic
state, and in our emotions,

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:24.590 align:middle line:84%
and in our thoughts, and in
our spiritual experiences

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:27.950 align:middle line:90%
all at the same time.

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:30.440 align:middle line:84%
As we pass through the
seven heavenly halls

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.870 align:middle line:84%
towards our new
incarnation on Earth,

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.120 align:middle line:84%
we must connect
our subtle bodies

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.780 align:middle line:84%
to the new growing physical
body in order to use it

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.450 align:middle line:90%
as our new earthly vehicle.

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:45.530 align:middle line:84%
This brings us to another great
secret of sacred geometry--

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.200 align:middle line:84%
the hidden net
coding system which

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.350 align:middle line:84%
connects our subtle bodies
to our physical body.

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:57.140 align:middle line:10%
This secret is found deeply
embedded in the Jewish Kabbalah

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.110 align:middle line:10%
but is understood by
very few people today.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:04.310 align:middle line:10%
In the great ancient text
called "Sefer Yetzirah,"

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:08.660 align:middle line:10%
it described how the 22 letters
of the original Hebrew alphabet

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:13.790 align:middle line:10%
are divided into a
series of 3, 7, and 12.

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:17.180 align:middle line:84%
These are described as three
mother letters of the Hebrew

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:23.090 align:middle line:84%
alphabet, seven double letters,
and 12 elemental letters.

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:28.310 align:middle line:84%
The initiation teaching
behind this 3, 7, 12 division

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:32.750 align:middle line:84%
is that each Hebrew letter
is a divine power, a flame

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:35.660 align:middle line:84%
letter from the ocean
of fire of the godhead

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.570 align:middle line:84%
that is connected to a
particular anchor point

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:42.350 align:middle line:84%
for our spirit in
the physical body.

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Another hidden
aspect which was not

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.030 align:middle line:84%
made public in the
"Sefer Yetzirah" text

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:50.840 align:middle line:84%
is that the complete sequence
of spiritual anchor points

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:55.670 align:middle line:84%
in the body is, in
fact, 1, 3, 7, 12.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.130 align:middle line:84%
We have to remember that
the ancient Jewish tradition

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:03.770 align:middle line:84%
forbade direct representations
of the one, the godhead source,

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.680 align:middle line:84%
as being too holy to
directly represent.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.210 align:middle line:84%
So the one could not be
referenced in Judaism directly,

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.940 align:middle line:84%
just as it was forbidden
to say the name of God

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:18.320 align:middle line:84%
or to show any visual
image of God in Judaism.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.610 align:middle line:84%
The full 1, 3, 7, 12 sequence
needed for our spirit

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.580 align:middle line:84%
to anchor into our
human body was only made

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:28.670 align:middle line:84%
public in the early
1900s through the work,

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:31.910 align:middle line:84%
once again, of the great
European Rosicrucian teacher

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Rudolf Steiner, who revealed
many ancient mysteries that

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.660 align:middle line:84%
had not been previously
released to the public.

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.600 align:middle line:84%
So it was Steiner who
released the knowledge

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.750 align:middle line:84%
that these numbers are related
to the precise locations

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:49.010 align:middle line:84%
in the physical body where our
spirit anchors and operates

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:50.480 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.180 align:middle line:84%
The one is the first
part of the sequence.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:57.230 align:middle line:84%
This is the one anchor point
for our divine immortal spirit

00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:00.620 align:middle line:90%
core in the center of our head.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.540 align:middle line:84%
The next part of
the full sequence

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.480 align:middle line:84%
is the three for the
three anchor points

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.120 align:middle line:84%
of the soul or, in
technical terms,

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.820 align:middle line:84%
the three anchor points
for the astral body,

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.520 align:middle line:90%
our body of consciousness.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.730 align:middle line:84%
These are connected to the three
mother letters of the Hebrew

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:20.630 align:middle line:84%
alphabet, perhaps called mother
letters because the soul is

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:24.170 align:middle line:84%
the mother of our internal
life and our sense

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.210 align:middle line:90%
of individual self.

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:29.240 align:middle line:84%
These three mother letters
are also shown in the Kabbalah

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.100 align:middle line:84%
to be the source of
each of the three

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:35.260 align:middle line:84%
axes of physical space,
the cubicle cross which

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:39.030 align:middle line:84%
is the internal structure
of the black cube.

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:42.120 align:middle line:10%
These are the three axes
which make the octahedron

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:47.890 align:middle line:10%
and then stellate into the star
tetrahedron of our astral body.

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:50.770 align:middle line:84%
The first of these three
anchor points for the soul

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:54.940 align:middle line:84%
overlaps with the one point of
the spirit, the Cave of Brahma

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.960 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the head.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.620 align:middle line:84%
This provides our mental
life in the physical body.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.370 align:middle line:84%
This Cave of Brahma provides
the close connection

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:07.069 align:middle line:84%
between our spirit core
and our consciousness,

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:10.000 align:middle line:84%
which we can experience through
the awakening of our mind

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.829 align:middle line:84%
and thoughts when we
focus at this location.

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:16.890 align:middle line:84%
The second of these
three anchor points

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:20.849 align:middle line:84%
is at the heart energy
center in the upper chest.

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:24.839 align:middle line:84%
This provides our emotional
life in the astral body.

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:29.100 align:middle line:10%
The heart is the center of
the vertically-oriented vesica

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:33.180 align:middle line:10%
in the human body, held
between the spheres of the head

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:37.690 align:middle line:10%
and the sphere of the
lower abdomen center.

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:40.060 align:middle line:10%
The heart can be
activated through the six

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:43.570 align:middle line:10%
essential exercises of
the Rosicrucian tradition

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:45.850 align:middle line:10%
to become the
absolute organizing

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:49.210 align:middle line:10%
center of the entire
human energy body

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:52.090 align:middle line:10%
and which can then create
harmony and balance

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:55.330 align:middle line:10%
in every other energy
center in the human body

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:58.560 align:middle line:10%
through the power of the heart.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.900 align:middle line:84%
The third of these
three anchor points

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.620 align:middle line:84%
is in the lower abdomen
beneath the navel.

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.500 align:middle line:84%
This is the connection
point to the core power

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.370 align:middle line:84%
of the etheric body, just as
the head is the connection

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:14.170 align:middle line:90%
point to one of the spirit.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:16.650 align:middle line:84%
This is the power
center in the human body

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:19.230 align:middle line:84%
where the vital life
force provides the energy

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:23.640 align:middle line:84%
to the heart and the head and
which anchors us into the Earth

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:90%
through the hips and the legs.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.640 align:middle line:84%
All of these are connected
through the central column

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.250 align:middle line:84%
of energy in the
human body, described

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:36.330 align:middle line:84%
as the metal pillar in our
work on the Grid of Life Design

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:40.930 align:middle line:84%
and also known as the Taiji
pole in the Chinese tradition.

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:42.930 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the tradition
which taught these three

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:45.990 align:middle line:84%
anchor points most clearly
and in the most detail

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:49.740 align:middle line:84%
for practical internal alkene
was the Daoist tradition

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:53.400 align:middle line:84%
of China, which called these
three anchor points of the soul

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:57.210 align:middle line:84%
the three dantians,
meaning the three elixir

00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:02.400 align:middle line:84%
fields where we can transform
ourselves to higher levels.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.500 align:middle line:10%
For the three anchor
points of the soul,

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.140 align:middle line:10%
the Chinese Daoist
tradition sees the head

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:11.130 align:middle line:10%
as the upper dantian,
where we perfect the elixir

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:12.900 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.900 align:middle line:10%
It sees the chest as
the middle dantian,

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:20.160 align:middle line:10%
where we perfect the elixir
of our inner life feelings,

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.760 align:middle line:10%
and our lower abdomen
as the lower dantian,

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:29.140 align:middle line:10%
where we perfect the elixir
of our vital life force.

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:32.170 align:middle line:84%
There are specialized knowledge
for each of the three elixir

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:33.610 align:middle line:90%
fields in the body.

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:37.330 align:middle line:84%
For, example dynamic energy
in the body cannot be safely

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:42.340 align:middle line:84%
concentrated and stored in
the upper or middle dantian.

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a tendency
to try subconsciously

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.770 align:middle line:84%
to store our energy in these
areas in the Western world,

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:50.740 align:middle line:84%
especially to store
it in our head

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.390 align:middle line:84%
because we're such
a mental culture.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:56.440 align:middle line:10%
However, these areas cannot
safely hold these high levels

00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:00.370 align:middle line:10%
of charge, and trying to
do so leads to headaches,

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:04.990 align:middle line:10%
mental and emotional tension,
brain fog, nervousness,

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:10.060 align:middle line:10%
irritability, heart and
breathing issues, et cetera.

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:13.700 align:middle line:10%
It's the lower abdomen,
the lower elixir field,

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:17.260 align:middle line:10%
which is the safe repository
of the dynamic vital power

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:18.910 align:middle line:10%
in the body.

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Often it's said that
the lower elixir

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:24.010 align:middle line:84%
field is around 2
inches below the navel

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:26.210 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the body.

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:28.030 align:middle line:84%
However, a more
complete understanding

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:31.000 align:middle line:84%
comes with a particular
Daoist method.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.510 align:middle line:84%
Put your thumbs together at
the navel with your fingers

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:38.710 align:middle line:84%
making a triangle downwards so
that the index fingers touch

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:41.170 align:middle line:84%
around the top of
your pubic bone.

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:45.190 align:middle line:84%
The area inside of this triangle
in the center of your body

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:48.220 align:middle line:90%
is your lower dantian.

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Daoists use spiral and
vortex circulations

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.000 align:middle line:84%
at the lower abdomen to
collect the vital energy

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.990 align:middle line:90%
and to store it in this area.

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:01.200 align:middle line:84%
This repository of
vital force is then,

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.440 align:middle line:84%
in advanced practices,
used to circulate energy

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.810 align:middle line:84%
through the other
circuits of the body

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:09.480 align:middle line:84%
in order to nourish the
entire body and energy

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:13.890 align:middle line:84%
field before collecting it
again at the lower dantian

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:16.440 align:middle line:90%
to end the practice.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Although that's the
approach of the Daoist,

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.030 align:middle line:84%
we should be aware that most
traditions around the world

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:25.560 align:middle line:84%
have their own secrets of how
to use these three centers.

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.100 align:middle line:10%
For the European Rosicrucians,
these three anchor points

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:33.450 align:middle line:10%
for the soul are understood to
be our thinking in the head,

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:39.240 align:middle line:10%
our feeling in the heart, and
our willing in the abdomen.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:44.430 align:middle line:84%
In Buddhism, they appear as
thought, speech, and action.

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:49.650 align:middle line:84%
In Sufism, they appear as
head, heart, and hands,

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:53.460 align:middle line:84%
with the hands expressing the
action from the lower abdomen

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.610 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:57.170 align:middle line:84%
Then there are
the deeper secrets

00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:00.650 align:middle line:84%
of these centers, the
holographic cosmological

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:04.490 align:middle line:84%
relationships known
to spiritual science.

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:06.650 align:middle line:84%
In Western alchemy,
these three centers

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:10.790 align:middle line:84%
are understood to also
be microcosmic emanations

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:15.140 align:middle line:84%
of the moon in the head,
the sun in the chest,

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.990 align:middle line:90%
and the Earth in the abdomen.

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:20.930 align:middle line:10%
This was a hidden teaching
in Western alchemy

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:25.010 align:middle line:10%
which often shows the sun,
moon, and Earth together

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:28.430 align:middle line:10%
in its teaching images.

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Advanced practices
will bring in the power

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:34.220 align:middle line:84%
from these cosmological
sources to energize

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:38.690 align:middle line:84%
and activate these centers
in the human energy body.

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Now that we've surveyed the one
spirit and three soul anchor

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:48.710 align:middle line:84%
points in the body, the next
part of this 1, 3, 7, 12 sacred

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:51.940 align:middle line:90%
geometry sequence is the seven.

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:55.090 align:middle line:84%
This appears as the seven anchor
points of the etheric life

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:56.170 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:59.200 align:middle line:10%
The tradition which taught
these seven the most clearly

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.980 align:middle line:10%
and in the most practical detail
has been the Vedic tradition

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.590 align:middle line:10%
of India where these
seven anchor points

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:07.840 align:middle line:10%
appear as the seven chakras.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Today, most other
systems in the world

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:12.640 align:middle line:84%
refer to the seven
chakras concepts of India

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:16.980 align:middle line:84%
in their understanding of
these seven anchor points.

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.770 align:middle line:84%
These seven points are
connected to the double letters

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:21.360 align:middle line:90%
of the Hebrew alphabet.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.790 align:middle line:84%
In fact, calling
them double letters

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:26.790 align:middle line:84%
could be considered another
encoding of a secret,

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:30.780 align:middle line:84%
that the seven are linked to
our etheric life body, which

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.490 align:middle line:84%
in many traditions
is referred to

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:36.450 align:middle line:84%
as our etheric double
that mirrors and sustains

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:38.670 align:middle line:90%
our physical body.

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Just as there's an overlap
between the one anchor point

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.890 align:middle line:84%
of the spirit in
the Cave of Brahma

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.170 align:middle line:84%
with the first anchor
point of the soul,

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:49.660 align:middle line:84%
the upper dantian,
in the same area,

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.830 align:middle line:84%
so there's also an overlap
between this head center

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:57.690 align:middle line:84%
of the spirit and soul with a
third eye center of the seven

00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:00.160 align:middle line:90%
chakras of the etheric body.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.880 align:middle line:84%
This is one reason why
the Cave of Brahma area

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.770 align:middle line:90%
is so powerful to activate.

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:08.790 align:middle line:84%
It is a key connection point
between the spirit, the soul,

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:12.930 align:middle line:84%
and our vital life force
through the third eye chakra

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:16.170 align:middle line:84%
moving back into
the Cave of Brahma

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:19.200 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the head.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.740 align:middle line:84%
There is also an overlap between
the heart center of the three

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:26.880 align:middle line:84%
soul elixir fields and the
heart center of the seven

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.850 align:middle line:84%
etheric body chakras,
connecting our heart's

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:34.880 align:middle line:84%
emotional and moral powers
with our vital life force.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.530 align:middle line:84%
These seven chakras
are understood

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:40.400 align:middle line:84%
in deeper spiritual science to
be the emanations of the seven

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.740 align:middle line:90%
classical planets.

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Although the exact correlations
between specific planets

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:50.780 align:middle line:84%
and chakras can vary somewhat
in different traditions.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:56.720 align:middle line:84%
The final part of this 1, 3, 7,
12 incarnation coding sequence

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.630 align:middle line:84%
is the 12 anchor points
for the structures

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:01.460 align:middle line:90%
of the physical body.

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:05.510 align:middle line:84%
These are taught most clearly in
classical Western metaphysics,

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:08.750 align:middle line:84%
including the European
Rosicrucian tradition.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:10.880 align:middle line:10%
In deeper spiritual
science, it's

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.700 align:middle line:10%
understood that each of the
12 areas of the physical body

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:18.500 align:middle line:10%
structure are emanations from
a specific sign of the Zodiac--

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.810 align:middle line:10%
in other words, from
a specific group

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:25.550 align:middle line:10%
of stars which encircle
us in the cosmos.

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:28.190 align:middle line:84%
In Eastern systems,
the 12 anchors

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:32.810 align:middle line:84%
manifest as the 12 organ energy
meridians of Chinese medicine.

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:37.910 align:middle line:90%


00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:42.110 align:middle line:84%
This 1, 3, 7, 12
system is a hidden key

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:45.260 align:middle line:84%
to understanding how
higher powers are encoded

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:49.130 align:middle line:84%
into specific anchor points in
our physical and subtle bodies

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:53.090 align:middle line:84%
so that our spirit can incarnate
into vehicles for living

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:54.980 align:middle line:90%
our independent life.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:58.170 align:middle line:84%
To activate the power of
each of these anchor points,

00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:00.470 align:middle line:84%
there are many hidden
practices from traditions

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:04.418 align:middle line:84%
around the world
which can be explored.

00:26:04.418 --> 00:26:05.960 align:middle line:10%
It should, at this
point, perhaps not

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:10.410 align:middle line:10%
surprise us that this sacred
geometry pattern of the 3, 7,

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:13.370 align:middle line:10%
12 described in the
"Sefer Yetzirah"

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:16.670 align:middle line:10%
text of the Jewish
Kabbalah also appears

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:20.810 align:middle line:10%
deeply encoded into the
Kabbalistic tree of life energy

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:22.010 align:middle line:10%
pattern.

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:23.960 align:middle line:10%
We have been
constructing this pattern

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.300 align:middle line:10%
through practices you
learned and experienced

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:29.240 align:middle line:10%
in earlier episodes,
with added insights

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.970 align:middle line:10%
from the Egyptian and
European traditions

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:37.400 align:middle line:10%
as the Grid of Life Design
or, for short, GOLD.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.370 align:middle line:10%
The 10 energy centers of
the Grid of Life Design

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.800 align:middle line:10%
are linked together
through pathways,

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:46.460 align:middle line:10%
or we could also call
them energy channels.

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:49.790 align:middle line:10%
There are exactly three
horizontal pathways

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:53.480 align:middle line:10%
just as there are three anchor
points for the astral body,

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.420 align:middle line:10%
seven vertical
pathways, just as there

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.600 align:middle line:10%
are seven anchor points
for the etheric life body,

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:04.280 align:middle line:10%
and 12 diagonal pathways just
as there are 12 anchor points

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:06.930 align:middle line:10%
for the physical body.

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:09.560 align:middle line:10%
This brings us now to
completing the work we began

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:13.100 align:middle line:10%
in our earlier episodes of
constructing the Grid of Life

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:17.180 align:middle line:10%
Design in our own energy field.

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.130 align:middle line:84%
If you'd like to do
the practice now,

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:23.180 align:middle line:84%
please see the companion
video for this episode.

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, please
set an intention

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:29.970 align:middle line:84%
to come back and do the
practice at a later time.

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Join us for our
next episode when

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.000 align:middle line:84%
we will explore the
hidden energies and powers

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.370 align:middle line:90%
within sacred geometry.

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:39.440 align:middle line:84%
This will open up an
incredible new world

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.590 align:middle line:84%
of practical applications
of sacred geometry

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:47.030 align:middle line:84%
to transform our life, our
health, and our consciousness.

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:48.710 align:middle line:90%
See you then.
