[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:21.420 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.850 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm going to teach you
this practice straight through

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.350 align:middle line:10%
for time purposes.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.930 align:middle line:10%
Then in the future, you
can practice this exercise

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.630 align:middle line:10%
more slowly than we will here.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.170 align:middle line:84%
We'll begin with our energy
field awareness practice,

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.300 align:middle line:84%
which we introduced
in episode one,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.260 align:middle line:84%
as the way to get a baseline
reading on our energy field

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.240 align:middle line:84%
before beginning any
energetic practice,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.290 align:middle line:84%
so that you can then see
more clearly the effects

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.690 align:middle line:90%
of the practice afterwards.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.730 align:middle line:90%
Simply close your eyes.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And tune into the feeling of
energy in and around your body.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.500 align:middle line:90%
What does the energy feel like?

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.470 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.810 align:middle line:84%
Then, keeping the
eyes closed, observe

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.490 align:middle line:84%
what is currently in your
thoughts and your emotions.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.470 align:middle line:84%
So now you've been
able to observe

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.950 align:middle line:84%
what you feel energetically and
what's in your consciousness,

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.400 align:middle line:84%
in your thoughts, and
in your emotional life.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Now we will begin
the practice itself.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Take three slow, deep
breaths, relaxing

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.450 align:middle line:84%
any tension in your head,
neck, and shoulders.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Keep the muscles of the head
relaxed during the practice.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Do not allow the
energy generated

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.690 align:middle line:90%
to create muscular tension.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Focus your awareness
between the eyebrows.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And become aware of any
sensations that you feel there.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Then follow that
sensation that you

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.920 align:middle line:84%
feel between the
eyebrows straight back

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.830 align:middle line:84%
along the third eye
cylinder, until you

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.090 align:middle line:84%
feel the location of the
center of the cubicle cross

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.470 align:middle line:90%
in the Cave of Brahma.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.930 align:middle line:84%
This location in the
center of your head

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.680 align:middle line:84%
will feel like an area
of increased vibration

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.820 align:middle line:84%
and light compared to
the areas around it.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.080 align:middle line:84%
It also feels like an open space
in your head, a very stable

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.690 align:middle line:84%
place where your
attention can rest.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Become aware that
from this power

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.580 align:middle line:84%
center of the Cave
of Brahma, you

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.480 align:middle line:84%
can feel the three axes of the
cubicle cross streaming out.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.000 align:middle line:90%


00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.080 align:middle line:90%
So become aware.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And feel the front back
circuit, from the third eye

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.770 align:middle line:84%
between the eyebrows,
back to the occipit

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.460 align:middle line:90%
at the back of the head.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Then become aware of and
feel the top down circuit,

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.310 align:middle line:84%
from the crown, down
the golden thread,

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.120 align:middle line:84%
through the vertical center line
of the body, to the perineum,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.530 align:middle line:90%
at the base of the abdomen.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.420 align:middle line:90%


00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And then become aware and
feel the side-to-side circuit,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.660 align:middle line:84%
from the top of one ear through
the two brain hemispheres,

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.100 align:middle line:90%
to the top of the opposite ear.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Then stabilize your
awareness, where

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.670 align:middle line:84%
all three lines of energy,
all three circuits,

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.940 align:middle line:84%
meet, in the center
of the cubicle cross,

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.940 align:middle line:90%
at the Cave of Brahma.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.850 align:middle line:84%
Tune into how the energy
feels at this location

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.920 align:middle line:90%
of the Cave of Brahma.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.820 align:middle line:84%
It may feel like a
vibration or a pressure.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Don't think about
this area abstractly.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.940 align:middle line:84%
You must put your mind
deep inside this location

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.750 align:middle line:90%
and feel its energy.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Now with your attention
in the Cave of Brahma,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.870 align:middle line:84%
pull all of your energy and
awareness, which normally flows

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.570 align:middle line:84%
outwards, to
instead move inwards

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.550 align:middle line:84%
into the absolute center of what
you feel in the Cave of Brahma,

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.010 align:middle line:90%
in the center of your head.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Feel this inward movement like
a sphere of energy and attention

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.110 align:middle line:84%
that is collapsing into its
own center from all directions

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.180 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.600 align:middle line:84%
This movement is like a balloon
collapsing into its own center

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.574 align:middle line:90%
as it deflates.

00:04:17.574 --> 00:04:20.610 align:middle line:90%


00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.250 align:middle line:84%
This inward pull from
all directions at once

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.040 align:middle line:84%
into the center is created by
a particular energetic muscle,

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.410 align:middle line:84%
which you may not have
been aware of before,

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.090 align:middle line:84%
which needs to be
exercised to become strong.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.480 align:middle line:84%
Once you have activated the
inward movement of the energy

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.410 align:middle line:84%
at the Cave of Brahma, let
go and allow the energy

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.740 align:middle line:84%
to continue to implode
into the center

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.810 align:middle line:90%
with its own energetic momentum.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:47.610 align:middle line:90%
Relax.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And allow your attention to be
pulled into the very center,

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.910 align:middle line:84%
as if being carried effortlessly
by a vortex of energy.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.110 align:middle line:84%
When your inward movement
reaches the absolute center,

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.270 align:middle line:84%
you may feel a profound
stability, a dynamic quiet

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.580 align:middle line:84%
and peace, as you dwell deep
inside this divine center

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.350 align:middle line:90%
at the Cave of Brahma.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.170 align:middle line:84%
Then experience that
this awakened energy now

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.690 align:middle line:84%
floods outwards
in all directions

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.590 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously, expanding
out from the divine plane

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.760 align:middle line:84%
central point, to create a
dynamically-expanding sphere

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.820 align:middle line:84%
of ecstatic light and
energy pouring out

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.890 align:middle line:90%
from this epicenter.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.650 align:middle line:84%
Allow this energy
sphere to expand

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.350 align:middle line:84%
until it becomes a
radiant golden sun

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.640 align:middle line:84%
around your entire head,
effortlessly radiating light

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.390 align:middle line:90%
and energy in all directions.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Allow the awakened energy
from the divine center

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.250 align:middle line:84%
and the golden sun to
clear out any stuck energy,

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.990 align:middle line:84%
any old, toxic thought forms
from your physical brain

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.740 align:middle line:90%
and your entire head.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.470 align:middle line:84%
All blockages and
darkness simply

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.100 align:middle line:84%
melt away, like dew
evaporating in sunlight.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.660 align:middle line:90%


00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.430 align:middle line:84%
Allow your thoughts
and awareness

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.380 align:middle line:84%
to now shift in quality, to
resonate with the golden sun

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.940 align:middle line:90%
sphere.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Experience the
clearing and expansion

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.680 align:middle line:90%
of your consciousness.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.520 align:middle line:84%
You may even experience contact
with packed thought forms

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.660 align:middle line:84%
from spiritual beings
and higher realities.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.590 align:middle line:84%
You can stay in this
expanded radiant state

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.400 align:middle line:84%
with the golden sun
around your entire head,

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.060 align:middle line:84%
anchored in the Cave of Brahma
in the center for as long

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.120 align:middle line:90%
as you like.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.410 align:middle line:84%
When you are ready to end
this activation practice,

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.530 align:middle line:84%
simply let go of the
awareness of the golden sun

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:54.730 align:middle line:90%
around your head.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And shift your
attention once again

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:00.250 align:middle line:84%
to the energy field
awareness practice.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Tune into the feeling of
energy in and around your head

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.390 align:middle line:90%
and body.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Become aware of any changes
to your consciousness,

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.110 align:middle line:84%
the change to
thoughts in your mind,

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.660 align:middle line:90%
and to your emotional state.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Ask yourself how your energy
and awareness have transformed

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.920 align:middle line:90%
from doing this practice.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.740 align:middle line:84%
Doing this simple energy
field awareness practice

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.890 align:middle line:84%
at the end of any
spiritual exercise

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:30.340 align:middle line:84%
allows you to directly know
what effect any practice is

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:34.390 align:middle line:84%
having on your energy
and your consciousness.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.340 align:middle line:84%
This is much better
than simply accepting

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.100 align:middle line:84%
what another person tells
you about the effects

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.780 align:middle line:90%
a practice will have.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.230 align:middle line:90%
You must know for yourself.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.540 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
significant practice.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.150 align:middle line:84%
It is so fundamental
that even if a person

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:53.770 align:middle line:84%
did only this method and applied
it to activate multiple energy

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:57.820 align:middle line:84%
centers in their body, it could
transform their consciousness

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.090 align:middle line:90%
and their spiritual destiny.

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:04.330 align:middle line:84%
You can apply the point in
the circle sacred geometry

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.290 align:middle line:84%
pattern, which becomes the zero
point centering and radiance

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.200 align:middle line:84%
technique to explore
power centers

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.020 align:middle line:90%
of your own inner landscape.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.120 align:middle line:84%
You could apply this
practice to activating

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.650 align:middle line:84%
your heart, your solar
plexus, organs, glands,

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:25.540 align:middle line:84%
acupuncture points, any energy
centers in your body or energy

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.140 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Every energy center within you
holds its own unique nectar,

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:36.299 align:middle line:84%
its own specific spiritual
powers and energies.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:39.840 align:middle line:84%
You will find that there is
a vast world living inside

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.890 align:middle line:90%
of you.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.740 align:middle line:84%
You will experience
that your body is indeed

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:49.050 align:middle line:84%
a sacred temple, a microcosm
which holds within it the keys

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:52.950 align:middle line:84%
to connect to every aspect
of the macrocosm and higher

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:56.070 align:middle line:90%
spiritual realities.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.080 align:middle line:84%
This is only a
short introduction

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:03.900 align:middle line:84%
to what is just a first step
to higher level activations.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.050 align:middle line:84%
After opening the consciousness
centers in the physical head,

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.420 align:middle line:84%
it is possible to go
up the central column,

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.860 align:middle line:84%
and open up the first
chakra above the head,

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.930 align:middle line:84%
using the same zero
point centering

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.670 align:middle line:90%
and radiance technique.

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Then later, you can
activate even higher centers

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.230 align:middle line:90%
above the head.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Be aware that any
activations above the head

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.180 align:middle line:84%
must be balanced
with activations

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.870 align:middle line:84%
of the centers below the body as
well, in more advanced methods.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:36.120 align:middle line:84%
This is an application of the
as above, so below principle,

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.820 align:middle line:84%
that for every movement
upwards, you must equally

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.370 align:middle line:84%
connect downwards
to the same extent,

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:45.030 align:middle line:84%
in order to stay
grounded and balanced.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.460 align:middle line:10%
For more information and
step-by-step training

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.210 align:middle line:10%
in these higher activations,
I created an online course

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:54.330 align:middle line:10%
entitled, Connecting
to Spiritual Realities

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:59.250 align:middle line:10%
at my website, www.vesica.org.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:03.300 align:middle line:10%
Once you effectively activate
these higher centers,

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.660 align:middle line:10%
you can begin to directly
experience packed thought forms

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.340 align:middle line:10%
from higher worlds.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Over time, you will also be
able to generate and transmit

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.420 align:middle line:84%
these packed thought
forms as well.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Then the four secrets
of sacred geometry,

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.650 align:middle line:84%
which you learned
in this episode,

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:23.430 align:middle line:84%
will become direct
experience, and can profoundly

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.140 align:middle line:90%
transform your life.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.190 align:middle line:90%
