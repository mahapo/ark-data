>> We can now experience a
simple practice to create

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.160 align:middle line:10%
and absorb a sphere
of bioenergy.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Remember the fundamental
ethical rule of safety

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.010 align:middle line:84%
when learning new
energetic methods, which

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.090 align:middle line:84%
is to first practice them on
yourself until you master them

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.200 align:middle line:84%
before using them on others
and to only use them on others

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.990 align:middle line:90%
with their explicit permission.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.400 align:middle line:10%
We will begin with the energy
field awareness practice, which

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.970 align:middle line:10%
is simply to become quiet
inside and tune into the feeling

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.120 align:middle line:10%
of energy in and
around your body

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.660 align:middle line:10%
as well as observing whatever
thoughts and emotions are

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.780 align:middle line:10%
in your consciousness
at this moment.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.580 align:middle line:10%
You don't need to
change or manipulate

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.510 align:middle line:10%
in any way what is in your
energy field or your mind

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.480 align:middle line:10%
during the energy field
awareness practice.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Simply observe and become
aware of whatever is present.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.410 align:middle line:10%
This gives you a
baseline to then

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.400 align:middle line:10%
observe changes in your
energy or consciousness

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.690 align:middle line:10%
from any energetic or
spiritual practice that you do,

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.060 align:middle line:10%
so please do the
energy field awareness

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.020 align:middle line:10%
practice for a moment.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.800 align:middle line:90%


00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Now we can begin the classical
energy sphere creation

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.380 align:middle line:90%
practice.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.960 align:middle line:10%
Our hands are used to
project life energy

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.010 align:middle line:10%
called prana, qi, ether, et
cetera in different traditions

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.570 align:middle line:10%
all over the world.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.880 align:middle line:84%
The most powerful energy
emission in the hands

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.860 align:middle line:84%
is the center of
the palm, which is

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.210 align:middle line:84%
acupuncture point pericardium
8 in Chinese medicine.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Energy emissions may also
come from the fingers.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.480 align:middle line:84%
However, the center of the
palm is the most powerful hand

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.440 align:middle line:90%
energy center.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Remember the principle that
energy follows attention.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you put your attention,
your energy goes there.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Simply by putting attention
on the palms of the hands,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.890 align:middle line:84%
you start to activate the
energy emissions there.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.200 align:middle line:84%
So please take a few deep
breaths deep into your belly.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.880 align:middle line:90%
Relax and become quiet inside.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Place your attention on
the center of your palms,

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.930 align:middle line:84%
feeling the natural
vibration there.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.980 align:middle line:84%
Now to increase the sensation
of the vibration you feel there,

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.980 align:middle line:84%
rub the palms of your
hands briskly together

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.790 align:middle line:84%
and then stop and feel
the vibration at the palms

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.150 align:middle line:90%
and between the two hands.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Move your palms
closer and further

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.880 align:middle line:84%
from each other,
feeling the compression

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.410 align:middle line:84%
of the energy between them when
you move them closer together.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Then start to play
with that energy,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.620 align:middle line:84%
moving your hands in
spherical rotations,

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.260 align:middle line:84%
forming the energy
between the palms

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.240 align:middle line:84%
into a sphere held
between the hands.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Use your attention
and mind power

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.100 align:middle line:84%
to move your
awareness and energy

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.770 align:middle line:84%
into the center of the sphere
held between your hands.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.770 align:middle line:84%
This is the zero-point
centering practice

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.140 align:middle line:84%
you learned in episode
2 of the series.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.150 align:middle line:84%
This activates the divine
plane, the unified field power.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Then from the center
of the sphere,

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.590 align:middle line:84%
use your mind power
to radiate the energy

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.440 align:middle line:84%
back to the boundary
of the sphere, which

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.750 align:middle line:90%
is the radiance practice.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Lead the energy of the
sphere to cycle sequentially

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.500 align:middle line:84%
through the zero-point
centering and radiance phases

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.380 align:middle line:84%
to gently implode
into its own center

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.350 align:middle line:84%
and explode back
out to the boundary

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.110 align:middle line:84%
of the sphere in
a regular rhythm,

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.930 align:middle line:84%
creating a steady
pulsation of the sphere

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.960 align:middle line:90%
as if it was a beating heart.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Set up the pulsation
of the sphere

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.120 align:middle line:84%
to match the rhythm of the
beating of your own heart

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.110 align:middle line:90%
in your chest.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.120 align:middle line:84%
Feel the change in the vibration
of the sphere in your hands

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.749 align:middle line:84%
when you set it to pulse with
the beating of your own heart.

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:23.960 align:middle line:90%


00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.500 align:middle line:84%
Imprint now into the
sphere with your mind power

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.580 align:middle line:84%
a gentle light blue pastel
color like the color

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.700 align:middle line:84%
of the clear sky,
which can help calm

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.640 align:middle line:90%
and soothe stress and agitation.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.310 align:middle line:84%
The vibrational power of
blue also specifically

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.850 align:middle line:84%
helps to stabilize and
hold the sphere together

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.320 align:middle line:84%
and to preserve thought forms
we project into the sphere.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.440 align:middle line:84%
Feel the change in the vibration
of the sphere in your hands

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:58.320 align:middle line:84%
when you imprint the light
sky blue color into it.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Generate then in your
mind a thought form

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.340 align:middle line:84%
of dynamic vitality and
health, of disintegrating

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.230 align:middle line:84%
any toxic invasions or
accumulations in your body.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.110 align:middle line:84%
See in your mind's
eye clear images

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.650 align:middle line:84%
of yourself bursting with
this vital energy and health,

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.900 align:middle line:84%
with any toxicity or issues
dissolving away to nothing.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Accompany these images
of health with generating

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.600 align:middle line:84%
the feeling of
health and happiness

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.080 align:middle line:90%
in your body and energy field.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.390 align:middle line:84%
Be aware that these
images and feelings

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.180 align:middle line:84%
are creating a coherent
thought form inside your head.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Then you're projecting
this thought form

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.770 align:middle line:84%
from inside your head then from
the area between your eyebrows

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.800 align:middle line:84%
into the sphere held
between your hands.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Feel the change in the vibration
of the blue sphere held

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.790 align:middle line:84%
between your hands when
you add this thought

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:02.090 align:middle line:84%
form of health and vitality
into the blue sphere.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Then you can use your hands
to take the blue sphere

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.160 align:middle line:84%
and push it into your
own solar plexus.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.610 align:middle line:84%
Absorb the sphere then
into your solar plexus,

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.460 align:middle line:84%
laying your hands on
top of the solar plexus

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.250 align:middle line:90%
as the sphere is absorbed.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Close your eyes
and relax, feeling

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.110 align:middle line:84%

body and energy

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.840 align:middle line:84%

sphere releases

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.125 align:middle line:84%
its beneficial contents
into your solar plexus.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Then you can relax and
return your hands to your lap

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:41.970 align:middle line:84%
and then use the energy field
awareness practice once again

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.880 align:middle line:84%
to quietly tune in to
the shift of energy

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.170 align:middle line:84%
in and around your body from
having created and absorbed

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.430 align:middle line:90%
this sphere of energy.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.070 align:middle line:84%
How does your energy
feel different

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.930 align:middle line:84%
than it did before the
start of the practice?

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.330 align:middle line:10%
Observe, also, any shifts
in your mental thoughts

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.530 align:middle line:10%
and emotional feelings from
having absorbed the sphere.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.200 align:middle line:10%
This process of creating
the energy sphere

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.290 align:middle line:10%
can also be used for
manifestation purposes

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.560 align:middle line:10%
by placing specific thoughts
forms within the sphere of what

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.060 align:middle line:10%
you choose to manifest and then
placing the visualized sphere

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.610 align:middle line:10%
within the energetic
environment where

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.120 align:middle line:10%
this situation can materialize.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.810 align:middle line:10%
This practice can be
repeated and reinforced daily

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.560 align:middle line:10%
to keep the sphere
active and working.
