00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome back.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.340 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Dr.
Robert J. Gilbert.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.340 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we will
explore the hidden energies

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.910 align:middle line:84%
behind sacred geometry,
which give geometric forms

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.920 align:middle line:90%
their true power.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.230 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient world,
sacred geometry

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.890 align:middle line:84%
was a practical energy science
with powerful applications

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.910 align:middle line:84%
for healing, for harmonizing
energy over large areas,

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.060 align:middle line:84%
for activating the
energy grid, the net,

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.430 align:middle line:90%
in human beings and locations.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.340 align:middle line:84%
Most of this ancient
energy science

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.650 align:middle line:84%
was lost over
thousands of years,

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.920 align:middle line:84%
leaving behind just the
philosophical and technical

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.500 align:middle line:84%
aspects of sacred
geometry design.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.989 align:middle line:84%
Esoteric traditions know
that human history goes

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.280 align:middle line:90%
through different time cycles.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.380 align:middle line:84%
One of the most famous is the
Kali Yuga Dark Age described

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.580 align:middle line:90%
in the Indian Vedic tradition.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.670 align:middle line:84%
This is a time when
spiritual light grows

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.300 align:middle line:90%
dim and materialism takes over.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.700 align:middle line:84%
Although some sources
calculate that we are still

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.630 align:middle line:84%
in the Dark Age, according to
the Babaji lineage of India,

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.430 align:middle line:84%
as expressed by Babaji disciple
Sri Yukteswar in his text

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.040 align:middle line:84%
"The Holy Science," the Dark
Age actually ended in 1899.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.920 align:middle line:10%
Interestingly, the European
Rosicrucian tradition

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.630 align:middle line:10%
through the work
of Rudolf Steiner

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.760 align:middle line:10%
gives the same date for the
end of the Dark Age, 1899.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Although the forces
of materialism

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.890 align:middle line:84%
are still tremendously strong
and in many ways getting

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.590 align:middle line:84%
even stronger, new
spiritual light

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.680 align:middle line:84%
has emerged in the
world since 1900.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Great spiritual traditions
all around the world

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.920 align:middle line:84%
have publicly released
previously hidden information.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.370 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
great inner secrets

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.680 align:middle line:84%
of the European
Rosicrucian tradition

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.720 align:middle line:84%
were revealed by Rudolf Steiner
in the years following 1899.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.840 align:middle line:10%
Highly secret and
protected information,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.660 align:middle line:10%
like the advanced
internal alchemy formulas

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.940 align:middle line:10%
of the Chinese
Daoist, which are some

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.870 align:middle line:10%
of the most advanced initiation
knowledge in the entire world,

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.460 align:middle line:10%
only began to be released
publicly in the 1980s.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.990 align:middle line:84%
One of the great developments
in spiritual science since 1900

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.290 align:middle line:84%
was the development of
the science of cymatics,

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.950 align:middle line:90%
the study of wave phenomena.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Cymatics makes visible the
actual invisible vibrational

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.660 align:middle line:84%
powers behind all physical
manifestation, what

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.790 align:middle line:84%
we call the energy
grid of the net

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.820 align:middle line:84%
that we explored earlier
in the series that

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.110 align:middle line:84%
was known in ancient
Egypt and other cultures.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Cymatics shows the
direct conversion

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.500 align:middle line:84%
of vibrational forces into
the sacred geometry patterns

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.440 align:middle line:90%
of all physical manifestation.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Because of this, cymatics
has become important evidence

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.490 align:middle line:84%
to show the validity of
modern vibrational medicine

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.160 align:middle line:90%
and vibrational science.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.010 align:middle line:90%
The Greek term for wave is kyma.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.310 align:middle line:84%
So kymatics was the
original German name

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.440 align:middle line:84%
for this breakthrough
field, which

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.430 align:middle line:84%
makes visible the invisible
vibrational fields behind all

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.900 align:middle line:90%
of creation.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.130 align:middle line:84%
In English, cymatics is
written with a c instead of a k

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.190 align:middle line:90%
and is pronounced cymatics.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.730 align:middle line:84%
It was developed by the Swiss
medical doctor Hans Jenny,

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.630 align:middle line:84%
a student of the Rosicrucian
work of Rudolf Steiner.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Jenny used modern
electronic technology,

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.650 align:middle line:84%
including the use of waveforms
transmitted through crystals,

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.340 align:middle line:84%
to show the relationship
between specific vibrations

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.820 align:middle line:84%
and the geometric forms
that they manifest.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.490 align:middle line:84%
Jenny recreated
the work of Kolodny

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.510 align:middle line:84%
from the 1700s, which showed
that a violin bow drawn

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.890 align:middle line:84%
across a steel plate would
form powder placed on the plate

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.450 align:middle line:84%
into specific geometric
forms based on the note,

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.899 align:middle line:84%
but now with much more
precision and control

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:22.540 align:middle line:84%
with the new electronic
instruments being

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.120 align:middle line:90%
used by Jenny.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Short wavelengths can
put matter into rotation,

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.200 align:middle line:84%
linked to the sacred
geometry power of the vortex.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.570 align:middle line:84%
By using liquids
rather than powder,

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.940 align:middle line:84%
counter-rotating
spirals are created

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.050 align:middle line:84%
through specific
vibrations, vibrations

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.600 align:middle line:84%
put through various
fluids, so the creation

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.560 align:middle line:90%
of perfect net energy matrices.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.650 align:middle line:10%
Here we see vibration
creating in the water sample

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.160 align:middle line:10%
a perfect point in the center
of the circle geometric

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.940 align:middle line:10%
form, which was our first
letter of the divine alphabet

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.290 align:middle line:10%
of sacred geometry.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.410 align:middle line:84%
A slight increase in
frequency keeps the point

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.440 align:middle line:84%
in the center of the
circle, while then adding

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.830 align:middle line:84%
the next stage of vibrational
structuring of matter,

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.250 align:middle line:84%
seen in the shapes being
created at the periphery.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.380 align:middle line:84%
In this case, with
the pentagonal shape

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.630 align:middle line:84%
on the periphery, as
with the pentagonal

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.150 align:middle line:90%
faces of the dodecahedron.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.430 align:middle line:84%
This close-up of
a water drop shows

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.090 align:middle line:84%
how the vibration creates
within a five-sided structure

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.810 align:middle line:84%
a continual pulsation and
movement from the center

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.540 align:middle line:90%
to the periphery and back again.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.320 align:middle line:84%
This combines the point in the
center of the circle geometry

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.050 align:middle line:84%
archetype with the
pulsation of movement

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.990 align:middle line:90%
in and out of a center.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.500 align:middle line:84%
By using two sounds
together, the beat of music

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.330 align:middle line:84%
can be made visible, like
the pulse of a heartbeat.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Vibration can crystallize
matter into forms

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.840 align:middle line:84%
like a spinal column, complete
with movement like a living

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.280 align:middle line:90%
centipede.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Vibration can even make matter
begin to aggregate together

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.440 align:middle line:84%
and rise up vertically and move
forward, like a living being,

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.940 align:middle line:84%
as seen here with
these iron filings.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.580 align:middle line:84%
The imaging methods
developed by Hans Jenny

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.800 align:middle line:84%
have been advanced
significantly in recent years,

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.610 align:middle line:84%
especially through the
work of British scientist

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:23.140 align:middle line:84%
John Stuart Reid, the inventor
of the modern CymaScope.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.770 align:middle line:84%
The CymaScope allows highly
detailed cymatics images

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.670 align:middle line:84%
to be created in 4K or
even higher resolution

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.940 align:middle line:84%
and with
three-dimensional detail.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.280 align:middle line:10%
Reid had previously
conducted research

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.490 align:middle line:10%
in the King's Chamber
of the Great Pyramid.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.680 align:middle line:84%
He showed that the
chamber was precisely

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.010 align:middle line:84%
constructed so that sound
vibrations generated

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:84%
inside the King's Chamber
were focused energetically

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.260 align:middle line:84%
on the so-called sarcophagus in
the room, which in reality is

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.040 align:middle line:84%
the place used for a powerful
spiritual initiation process.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.940 align:middle line:84%
This means that chants or other
sounds created in the King's

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Chamber would immediately
focus their vibrational effects

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.300 align:middle line:84%
on the person
undergoing initiation

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.300 align:middle line:90%
lying in the sarcophagus.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.120 align:middle line:10%
Reid has used his
development of the CymaScope

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.340 align:middle line:10%
to conduct pioneering
breakthroughs

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.950 align:middle line:10%
in cymatics imaging,
such as being

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:22.750 align:middle line:10%
able to recreate the structural
form of ancient primordial life

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.500 align:middle line:10%
forms through pure
sound vibration.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.620 align:middle line:84%
This demonstrates how these
invisible vibrational fields

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.700 align:middle line:84%
create the structures of all
life and matter, structures

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.870 align:middle line:90%
which he can now recreate.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.800 align:middle line:84%
This is his recreation of the
pattern of an ancient trilobite

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.540 align:middle line:84%
from the Cambrian period
526 million years ago,

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:52.210 align:middle line:84%
with his lab-generated cymatics
trilobite shown on the right.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.910 align:middle line:84%
This is his
recreation of a diatom

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:58.930 align:middle line:84%
from the Cretaceous period
65 million years ago,

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:03.380 align:middle line:84%
and his schematic diatom
shown on the right.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Reid has found that the modern
concept of a sound wave, which

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.300 align:middle line:84%
is usually depicted as a
two-dimensional sine wave

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.040 align:middle line:90%
is deeply misleading.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.160 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, all sound
waves are spherical,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.160 align:middle line:10%
propagating as
pulsating bubbles.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.310 align:middle line:84%
This discovery shows the
relationship of sound waves

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.440 align:middle line:84%
to one of the first
sacred geometry patterns

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.180 align:middle line:90%
we explored in this series--

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.580 align:middle line:84%
the point in the
center of the circle

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.740 align:middle line:84%
with the expansion
and contraction

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.169 align:middle line:90%
in and out of the center.

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:37.190 align:middle line:10%
Whenever we hear sound or hear
a musical instrument played,

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:42.500 align:middle line:10%
what we are hearing is the
expanding sound wave sphere.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.710 align:middle line:10%
Reid has been able to image
all types of invisible sound

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:48.440 align:middle line:10%
vibrations, including
these 12 piano

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.570 align:middle line:10%
notes of the first
octave, showing

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:54.120 align:middle line:10%
their precise geometries.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.180 align:middle line:10%
He has even been able to
capture the vibrational pattern

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.390 align:middle line:10%
of the sun itself,
in this image, which

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.460 align:middle line:10%
he calls The Song of the Sun.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.610 align:middle line:84%
The Song of the
Sun cymatics glyph

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:08.250 align:middle line:84%
can be used as a matrix
on which to construct

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.070 align:middle line:84%
powerful crystalline
energy grids.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.850 align:middle line:84%
These crystal grids create a
microcosm of the great standing

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.650 align:middle line:84%
stone circles of
megalithic Europe,

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:20.070 align:middle line:84%
which were used to
concentrate and direct

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:25.020 align:middle line:84%
energy at natural power
spots on the Earth.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.770 align:middle line:84%
In this image, we see clear
quartz standing stones

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.980 align:middle line:84%
placed on the song of
the sun matrix, one

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.880 align:middle line:84%
on each of the 28 nodal
points on the periphery.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.190 align:middle line:84%
An illuminated quartz
sphere is placed

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:39.660 align:middle line:90%
on the center of the grid.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And then quartz points
are used horizontally

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.780 align:middle line:84%
to create lines of energy
which connect the center

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:49.050 align:middle line:90%
to the periphery crystals.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.730 align:middle line:84%
I constructed this
particular grid

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:54.600 align:middle line:84%
to illustrate this process
in my online course, minerals

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.280 align:middle line:84%
and crystals for
times of stress.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Note that a stone, which
can transmute and harmonize

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.110 align:middle line:84%
any toxicity coming from
the electronic light source

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.620 align:middle line:84%
in the center, which is a
little known stone called Indigo

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Gabbro from
Madagascar, is included

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.760 align:middle line:84%
on the light source for optimal
energetics of this grid.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.640 align:middle line:84%
In addition to making
his advanced CymaScope

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.910 align:middle line:84%
available to scientific
research institutes,

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Reid has been able to
create a digital library

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.750 align:middle line:84%
of the geometric forms which
correspond to specific tones

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:31.620 align:middle line:84%
and frequencies, which is
now available in miniaturized

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:36.990 align:middle line:84%
form as a CymaScope app for
all smartphones or tablets.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Unlike other apps,
which simply generate

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:middle line:84%
abstract random digital graphics
in response to inputted sounds,

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Reid's CymaScope app shows the
actual geometric vibrational

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.000 align:middle line:84%
pattern created by
the sounds of anything

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.070 align:middle line:84%
you use the app to
capture and image.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:58.380 align:middle line:10%
This can be human voices,
or music, natural sounds,

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.360 align:middle line:10%
et cetera.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.960 align:middle line:84%
Reid's work has now moved into
creating unprecedented high res

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.760 align:middle line:84%
images 4K and higher, as seen
in this imaging of a chant

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.060 align:middle line:84%
by sound researcher
Jonathan Goldman.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Reid is also creating 3D images
of complete sound spheres.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.740 align:middle line:10%
In some of his latest
work, Reid has opened up

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:24.130 align:middle line:10%
the possibilities of a new
field of medical imaging

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.170 align:middle line:10%
using cymatics.

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:28.540 align:middle line:10%
He has created the
first images of

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.000 align:middle line:10%
the vibrational
geometric difference

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.440 align:middle line:10%
between a healthy cell
and a cancerous cell.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.410 align:middle line:84%
In the new field
called cymatherapy,

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:41.440 align:middle line:84%
British osteopath
Dr. Peter Guy Manners

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.870 align:middle line:84%
applied cymatics
principles to creating

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:48.730 align:middle line:84%
the first clinical cymatherapy
device in the early 1960s,

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:51.280 align:middle line:84%
which he used to treat
patients at his clinic

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.370 align:middle line:90%
until his retirement in 2005.

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Manners lived in
excellent health

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.080 align:middle line:84%
to be over 100 years
old, which he attributed

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.680 align:middle line:84%
to being exposed daily to
the powerful healing effects

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.290 align:middle line:90%
of his cymatherapy frequencies.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:09.550 align:middle line:84%
He was 101 years old when
this picture was taken.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:13.210 align:middle line:10%
Manners became known for the
almost miraculous recoveries

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.270 align:middle line:10%
enjoyed by his
cymatherapy patients.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:20.020 align:middle line:84%
He discovered it was not enough
to simply hear the sounds,

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.600 align:middle line:84%
their vibrations had
to be driven directly

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.770 align:middle line:84%
into the tissues of the body
through a transducer in contact

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:29.930 align:middle line:90%
with the area being treated.

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:32.350 align:middle line:84%
One of the great secrets
of Dr. Manners's work

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.920 align:middle line:84%
became known as
the secret of five.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.530 align:middle line:84%
He discovered through
decades of empirical research

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.570 align:middle line:84%
that it is not
possible to restore

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:43.420 align:middle line:84%
the full resonant
frequency of body areas

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.000 align:middle line:84%
through a single
sound vibration,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.710 align:middle line:84%
nor even two, three, or four
vibrations used together.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:54.700 align:middle line:84%
He found the key was to use
five sound frequencies together

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:59.650 align:middle line:84%
in highly precise combinations,
creating complex sound codes

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:02.470 align:middle line:90%
which he called commutations.

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:04.570 align:middle line:84%
This is of particular
interest, given

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.150 align:middle line:84%
that we have seen
previously in the series

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:11.290 align:middle line:84%
that the number five is directly
linked to the vital life

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:15.820 align:middle line:84%
force in the human being, as
seen in the five-sided pentagon

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:19.450 align:middle line:84%
and pentagram,
sacred geometries.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Manners passed on his
work to Mandara Cromwell

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:26.170 align:middle line:84%
from the United States, who
updated the electronic systems

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:29.800 align:middle line:84%
with the latest
technological advancements.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.890 align:middle line:84%
Her first units were
miniaturized and upgraded

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:36.130 align:middle line:84%
versions of Manners's
master clinical units.

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Cromwell then realized
this technology

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.440 align:middle line:84%
needed to be made available
to the general public

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.660 align:middle line:90%
in a simplified form.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.580 align:middle line:84%
This led to her
recent development

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:51.100 align:middle line:84%
of the first public cymatherapy
device, the AMI 750.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.370 align:middle line:10%
Instead of requiring holding
a hand-held applicator

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:57.830 align:middle line:10%
for extended periods on
particular body parts,

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:01.240 align:middle line:10%
this device simply has the
user place their bare feet

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.300 align:middle line:10%
on gel pads which
conduct the vibrations

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:08.650 align:middle line:10%
through the soles of the feet
into the entire body system.

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Cromwell was nominated
for the Thomas Edison

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.440 align:middle line:84%
Award for innovation in the
fields of science and medicine

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:18.820 align:middle line:84%
in 2013 for her development of
the first public cymatherapy

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:22.540 align:middle line:84%
device using Dr. Manners's
precision sound codes,

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.090 align:middle line:84%
and her device has now
become available worldwide.

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:29.200 align:middle line:84%
In the United States,
it's FDA-certified for use

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.970 align:middle line:90%
for pain and stress relief.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Many research projects
have shown the efficacy

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:36.850 align:middle line:90%
of cymatherapy methods.

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:40.660 align:middle line:10%
For example, this project
showed that a 95% tendon

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:44.170 align:middle line:10%
tear in the leg of a horse
healed the tendon fully

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:47.410 align:middle line:10%
with no surgery or physical
intervention, which

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:50.680 align:middle line:10%
is considered virtually
impossible today.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.350 align:middle line:10%
Thermographic imaging
of this leg injury

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.690 align:middle line:10%
shows elimination
of inflammatory pain

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:57.670 align:middle line:10%
within 30 minutes.

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:01.090 align:middle line:10%
Similarly, thermography
shows the massive reduction

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.940 align:middle line:10%
or complete
elimination of 10 years

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:08.350 align:middle line:10%
of progressive inflammatory pain
of the breast and lymph glands

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:12.540 align:middle line:10%
after a standard six
weeks treatment protocol.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.600 align:middle line:84%
This study, from a
Bioelectromagnetics Society

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.840 align:middle line:84%
Conference showed tremendous
reduction of inflammation

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.320 align:middle line:84%
from peripheral artery
disease in only 15 minutes

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.730 align:middle line:90%
of treatment.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:27.720 align:middle line:84%
The actual sacred geometric
form of these sound codes

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.940 align:middle line:84%
coming from the
cymatherapy device

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:34.260 align:middle line:84%
can be made visible using John
Reid's CymaScope app, simply

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:38.160 align:middle line:84%
by placing a smartphone or
tablet with the app on top

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.550 align:middle line:84%
of the gel pads while they're
running specific channels.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:43.830 align:middle line:84%
Using the full
CymaScope apparatus,

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:47.730 align:middle line:84%
John Reid was also able to
take precision images of some

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:50.280 align:middle line:84%
of the cymatherapy
sound codes contained

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.220 align:middle line:90%
in this first public device.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:56.670 align:middle line:84%
When imaged with a CymaScope,
the acupuncture meridian

00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:01.470 align:middle line:84%
clearing sound code manifested
a perfect five-pointed star,

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:03.630 align:middle line:84%
which we have seen
in previous episodes

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:07.570 align:middle line:84%
is a signature of the
etheric life force.

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.920 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, this image of
the etheric body sound

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:15.180 align:middle line:84%
code from Dr. Manners shows an
amazing spherical configuration

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:19.680 align:middle line:84%
of pentagons, making a
dynamic dodecahedron, which

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.840 align:middle line:84%
is the highest of
the platonic solids,

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.540 align:middle line:90%
the one for the ether itself.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.020 align:middle line:84%
We should bear in mind
that only recently has

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.630 align:middle line:84%
the imaging of Dr.
Manners's sound codes been

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:32.940 align:middle line:84%
possible at this
level, revealing

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.820 align:middle line:84%
the incredible match between
what Dr. Manners said

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.920 align:middle line:84%
the function of
the sound code was

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.070 align:middle line:84%
with the literal geometric
form which is created

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:44.160 align:middle line:84%
by that code, which we
can now see visibly, which

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.780 align:middle line:90%
proves his assertion.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:49.230 align:middle line:84%
The anti-aging channel on
the public cymatherapy device

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:53.010 align:middle line:84%
contains Dr. Manners's sound
codes for all five elements

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:54.780 align:middle line:90%
of Chinese medicine.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:58.140 align:middle line:84%
These have now been imaged
by John Reid's CymaScope

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.840 align:middle line:84%
and color-coded
for each element.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:05.730 align:middle line:84%
As seen here, the metal element
in white, water in blue,

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:11.880 align:middle line:84%
wood in green, fire in
red, and earth in yellow.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Cymatics has now shown
through modern technology

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:18.869 align:middle line:84%
that invisible vibrations do
indeed create and structure

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:22.349 align:middle line:84%
the physical world, just as
claimed in ancient traditions

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:24.329 align:middle line:90%
all around the world.

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:26.730 align:middle line:84%
These vibrations can
be practically applied

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:30.690 align:middle line:84%
for profound healing and
physical regeneration.

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:33.120 align:middle line:84%
This has now opened
the door for a new age

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.990 align:middle line:84%
of vibrational medicine
and vibrational science.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:39.390 align:middle line:84%
To fully understand the
significance of this,

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:41.880 align:middle line:84%
we need to understand that
our modern technology has

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:46.410 align:middle line:84%
completely transformed the
Earth in only 100 years.

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:50.430 align:middle line:10%
All of this new technology, from
electrification of the Earth,

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.910 align:middle line:10%
to propulsion systems,
to digital computers

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:58.960 align:middle line:10%
are all based on the discovery
of two spectrums of energy.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.470 align:middle line:10%
The first is the spectrum
of all physical matter which

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:05.320 align:middle line:10%
has allowed us to identify
every single element which

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.510 align:middle line:10%
exists in the physical world.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:11.830 align:middle line:10%
This is what we call the
periodic table of elements.

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:15.190 align:middle line:84%
The second is the spectrum
of the decayed radiations

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:18.490 align:middle line:84%
that are beneath the level
of the physical plane.

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:21.280 align:middle line:10%
This sub-physical
spectrum is what we call

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.100 align:middle line:10%
the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.410 align:middle line:84%
All of our modern
technology is based

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:29.770 align:middle line:84%
on cracking the code
of these two spectrums,

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:33.100 align:middle line:84%
allowing us to identify
what bits of physical matter

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.440 align:middle line:84%
can be used in
conjunction with which

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.140 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic
frequencies in order

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:41.590 align:middle line:84%
to create new
technological devices.

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Modern materialistic
science says

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:46.240 align:middle line:84%
that only these two
levels of physical matter

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.000 align:middle line:84%
and electromagnetic
radiations exist,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.900 align:middle line:84%
and there is nothing else
but them in all of creation.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.990 align:middle line:10%
The terrible consequence
of this short-sightedness

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:59.140 align:middle line:10%
of modern science is that it's
created a technology which

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.890 align:middle line:10%
can manipulate physical matter
and electromagnetic energy

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:07.300 align:middle line:10%
to a very high degree but with
absolutely no consideration

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:11.680 align:middle line:10%
of how this new technology
affects living beings.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:15.250 align:middle line:84%
The tragic consequence
is that in only 100 years

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:19.000 align:middle line:84%
our entire planet has been
catastrophically contaminated

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.960 align:middle line:84%
with chemical, biological,
and radiological toxins

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.440 align:middle line:84%
which now threaten
all life on Earth.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.540 align:middle line:84%
The solution is to
expand our science

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.090 align:middle line:84%
to include not just the
sub-physical and physical

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:33.400 align:middle line:84%
levels that it currently
has, but to add

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.760 align:middle line:84%
to them the level of vibrational
matrices of the vital life

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:41.070 align:middle line:84%
force, which create the physical
matter in the first place.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:43.740 align:middle line:84%
As identified by the
European Rosicrucian

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:46.110 align:middle line:84%
tradition and the work
of Rudolf Steiner,

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:49.600 align:middle line:84%
it is the vital life force
level above the physical

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.290 align:middle line:84%
which truly animates
and structures

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:54.810 align:middle line:90%
all the physical matter.

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:58.020 align:middle line:84%
These vital life forces
are faster than light.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:01.180 align:middle line:84%
So when they come into physical
matter and are used up,

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:04.560 align:middle line:84%
they then decay into slower
than light radiations.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.980 align:middle line:10%
In other words, they decay into
what Nikola Tesla referred to

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:12.750 align:middle line:10%
as the retarded hertzian waves
of the modern electromagnetic

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:14.430 align:middle line:10%
spectrum.

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Nikola Tesla referred to the
faster than light energies

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:21.240 align:middle line:84%
which would be the subject of a
more advanced future technology

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.450 align:middle line:90%
as being scalar waves.

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Just as our modern
life-destroying technology

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:29.940 align:middle line:84%
was based on breaking
the code of the spectrums

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.460 align:middle line:84%
of the physical and
sub-physical levels,

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.800 align:middle line:84%
the new life-supporting
technology

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:39.030 align:middle line:84%
must be based on the spectrum
of subtle vibrational forces

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:43.020 align:middle line:84%
which form matter and
which sustain health.

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:47.610 align:middle line:84%
We can call this the universal
vibrational spectrum.

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:50.820 align:middle line:84%
The good news is that this
universal vibrational spectrum

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.580 align:middle line:84%
has already been
identified in Europe.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And new types of tools
to detect and identify

00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:00.870 align:middle line:84%
all of its bands of energy
have already been created.

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:04.530 align:middle line:84%
The bad news is that the world
did not take notice of this.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And these fundamental European
breakthroughs from the 1930s

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:13.650 align:middle line:84%
were lost in the midst of the
catastrophe of World War II.

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:15.510 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient world,
there was a science

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:18.540 align:middle line:84%
of detecting the subtle energies
which create and sustain

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.330 align:middle line:84%
life and health, a
science which reached

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:26.240 align:middle line:84%
one of its highest peaks in the
ancient Egyptian civilization.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.670 align:middle line:84%
This science was taught
to the temple elite

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:31.520 align:middle line:84%
with its secrets often
hidden from public view

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.260 align:middle line:90%
to keep it from being misused.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.980 align:middle line:10%
We find throughout
ancient Egyptian artifacts

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:40.850 align:middle line:10%
and references many different
types of pendulums and rods

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:43.100 align:middle line:10%
which were used
as tools to detect

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:46.850 align:middle line:10%
or to project subtle energies.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:49.520 align:middle line:84%
However, modern Egyptology
understands nothing

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:53.810 align:middle line:84%
about these tools and simply
calls them ritual objects,

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:57.350 align:middle line:84%
or say that there's some
type of religious symbolism.

00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:00.560 align:middle line:84%
Today when we see these
types of rods and pendulums,

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.340 align:middle line:84%
we may think of modern systems
of mental dowsing, in which

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:07.310 align:middle line:84%
a person mentally programs
a pendulum or a rod

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:10.160 align:middle line:84%
to respond with certain
movements in response

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.940 align:middle line:84%
to a mental question which is
asked, one movement showing

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:18.410 align:middle line:84%
a no response, another movement
showing a yes response.

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Mental dowsing is a powerful
and valid modern system.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:25.100 align:middle line:84%
However, the original
vibrational temple science

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:28.070 align:middle line:84%
of ancient Egypt and other
great lost civilizations

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:31.790 align:middle line:84%
used vibrational tools
to detect and direct

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:35.060 align:middle line:84%
vibrations, different
types of energy,

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.700 align:middle line:84%
not to ask mental
questions, which

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.520 align:middle line:84%
is a modern modification
based on our highly

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.550 align:middle line:90%
mental modern culture.

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:47.000 align:middle line:10%
Particular tools and methods
to detect vibrational energies

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.280 align:middle line:10%
of this higher
level were developed

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:54.830 align:middle line:10%
by Chinese Feng Shui, Indian
Vastu, the Augurs of Italy,

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:57.680 align:middle line:10%
and many other traditions
around the world.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.170 align:middle line:84%
This original
vibrational science

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:03.020 align:middle line:84%
was linked to the capacity
of the human energy system

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:05.900 align:middle line:84%
to directly detect
vibrations which

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.470 align:middle line:84%
no purely physical
electromagnetic device can ever

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:10.470 align:middle line:90%
detect.

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:13.220 align:middle line:84%
To detect a particular
energy requires

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:17.390 align:middle line:84%
a detector of a similar
type, a similar quality.

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:20.090 align:middle line:84%
A basic metal box with
wires and electricity

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:21.980 align:middle line:84%
may be able to pick
up gross levels

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:24.090 align:middle line:90%
of electromagnetic waves.

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:27.590 align:middle line:84%
But it cannot pick up the
subtle vibrational waves,

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:29.900 align:middle line:90%
the vital life forces.

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.780 align:middle line:84%
That requires something
which itself is alive

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:37.430 align:middle line:84%
and has these vital forces,
such as the human energy field.

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:40.190 align:middle line:84%
As the materialistic
modern era advanced,

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:42.290 align:middle line:84%
many of the secrets of
the ancient traditions

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:44.840 align:middle line:90%
became lost or obscured.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.450 align:middle line:84%
In Europe, the Masons
who built the cathedrals

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:49.610 align:middle line:90%
cultivated the secret knowledge.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And separately, the Jesuits
within the Roman Catholic

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.770 align:middle line:84%
Church sought to collect
ancient knowledge

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:56.660 align:middle line:84%
from around the
world, particularly

00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:00.230 align:middle line:84%
from ancient Egypt, and take
it back to Rome and the Vatican

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:02.180 align:middle line:90%
Library.

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:04.820 align:middle line:84%
The Jesuits cultivated
in their own circles

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:06.890 align:middle line:84%
some of the ancient
vibrational methods

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.290 align:middle line:84%
which they rediscovered
in their research

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:11.570 align:middle line:84%
and which they then
taught to some priests

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:15.510 align:middle line:84%
and missionaries for them to
use for practical purposes.

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:18.290 align:middle line:84%
For example, a missionary
in a strange land

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:20.150 align:middle line:84%
could use these
vibrational techniques

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:24.320 align:middle line:84%
to find clean sources of water,
to differentiate poisonous

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.440 align:middle line:84%
from edible plants, and
to find medicinal herbs

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.060 align:middle line:90%
for any type of illness.

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:32.300 align:middle line:84%
We need to be clear, this is
not some conspiracy theory

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.090 align:middle line:84%
or fanciful modern
speculation of which

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:38.690 align:middle line:84%
there is so much rampant in
metaphysical circles today.

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:40.640 align:middle line:84%
This background was
in fact revealed

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.790 align:middle line:84%
by French-speaking
Catholic priests themselves

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:47.490 align:middle line:84%
in public texts which they
wrote in the early 1900s.

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:49.400 align:middle line:84%
The most famous of
these writers being

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Abbe Mermet from
Switzerland, who

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:53.990 align:middle line:84%
revealed many
practical vibrational

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:57.650 align:middle line:84%
techniques to the public in
his book titled in French,

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:01.710 align:middle line:84%
[SPEAKING FRENCH] or in
English, "How I work,"

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:03.800 align:middle line:84%
which then appeared
in multiple languages

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:07.100 align:middle line:84%
and was titled in English,
"Principles and Practice

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:09.260 align:middle line:90%
of Radiesthesia."

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Radiesthesia,
meaning the ability

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:15.230 align:middle line:84%
to detect subtle radiations,
became the modern name

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:19.640 align:middle line:84%
for the rebirth of these
ancient vibrational techniques.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Once these techniques were
made available to the public

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.200 align:middle line:84%
for the first time
through the writings

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.380 align:middle line:84%
of these French priests,
then scientists and doctors

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.390 align:middle line:84%
in France began to
use these techniques

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:31.730 align:middle line:90%
for their own research.

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:34.130 align:middle line:10%
French medical doctors
created the system

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:36.950 align:middle line:10%
of medical radiesthesia,
in which they

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:40.130 align:middle line:10%
were able to detect the
precise vibrational quality

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:44.760 align:middle line:10%
of any patient, what they called
their personal wavelength,

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:47.150 align:middle line:10%
which is as unique
to each individual

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:49.130 align:middle line:10%
as their fingerprints are.

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And then to use this to find
exactly where in their body

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:54.410 align:middle line:90%
specific problems existed.

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And then to find exactly which
vibrational sources the person

00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:01.670 align:middle line:84%
was exposed to which
created and fed the illness.

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And then to find which
vibrational sources could

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:07.520 align:middle line:90%
reverse or cure the illness.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Their work was tremendously
successful, soon

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.320 align:middle line:84%
being adopted by thousands
of medical doctors

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.470 align:middle line:90%
across Europe by the late 1930s.

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Large congresses were
held where doctors

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:21.440 align:middle line:84%
shared their new techniques
and successful applications

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:24.350 align:middle line:90%
for supposedly incurable cases.

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:27.530 align:middle line:84%
Because these powerful
vibrational methods are almost

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:30.410 align:middle line:84%
forgotten today, I
created an online course

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:32.630 align:middle line:84%
entitled Personal
Wavelength, which

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:35.540 align:middle line:84%
teaches the essential keys
to the medical radiesthesia

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:39.710 align:middle line:84%
techniques used by the
European doctors in the 1900s.

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:42.200 align:middle line:84%
While I make no medical
claims for this work,

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.900 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's important that
these hidden techniques are now

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:47.960 align:middle line:84%
available for everyone
to explore and to use

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.450 align:middle line:90%
to empower their own self-care.

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:53.960 align:middle line:10%
Louis Turenne was a professor
of radio wave engineering

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.660 align:middle line:10%
and an instructor to
the French military

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.790 align:middle line:10%
who knew that
humanity's understanding

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:01.250 align:middle line:10%
of the invisible waves
of energy around us

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:03.590 align:middle line:10%
was only in its infancy.

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:06.020 align:middle line:84%
He understood that just
as humanity did not even

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.510 align:middle line:84%
know of the existence
of radio waves

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:10.640 align:middle line:84%
until a mechanical
detector for them

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.850 align:middle line:84%
had been created,
that there were also

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:17.390 align:middle line:84%
a huge range of invisible waves
which affect health, energy,

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:20.390 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness, which are
too subtle to be picked up

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:23.420 align:middle line:84%
by standard
electromagnetic equipment.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.810 align:middle line:84%
To be able to detect and
map these invisible subtle

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:29.270 align:middle line:84%
vibrations for the
first time, Turenne

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:31.370 align:middle line:84%
realized that the
radiesthesia techniques

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:33.320 align:middle line:84%
from the French
priests could be used

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.230 align:middle line:90%
to accomplish this research.

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Turenne created a
scientific pendulum

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:40.400 align:middle line:84%
with magnetic needles
mounted to either side

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.320 align:middle line:90%
of a spherical body.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:45.620 align:middle line:84%
The direction of the compass
needles on the Turenne pendulum

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:49.400 align:middle line:84%
allowed the pendulum to detect
the movement of invisible waves

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.000 align:middle line:84%
which could not be detected
by standard electromagnetic

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.710 align:middle line:90%
equipment.

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Now that he could detect and
track these invisible life

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.660 align:middle line:84%
force energies for
the very first time,

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Turenne conducted
research to see

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:04.220 align:middle line:84%
how to identify
those energies which

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:09.390 align:middle line:84%
created health versus those that
would create illness and death.

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Turenne had discovered
an important method

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:14.940 align:middle line:84%
to start to identify the
invisible energies that

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.970 align:middle line:84%
harm the health of living
beings, which were completely

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:20.810 align:middle line:90%
unknown to us previously.

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:24.140 align:middle line:84%
With the new ability to test
the direction of wave movement

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:27.170 align:middle line:84%
as a rough guide to
toxicity, Turenne then

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:29.630 align:middle line:84%
needed to identify
the complete spectrum

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:32.000 align:middle line:84%
of all these invisible
energies which

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.420 align:middle line:84%
are too subtle to be picked
up by standard electromagnetic

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.280 align:middle line:90%
detectors.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.740 align:middle line:84%
Turenne created the
foundation of what

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:44.030 align:middle line:84%
we can call today the
universal vibrational spectrum.

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:47.240 align:middle line:10%
Using the principle
of angular refraction,

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.480 align:middle line:10%
just as in modern optics we know
that the angle of refraction

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.570 align:middle line:10%
of white light in a prism
determines the wavelength

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:57.170 align:middle line:10%
and the visible color of
an electromagnetic wave,

00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:59.960 align:middle line:10%
Turenne was able to
create pendulum detectors

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:04.460 align:middle line:10%
using various angles to
detect roughly 11 bands

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.890 align:middle line:10%
of invisible life energies.

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:10.310 align:middle line:10%
At the ends of the spectrum
were black and white

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:13.850 align:middle line:10%
with indications that there was
some further mysterious 12th

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:18.800 align:middle line:10%
energy at this alpha and omega
point, the connected beginning

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.890 align:middle line:10%
and end points, which he
had first referred to as

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:26.110 align:middle line:10%
infra-black and infra-white.

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Turenne had now
created the foundation

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:32.822 align:middle line:84%
for the universal
vibrational spectrum.

00:29:32.822 --> 00:29:34.780 align:middle line:84%
It's important to understand
that although each

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.360 align:middle line:84%
of these bands are given
the names of colors

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.960 align:middle line:84%
in the original French
research, that visible color

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.720 align:middle line:84%
in light or physical
matter is only one

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:48.190 align:middle line:84%
way that these invisible
energies can manifest.

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:52.090 align:middle line:84%
As we will see in our next
episode with modern biogeometry

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:55.060 align:middle line:84%
from Egypt, each of
these vibrational bands

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:58.990 align:middle line:84%
can manifest as a
completely invisible wave.

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Or they can manifest
as a shape in geometry.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Or they can manifest as a sound,
or in a numerical sequence,

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:12.010 align:middle line:84%
or as an angle, or as a
proportion, et cetera.

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Color, shape, sound,
number, angle, proportion

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:19.870 align:middle line:84%
are all quality scales through
which vibrational powers can

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:22.570 align:middle line:84%
manifest for
practical application,

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:26.890 align:middle line:84%
in addition to their appearing
as simply invisible energy

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:28.780 align:middle line:90%
waves.

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Turenne then conducted
decades of amazing research

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:34.870 align:middle line:84%
which has been almost
forgotten today.

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:36.940 align:middle line:84%
For example, he
solved the mystery

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:39.310 align:middle line:84%
of why some temple
locations in Egypt

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:43.150 align:middle line:84%
had the hieroglyphs on
their temple walls defaced.

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:46.480 align:middle line:84%
He showed in his
remarkable 1943 book

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:50.530 align:middle line:84%
whose title in French translates
to English as "The Scientific

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:54.100 align:middle line:84%
Control of All
Natural Waves," he

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.170 align:middle line:84%
showed that the
hieroglyphs when they

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:58.330 align:middle line:84%
were complete on
the temple walls

00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:02.770 align:middle line:84%
with their boundaries intact
emanated a powerful energy wave

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:05.320 align:middle line:90%
from the shape of a hieroglyph.

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.420 align:middle line:10%
However, if the
boundary of the shape

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:11.080 align:middle line:10%
was cut, as was done in some
later time with a chisel

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.870 align:middle line:10%
as seen here, then
the hieroglyphs

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:17.020 align:middle line:10%
became energetically
neutralized and were no longer

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.240 align:middle line:10%
effective energetically.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.790 align:middle line:84%
He had discovered that
hieroglyphs actually create

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:24.610 align:middle line:84%
energy emanations
and were not simply

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:27.640 align:middle line:90%
for abstract communication.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.740 align:middle line:10%
Turenne discovered
that the reason

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:32.140 align:middle line:10%
for the tradition that
an upright cross was

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:35.890 align:middle line:10%
a sign of beneficial spiritual
powers and an inverted

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:38.500 align:middle line:10%
cross a sign of
harmful powers was

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.870 align:middle line:10%
that when the form of
the cross is inverted,

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:44.200 align:middle line:10%
it reverses its
energetic spin direction

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:49.240 align:middle line:10%
and thereby changes its effect
on living energy fields.

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.670 align:middle line:10%
Turenne also found a
hidden energetic reason

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:55.720 align:middle line:10%
why seven was considered
a holy or a sacred number.

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:59.200 align:middle line:10%
He found that if he carefully
drew a circular spiral

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:02.800 align:middle line:10%
from the outside to the
inside with exactly seven

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:07.510 align:middle line:10%
full clockwise turns, it would
then emanate a powerful carrier

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:10.840 align:middle line:10%
wave energy that
could broadcast energy

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.900 align:middle line:10%
from one location to another.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Turenne showed a wide
range of energy effects

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:19.780 align:middle line:84%
from artifacts gathered
from China, India,

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.150 align:middle line:84%
and other classical
traditions in addition

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:26.110 align:middle line:84%
to Egypt, showing the level
of hidden energy science found

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:28.360 align:middle line:84%
in these ancient
traditions that can now

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:32.470 align:middle line:84%
be rediscovered through
vibrational radiesthesia.

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Other French
researchers followed up

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:36.910 align:middle line:84%
on Turenne's early
discoveries, completing

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:41.080 align:middle line:84%
the vibrational
spectrum around 1933.

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Chaumery and de Bélizal were
two researchers who investigated

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:49.270 align:middle line:84%
further the mysterious
energies in between the ends

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:54.130 align:middle line:84%
of Turenne's fundamental
vibrational spectrum.

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:57.160 align:middle line:84%
By moving the spectrum
from linear to circular,

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Chaumery and de Bélizal were
able to discover a great

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:04.540 align:middle line:84%
spiritual secret hidden for
thousands of years but known

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:08.530 align:middle line:84%
to the ancient Egyptians
and other great cultures--

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:11.650 align:middle line:84%
a very powerful
invisible energy which

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:13.840 align:middle line:84%
completes the
vibrational spectrum

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:17.530 align:middle line:84%
between the black
and white bands.

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:21.460 align:middle line:84%
This powerful wave appears
opposite the green band energy

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:25.240 align:middle line:84%
in a circular configuration,
leading to their naming

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:29.190 align:middle line:84%
this mysterious
energy negative green.

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:31.410 align:middle line:90%
This name led to some confusion.

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Because in reality, it's a
completely invisible energy

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.810 align:middle line:84%
which never appears
as a green color.

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:41.520 align:middle line:84%
It's the polar opposite of the
visible green energy quality.

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.190 align:middle line:84%
If negative green were to
appear to visible sight,

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:46.230 align:middle line:90%
it would appear as gray.

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:middle line:84%
The same as colorblind
people today

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.090 align:middle line:84%
can only see colors
as shades of gray,

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:52.830 align:middle line:84%
because humanity
does not yet have

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:58.080 align:middle line:84%
a sense organ to perceive the
true nature of negative green.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:01.410 align:middle line:84%
Chaumery and de Bélizal
were fascinated by the power

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:04.830 align:middle line:84%
of the invisible negative
green wave and how it was used

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:05.730 align:middle line:90%
in ancient Egypt.

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:09.179 align:middle line:84%
They found it had the power to
penetrate thicknesses of lead

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:12.150 align:middle line:84%
that cannot be
penetrated by X-rays.

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Negative green has the
ability to penetrate straight

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.320 align:middle line:84%
through solid matter, similar
to neutrinos in modern physics,

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.300 align:middle line:84%
which pass straight
through matter and straight

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.340 align:middle line:90%
through the Earth itself.

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:26.429 align:middle line:84%
Negative green is a
carrier wave on which

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:28.980 align:middle line:84%
other vibrational
powers can be carried,

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:33.780 align:middle line:84%
similar to music or speech
being carried on a radio wave.

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Like every one of the 12 bands
of the vibrational spectrum,

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.110 align:middle line:84%
negative green has
both beneficial waves,

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:42.120 align:middle line:84%
which tend to
propagate horizontally,

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:45.900 align:middle line:84%
and detrimental waves, which
tend to propagate vertically

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:47.639 align:middle line:90%
within the band.

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:50.730 align:middle line:84%
The beneficial waves are
essential to all life.

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:55.230 align:middle line:84%
They are the conduction power
behind all life force itself.

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:57.660 align:middle line:84%
They may be the actual
energy described

00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:01.380 align:middle line:84%
in the Indian Vedic tradition
as the divine feminine moving

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:03.990 align:middle line:90%
force of God, the Shakti.

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:08.310 align:middle line:84%
Shakti is ultimate energy,
just as her consort Shiva

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:11.070 align:middle line:90%
is ultimate consciousness.

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:13.530 align:middle line:84%
The detrimental waves
of negative green

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:17.280 align:middle line:84%
are the waves which
literally bring death.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Chaumery and de Bélizal found
that the ancient Egyptians were

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:23.430 align:middle line:84%
the masters of this
hidden energy science.

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:27.420 align:middle line:84%
They found that the ankh is not
just an abstract symbol that

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:30.210 align:middle line:84%
means life, as we're
often told today.

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:33.930 align:middle line:84%
But rather, it's an actual
geometric energy projector

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:37.350 align:middle line:84%
designed to transmit beneficial
waves of negative green

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:38.880 align:middle line:90%
from its base.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.030 align:middle line:84%
The top of the ankh projects
the green energy quality,

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:44.700 align:middle line:84%
and the bottom projects
negative green.

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:48.120 align:middle line:90%
These are two opposite powers.

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.180 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Egypt, the beings
shown on the temple walls

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:56.070 align:middle line:84%
were called Netjers, meaning
the conscious forces of nature.

00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:58.560 align:middle line:84%
In old Egyptian
depictions, the Netjers

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.690 align:middle line:84%
are shown interacting
with human beings

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:03.120 align:middle line:84%
through geometric
forms, which are

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:06.060 align:middle line:90%
projectors of precise energies.

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:09.180 align:middle line:84%
In some depictions, the
Netjer is holding the base

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:12.720 align:middle line:84%
so that the top of the ankh is
held towards a person, which

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.800 align:middle line:84%
then projects the positive
green energy towards them, often

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.410 align:middle line:84%
projecting that ray into
the brain of a person

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:21.510 align:middle line:90%
through the sinus cavity.

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:24.270 align:middle line:84%
In other depictions,
the bottom of the ankh

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:28.570 align:middle line:84%
is used to project the
negative green wave.

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Chaumery and de Bélizal proved
and popularized a key discovery

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:36.730 align:middle line:84%
of French radiesthesia,
that geometric forms project

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:40.960 align:middle line:84%
powerful subtle energy waves
which they called shape-caused

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:42.310 align:middle line:90%
waves.

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:45.970 align:middle line:84%
With the rediscovery of the
complete universal vibrational

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:49.450 align:middle line:84%
spectrum, with new tools
to detect and differentiate

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:52.480 align:middle line:84%
all the different bands,
the different powers

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.420 align:middle line:84%
of these subtle energies,
the French researchers

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:58.240 align:middle line:84%
had reclaimed the
lost ancient energy

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:02.500 align:middle line:90%
science behind sacred geometry.

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:05.350 align:middle line:84%
De Bélizal noted that the
curse of the Pharaohs,

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:08.140 align:middle line:84%
which was linked to the
mysterious deaths of those who

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:10.540 align:middle line:84%
opened up the ancient
tombs in Egypt,

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:14.830 align:middle line:84%
was in fact linked to energetic
booby traps left to protect

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:19.120 align:middle line:84%
the tombs, often involving
projections of toxic negative

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.610 align:middle line:90%
green vibrations.

00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:25.630 align:middle line:84%
The waveform of Luxor was one
form which could apparently

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:28.420 align:middle line:84%
defend a person from the
vertical negative green

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:31.240 align:middle line:84%
concentrations which
were used to protect

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:34.270 align:middle line:90%
the ancient Egyptian tombs.

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:37.640 align:middle line:84%
De Bélizal analyzed the
shapes on a clay ring,

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:40.870 align:middle line:84%
which was discovered by a French
Egyptologist in the Valley

00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:42.160 align:middle line:90%
of the Kings.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.860 align:middle line:10%
As fate would have
it, that Egyptologist,

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:47.980 align:middle line:10%
the Marquis de Grande,
was the grandfather of de

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:49.716 align:middle line:10%
Bélizal's wife.

00:37:49.716 --> 00:37:53.950 align:middle line:10%
De Bélizal asserted that wearing
this ring was the secret of how

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:57.460 align:middle line:10%
the Egyptologist Howard
Carter survived the opening

00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:01.380 align:middle line:10%
of the tomb of Tutankhamen,
which had an inscription

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.710 align:middle line:10%
at the entrance stating that
harm would befall anyone who

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:07.470 align:middle line:10%
violated the tomb.

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:10.290 align:middle line:84%
Soon after opening the
tomb, Carter's partner,

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Lord Carnarvon died from
a strange malady, followed

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.380 align:middle line:84%
by the deaths of
around 18 other members

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:18.900 align:middle line:84%
of the team in
strange circumstances

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:21.630 align:middle line:90%
within two years of the opening.

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:26.340 align:middle line:84%
De Bélizal named the shapes on
the ring the waveform of Luxor,

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:29.880 align:middle line:84%
which created a powerful
protective shape-caused wave.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And the ring itself
became popularly known

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:33.810 align:middle line:90%
as the Atlantis ring.

00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:36.680 align:middle line:90%


00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:39.950 align:middle line:84%
After conducting vibrational
analysis of the ring,

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:43.040 align:middle line:84%
de Bélizal created a straight
bar version of the shapes

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:47.420 align:middle line:84%
on the ring to create powerful
protective forces against toxic

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:51.230 align:middle line:84%
vertical wave of negative
green concentrations.

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And he then termed the
straight bar version

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:56.690 align:middle line:90%
the harmonizer of Luxor.

00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:59.630 align:middle line:10%
One of the major discoveries
which Chaumery and de Bélizal

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:03.260 align:middle line:10%
popularized in their first
book from the 1930s was that

00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:08.330 align:middle line:10%
hemisphere or pyramid forms both
project strong concentrations

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:10.970 align:middle line:10%
of negative green
from their base.

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:12.770 align:middle line:10%
Whether the projections
are primarily

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:15.740 align:middle line:10%
beneficial or detrimental
types of negative green

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:20.540 align:middle line:10%
depends on design aspects and
the material that it's made of.

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:24.320 align:middle line:10%
Just as a hemisphere is a
sphere cut in half and its base

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:27.440 align:middle line:10%
then projects negative
green, so a pyramid

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.910 align:middle line:10%
is an octahedron cut in half.

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And the base of
the pyramid is also

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:34.730 align:middle line:90%
a negative green projector.

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:39.750 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what became known in
the 1960s as pyramid power is,

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:44.330 align:middle line:84%
in fact, the mysterious
ancient negative green wave.

00:39:44.330 --> 00:39:47.210 align:middle line:84%
French discoveries in
vibrational radiesthesia

00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:50.360 align:middle line:84%
rediscovered the real nature
of this mysterious energy

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:54.170 align:middle line:84%
within the complete context
of the universal vibrational

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:58.130 align:middle line:84%
spectrum after thousands of
years of this knowledge being

00:39:58.130 --> 00:39:59.960 align:middle line:90%
kept secret.

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Chaumery and de Bélizal did
extensive research into the use

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:08.030 align:middle line:84%
of hemisphere shapes to project
negative green as is shown

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:11.600 align:middle line:84%
on the cover of their
book from the 1930s.

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.690 align:middle line:84%
So it was with the
discovery in the early 1930s

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:18.740 align:middle line:84%
of negative green as the missing
band between black and white

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:23.070 align:middle line:84%
that the universal vibrational
spectrum was completed.

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:25.970 align:middle line:84%
This is the full spectrum
for the vital life force

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:30.230 align:middle line:84%
level above the physical plane,
just as the periodic table

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:33.220 align:middle line:84%
is the spectrum of
all physical matter.

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:36.880 align:middle line:84%
With the identification of
this full etheric spectrum,

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:40.750 align:middle line:84%
a new age of vibrational science
and healing breakthroughs

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:43.630 align:middle line:90%
has now become possible.

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Just as modern
physical science can

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:49.840 align:middle line:84%
perform electromagnetic spectral
analysis of periodic table

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:53.860 align:middle line:84%
elements, so the universal
vibrational spectrum

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:56.650 align:middle line:84%
can detect all the
subtle energy components

00:40:56.650 --> 00:41:01.150 align:middle line:90%
of any person, place, or thing.

science reclaimed by the
French radiesthesists

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:25.630 align:middle line:10%

modern energy science
of biogeometry.
