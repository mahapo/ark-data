>> Welcome.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.830 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Dr.
Robert J. Gilbert.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.490 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we will
explore four major secrets

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.525 align:middle line:10%
of sacred geometry.

00:00:30.525 --> 00:00:33.930 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.590 align:middle line:84%
These secrets will guide us into
learning a very powerful method

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.640 align:middle line:84%
which can activate any energy
center in your body or energy

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.560 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.380 align:middle line:84%
You'll learn in this episode
how to apply this method

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.200 align:middle line:84%
to activate the most
important energy

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.770 align:middle line:84%
center in the human head, what
in the Himalayan tradition

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.120 align:middle line:90%
is called the Cave of Brahma.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.390 align:middle line:10%
This exploration will lead
us into the highest sources

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.620 align:middle line:10%
of inspiration and
spiritual visions

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.540 align:middle line:10%
and into the many levels of
our multidimensional world.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Our first great secret
of sacred geometry

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.610 align:middle line:84%
reveals the true source of
all physical manifestation.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.310 align:middle line:84%
This secret is that
sacred geometry patterns

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.780 align:middle line:84%
are, in reality, thought forms
in the mind of God, which

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.735 align:middle line:84%
become the divine blueprints
for all of creation.

00:01:27.735 --> 00:01:31.460 align:middle line:90%


00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.800 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with an
important development

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.000 align:middle line:84%
in human spiritual
evolution, that large numbers

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.390 align:middle line:84%
of human beings are
increasingly experiencing

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.390 align:middle line:84%
inner visions of
the sacred geometry

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.790 align:middle line:84%
patterns behind
the physical plane,

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.160 align:middle line:84%
along with visions
of the higher worlds

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.700 align:middle line:84%
which interact
with the physical.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.470 align:middle line:84%
These sacred geometry
thought forms,

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.140 align:middle line:84%
which more and more
people are experiencing,

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.250 align:middle line:84%
are, in actuality, packets
of divine consciousness,

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.240 align:middle line:84%
holding inside of them pure
structural patterns which then

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.330 align:middle line:84%
move down from the
higher plains to manifest

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.090 align:middle line:90%
on every level of creation.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.190 align:middle line:84%
These sacred
geometric visions can

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.100 align:middle line:84%
come whenever we
release our contracted

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.720 align:middle line:84%
perception of the physical world
and expand into deeper levels

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.150 align:middle line:90%
of awareness.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.520 align:middle line:84%
In my 30 years of
publicly teaching

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.460 align:middle line:84%
sacred geometry,
in every class, I

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.310 align:middle line:84%
would have students tell me
that the pattern I had just

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.610 align:middle line:84%
taught them was one that
they had seen before.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Students told me they had
seen the pattern internally,

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.300 align:middle line:84%
in a dream, in a
vision, in an ayahuasca

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.500 align:middle line:84%
journey, or other
psychotropic experience,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.310 align:middle line:84%
or in a transmission
from a spiritual teacher.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.440 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, they
had been taught

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.660 align:middle line:84%
a specific sacred
geometry pattern

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.960 align:middle line:84%
as a private secret of a
tradition into which they

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.840 align:middle line:84%
received initiation, being told
they could never mention it

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.650 align:middle line:84%
to anyone outside the tradition,
and then being astonished when

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.020 align:middle line:84%
they found out in my
class that it was actually

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.400 align:middle line:84%
a part of the complete sacred
geometry pattern language known

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.190 align:middle line:90%
to multiple traditions.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Ancient traditions knew that
these sacred geometry patterns,

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.330 align:middle line:84%
which underlie all of
creation, are in reality,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.360 align:middle line:84%
in their deepest
essence, thought forms

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.485 align:middle line:90%
from the mind of God.

00:03:27.485 --> 00:03:30.260 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.440 align:middle line:84%
So our visions of these
sacred geometry patterns

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.460 align:middle line:84%
can at their highest level
mean a literal communion

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.260 align:middle line:84%
of our human mind
with the divine mind.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.910 align:middle line:84%
This experience can transform
our deepest sense of ourselves

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.840 align:middle line:84%
and of what our true
potential really is.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.390 align:middle line:10%
This idea, that the
basis of creation

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.360 align:middle line:10%
is sacred geometric
patterns, is related

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.240 align:middle line:10%
to the findings of some
modern physicists, who

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.430 align:middle line:10%
say that the evidence
in modern physics

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.890 align:middle line:10%
shows that the essence
of all creation

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.290 align:middle line:10%
is not physical matter,
but consciousness.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.600 align:middle line:84%
A key aspect of
consciousness being

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.820 align:middle line:84%
the foundation of all existence
is that light and consciousness

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.570 align:middle line:90%
are the exact same thing.

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.420 align:middle line:84%
This is embedded in
Genesis, with creation

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.230 align:middle line:84%
beginning with the statement,
"Let there be light."

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Modern physics says that
everything is fundamentally

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.800 align:middle line:84%
energy and that light exists
both as a physical particle

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.260 align:middle line:90%
and as an energy wave.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.650 align:middle line:10%
Light is the fundamental
constant of nature,

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.880 align:middle line:10%
linking the concepts of
physical mass and energy

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.120 align:middle line:10%
together in the
famous E equals MC

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.850 align:middle line:10%
squared equation of Einstein.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Light sets the speed limit
for the physical plane.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Modern physics says that
nothing in the physical world

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.460 align:middle line:84%
can travel faster than
the speed of light.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.990 align:middle line:84%
This has all led to the concept
that everything physical is

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.130 align:middle line:84%
actually made of light and
that physical matter is simply

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:12.560 align:middle line:84%
light energy in a specific
state of materialization.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.810 align:middle line:84%
Ancient traditions
knew that when

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.330 align:middle line:84%
consciousness is
experienced externally,

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.970 align:middle line:90%
it appears as light.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And when light appears
internally, inside of us,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.020 align:middle line:84%
we experience it
as consciousness.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.180 align:middle line:84%
This is why auras
of brilliant light

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.210 align:middle line:84%
are always shown in
classical traditions

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.930 align:middle line:84%
around great initiates,
either just around their head,

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.270 align:middle line:84%
with the activation of
their consciousness,

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.620 align:middle line:84%
or around their entire
body and energy field,

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.720 align:middle line:84%
with higher levels of initiation
and self-transformation.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.310 align:middle line:84%
This brings us to
what we might call

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.750 align:middle line:84%
the first letter in the alphabet
of sacred geometry forms

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.490 align:middle line:90%
which create the world.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.430 align:middle line:84%
This is the ancient
symbol of the point

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.270 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the circle.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.970 align:middle line:84%
This was the hieroglyph for the
spiritual being of the sun, Ra,

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:13.340 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Egypt, and became the
image for the sun in astrology.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.810 align:middle line:84%
Just as creation
comes from light,

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.900 align:middle line:84%
the source of light and life in
our earthly lives is the sun.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:26.540 align:middle line:84%
This same symbol is used as
the sign for gold in alchemy.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Ancient traditions
understood gold

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.480 align:middle line:84%
to be a physical crystallization
of the same energy

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.200 align:middle line:90%
quality as in sunlight.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.830 align:middle line:10%
This pattern is also the sign
for the Godhead, the source

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.130 align:middle line:10%
of creation in both the
Rosicrucian and Masonic

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.510 align:middle line:10%
traditions, as
seen in this image,

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.690 align:middle line:10%
based on the work of the
Rosicrucian initiate Rudolf

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.980 align:middle line:10%
Steiner.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:57.630 align:middle line:84%
The Godhead is the divine unity,
the original unified field

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.880 align:middle line:90%
where all is one.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.650 align:middle line:84%
The macrocosm is
the higher world

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.950 align:middle line:90%
which emerges from that unity.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.890 align:middle line:84%
The macrocosm contains
the Godhead broken up

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:13.140 align:middle line:84%
into discrete pieces, into a
multitude of spiritual beings,

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.010 align:middle line:90%
worlds, and creative processes.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:21.390 align:middle line:10%
The microcosm contains that
same totality of the Godhead,

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.000 align:middle line:10%
but broken up into
pieces of denser,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.960 align:middle line:10%
smaller levels of
manifestation, reaching down

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:33.810 align:middle line:10%
to the vital energy, physical,
and electromagnetic levels.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.050 align:middle line:84%
We will see in a future
episode that the hexagram

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.670 align:middle line:84%
of the macrocosm and the
pentagram of the microcosm

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.190 align:middle line:84%
are sacred geometry
keys to unlocking

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.670 align:middle line:84%
two essential levels
of every human being,

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:53.010 align:middle line:84%
the astral body of consciousness
and the etheric or chronic body

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.410 align:middle line:90%
of vital energy.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:59.160 align:middle line:84%
These are also key parts of
the Merkaba, the human soul

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.780 align:middle line:90%
vehicle.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.520 align:middle line:84%
We have to switch
our understanding

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.490 align:middle line:84%
of sacred geometry
from being static forms

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:08.940 align:middle line:84%
to instead focus on
the living, dynamically

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.375 align:middle line:84%
vibrating energy fields
which create these forms.

00:08:12.375 --> 00:08:16.510 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.370 align:middle line:84%
When dealing with
sacred geometry forms

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.830 align:middle line:84%
like the point in the
center of the circle,

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:24.640 align:middle line:84%
think of these forms as being
similar to electronic circuit

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.750 align:middle line:84%
diagrams, showing energy
patterns which we can directly

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.570 align:middle line:90%
apply for practical purposes.

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:33.490 align:middle line:84%
The point in the
center of the circle

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.710 align:middle line:90%
is a two-dimensional image.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.650 align:middle line:84%
It becomes in three
dimensions the point

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:42.340 align:middle line:84%
in the center of the
sphere of creation,

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.130 align:middle line:84%
with dynamic movement
between the center

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:48.820 align:middle line:84%
and the boundary of
creation within the sphere.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:52.060 align:middle line:84%
In modern physics, the
so-called Big Bang Theory

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:56.290 align:middle line:84%
is misunderstood by most
of the general public.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:09:00.160 align:middle line:84%
The theory does not say that
some unknown explosion filled

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.810 align:middle line:84%
up an already existing space
and time with physical things.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.110 align:middle line:84%
Rather, it says that an
original outward movement

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:11.980 align:middle line:84%
from a zero-dimensional
point, the singularity,

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:16.450 align:middle line:84%
created space and time
through the outward expansion

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:19.420 align:middle line:84%
of the point, which
created an expanding

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:24.430 align:middle line:84%
sphere of the three-dimensional
physical world that we live in.

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:27.460 align:middle line:84%
In other words, a sacred
geometric movement

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.370 align:middle line:84%
from the point to the
surrounding sphere

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:34.780 align:middle line:84%
is the foundation of all
creation in modern physics.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:37.240 align:middle line:84%
The concept that
the geometric center

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.810 align:middle line:84%
is the source of all creation
and is a literal gateway

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:45.640 align:middle line:84%
to the divine plane is found in
classical spiritual traditions.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:49.180 align:middle line:84%
It is prominent in the
Indian tradition as the Bindu

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:53.620 align:middle line:84%
point of divine light,
found in the exact center

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:59.170 align:middle line:84%
of Indian Yantras, of the
mandalas of Eastern traditions,

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and sacred geometric
forms in general.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:08.080 align:middle line:10%
In modern times, Dr. Ibrahim
Karim of Cairo, Egypt

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.770 align:middle line:10%
has demonstrated that there
is a powerful, subtle energy

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:15.820 align:middle line:10%
quality that is literally
present in the center

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.190 align:middle line:10%
of all geometric forms.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:20.230 align:middle line:84%
This powerful
energy of the center

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:23.710 align:middle line:84%
appears in both two-dimensional
geometric drawings

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:27.040 align:middle line:90%
and in three-dimensional forms.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.200 align:middle line:84%
As long as the
boundary information

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.320 align:middle line:84%
of the geometric form
is present in space,

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:37.050 align:middle line:84%
like a conducting wire
in an electrical circuit,

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:40.170 align:middle line:84%
this subtle energy
appears in the center

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.300 align:middle line:90%
of the geometric form.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:47.410 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Karim developed methods
to directly detect and apply

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.200 align:middle line:10%
this powerful subtle
energy of the center,

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.020 align:middle line:10%
leading to the creation
of the new energy science

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:57.600 align:middle line:10%
called biogeometry, the
subtle energy quality

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.280 align:middle line:10%
from the geometric center.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.470 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Karim was able
to demonstrate

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:05.550 align:middle line:10%
replicable biological
effects on living beings

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:09.360 align:middle line:10%
at the Egyptian
National Research Center

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.540 align:middle line:10%
and in multiple international
university and medical studies.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.630 align:middle line:10%
Classical traditions
described the act of creation

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.600 align:middle line:10%
from the center as moving
through multiple levels

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.800 align:middle line:10%
of densification, which are
referred to as spiritual planes

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.740 align:middle line:10%
or as the planes of nature.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.960 align:middle line:84%
The initial
zero-dimensional point

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.880 align:middle line:84%
of creation, which physics calls
the singularity, in metaphysics

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.640 align:middle line:90%
is known as the divine plane.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.280 align:middle line:84%
This point of the
divine plane is the key

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.940 align:middle line:84%
to the unified field,
beyond any polarity

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:48.350 align:middle line:84%
which exists in lower
worlds of manifestation.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim has created a new
multidimensional wave model,

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.940 align:middle line:84%
describing the different
planes of manifestation

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.640 align:middle line:84%
and showing which
geometric shapes are

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.670 align:middle line:90%
in resonance with each plane.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:04.640 align:middle line:10%
In practical biogeometry
applications,

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.010 align:middle line:10%
these shapes can
act like antennas

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:11.570 align:middle line:10%
to focus on a specific plane
to either detect and analyze

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:17.880 align:middle line:10%
their energy or to direct
energy to or from that plane.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:22.050 align:middle line:84%
The highest plane, the
divine, manifests its energy

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:24.300 align:middle line:84%
through the
zero-dimensional point,

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:28.980 align:middle line:84%
which manifests in the center
of all geometric forms.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.340 align:middle line:10%
The circle and sphere, the
perfect balanced containers

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:36.120 align:middle line:10%
for creation, resonate
with the physical plane,

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:40.020 align:middle line:10%
where vibrations
crystallize into matter.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.090 align:middle line:84%
When we connect the
highest and the lowest

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:45.210 align:middle line:84%
planes in Dr. Karim's
model, we see the point

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.760 align:middle line:84%
in the center of the
circle for what it really

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.810 align:middle line:84%
is, the divine unity
plane in the center

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:54.810 align:middle line:84%
of the physical
world of creation.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.060 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim's discovery
is connected

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.210 align:middle line:90%
to other scientific discoveries.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Recent experiments using laser
light to create cavitations

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.710 align:middle line:84%
within water, which are
empty spheres or bubbles,

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.830 align:middle line:84%
have shown incredible effects
which cannot be explained

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.690 align:middle line:90%
by modern science.

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:15.300 align:middle line:84%
When this water
bubble collapses,

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.390 align:middle line:84%
it releases both
light and sound,

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:22.620 align:middle line:84%
a phenomenon known
as sonoluminescence.

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.590 align:middle line:84%
The instant the water
bubble collapses, it also

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:28.980 align:middle line:84%
releases a tremendous
amount of excess energy.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:34.920 align:middle line:84%
In one experiment, when linked
to a pump with 840 watts input,

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:41.490 align:middle line:84%
it produced 2,800 watts of
power, an increase of over 300%

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:46.650 align:middle line:84%
of the input energy, considered
impossible in modern physics,

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:50.340 align:middle line:84%
but explained in research
papers as a possible release

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:54.180 align:middle line:84%
of hidden energy from
the quantum vacuum, which

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.850 align:middle line:84%
some people call
zero-point energy.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:59.220 align:middle line:84%
Studies of the
collapsing water cavity

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:03.420 align:middle line:84%
have found that this collapse
creates for a millisecond heat

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.210 align:middle line:90%
of over 5,000 Kelvin.

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:11.160 align:middle line:84%
The surface of the
sun is 5,800 Kelvin.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.640 align:middle line:10%
Just as Dr. Karim's work
shows a subtle energy which

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:18.360 align:middle line:10%
affects biological life coming
from the center of the sphere

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.890 align:middle line:10%
and all geometric forms, so
sonoluminescence research

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:25.680 align:middle line:10%
proves massive
millisecond releases

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:31.320 align:middle line:10%
from the center of collapsing
spherical structures in water.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.410 align:middle line:84%
So we have now explored
the first secret,

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:36.020 align:middle line:84%
how the point in the
center of the circle image

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:40.220 align:middle line:84%
is a packed thought form
in the mind of God, which

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.070 align:middle line:84%
holds encoded
information about how

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:48.470 align:middle line:84%
the divine geometric center, the
singularity, the unified field

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:53.600 align:middle line:84%
manifests the sphere
of physical creation.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.510 align:middle line:84%
We now come to a
second great secret

00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:00.320 align:middle line:84%
of sacred geometry, which is
that every human being can

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.730 align:middle line:84%
develop the ability to
perceive, create, and send

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:09.320 align:middle line:84%
these divine pact thought
forms of sacred geometry.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.390 align:middle line:84%
The precise methods
of how to do this

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:14.030 align:middle line:84%
have been hidden in
closed initiation

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:17.540 align:middle line:90%
circles for thousands of years.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:20.060 align:middle line:84%
In the Kabbalah,
the mind of God is

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:24.560 align:middle line:84%
described as an ocean of fire,
which is pure consciousness.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.880 align:middle line:10%
Every human being receives a
spark from this ocean of fire.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And this divine spark becomes
our immortal spirit core,

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:38.900 align:middle line:84%
our microcosmic part of
the one universal being.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:43.820 align:middle line:84%
This flame of our higher spirit
core ignites above our head

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.300 align:middle line:84%
during advanced forms
of spiritual initiation.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.490 align:middle line:84%
This is seen in the
Indian tradition

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.950 align:middle line:84%
with the flame
appearing above the head

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:55.490 align:middle line:84%
when a person
becomes twice born.

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And in Christianity, it
is seen in the flames

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.170 align:middle line:84%
above the heads
of the disciples,

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:04.520 align:middle line:84%
led by Mary Magdalene
at Pentecost.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.680 align:middle line:84%
In the Western
spiritual tradition,

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:11.060 align:middle line:84%
it is said that humanity is
the microcosm of the macrocosm

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.790 align:middle line:84%
and that we are the
crown of creation.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:16.760 align:middle line:84%
This means that every
human being has within them

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:21.050 align:middle line:84%
all the planes of creation,
all the powers of the Godhead,

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:27.080 align:middle line:84%
but in a latent and sleeping
form, which must be awakened.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:31.590 align:middle line:84%
This is a process of
illumination, in other words,

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:34.460 align:middle line:84%
increasing our
internal light, which

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:37.190 align:middle line:84%
we have seen as the
external manifestation

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:40.320 align:middle line:90%
of divine consciousness itself.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.950 align:middle line:84%
We have this incredible
slumbering potential

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:46.010 align:middle line:84%
because we are a direct
emanation of the Godhead,

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.160 align:middle line:84%
reduced in scale to
the microcosmic level,

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.680 align:middle line:84%
but with all the inherent
qualities and powers

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.470 align:middle line:90%
of the divine.

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:57.440 align:middle line:84%
The law of attraction, that you
will attract to yourself what

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.330 align:middle line:84%
you create in your
consciousness,

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.570 align:middle line:84%
is an example of modern
teachings on the power

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.450 align:middle line:90%
of the human mind to create.

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:09.109 align:middle line:10%
Science of mind and related
mental healing methods

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:11.210 align:middle line:10%
are examples of the
power of the human mind

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:15.079 align:middle line:10%
to heal and to create the
fundamental conditions

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:19.640 align:middle line:10%
of both illness and health,
depending on how skillfully we

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.500 align:middle line:10%
use our minds.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Many healers have
found that when

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:26.930 align:middle line:84%
they combine the clear,
focused creation of a thought

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:30.590 align:middle line:84%
form holding the desired state
of health with whatever method

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:34.560 align:middle line:84%
of healing they are applying
that the results improve,

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.470 align:middle line:90%
sometimes miraculously.

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:39.140 align:middle line:84%
This method is
very powerful when

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:43.310 align:middle line:84%
the light of our
consciousness, our mind power,

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:46.860 align:middle line:84%
is focused and coherent,
like a laser light.

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:50.450 align:middle line:84%
It is also strengthened when
beneficial spiritual beings

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and energies are lovingly
asked to help with the healing.

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:59.060 align:middle line:84%
This ability to perceive
or create thought forms

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:02.270 align:middle line:84%
at the higher
macrocosmic level is not

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:04.580 align:middle line:90%
based on thinking in words.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:09.680 align:middle line:84%
It is a higher-order thinking
in mental images, in sounds,

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.410 align:middle line:90%
in internal vibrational states.

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:14.720 align:middle line:84%
It is a thinking
that lives and plays

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:19.810 align:middle line:84%
in the vibrational essence
behind physical things.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.330 align:middle line:84%
In humanity's current
state of evolution,

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:24.940 align:middle line:84%
we break down
information into thinking

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.480 align:middle line:84%
in words, one word at
a time to represent

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.970 align:middle line:84%
every separate component
of the thought.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And then we slowly build
up larger concepts.

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.880 align:middle line:90%
But this is a very slow method.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.630 align:middle line:84%
But for angelic beings and more
advanced nonphysical beings,

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:45.370 align:middle line:84%
they can communicate through
an instantaneous transmission

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:50.110 align:middle line:84%
of a thought form containing
densely packed information.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:54.100 align:middle line:10%
We can use the terminology of
the late French medical doctor

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:58.120 align:middle line:10%
Samuel Sagan, founder of the
Modern Clairvision School,

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.840 align:middle line:10%
and call these higher-level
dense packets of consciousness

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.300 align:middle line:10%
packed thought forms.

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Every human being
has experienced

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:08.650 align:middle line:84%
this type of packed
thought form when

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.630 align:middle line:84%
we have been thinking
about some issue

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:13.000 align:middle line:84%
and then we get into
a relaxed state.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And then in this open state, we
receive a packed thought form

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.630 align:middle line:84%
in an instant, which
contains a huge amount

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:21.850 align:middle line:90%
of embedded information.

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:24.550 align:middle line:10%
This is the eureka moment.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:28.120 align:middle line:84%
This is the vision received
in the vision quest.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.490 align:middle line:84%
This is the
transmission received

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:34.450 align:middle line:84%
from the spiritual teacher
or an angelic being.

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:36.700 align:middle line:84%
This is the opening
of our awareness

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:41.920 align:middle line:84%
to merge with a higher
field of consciousness.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.870 align:middle line:84%
This secret of
packed thought forms

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:48.640 align:middle line:84%
brings us to our third secret,
that the sacred geometric

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.620 align:middle line:84%
structures of the
human energy body

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:55.810 align:middle line:84%
are keys to access our
latent spiritual powers.

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:57.850 align:middle line:84%
The difference between
an ordinary person

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and a spiritual adept
is that the latter

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:05.050 align:middle line:84%
has an energy field which is
highly activated and sacred

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:07.270 align:middle line:90%
geometrically structured.

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.610 align:middle line:84%
This makes available
to them higher states

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:12.520 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and
other powers, which

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.850 align:middle line:84%
appear magical to ordinary
people who are stuck

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:19.270 align:middle line:90%
in dense, toxic energy fields.

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:21.940 align:middle line:84%
For this reason,
hidden traditions

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:25.120 align:middle line:84%
of initiation around the
world train their students

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.510 align:middle line:84%
to understand where the
key spiritual centers are

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:32.230 align:middle line:84%
in their energy field
and how to activate them.

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:35.080 align:middle line:10%
This knowledge of the
sacred geometry structures

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.450 align:middle line:10%
of the human energy
system opens up

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:41.680 align:middle line:10%
a hidden world, which controls
health and illness, our mind

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:46.600 align:middle line:10%
and emotions, and our
latent spiritual potential.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.060 align:middle line:84%
There are many different
sacred geometry structures

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.260 align:middle line:90%
in our energy bodies.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:54.040 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge science in itself.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's clarify now just
a few structures which

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.520 align:middle line:84%
provide the background we
need for the powerful energy

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.770 align:middle line:84%
activation practice
you will learn

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:06.140 align:middle line:90%
at the end of this episode.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.630 align:middle line:84%
The primary energy
axis of our body

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:11.240 align:middle line:84%
is our central column
of energy, which

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.720 align:middle line:84%
runs in the absolute
vertical midline of our body,

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.510 align:middle line:84%
from the crown center
to the perineum

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:20.690 align:middle line:90%
at the base of the abdomen.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:23.210 align:middle line:84%
This central column
is not the same

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:27.050 align:middle line:84%
as the spinal energy circuit
described in many traditions.

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:30.890 align:middle line:84%
The very existence of this
midline central column

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:33.560 align:middle line:84%
was kept secret by
many traditions.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And it features prominently
in many of the most powerful

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:41.000 align:middle line:90%
spiritual activation practices.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.060 align:middle line:84%
In the exact center
of the central column

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:47.750 align:middle line:84%
runs a golden thread
of divine energy,

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:50.180 align:middle line:84%
which holds the
original unity energy

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:55.760 align:middle line:84%
of the divine plane inside the
central column in our body.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.780 align:middle line:84%
The seven primary energy
centers on our central column

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:04.670 align:middle line:84%
are known today by their Indian
name, chakras, meaning wheel,

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:07.880 align:middle line:84%
because they appear on the
front and back of the body

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.670 align:middle line:90%
as spinning vortices of energy.

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:14.780 align:middle line:84%
For the five chakras from the
third eye, or Ajna center,

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:18.110 align:middle line:84%
in the head, down to
the sexual chakra,

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:20.690 align:middle line:84%
the vortices that each
of these five chakras

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:23.970 align:middle line:84%
are paired up in the front
and the back of the body.

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.240 align:middle line:84%
The tips of the
two vortices meet

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:30.810 align:middle line:84%
at the golden thread in the very
center of the central column.

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:34.070 align:middle line:84%
The very top and bottom chakras
along the central channel

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:38.840 align:middle line:84%
in our body, the crown, or
Sahasrara center, and the base,

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.840 align:middle line:84%
or Muladhara center,
are connected together

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:45.140 align:middle line:84%
in their own vertical
vortex pair right

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:47.930 align:middle line:90%
on the central column itself.

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:50.210 align:middle line:84%
Our central column
continues down

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:53.090 align:middle line:84%
from the perineum at
the base of the abdomen

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:57.440 align:middle line:84%
to go between our legs and then
below our feet into the earth

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:01.160 align:middle line:84%
to ground us, and also continues
in the opposite direction,

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.790 align:middle line:84%
above the human head, to connect
us to higher consciousness

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:06.290 align:middle line:90%
centers.

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:08.450 align:middle line:84%
The energy centers
in our physical body

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:11.720 align:middle line:84%
can only hold a certain
intensity level of power.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.020 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, their
high level of voltage

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:18.290 align:middle line:84%
would burn out the smaller,
subtle energy circuits

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:22.780 align:middle line:84%
in the human body,
which are referred to as

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.960 align:middle line:90%
Nadis in the Indian tradition.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.930 align:middle line:84%
However, energy centers
in our subtle energy field

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:33.160 align:middle line:84%
outside of our physical body
can hold much higher energy

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.450 align:middle line:90%
intensity.

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:36.580 align:middle line:10%
This means that the
true energy centers

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.940 align:middle line:10%
we need to activate in
order to fully perceive,

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:44.260 align:middle line:10%
create, and transmit packed
thought forms are actually

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:48.490 align:middle line:10%
outside the physical body
in our greater energy field.

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:51.400 align:middle line:10%
However, before we can
activate these higher centers

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:54.670 align:middle line:10%
outside of the physical
body in a balanced way,

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:58.960 align:middle line:10%
we must activate and have
our spirit fully inhabit

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.270 align:middle line:10%
the key chakras in our body.

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:06.100 align:middle line:84%
In our modern culture, which is
very intellectual and thinking

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:09.880 align:middle line:84%
centric, the third eye chakra
is often the first chakra

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.750 align:middle line:90%
to be activated.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.230 align:middle line:84%
The third eye
chakra is named Ajna

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:20.380 align:middle line:84%
in Sanskrit, which means both
to perceive and to command.

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:23.740 align:middle line:84%
We can use the mind
power and light generated

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.500 align:middle line:84%
by the activated third
eye chakra to help

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.950 align:middle line:84%
activate all of the other
chakras in the body and energy

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:32.510 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:34.820 align:middle line:84%
The third eye chakra
is often misunderstood

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:37.490 align:middle line:84%
in Western circles to
be an energy center

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:41.510 align:middle line:84%
only in the front of the
head between the eyebrows.

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.190 align:middle line:84%
But as we have seen,
there's actually

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:47.600 align:middle line:84%
a front and back vortex pair
connecting at the third eye

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.920 align:middle line:90%
chakra.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:53.330 align:middle line:84%
In reality, the third eye is
a multidimensional geometric

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:58.010 align:middle line:84%
structure which runs as a
horizontal cylinder of energy

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:00.830 align:middle line:84%
from between the
eyebrows, connects

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:03.560 align:middle line:84%
to the central column in
the center of the head,

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:08.780 align:middle line:84%
and then continues through
to the back of your head.

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.990 align:middle line:84%
Just as the three
90-degree axes of space

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:14.850 align:middle line:84%
define the three
dimensional physical world,

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:17.720 align:middle line:84%
so it defines the sacred
space in the center

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.700 align:middle line:90%
of the third cylinder.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:24.050 align:middle line:84%
We can call the three axes
of space the cubical cross,

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:26.750 align:middle line:84%
because it is a cross
in three dimensions

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:29.060 align:middle line:90%
rather than just two dimensions.

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And this three-axis cross is
the structural infrastructure

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:36.770 align:middle line:84%
of the cube shape connected
to three-dimensional physical

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:38.710 align:middle line:90%
manifestation.

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:41.680 align:middle line:84%
The first axis of the
cubical cross in the head

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:45.130 align:middle line:84%
is the front-back
axis just mentioned,

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:47.890 align:middle line:84%
the horizontal cylinder
of energy running

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:51.250 align:middle line:84%
from between the eyebrows
to the area of the bump

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:53.740 align:middle line:90%
in the back of your head.

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:58.750 align:middle line:84%
The second 90-degree axis is
the top-down vertical line

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:02.420 align:middle line:84%
of the central column
we discussed previously.

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:06.650 align:middle line:84%
The third axis is the
side-to-side axis.

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.380 align:middle line:84%
This can be experienced
by putting your attention

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:12.320 align:middle line:84%
at the top of both
ears and becoming

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.140 align:middle line:84%
aware of an axis running
through the two brain

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:17.810 align:middle line:84%
hemispheres and
the corpus callosum

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:20.360 align:middle line:90%
between the hemispheres.

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:25.430 align:middle line:84%
Where these three axes meet in
the cubicle cross of our head

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:30.270 align:middle line:84%
is at the location of the
third ventricle of the brain.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:33.050 align:middle line:84%
This is a key spiritual
center in the human body

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:37.110 align:middle line:84%
called the Cave of Brahma
in the Indian tradition.

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:39.770 align:middle line:84%
This is a large open
area of the brain,

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:43.010 align:middle line:84%
through which flows the
cerebrospinal fluid,

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:45.560 align:middle line:90%
a true water of life.

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.710 align:middle line:84%
The cerebrospinal fluid
is a completely different

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:53.690 align:middle line:84%
bodily fluid system than the
blood or the lymph systems.

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:57.260 align:middle line:84%
It is literally a
liquid ocean which

00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:00.500 align:middle line:84%
pulses through the
human spine and brain,

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:05.540 align:middle line:84%
making life and movement
possible in the human body.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:08.390 align:middle line:84%
On the periphery of
the third ventricle,

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:11.660 align:middle line:84%
within this liquid ocean
are both the pineal

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:14.040 align:middle line:90%
and the pituitary glands.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.700 align:middle line:84%
These glands are understood
in classical traditions

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.430 align:middle line:84%
to be the key anchors
for spiritual development

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:21.350 align:middle line:90%
in the human body.

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:25.340 align:middle line:84%
In addition to their powerful
physical functions as sources

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:30.110 align:middle line:84%
of neurotransmitters and
body-regulating secretions,

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:33.560 align:middle line:84%
by activating the center
area of the cubical cross

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:37.490 align:middle line:84%
in the head, the Cave of
Brahma, your entire head system

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:41.060 align:middle line:84%
is both activated
and stabilized.

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Activating the
Cave of Brahma also

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:45.980 align:middle line:84%
ignites other energy
activations throughout

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:47.555 align:middle line:90%
the entire human energy field.

00:27:47.555 --> 00:27:50.180 align:middle line:90%


00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:53.150 align:middle line:84%
This brings us now
to a fourth secret,

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:56.330 align:middle line:84%
that these hidden practices
to activate the human energy

00:27:56.330 --> 00:28:00.980 align:middle line:84%
system do so by applying the
exact same sacred geometry

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:03.770 align:middle line:84%
patterns which
created our world.

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:07.070 align:middle line:84%
These key patterns move
energy in the major centers

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:10.850 align:middle line:84%
and circuits of the human
body, and thereby activate

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:13.430 align:middle line:90%
our full spiritual potential.

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:17.090 align:middle line:10%
This fourth secret connects
us to the energetic practice

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:19.400 align:middle line:10%
from our first
episode, where you

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.800 align:middle line:10%
learned to activate
the first segment

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:25.430 align:middle line:10%
of the powerful net energy
grid of the human body, which

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:29.600 align:middle line:10%
we call the grid of
life design, or GOLD.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.730 align:middle line:10%
In that first
practice, you learned

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:35.360 align:middle line:10%
to connect three powerful
energy centers around your head

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:39.230 align:middle line:10%
into a golden triangle,
which clears and elevates

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:42.120 align:middle line:10%
our consciousness
to higher levels.

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:45.980 align:middle line:84%
However, we performed that
practice in a very simple way,

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.960 align:middle line:84%
just putting our
attention on each

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.980 align:middle line:84%
of the three energy centers and
then mentally connecting them.

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:55.610 align:middle line:84%
We can now make these energy
activations much stronger

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:59.960 align:middle line:84%
and more effective by using
a precise sacred geometry

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.030 align:middle line:90%
pattern.

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:06.230 align:middle line:84%
This advanced method applies
the core manifestation pattern

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:09.680 align:middle line:84%
we explored earlier in
this episode, the point

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.570 align:middle line:84%
in the center of
the circle, which

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:14.150 align:middle line:84%
is the dynamic movement
from the divine unity

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:19.310 align:middle line:84%
center to the spherical boundary
of creation and back again.

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:22.670 align:middle line:84%
To apply this powerful pattern
for energy activations,

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:25.940 align:middle line:84%
we must first understand
that to live and survive

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:27.980 align:middle line:84%
in our external
three-dimensional physical

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.920 align:middle line:84%
world, we usually move
our attention outwards

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.920 align:middle line:84%
through our physical senses,
out into all directions

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.700 align:middle line:90%
in the world around us.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.120 align:middle line:84%
This is the movement
from the divine center

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:41.930 align:middle line:84%
to the surrounding sphere,
the external boundary.

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:45.890 align:middle line:84%
The first part of this
energy activation practice

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:49.820 align:middle line:84%
is to reverse the usual outward
movement of our attention

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:53.660 align:middle line:84%
back into the center
which it comes from.

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.450 align:middle line:84%
To put it very simply,
for physical awareness,

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:58.910 align:middle line:84%
we move outwards
to our periphery.

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:02.210 align:middle line:84%
For spiritual awareness, we
move the opposite direction,

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:04.820 align:middle line:90%
inwards, back into the center.

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:07.640 align:middle line:84%
By pulling our attention
back into the very center

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.160 align:middle line:84%
of any energy
center in the body,

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.680 align:middle line:84%
we move through layers
of the subtle body

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:16.340 align:middle line:84%
until we touch the divine
core at the center,

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:20.570 align:middle line:84%
the zero-dimensional
point, or zero point.

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:22.910 align:middle line:84%
By pulling our energy
and consciousness back

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:27.620 align:middle line:84%
into the divine center,
we activate that center.

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:31.250 align:middle line:84%
When activated, this center
then reverses the direction

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:33.590 align:middle line:84%
of movement so that
we switch again

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:37.610 align:middle line:84%
from going inward to now having
the activated energy center

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:41.640 align:middle line:84%
radiate outwards
in all directions.

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.840 align:middle line:84%
This natural countermovement
radiates from the center

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:49.040 align:middle line:84%
back out to the periphery, but
with a much stronger awakened

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:53.480 align:middle line:84%
power than before, now pouring
out from that energy center.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:57.110 align:middle line:84%
This creates in our energy
body an expanding sphere

00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:59.630 align:middle line:84%
radiating out from
that center point

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:04.470 align:middle line:84%
to create a radiant sun
around that energy center.

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:07.740 align:middle line:10%
The effect of this practice
is described and illustrated

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:11.430 align:middle line:10%
in virtually every world
tradition showing a radiant

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:14.640 align:middle line:10%
sun of energy around
a person's head

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:18.940 align:middle line:10%
or their heart or other
activated energy centers.

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:23.040 align:middle line:84%
This is the aura of an
awakened master, an initiate.

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.810 align:middle line:90%
This method has two stages.

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:28.500 align:middle line:84%
The first stage is
the inward movement

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.680 align:middle line:84%
of our energy and awareness
into the center point

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.810 align:middle line:90%
of an energy center.

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:36.120 align:middle line:10%
When our inwardly-moving
consciousness

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:39.900 align:middle line:10%
touches the divine
center, this profoundly

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:43.350 align:middle line:10%
activates the energy
center we are focusing on.

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:49.530 align:middle line:84%
This first stage we will call
zero-point centering, or ZPC

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:51.430 align:middle line:90%
for short.

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:54.390 align:middle line:84%
The second stage is
the outward expansion

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:58.230 align:middle line:84%
from the divine center
when it has been activated,

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:00.750 align:middle line:84%
turning that energy
center we are focusing on

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:03.630 align:middle line:90%
into our radiant sun.

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:08.550 align:middle line:84%
We will call the second
stage the radiance stage.

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:12.750 align:middle line:84%
What we are calling zero-point
centering and radiance are

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:15.900 align:middle line:84%
known by a variety of names
in different traditions--

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:21.570 align:middle line:84%
center and periphery, expansion
and contraction, involution

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:26.910 align:middle line:84%
and exvolution, divine
pulsation, et cetera.

00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, when most modern
systems teach this practice,

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:35.070 align:middle line:84%
they almost always teach
only one of the two phases,

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:38.160 align:middle line:84%
ignoring or dismissing
the other phase.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Eastern systems
tend to focus only

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:44.100 align:middle line:84%
on the inward movement, the
zero-point centering movement

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:48.030 align:middle line:84%
into the center, whereas Western
systems tend to focus only

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:50.730 align:middle line:84%
on the outward movement,
the radiance out

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:53.260 align:middle line:90%
into the surrounding sphere.

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.950 align:middle line:84%
This is a common
metaphysical problem.

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Many of our modern
spiritual practices

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:01.650 align:middle line:84%
are based on shattered
fragments of the whole,

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:04.980 align:middle line:84%
with key parts of the practice
missing because we don't

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:07.050 align:middle line:90%
understand the full pattern.

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Sacred geometry holds
the key to understanding

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.710 align:middle line:90%
the complete pattern.

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:16.920 align:middle line:84%
It is essential that both
parts of this practice,

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:19.920 align:middle line:84%
the inwards and
outwards movements,

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:23.940 align:middle line:84%
are used together to create
the optimal balanced activation

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:25.710 align:middle line:90%
of any energy center.

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:28.080 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it's like trying
to walk and move forward

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.480 align:middle line:84%
by only using one
foot or breathing

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:33.540 align:middle line:84%
by only using in
breath or out breath,

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:36.840 align:middle line:84%
which ignores the healthy
rhythm of alternating

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:40.350 align:middle line:84%
the opposite poles
of the practice.

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:42.870 align:middle line:84%
We can perform this practice
on any energy center

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:44.710 align:middle line:90%
in the body to activate it.

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:48.270 align:middle line:84%
We could even use this
method to activate an energy

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:51.690 align:middle line:84%
center in another person's
body through putting

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:54.090 align:middle line:84%
our mind inside
their energy center

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:57.660 align:middle line:84%
and creating this
movement pattern.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.330 align:middle line:84%
This activation of
an energy center

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:04.530 align:middle line:84%
helps to fully manifest that
center's inherent powers.

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:07.440 align:middle line:10%
This awakens the
slumbering divine powers

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:10.170 align:middle line:10%
within any energy
center of our body,

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:13.980 align:middle line:10%
while also balancing
and restoring harmony

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:19.889 align:middle line:10%
and opening up perception of
higher, nonphysical realities.

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Please keep in mind that
external explanations

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:25.469 align:middle line:84%
like these are
essential to understand

00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:28.510 align:middle line:90%
these deep initiation processes.

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:30.600 align:middle line:84%
However, we must be
careful not to fall

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:34.170 align:middle line:84%
into the common trap of
modern spirituality, which

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:37.050 align:middle line:84%
is to intellectually
understand a concept,

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:39.690 align:middle line:84%
but to have never
really experienced

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:42.330 align:middle line:90%
the full reality of it.

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:44.699 align:middle line:84%
Only by experiencing
the practice will

00:34:44.699 --> 00:34:49.260 align:middle line:84%
you truly know and
be benefited by it.

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:52.409 align:middle line:84%
Previously we created the
Golden Triangle around the head

00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:53.820 align:middle line:90%
in episode one.

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Now we will activate
the Cave of Brahma

00:34:56.340 --> 00:35:00.240 align:middle line:84%
in the center of the
three-axis cross in the head.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.930 align:middle line:84%
This area is a master controller
of the brain and body,

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:08.370 align:middle line:84%
of the entire sacred geometry
net of the human energy field.

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:11.460 align:middle line:84%
The Cave of Brahma can
activate a wide range

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:16.110 align:middle line:84%
of new powers, abilities,
and states of consciousness.

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:18.000 align:middle line:84%
The practice you
are about to learn

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.340 align:middle line:84%
is almost never
described publicly.

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:24.720 align:middle line:84%
Instead, it is encoded in
sacred geometric imagery,

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.910 align:middle line:84%
the same way many
hidden practices

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:29.910 align:middle line:84%
are encoded in sacred
geometry images which

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:32.940 align:middle line:84%
are understood by initiates,
but are thought to be simply

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.830 align:middle line:90%
symbolic by the general public.

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:38.320 align:middle line:84%
For example, this
activation of the Cave

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.170 align:middle line:84%
of Brahma in the cubicle
cross of the head

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:43.600 align:middle line:84%
was encoded in the
Christian tradition

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:47.350 align:middle line:84%
through the Chi Rho symbol
of early Christianity,

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:49.600 align:middle line:84%
in which the Greek
letter rho, which

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:52.480 align:middle line:84%
looks like an English
capital P, created

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.210 align:middle line:84%
the vertical axis of
the cubical cross,

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:58.690 align:middle line:84%
and the letter chi,
looking like an English X,

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:03.190 align:middle line:84%
created the two horizontal axes,
which when flattened into 2D

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:05.200 align:middle line:90%
looks like an X.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.720 align:middle line:84%
This was a symbol
for Christ, or more

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.330 align:middle line:84%
precisely for Christ
consciousness,

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:13.750 align:middle line:84%
the activation of the
spiritual center in the head

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:17.470 align:middle line:84%
into a radiant sun
of divine light.

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:20.050 align:middle line:10%
This was not only a
general representation

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:24.040 align:middle line:10%
of the cubical cross as the
three axes of physical space,

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:27.010 align:middle line:10%
but was specifically shown
in the classical images

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:31.180 align:middle line:10%
to be inside the head,
where icons of Christ

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:34.270 align:middle line:10%
show the vertical axis
down through the crown

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:38.410 align:middle line:10%
center and the horizontal axis
through the top of the ears,

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:42.680 align:middle line:10%
meeting at the Cave of Brahma
in the center of the head.

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.380 align:middle line:84%
This practice is
actually quite simple.

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:47.260 align:middle line:84%
However, when you
first perform it,

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:49.660 align:middle line:84%
you will have to
train your energy body

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:52.240 align:middle line:90%
to learn this new movement.

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Just as we have to train the
physical muscles of our body

00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:59.270 align:middle line:84%
to perform the movements
of a new sport or activity,

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:03.100 align:middle line:84%
so we have energetic
muscles in our energy field

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:06.730 align:middle line:84%
which most people have
no idea even exist.

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:10.450 align:middle line:84%
These energetic muscles
are in an atrophied state,

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:14.960 align:middle line:84%
just as if we had not used a
physical muscle for decades.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.660 align:middle line:84%
So in the beginning,
we will need

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:20.620 align:middle line:84%
to apply more effort to flex
this atrophied energetic muscle

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:21.430 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:23.470 align:middle line:84%
But through repeated
practice, you

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:27.400 align:middle line:84%
will find it easier and
easier each time to make

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:30.070 align:middle line:84%
the sacred geometric
energy movement.

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:33.370 align:middle line:84%
The practice becomes in time
almost effortless and more

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:36.430 align:middle line:84%
powerful and tangible
with every repetition.

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:40.660 align:middle line:84%
This powerful contraction
expansion at any energy center

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:43.960 align:middle line:84%
brings it back to
life and pulsating,

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:46.390 align:middle line:84%
just as expansion
and contraction

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:48.820 align:middle line:84%
of a physical muscle
during weightlifting

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:51.700 align:middle line:90%
leads to physical growth.

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:54.940 align:middle line:84%
This practice of zero-point
centering and radiance,

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:58.690 align:middle line:84%
done specifically in the
center of the cubicle cross

00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:02.050 align:middle line:84%
in the Cave of Brahma,
may also activate

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:05.740 align:middle line:84%
a range of internal energy
circuits in your body,

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:10.720 align:middle line:84%
giving rise to sensations or
internal perceptions of light,

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.560 align:middle line:90%
color, and vibration.

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:16.830 align:middle line:84%
In summary, this is a
very effective practice

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:20.370 align:middle line:84%
which will allow you to
powerfully activate any energy

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:22.320 align:middle line:90%
center in your field.

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.270 align:middle line:84%
If you'd like to do
the practice now,

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:27.540 align:middle line:84%
please see the companion
video for this episode.

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, please
set an intention

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:33.750 align:middle line:84%
to come back and do the
practice at a later time.

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Please join us for
our next episode,

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:38.160 align:middle line:84%
where we will explore the
sacred geometry secrets

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:40.410 align:middle line:90%
of the cup of the Holy Grail.

00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And you will learn
how to use this form

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:46.800 align:middle line:84%
to activate and recharge
your entire energetic field.

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:49.140 align:middle line:90%
See you then.
