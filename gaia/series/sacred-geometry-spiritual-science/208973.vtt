00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a pattern behind
everything in your life.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.930 align:middle line:84%
It's pain or pleasure, happiness
or misery, success or failure.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.930 align:middle line:10%
The hidden key to
self-empowerment

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.730 align:middle line:10%
is the knowledge
of these patterns

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.710 align:middle line:10%
which direct our lives.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.410 align:middle line:84%
Sacred geometry teaches
the master patterns

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.650 align:middle line:84%
which create our world and
which are the true secret

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.600 align:middle line:90%
behind all manifestation.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.420 align:middle line:90%


00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.860 align:middle line:84%
This series removes the veils
of previously hidden knowledge.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.140 align:middle line:84%
You will learn key
subtle energy patterns

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.160 align:middle line:84%
which, when activated regularly
in your own energy field,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.502 align:middle line:90%
can change your life.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.880 align:middle line:10%
Welcome, I'm your host,
Dr. Robert J. Gilbert,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.390 align:middle line:10%
founder of the Vesica
Institute for Holistic Studies.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.970 align:middle line:84%
For over 40 years, I have
intensively researched

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.100 align:middle line:90%
the patterns behind human life.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.700 align:middle line:84%
This includes scientific studies
from my time as a US Marine

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Corps instructor in the field
of nuclear, biological, chemical

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.750 align:middle line:84%
warfare defense and studies
of spiritual traditions

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.080 align:middle line:84%
around the world while
completing my PhD

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.210 align:middle line:90%
in international studies.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited to share
with you in this series

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.300 align:middle line:84%
some of the highlights of
these 40 years of research.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.820 align:middle line:84%
We will explore together
the hidden patterns

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.000 align:middle line:84%
which manifest everything
in physical existence.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.650 align:middle line:84%
This is a journey
of empowerment.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.860 align:middle line:84%
By learning how to work with
subtle energy patterns known

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.620 align:middle line:84%
to ancient traditions,
you can initiate

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.730 align:middle line:84%
an alchemical transformation
within yourself.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.030 align:middle line:84%
This process can empower
your individual evolution

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.390 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and
thereby assist the raising

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.380 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness on our planet.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.680 align:middle line:84%
We begin with a hidden
lineage of initiates

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.330 align:middle line:84%
known in ancient Egypt as
the masters of the net.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.110 align:middle line:90%


00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.510 align:middle line:84%
These initiates
knew a great secret,

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.450 align:middle line:84%
that behind everything
in physical existence

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.940 align:middle line:84%
is an invertible
matrix of energy,

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.400 align:middle line:84%
which is the source of all
physical manifestation.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.800 align:middle line:84%
It is this invisible
energy matrix

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.490 align:middle line:84%
which materializes everything
in the physical world

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.550 align:middle line:84%
through the patterns we
call sacred geometry.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.560 align:middle line:84%
The term sacred geometry
is comprised of geo-,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.590 align:middle line:84%
meaning Earth, and metry,
meaning measurement.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.610 align:middle line:84%
Sacred geometry literally
means the sacred measure

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.870 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.390 align:middle line:10%
We can also think of
this in a larger sense,

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.750 align:middle line:10%
of sacred geometry meaning
the divine blueprints

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.840 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness and energy.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.590 align:middle line:10%
In the ancient world, all
of the temples, monuments,

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.550 align:middle line:10%
and political power centers
were built on the larger power

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.220 align:middle line:10%
spots of the Earth's
energy grid and were

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.390 align:middle line:10%
used for establishing the exact
placement of the central axis

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.440 align:middle line:10%
of the building, the
walls, the altars, and all

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.120 align:middle line:10%
the other features
in sacred buildings.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.490 align:middle line:10%
The ancients knew that
many of these large scale

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.160 align:middle line:10%
Earth grids are connected to
the sacred geometry patterns

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.210 align:middle line:10%
we know today as
the Platonic solids.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.130 align:middle line:10%
They're called Platonic
solids because they

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.940 align:middle line:10%
appeared in the writings
of Plato 2,500 years ago.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.020 align:middle line:84%
However, these forms were known
in ancient temple sciences

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.590 align:middle line:90%
long before the time of Plato.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.930 align:middle line:84%
The Platonic solids
are the geometric forms

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.370 align:middle line:84%
which correspond to the four
elements of earth, water, air,

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.940 align:middle line:90%
and fire.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Then there is the form
of the fifth element,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.810 align:middle line:84%
the universal life force which
the Greeks called ether and was

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.810 align:middle line:84%
known as chi, qi,
prana, and other names

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.310 align:middle line:90%
in different traditions.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.840 align:middle line:84%
This is the fifth and
final Platonic solid.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.730 align:middle line:84%
This fifth element form is
the 12-sided dodecahedron

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.190 align:middle line:84%
which was considered
sacred and sometimes

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.770 align:middle line:90%
secret in the Greek tradition.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Plato hints at it when
he described the Earth

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.250 align:middle line:84%
as looking from above
like a 12-sided ball.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.300 align:middle line:84%
In ancient traditions, both the
Earth and the entire universe

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.130 align:middle line:84%
were considered to have
the form of a dodecahedron.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.880 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to see why over the
entrance to Plato's initiation

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.690 align:middle line:84%
school, there was said to
be a sign which read no one

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.100 align:middle line:90%
ignorant of geometry may enter.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.030 align:middle line:84%
In the 1970s, Ivan
Sanderson wrote an article

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.870 align:middle line:84%
showing the geometric
locations of physical anomalies

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.270 align:middle line:90%
on the Earth.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.460 align:middle line:84%
The most famous
of these locations

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.190 align:middle line:84%
is the devil's triangle
around Bermuda.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.750 align:middle line:10%
However, Sanderson
found that there

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.480 align:middle line:10%
was a geometric pattern
of similar sites

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.150 align:middle line:10%
all around the globe.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Sanderson found
these locations were

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.830 align:middle line:84%
at the nodal points
of the Platonic

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.170 align:middle line:90%
solid known as the icosahedron.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.080 align:middle line:84%
As we will see in a later
episode of this series,

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.470 align:middle line:84%
the icosahedron is not only
the sacred geometry shape

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.590 align:middle line:84%
for this part of the
energy grid of the Earth.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.050 align:middle line:84%
It is also known
in science today

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.890 align:middle line:84%
as a key biological form
which appears, for example,

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.110 align:middle line:84%
in the geometric
form of viruses,

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.730 align:middle line:90%
the most basic form of life.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Researchers discovered that
to make these Earth grid maps

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.440 align:middle line:84%
align properly to these
sacred geometry patterns,

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.410 align:middle line:84%
point number one
of the grid needed

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.500 align:middle line:84%
to be aligned to one of the
world's great large scale

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.690 align:middle line:84%
power spots, Giza
plateau in Egypt.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And so it is here, in the
civilization of ancient Egypt,

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.890 align:middle line:84%
built on this primary power
spot of the Earth grid,

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.030 align:middle line:84%
that we will find evidence of
an ancient initiation system

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.740 align:middle line:84%
based on the invisible energy
grids, which in ancient texts

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.780 align:middle line:84%
are often referred to
as nets, or the net.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.050 align:middle line:84%
In India, for example,
the jeweled net of Indra

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.050 align:middle line:84%
is described as a net
extending infinitely

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.900 align:middle line:84%
in all direction
with jewels which

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.890 align:middle line:84%
glitter like stars at every
nodal point of the net.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Every jewel reflects all
the other jewels in itself.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.990 align:middle line:10%
Other interpretations include
that every bright jewel

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.770 align:middle line:10%
at the nodal points of
the net is an atman, which

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.410 align:middle line:10%
is the spirit core
within human beings

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.900 align:middle line:10%
and all spiritual beings.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Each atman spirit core has
the same divine essence

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.130 align:middle line:84%
as all others, but with
their own unique qualities

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.340 align:middle line:84%
based on the karma they have
generated through acting

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.405 align:middle line:90%
in the physical world.

00:07:07.405 --> 00:07:11.000 align:middle line:90%


00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.160 align:middle line:10%
In the highest levels
of modern physics,

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.990 align:middle line:10%
it is understood
that physical matter

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.320 align:middle line:10%
is based on both physical
particles in different states

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.860 align:middle line:10%
of vibration and on waves.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.170 align:middle line:84%
Waves can collapse
into particles.

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Particles can disintegrate
back into waves.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.940 align:middle line:84%
This is called wave particle
duality in modern physics.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, ancient traditions
based both their understanding

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.570 align:middle line:84%
of natural forces and
their healing methods

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:42.720 align:middle line:84%
on dynamic vital energy, not
on the physical matter itself,

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.000 align:middle line:84%
which is simply a lower, denser
manifestation of the underlying

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.500 align:middle line:90%
energy patterns.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Ancient traditions understood
that energy in different states

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.380 align:middle line:90%
is the core of all existence.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.040 align:middle line:84%
This brings us to an important
secret of sacred geometry.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you see a
physical form, including

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.880 align:middle line:84%
the forms of sacred geometry
we will explore in this series,

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.660 align:middle line:84%
don't think of it as a
solid, inert structure.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Always keep in mind
that what stands

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:16.200 align:middle line:84%
behind this physical
structure is the net,

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.970 align:middle line:84%
the vibrational matrix of energy
that this form crystallized out

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:21.930 align:middle line:90%
of.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Remember that the physical
form can change immediately

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.590 align:middle line:84%
when the background
energy matrix changes.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.950 align:middle line:84%
Everything is energy so
sacred geometry patterns

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:34.710 align:middle line:84%
are crystallized
forms showing us

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.559 align:middle line:84%
the invisible,
vibrational matrix, which

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.929 align:middle line:90%
is the higher reality.

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:44.430 align:middle line:84%
This vibrational matrix is the
net, which ancient traditions

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:45.840 align:middle line:90%
learn to master.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Understanding that the
solidity of physical matter

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:52.440 align:middle line:84%
is an illusion, that it can
change based on changing

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.050 align:middle line:84%
the vibrational
matrix behind matter,

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.260 align:middle line:84%
is the secret of all
advanced energy healing

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.800 align:middle line:84%
and what we call today
vibrational medicine.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.880 align:middle line:84%
It is also the secret of all
advanced spiritual activation

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.855 align:middle line:90%
of the human being.

00:09:06.855 --> 00:09:09.920 align:middle line:90%


00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.240 align:middle line:84%
These nets, or energy grids,
work on higher plane levels,

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.910 align:middle line:84%
in addition to their work
on the physical plane,

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:20.300 align:middle line:90%
to create physical form.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.730 align:middle line:10%
Modern physics has
allowed materialism

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:26.210 align:middle line:10%
to restrict its understanding
of this larger reality

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.450 align:middle line:10%
so that modern materialism
only sees energy manifesting

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.180 align:middle line:10%
at two levels, the
electromagnetic

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.515 align:middle line:10%
and the physical levels.

00:09:33.515 --> 00:09:37.270 align:middle line:90%


00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:39.810 align:middle line:84%
One of the most popular
models of these higher planes

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:45.120 align:middle line:84%
today is the seven planes model
from the Theosophical Society.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.730 align:middle line:10%
This image of the
seven planes of nature

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.800 align:middle line:10%
is derived from
the modern system

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:56.100 align:middle line:10%
of biogeometry developed by Dr.
Ibrahim Karim in Cairo, Egypt.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim found the
geometric shapes

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.700 align:middle line:84%
which connect in resonance
to each plane, which

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.900 align:middle line:84%
makes possible very advanced
work in testing or directing

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.270 align:middle line:90%
energy to these planes.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.150 align:middle line:84%
We will discuss
biogeometry in more detail

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:15.690 align:middle line:84%
in the final episode
of the season.

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Working with higher
planes, along with the net

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.530 align:middle line:84%
of the vibrational
matrix, is a key secret

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:25.740 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual initiation.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.410 align:middle line:84%
This makes possible
advanced applications

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:33.270 align:middle line:84%
in manifestation, prosperity
work, and the materialization

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:37.680 align:middle line:84%
of energy and thought forms
into physical reality.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.300 align:middle line:84%
It is all about
knowing how to work

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.090 align:middle line:84%
with the patterns of energy,
which move from the higher

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:45.810 align:middle line:84%
planes of consciousness
into vibrational matrices

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:51.270 align:middle line:84%
and then crystallize into
physical manifestation.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Modern materialistic
science doesn't

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.170 align:middle line:84%
allow itself to
consider any planes

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.850 align:middle line:90%
above the physical plane.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.850 align:middle line:84%
It bans any discussion
of metaphysics

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.150 align:middle line:84%
just as dogmatically as
any fundamentalist religion

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:07.360 align:middle line:84%
enforces the suppression
of heretical ideas.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.530 align:middle line:84%
Instead, modern science talks
about dimensions rather than

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:13.210 align:middle line:90%
higher planes.

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Modern advanced physics is
full of higher dimensions.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:20.290 align:middle line:84%
In fact, modern physics requires
the existence of many higher

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:23.770 align:middle line:84%
dimensions in order for the
mathematics of quantum physics

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:26.290 align:middle line:90%
to work out.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:28.360 align:middle line:84%
But despite these
higher dimensions

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.150 align:middle line:84%
in physics equations,
materialistic science

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:35.470 align:middle line:84%
continues to insist that this is
simply a mathematical artifact

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.290 align:middle line:84%
and does not indicate the
existence of any higher

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:39.880 align:middle line:90%
metaphysical realities.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.700 align:middle line:90%


00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:47.450 align:middle line:84%
So let's take just a moment to
understand the basics of what

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.990 align:middle line:84%
dimensions are, as these have
taken the place in physics

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:56.030 align:middle line:84%
today of the classical ideas of
the higher planes of existence.

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Physics today teaches that our
physical reality is literally

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:03.620 align:middle line:84%
a three-dimensional
geometric grid comprised

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:09.140 align:middle line:84%
of three axes, each at a
90-degree angle to the others.

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.900 align:middle line:84%
We start with zero
dimensions, which

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.780 align:middle line:90%
is a point, an energy center.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:19.550 align:middle line:10%
In physics, it is connected
to the idea of the singularity

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:23.420 align:middle line:10%
as the source of all creation.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.900 align:middle line:84%
In spiritual terms, the
zero dimensional point

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:31.430 align:middle line:84%
is the gateway to the divine
unity from which all polarity

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:36.260 align:middle line:84%
and manifestation emerges,
which ancient traditions would

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.680 align:middle line:90%
call the divine plane.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.080 align:middle line:84%
The zero dimensional
point is literally

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.600 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual origin
point from which

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.540 align:middle line:90%
physical space is created.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.420 align:middle line:10%
To create the first
dimension, the point

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:54.200 align:middle line:10%
moves parallel to
itself to create a line.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.570 align:middle line:10%
The point then
moves on a new axis,

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:59.690 align:middle line:10%
creating lines between
the new point and the two

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:02.600 align:middle line:10%
previous points,
making the simplest

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:07.040 align:middle line:10%
two-dimensional straight
line form: the triangle.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.470 align:middle line:84%
The point then moves on
a new 90-degree axis,

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:14.480 align:middle line:84%
which creates not only new lines
between the now four points,

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.290 align:middle line:84%
but also creates planes
on all sides of this now

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:21.450 align:middle line:90%
three-dimensional form.

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:23.790 align:middle line:84%
This makes the
simplest straight line,

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:29.220 align:middle line:84%
three-dimensional geometrical
form, the tetrahedron.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.100 align:middle line:10%
We have now moved from
the point, to the line,

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:36.060 align:middle line:10%
to the plane, to the
solid, from zero dimensions

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:39.570 align:middle line:10%
to three dimensions.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.960 align:middle line:84%
If we move the point
into another new axis,

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.930 align:middle line:84%
away from the existing
three dimensions of space,

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:49.650 align:middle line:84%
we then create a fourth
dimensional object.

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:53.670 align:middle line:84%
We cannot see any aspect of
fourth dimensional or higher

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:57.660 align:middle line:84%
forms because our human
senses are based on perceiving

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.090 align:middle line:90%
our three-dimensional world.

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.270 align:middle line:84%
However, it may be
that our subtle organs

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:07.110 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual perception
could perceive these higher

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:11.540 align:middle line:90%
dimensions, or higher planes.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:15.500 align:middle line:84%
This realization, that beings
with sense organs for only

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.740 align:middle line:84%
lower dimensions could
only see fragments

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.680 align:middle line:84%
of higher dimensional
objects, was

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:26.270 align:middle line:84%
the basis for the concept
of Flatland by Edwin Abbott.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:29.990 align:middle line:84%
The Flatland concept shows
how a two-dimensional being

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:32.540 align:middle line:84%
could only see simple
two-dimensional or

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:36.050 align:middle line:84%
one-dimensional aspects of
three-dimensional objects

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:41.633 align:middle line:84%
moving through the plane of
the world that he perceives.

00:14:41.633 --> 00:14:43.800 align:middle line:84%
The lesson, of course, is
at the same is true for us

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.480 align:middle line:90%
as three-dimensional beings.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.690 align:middle line:84%
We can only see 3D,
or lower dimensional,

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:51.090 align:middle line:84%
sections of any
fourth dimensional

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:55.380 align:middle line:84%
or higher dimensional objects
moving through our world.

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:59.490 align:middle line:10%
This Flatland concept of our
only perceiving small fragments

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:02.700 align:middle line:10%
of higher dimensional objects
moving through our world

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:06.270 align:middle line:10%
opens up new understandings
of mysterious spiritual

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:10.620 align:middle line:10%
manifestations, of UFO
sightings, et cetera.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Fifth, sixth, and even
higher dimensional forms

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.960 align:middle line:84%
are also possible
and have already

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.930 align:middle line:84%
been identified in advanced
scientific mathematics

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:20.820 align:middle line:90%
and geometric studies.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.100 align:middle line:84%
When we see these higher
dimensional geometric

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.730 align:middle line:84%
forms on a flat,
two-dimensional surface,

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:31.230 align:middle line:84%
they appear as a complex grid
pattern, the net described

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:34.030 align:middle line:90%
in the ancient traditions.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:36.580 align:middle line:84%
So if we add another
point to the preceding

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:39.560 align:middle line:84%
series of dimensional
images, a new point

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:43.000 align:middle line:84%
which would now be in the
fourth dimension, along an axis

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.570 align:middle line:84%
shift not perceivable by a
three-dimensional person,

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:49.510 align:middle line:84%
this would create a
fourth dimensional form,

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:54.760 align:middle line:84%
of which we would only see a
shadow of it in our dimension.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Note that the fourth
dimensional form

00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.010 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the sequence, when
shown in a lower dimensional

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:04.600 align:middle line:84%
projection as a flat, 2D form,
from a specific perspective,

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.860 align:middle line:84%
looks like a five-pointed
star, a pentagram

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:13.360 align:middle line:84%
inside a five-sided
enclosure, a pentagon.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:17.590 align:middle line:84%
This opens up the possibility
that forms and sacred geometry

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:20.890 align:middle line:84%
used in ancient
spiritual traditions

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:24.640 align:middle line:84%
are actually lower
dimensional projection views

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.550 align:middle line:90%
of higher dimensional objects.

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:30.670 align:middle line:84%
These 2D or 3D sacred
geometry patterns

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:33.010 align:middle line:84%
may actually have
the hidden power

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:38.770 align:middle line:84%
to energetically connect us to
higher dimensional realities.

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:40.690 align:middle line:84%
As we will see in
a later episode,

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:43.420 align:middle line:84%
the pentagram form
we see here, created

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.670 align:middle line:84%
by higher dimensional
projection,

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:49.810 align:middle line:84%
is a key sacred geometry pattern
for the human energy body

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:53.830 align:middle line:84%
and has been used for
spiritual and magical purposes

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:57.030 align:middle line:84%
throughout recorded
human history.

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:59.750 align:middle line:84%
This pentagram within
a pentagon is also

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:03.000 align:middle line:84%
related to the large
dodecahedron of the Earth grid

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.750 align:middle line:90%
we saw earlier in this episode.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:09.380 align:middle line:84%
The dodecahedron is
comprised of 12 pentagons,

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:13.430 align:middle line:84%
showing that the energy
geometries of the human body

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:17.329 align:middle line:84%
also exist in a larger
macro form in the energy

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:20.420 align:middle line:90%
grids of the Earth itself.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:24.200 align:middle line:84%
This is a profound aspect
of sacred geometry,

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.109 align:middle line:84%
that geometric forms
we see may just

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:30.650 align:middle line:84%
be shadows of higher
dimensional forms which

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:33.290 align:middle line:84%
most human beings have
not yet developed a sense

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:34.910 align:middle line:90%
organ to perceive directly.

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:38.220 align:middle line:90%


00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Now that we have explored
some basics of energy grids,

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:44.460 align:middle line:84%
or what the ancients called
the net, as patterns which

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.350 align:middle line:84%
create the physical
world and which

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:49.890 align:middle line:84%
manifest on multiple
planes and dimensions,

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:53.040 align:middle line:84%
we can now explore the hidden
tradition of the masters

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:57.080 align:middle line:90%
of the net in ancient Egypt.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.230 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Egyptian
tradition cultivated

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:02.260 align:middle line:84%
deep, hidden knowledge
and applications

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.890 align:middle line:84%
of the energetic net behind
all physical manifestation,

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:09.280 align:middle line:84%
both in the human energy
field and in the Earth itself.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:12.470 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.270 align:middle line:84%
In modern physics,
it is understood

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:17.090 align:middle line:84%
that all physical matter
is within an energy

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:19.700 align:middle line:90%
grid of space and time.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.730 align:middle line:84%
Today, we see in physics
books a representation

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:28.070 align:middle line:84%
of the net of spacetime being
distorted by physical mass.

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:31.130 align:middle line:84%
This net is often shown
looking like a rubber sheet

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.740 align:middle line:84%
with a squared
geometric grid on it,

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:38.240 align:middle line:84%
being distorted and stretched
by an object such as a planet.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.910 align:middle line:84%
This means that the
net is malleable,

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:43.610 align:middle line:90%
and it can be modified.

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Over 5,000 years
before modern physics,

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.980 align:middle line:84%
this same energy
grid which is today

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:52.010 align:middle line:84%
called the net of spacetime,
was known and shown

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:54.110 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient
Egyptian mysteries

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:56.630 align:middle line:84%
as the net which
creates and sustains

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.910 align:middle line:90%
all physical existence.

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:03.110 align:middle line:84%
Learning to tap the power of
this geometric energy grid

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:07.730 align:middle line:84%
was a key aspect of the
Egyptian temple initiation.

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Those initiated
into these mysteries

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:12.950 align:middle line:84%
were known as the
masters of the net.

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:15.560 align:middle line:90%


00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.050 align:middle line:84%
Behind the illustrations
on the Egyptian temple

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:22.400 align:middle line:84%
walls were geometric grids
constructed first by the artist

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.800 align:middle line:84%
before creating the
final illustrations we

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.700 align:middle line:84%
see on the completed
temple walls in Egypt.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.370 align:middle line:84%
These geometric grids
used in ancient Egypt

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:33.740 align:middle line:84%
are known to modern
Egyptologists.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.900 align:middle line:84%
But with their
materialistic viewpoint,

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.850 align:middle line:84%
many believe these
grids to have only

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:40.130 align:middle line:84%
been a practical
method to lay out

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:42.140 align:middle line:90%
the illustrations on the wall.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:45.600 align:middle line:84%
They ignore the vast
literature in ancient Egypt,

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.940 align:middle line:84%
which describes this net
and its magical power.

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.790 align:middle line:84%
There are specific terms
used for different aspects

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:56.690 align:middle line:84%
of the geometric net of energy
by the Egyptian initiates

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:58.040 align:middle line:90%
of the temple.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.290 align:middle line:10%
Some of those
terms are seen here

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:03.800 align:middle line:10%
from hieroglyphic text
published by British researchers

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.040 align:middle line:10%
in the late 1800s.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:11.340 align:middle line:10%
There were also direct
representations of the net.

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:13.590 align:middle line:84%
For the public,
the net was often

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:17.700 align:middle line:84%
represented metaphorically
as a net used to catch fish,

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:21.240 align:middle line:90%
or to catch birds.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:26.010 align:middle line:84%
Initiates were shown learning to
master the net and its powers.

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Deeper initiation
teachings were also

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.690 align:middle line:90%
held within the net imagery.

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Ancient Egyptians did not
refer to non-physical beings

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:39.530 align:middle line:84%
as gods or goddesses, as they
are translated into English

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:41.510 align:middle line:90%
today from ancient text.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.790 align:middle line:84%
But rather, they
referred to these beings

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:48.000 align:middle line:84%
as netters, the conscious
forces of nature

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.200 align:middle line:84%
which the initiate learns
to directly communicate with

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.230 align:middle line:90%
and to direct their power.

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:56.780 align:middle line:84%
Many netters were shown
with animal heads,

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.700 align:middle line:84%
not because ancient
Egyptians worshipped

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:02.630 align:middle line:84%
animals, as is sometimes
falsely speculated today,

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:05.930 align:middle line:84%
but because they understood that
higher divine powers manifested

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:10.470 align:middle line:84%
through specific animals,
just as today we say clever

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:13.030 align:middle line:90%
as a fox.

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:16.690 align:middle line:84%
The ibis-headed netter was
known to the ancient Egyptians

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:20.530 align:middle line:84%
as Djehuti, but today,
we know this netter

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:26.410 align:middle line:84%
from the later corrupted
Greek name, Thote or Thoth.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:30.730 align:middle line:84%
Djehuti was understood to be
the being who created and taught

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:33.130 align:middle line:90%
the Egyptian temple science.

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.470 align:middle line:10%
The non-physical
servants of Djehuti

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:42.070 align:middle line:10%
were depicted as baboons casting
nets into water to catch fish.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, the deeper initiation
knowledge behind this

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:47.560 align:middle line:84%
was that these fish
caught in the net

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.800 align:middle line:84%
were in actuality the
souls of the dead who

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.600 align:middle line:84%
are unable to
consciously navigate

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.960 align:middle line:84%
through the non-physical
worlds and so became

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.235 align:middle line:90%
caught in the net.

00:21:57.235 --> 00:21:59.750 align:middle line:90%


00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:02.350 align:middle line:84%
There is a specific
teaching about this

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.740 align:middle line:84%
in the key Egyptian
initiation text called

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:09.760 align:middle line:84%
the Book of Coming Forth
Into Light, which today we

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.760 align:middle line:84%
often call the Egyptian
Book of the Dead.

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.010 align:middle line:84%
In this text, the
initiate learns

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:18.100 align:middle line:90%
to navigate and master the net.

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.100 align:middle line:84%
In chapter 153,
the initiate learns

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:26.080 align:middle line:84%
to consciously navigate through
the net, as seen in this quote.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:29.830 align:middle line:84%
"Oh, you fisherman, you shall
not catch me in your net.

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:32.740 align:middle line:84%
You shall not catch me in
your nets in which you catch

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:36.340 align:middle line:84%
the unwary, for I know the
net from its upper heights

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.740 align:middle line:90%
to its lower depths."

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.410 align:middle line:84%
This remarkable
initiation text details

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:44.740 align:middle line:84%
all of the aspects of the
net, from the Earth out

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:49.180 align:middle line:84%
into cosmological bodies,
and which aspects of the net

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:52.480 align:middle line:84%
connect to specific higher
non-physical beings,

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.220 align:middle line:90%
the netters.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.830 align:middle line:84%
The true master of the
net is the initiate

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:59.680 align:middle line:84%
who has learned how to
navigate through the net

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.160 align:middle line:84%
and learned how to use the net
of the living energy matrix

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.770 align:middle line:84%
behind everything on
the physical plane

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:08.920 align:middle line:84%
to develop powers that
the uninitiated consider

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.840 align:middle line:90%
to be magical.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:14.110 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Egypt, the
netter of death and rebirth

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:17.200 align:middle line:84%
was named Azra,
name later corrupted

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.940 align:middle line:90%
in Greek to become Osiris.

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:21.890 align:middle line:90%


00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:25.220 align:middle line:84%
The sacred geometry forum
known as the backbone of Azra

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:28.100 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Egypt
was the djed-pillar,

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.650 align:middle line:84%
which was erected each
year in the raising

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:35.280 align:middle line:84%
of the djed ceremony to
connect heaven and Earth.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Just as the Egyptian temples
connected power spots

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:41.370 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth on which they
were built to power spots

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:44.460 align:middle line:84%
in the heavens and
just as the human spine

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:48.120 align:middle line:84%
stands erect for us to be
held between Earth and heaven

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:52.950 align:middle line:84%
to act on the physical plane,
the raising of the djed-pillar

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:59.400 align:middle line:84%
was the culmination of the
mysteries of Azra, or Osiris.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:02.250 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient Egyptian
document which is today

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:06.330 align:middle line:84%
known as the Westcar Papyrus,
one of the highest masters

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:10.680 align:middle line:84%
of the net in ancient Egypt
is described as the Djedi,

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:14.760 align:middle line:84%
based on the djed-pillar being
the backbone of Azra connecting

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.680 align:middle line:90%
heaven and Earth.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.890 align:middle line:84%
The Djedi derives
extraordinary powers

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:84%
from using the net to
control natural forces.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.540 align:middle line:84%
One story in the Westcar
Papyrus describes a master

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:31.500 align:middle line:84%
of the net, a high priest
for a pharaoh Sneferu,

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:35.220 align:middle line:84%
who parts the waters of a
lake, making a part of a lake

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:38.490 align:middle line:84%
dry so that a valuable
piece of jewelry

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:40.605 align:middle line:90%
can be reclaimed from its floor.

00:24:40.605 --> 00:24:43.350 align:middle line:90%


00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Today, such miracles,
or magic, are

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:48.600 align:middle line:84%
associated with the
parting of the Red Sea

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.900 align:middle line:84%
by Moses described
in the Old Testament.

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:54.720 align:middle line:84%
However, these abilities
to control natural forces

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:58.650 align:middle line:84%
were, in fact, a part of the
masters of the net initiation

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:02.010 align:middle line:84%
lineage from which Moses
derived his knowledge

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:05.520 align:middle line:84%
during his training in
the Egyptian temples.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.460 align:middle line:10%
Similarly, the use
of the staff by Moses

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.130 align:middle line:10%
is directly derived
from the training

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:14.840 align:middle line:10%
and the use of the staff
in the Egyptian temples.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:19.740 align:middle line:84%
The staff acts as an antenna
for detecting and projecting

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.320 align:middle line:84%
higher forces based
on the designs

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.980 align:middle line:90%
and shapes on the staff.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.470 align:middle line:84%
In the Westcar Papyrus,
after the story

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:31.880 align:middle line:84%
of the priest who parts
the waters for the pharaoh,

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.580 align:middle line:84%
the story of the
Djedi is introduced.

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:37.160 align:middle line:84%
He is said in this
ancient Egyptian text

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:41.450 align:middle line:84%
to specifically have the power
to restore a life to the dead

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:45.350 align:middle line:84%
and to know hidden secrets
of the ancient temples.

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:48.950 align:middle line:84%
The term used in recent
times in the Star Wars film

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:53.045 align:middle line:84%
series of a Jedi Knight
who can direct the force.

00:25:53.045 --> 00:25:55.580 align:middle line:90%


00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:58.460 align:middle line:84%
This carries a powerful
subconscious resonance

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.160 align:middle line:90%
and attraction for people today.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.790 align:middle line:84%
This is because it comes from
the Hekau system of words

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:08.300 align:middle line:84%
of power in ancient
Egypt, specifically

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.960 align:middle line:90%
the terms djed and Djedi.

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.910 align:middle line:84%
The lightsaber in
Star Wars sometimes

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:19.140 align:middle line:84%
resembles the form of
the djed-pillar, as well.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:22.140 align:middle line:84%
From ancient Egypt, the
hidden knowledge of the

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:27.260 align:middle line:84%
spread to other cultures in
the Western tradition, as well.

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.170 align:middle line:84%
The foundation of the Western
monotheistic tradition

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:34.130 align:middle line:84%
is the Old Testament,
whose first book, Genesis,

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:36.350 align:middle line:84%
describes the creation
of the Earth from higher

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:40.280 align:middle line:84%
spiritual realms through the
use of specific sacred geometry

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.300 align:middle line:90%
patterns.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.520 align:middle line:84%
The very first
statement in Genesis,

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.460 align:middle line:90%
in Hebrew, is bereshet.

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:48.590 align:middle line:10%
Note that in the
Hebrew original text,

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:50.660 align:middle line:10%
there are no divisions
of the letters

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:54.530 align:middle line:10%
into words, just an unbroken
stream of letters which

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:56.960 align:middle line:10%
can be divided and
interpreted in deeper

00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:01.760 align:middle line:10%
ways within the
Kabbalistic mysteries.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Bereshet is usually
translated into English

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:09.830 align:middle line:84%
as meaning in the beginning,
but in the deeper Kabbalistic

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:13.940 align:middle line:84%
teachings, it also
literally means the net,

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:19.550 align:middle line:84%
or God creates the net as
the beginning of creation.

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:22.130 align:middle line:84%
This means that the
same geometric energy

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:24.380 align:middle line:84%
net we saw previously
as the core

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.720 align:middle line:84%
of ancient Egyptian
initiation, which

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:30.140 align:middle line:84%
appears as the matrix of
space time in modern physics,

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.650 align:middle line:84%
is also the very first
statement of Genesis, which

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:35.900 align:middle line:84%
can be accurately
translated as God

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:39.770 align:middle line:84%
creates the net as the
very first act of creation.

00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:41.480 align:middle line:84%
The Jewish tradition
is well known

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:45.260 align:middle line:84%
for avoiding visual images
of divine realities.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:48.650 align:middle line:84%
However, in the Kabbalah,
there is a powerful discussion

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:53.840 align:middle line:84%
of a specific net of creation
manifested by the 22 flame

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:57.260 align:middle line:84%
letters of the Hebrew
alphabet, each of which

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.930 align:middle line:90%
is a divine power.

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:03.140 align:middle line:84%
In the modern Jewish
Kabbalah, this net pattern

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:08.650 align:middle line:90%
is referred to as the 231 gates.

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:10.750 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps the best
known net pattern

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:13.030 align:middle line:10%
from the Jewish
tradition in modern times

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:16.030 align:middle line:10%
is the tree of life,
an energy matrix which

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:20.260 align:middle line:10%
is a map connecting multiple
dimensions which also

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:23.830 align:middle line:10%
microcosmically manifest
as a powerful energy

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:27.430 align:middle line:10%
grid within the
human energy body.

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Methods to activate this
powerful energy grid

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.220 align:middle line:84%
within our human
energy field require

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:37.740 align:middle line:84%
real knowledge about this
pattern and its effects,

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.450 align:middle line:84%
rather than the
inaccurate speculation

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:44.250 align:middle line:84%
which has become so
prevalent in recent times.

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:47.190 align:middle line:10%
This lost knowledge was
restored in modern times

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:51.210 align:middle line:10%
by a Greek Christian healer and
initiate known to the public

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:55.740 align:middle line:10%
as Daskalos, who referred to the
pattern as the symbol of life,

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:59.310 align:middle line:10%
from its ancient Egyptian roots.

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Activating each key part
of this net grid pattern

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.310 align:middle line:90%
requires regular practice.

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.290 align:middle line:84%
We will show you a
simplified method

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:11.580 align:middle line:84%
where you will activate this
pattern one section at a time

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:13.810 align:middle line:84%
so that by the end
of this series,

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:16.440 align:middle line:84%
you will have learned how
to activate the full pattern

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.600 align:middle line:90%
in your energy field.

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Please be aware that this can be
an extremely powerful practice,

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:26.160 align:middle line:84%
which can accelerate your
path of personal evolution

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.800 align:middle line:84%
and can even
beneficially transform

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.320 align:middle line:90%
your spiritual destiny.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.210 align:middle line:10%
We will, in this
series, refer to

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:36.510 align:middle line:10%
this powerful, sacred geometry
grid in the human energy field

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:40.230 align:middle line:10%
as the grid of life
design, or refer

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:43.620 align:middle line:10%
to in short by the acronym GOLD.

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:46.470 align:middle line:10%
This will help to remind us
that this pattern is indeed

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:50.550 align:middle line:10%
linked to activating the
GOLD energy of the saints

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:54.540 align:middle line:10%
in our energy field, the same
golden radiance which is shown

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:57.210 align:middle line:10%
above the heads or bodies
of the great initiates

00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:59.565 align:middle line:10%
of every spiritual
tradition around the world.

00:29:59.565 --> 00:30:03.010 align:middle line:90%


00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:06.540 align:middle line:10%
So let us begin our activation
of the grid of life design,

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:10.470 align:middle line:10%
or GOLD, with the activation
of the GOLD energy surrounding

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:13.230 align:middle line:10%
our head, the seat
of our consciousness.

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:16.830 align:middle line:90%


00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:18.870 align:middle line:84%
If you'd like to do
the practice now,

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:22.380 align:middle line:84%
please see the companion
video for this episode.

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:24.300 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, please
set an intention

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:27.045 align:middle line:84%
to come back and do the
practice at a later time.

00:30:27.045 --> 00:30:30.210 align:middle line:90%


00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And join us for
our next episode,

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:34.800 align:middle line:84%
where we will reveal
four of the deepest

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.010 align:middle line:90%
secrets within sacred geometry.

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:40.800 align:middle line:84%
We'll explore more of
the core hidden knowledge

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.230 align:middle line:84%
of the masters of
the net from Egypt

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:47.430 align:middle line:84%
and from other great initiation
traditions around the world.

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:49.550 align:middle line:90%
See you then.

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:56.000 align:middle line:90%
