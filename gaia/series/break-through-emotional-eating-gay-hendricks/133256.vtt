00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>Welcome back to "Break
Through Emotional Eating."

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm Gay Hendricks.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.870 align:middle line:84%
In this episode,
we're going to discuss

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.600 align:middle line:84%
a topic of great importance--
emotional awareness.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.180 align:middle line:84%
I've often thought
that we should

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.380 align:middle line:84%
start learning the skills
of emotional awareness

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.260 align:middle line:84%
in kindergarten and
the first grade.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.156 align:middle line:90%
However, I know I didn't.

00:00:36.156 --> 00:00:38.300 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get any
training in those skills

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.700 align:middle line:84%
in high school or
even college either.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.970 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until
my doctor's degree

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.960 align:middle line:84%
when it was almost
over that we started

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.750 align:middle line:84%
working on the emotional
structure of human beings.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.380 align:middle line:84%
As I began my process of
losing 100-plus pounds,

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.560 align:middle line:84%
I realized I needed to learn
how to embrace my emotions.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.220 align:middle line:84%
I needed to let down that
300-pound wall of defense

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.590 align:middle line:84%
and build up a new
emotional awareness in me.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.030 align:middle line:84%
To help me better
understand your emotions,

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.760 align:middle line:84%
here's a list of typical
physical reactions associated

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.470 align:middle line:90%
with different emotions.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.170 align:middle line:84%
Fear is usually felt in the
body as a racy, slightly queasy

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.900 align:middle line:84%
sensation, located
between the bottom

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.310 align:middle line:90%
of your sternum and your navel.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.110 align:middle line:84%
It's in the same area as
the sensation of hunger.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Fear can range from
butterflies to heart pounding.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Since humans feel fear in the
same general region as hunger,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.620 align:middle line:84%
people often associate
that feeling with hunger.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.800 align:middle line:84%
This leads us to eat when we're
scared, rather than eating just

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.890 align:middle line:90%
when we're hungry.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.690 align:middle line:84%
Sadness is usually experienced
as a pressure or heaviness

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.070 align:middle line:90%
in your upper chest and throat.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.120 align:middle line:84%
Think of that lump
in the throat.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And this sensation appears
usually before tears come.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Joy is a bubbly
sense of lightness

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.620 align:middle line:90%
at the center of your body.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.240 align:middle line:84%
With anger, the first
thing people notice

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.259 align:middle line:84%
is a pulling contraction in
their upper neck and shoulders.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.300 align:middle line:84%
That's the early warning
signal that you're

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.790 align:middle line:90%
getting angry about something.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.690 align:middle line:84%
This sensation appears
before secondary sensations,

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.900 align:middle line:84%
like clenched jaws and tensed
fists and heat in the face.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.090 align:middle line:84%
The physical feelings
of these emotions

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.050 align:middle line:84%
are very distinct from
the sensation of hunger

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.250 align:middle line:84%
and fatigue-- two things
they're often confused with.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Hunger is a gnawing
contraction between the bottom

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.800 align:middle line:84%
of your sternum and
your navel back in here.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Fatigue is first felt as an
achy feeling, which is often

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.820 align:middle line:84%
found in the back of
your arms and your neck

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.910 align:middle line:90%
and your mid-back.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Secondary sensations
of fatigue--

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.580 align:middle line:84%
are mental fog, a
downward heaviness

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.050 align:middle line:84%
or pulling in the
legs, and the heavy

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.260 align:middle line:84%
eyelids that you feel often
before you go to sleep.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.410 align:middle line:84%
To illustrate my
next point, I'd like

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.310 align:middle line:84%
to tell you more
about that moment when

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.950 align:middle line:84%
I was walking in the
woods that day and slipped

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.740 align:middle line:84%
and fell and was
lying on my back.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.320 align:middle line:84%
I saw all of these defenses I
had erected, all of the ways

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.030 align:middle line:84%
I attacked myself just
for having feelings.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.450 align:middle line:84%
I also saw clearly
how all of these

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.950 align:middle line:84%
denied emotions caused
me to project things

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.340 align:middle line:84%
about other people that
were really about me, not

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.730 align:middle line:90%
about them.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.980 align:middle line:84%
For example, because
I denied my anger,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.530 align:middle line:90%
I saw other people as angry.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.000 align:middle line:84%
In that moment of
clear insight, I

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.680 align:middle line:84%
realized that I held my
muscles in chronic contraction

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.800 align:middle line:84%
to keep my feelings
at bay, to keep myself

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.210 align:middle line:90%
from feeling those feelings.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Somehow I got this
idea or illusion

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.690 align:middle line:84%
that I wouldn't feel
sad or scared if I

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.020 align:middle line:90%
kept my muscles contracted.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.080 align:middle line:90%


00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.640 align:middle line:84%
This exercise will
help you know how

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.610 align:middle line:84%
the different emotions of
joy, fear, sadness, and anger

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.820 align:middle line:90%
feel in your body.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.610 align:middle line:84%
First, let's go back
to the yes breath.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.280 align:middle line:90%
Take a few easy breaths.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Remember breathing in
for six or seven seconds,

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.510 align:middle line:84%
breathing out for
six or seven seconds.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.089 align:middle line:84%
Take it very slow and easy,
and keep it connected.

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:23.140 align:middle line:90%
Breathe easy and connected.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.820 align:middle line:84%
Breathe in and out
through your nose.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Arch your back as you breathe
in and flatten your back

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.310 align:middle line:90%
as you breathe out.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.920 align:middle line:84%
When you get an easeful
flow going inside

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.780 align:middle line:84%
from your breathing,
float these suggestions

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.080 align:middle line:90%
through your consciousness.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.000 align:middle line:84%
So take a moment to scan
the front of your body.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Think of a moment when you
were afraid, but not terrified.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Just think of a moment when you
were anxious about something--

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.390 align:middle line:84%
maybe taking a test
or something you

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.760 align:middle line:90%
were scared about in your life.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Breathe and remember
that time, while you take

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.320 align:middle line:90%
a couple of easy, slow breaths.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.520 align:middle line:90%


00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Back to checking into
fear for a moment--

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.940 align:middle line:84%
scan your solar plexus
area around your navel

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.418 align:middle line:84%
and your belly, while you
take two slow, easy breaths.

00:05:16.418 --> 00:05:19.350 align:middle line:90%


00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's shift over a little
bit to focus on sadness.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Take a breath or two--
easy, slow breathing.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Open up your chest
and heart area.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Scan that area and
notice if you feel

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.610 align:middle line:84%
any of the signs of sadness,
such as a lump in the throat

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.900 align:middle line:84%
or a heaviness in your chest
or a tugging at your eyelids.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Think of a time when you
felt angry about something.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.520 align:middle line:84%
Just take a few breaths
and remember that time.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.160 align:middle line:84%
As you do that,
scan your shoulders

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.010 align:middle line:84%
between your shoulder blades
and up the back of your neck.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Notice what you
feel in your back.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.441 align:middle line:84%
Put your consciousness
to work for you.

00:06:04.441 --> 00:06:07.390 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, shift over
and think of a time

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.970 align:middle line:90%
when you were really happy.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Feel what you were doing some
time when you were really

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.380 align:middle line:84%
feeling good, happy, feeling
content, and fulfilled.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.180 align:middle line:84%
Breathe and remember
that time, while you take

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.020 align:middle line:90%
a couple of slow, easy breaths.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Really stretch out into
that feeling of happiness.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.830 align:middle line:90%


00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, take a few breaths and
move around a little bit,

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.910 align:middle line:84%
stretching and letting go of
the thoughts and feelings that

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.960 align:middle line:90%
came up in this exercise.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.430 align:middle line:84%
The more you can learn
about your emotions,

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.100 align:middle line:90%
the better off you are.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.900 align:middle line:84%
We all need to know what
emotional situations cause

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.300 align:middle line:84%
us to go into unconscious
eating patterns.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.220 align:middle line:84%
For me, it had a lot to do with
a certain feeling of loneliness

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.840 align:middle line:90%
and feeling like I was a victim.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.590 align:middle line:84%
I thought that people were
picking on me and I was lonely

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.240 align:middle line:84%
and I had nobody
to connect with.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.530 align:middle line:84%
That would oftentimes drive
me to the refrigerator.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.420 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know
that until I spent

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.850 align:middle line:84%
a lot of time learning to pay
attention to my emotions again.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.000 align:middle line:84%
In our next episode,
I'm going to show you

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.660 align:middle line:84%
how a certain kind of
spiritual awareness

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.470 align:middle line:84%
can make it much easier to
create your healthy body.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.820 align:middle line:10%
