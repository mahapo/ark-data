00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>>Welcome back to "Break
Through Emotional Eating."

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm Gay Hendricks.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.860 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we're going to
learn about spiritual awareness

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.140 align:middle line:90%
and your healthy body.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Looking back now, I think
that once having been fat

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.070 align:middle line:84%
was the best thing that
could have happened to me.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.220 align:middle line:84%
That may seem hard to
believe, but I really feel it.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Being fat brought
me to an insight

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.780 align:middle line:90%
that forever changed my life.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.710 align:middle line:84%
It goes right along with the
exploration of our emotions.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Down at the bottom of everything
is something very special--

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.460 align:middle line:90%
a new undiscovered land.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.760 align:middle line:84%
I had in this moment a genuine
feeling of life changing

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.710 align:middle line:84%
experience, and illuminated for
me the true nature of who I was

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.070 align:middle line:84%
and also the true nature
of the universe around me.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And I now believe
that being fat gave me

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.150 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate gift of a
spiritual dimension to my life

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.230 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't really
have until that moment.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.410 align:middle line:84%
I also learned in that
moment that any emotion,

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.740 align:middle line:84%
even unpleasant ones
such as anger and fear,

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.070 align:middle line:84%
takes place against a
background of spirit.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.780 align:middle line:84%
If you let yourself feel the
emotion without judging it,

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.270 align:middle line:84%
you'll feel your spirit
behind the emotion.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And the tangible
feeling of spirit

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.290 align:middle line:84%
is a clear sweet sensation you
can actually feel in your body.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.750 align:middle line:84%
I was fat, so I
can remind myself

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.530 align:middle line:84%
in every moment to relax
into the welcoming embrace

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.090 align:middle line:90%
of spirit.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'd like to show
you two techniques that I

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.040 align:middle line:90%
used to transform my life.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.430 align:middle line:84%
I call them the magic
keys because each of them

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.170 align:middle line:84%
unlocks the treasure trove
I didn't even know I had.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I want
them to do for you.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Three big emotions account
for most relationship stress--

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.620 align:middle line:90%
sadness, anger, and fear.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Other feelings, like
disappointment and boredom,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.060 align:middle line:84%
are usually mixtures of one
of those big three feelings.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Since they come up
frequently in life,

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.230 align:middle line:84%
you can use them
as a powerful way

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.820 align:middle line:84%
to reconnect you with
your organic spirituality.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.950 align:middle line:84%
There are two
sensations that we all

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.510 align:middle line:84%
need to learn to recognize--
hunger and fatigue.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.240 align:middle line:84%
Knowing when you're
genuinely hungry

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.730 align:middle line:84%
and when you're
genuinely becoming tired

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.860 align:middle line:90%
is vitally important.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.730 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to pick one of
those to focus on right now.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.830 align:middle line:90%
One of them would be fear.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.870 align:middle line:90%
One of them would be anger.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.570 align:middle line:90%
One of them would be sadness.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.900 align:middle line:84%
As you tune into that
sensation or emotion,

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.930 align:middle line:90%
rest your full attention on it.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Don't judge the feeling as
good or bad, right or wrong.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.700 align:middle line:84%
Simply direct your attention
toward that feeling

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.140 align:middle line:90%
or sensation.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.710 align:middle line:84%
After 10 seconds or so,
you'll notice the sensation

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.820 align:middle line:90%
will begin to dissolve.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And it will be replaced
by a clear, sweet feeling.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And this new feeling
means that you

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.380 align:middle line:84%
have honored the original
emotion or sensation

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.850 align:middle line:84%
with enough awareness to
invite the emergence of spirit.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be able to
practice with these techniques

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.270 align:middle line:84%
that behind every emotion
and in the center of us

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.420 align:middle line:84%
all is that clear, sweet
sensation of spirit

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.920 align:middle line:90%
in ourselves.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.350 align:middle line:84%
It's an actual thing you
can feel, in addition

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.690 align:middle line:90%
to be able to think about.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.840 align:middle line:84%
What it's like you to do now,
over the next minute or two,

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.900 align:middle line:84%
is to repeat this process
for several minutes

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.640 align:middle line:84%
until you can actually feel
the sweet, clear sensation that

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.170 align:middle line:84%
is behind all of your foreground
feelings that's just anger

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.480 align:middle line:90%
or sadness or fear.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.580 align:middle line:84%
After you've
finished the process,

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.220 align:middle line:84%
take a few moments to
record your experiences

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.500 align:middle line:90%
in your journal.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.420 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's get very practical.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.690 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to give you the tool
I use throughout my journey

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.420 align:middle line:90%
of losing more than 100 pounds.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.190 align:middle line:90%
Here's the background.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Early in life, you
may have been fed

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.370 align:middle line:84%
things that have distanced
you from your spirit.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.630 align:middle line:84%
But now you're in charge of
what you put in your mouth.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.360 align:middle line:84%
No food is really good or
bad, or right or wrong.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.660 align:middle line:84%
The key is to discover
the foods that

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.600 align:middle line:84%
nourish your spirit one bite at
a time and at your own speed.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.930 align:middle line:90%
I had to do that.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And you will need
to do that too.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And here's my promise to you
that as you eat more spirit

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.510 align:middle line:84%
foods, those extra pounds
just seem like to melt away.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.270 align:middle line:90%
And your spirit begins to shine.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.500 align:middle line:90%
It's so simple.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.540 align:middle line:84%
When you eat a bite
of food, ask yourself,

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.990 align:middle line:90%
will this feed my spirit?

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.390 align:middle line:90%
Will this feed my spirit?

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.030 align:middle line:84%
If your body tells you
yes, go ahead and eat it.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you're finding
foods that feed your spirit,

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.920 align:middle line:84%
there's really no need to be
obsessive about it at all.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.620 align:middle line:84%
Whether you can do it once
a day or 100 times a day,

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.090 align:middle line:84%
they always have the same
great practical value.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.490 align:middle line:90%
So again, be easy on yourself.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Be gentle and
loving on yourself.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Gradually, you'll learn to tell
the difference between foods

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.110 align:middle line:84%
and amounts that nourish
your spirit, that

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.070 align:middle line:84%
enable you to expand
into it, and foods that

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.100 align:middle line:84%
bury your spirit
deeper within you,

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.920 align:middle line:84%
making you contract
away from it.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.230 align:middle line:84%
You'll also notice when
you're eating something

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.690 align:middle line:84%
to distract yourself
from something

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.970 align:middle line:90%
you don't want to face.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.180 align:middle line:84%
So you'll naturally begin
to choose the perfect foods

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.370 align:middle line:90%
to feed your spirit.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.980 align:middle line:84%
You can also use
this magic question,

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.470 align:middle line:84%
will this feed my spirit,
for more than just the food

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.270 align:middle line:90%
you eat.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.480 align:middle line:84%
For example, you may
have other life decisions

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.180 align:middle line:84%
about how much exercise
you are going to do

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.000 align:middle line:84%
or what career you're
going to pursue

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.080 align:middle line:84%
or how to handle that personal
relationship situation.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.220 align:middle line:84%
This magic question,
will this feed my spirit,

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.880 align:middle line:84%
can help you live it into a
spiritually and fulfilling

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.480 align:middle line:84%
manner in all
areas of your life.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.750 align:middle line:84%
The magic question showed
me what foods to eat.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.510 align:middle line:84%
It showed me which
friends had to go

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.970 align:middle line:84%
and which ones I
could hang out with.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.660 align:middle line:84%
It even showed me what changes
I needed to make in order

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.060 align:middle line:90%
to have a successful career.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.720 align:middle line:90%
I used it on everything.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.570 align:middle line:90%
And it always worked.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.910 align:middle line:84%
It's become so much
a part of my life

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.270 align:middle line:84%
that I no longer think I
have it as a key at all.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.660 align:middle line:84%
It's just the way things
need to work in order for me

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.340 align:middle line:90%
to feel happy and creative.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.010 align:middle line:84%
I hope that it will serve
the same for you, as well.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.430 align:middle line:84%
In closing, I want to wish you
well in the exciting journey

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.320 align:middle line:90%
to your healthy body.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.480 align:middle line:84%
I hope that the journey
we have taken together

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.540 align:middle line:84%
will assist you in creating
the body and the life

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.020 align:middle line:84%
that you, with all
your heart, most want.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.170 align:middle line:84%
It's been my honor and privilege
to share this information

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.430 align:middle line:84%
with you and I wish you
the greatest success

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.570 align:middle line:84%
in making all your
dreams come true.

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:25.220 align:middle line:10%
