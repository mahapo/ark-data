00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>>Hello, I'm Gay Hendricks.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.450 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you the story
of how I lost 120 pounds

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.340 align:middle line:84%
and have kept it off
for more than 40 years.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.420 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you the
essential secrets that I believe

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.620 align:middle line:84%
will assist you in finding an
agreeable weight and a body you

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.600 align:middle line:90%
love.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.460 align:middle line:84%
I was fat pretty
much from the moment

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.440 align:middle line:90%
I arrived on planet Earth.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.500 align:middle line:10%
I was one of those babies
that put on weight quickly.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of
my first year, I

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.150 align:middle line:84%
was in the top 2%
of baby weights.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.120 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you
had 100 babies lined

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.810 align:middle line:90%
I was fatter than 97 of them.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.030 align:middle line:84%
As I proceeded
through my childhood,

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.550 align:middle line:90%
I continued to be overweight.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.720 align:middle line:84%
To make matters worse, everybody
else in my family was skinny.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.180 align:middle line:84%
I continued to
struggle with my weight

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.850 align:middle line:84%
throughout high
school and college.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, I would go on a
diet and lose some weight,

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.300 align:middle line:84%
but I always gained it back,
and usually put on a few more

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.790 align:middle line:90%
pounds than when I started.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.190 align:middle line:84%
By the time I was
24 years old, I

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.240 align:middle line:84%
weighed 320 pounds--
140 pounds more

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.840 align:middle line:84%
than the healthy 180
pounds I weigh today.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Then, one day, not long
after my 24th birthday,

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.840 align:middle line:84%
something happened that changed
the direction of my life

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.100 align:middle line:90%
completely.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.960 align:middle line:84%
I was working at the
time as a teacher

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.690 align:middle line:84%
and counselor at a school
for delinquent boys in New

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.950 align:middle line:90%
Hampshire.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.700 align:middle line:84%
I also was in the third year
of a very troubled relationship

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.620 align:middle line:90%
that I wanted to get out of.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.520 align:middle line:84%
However, part of my job required
living in an apartment attached

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.290 align:middle line:90%
to one of the dormitories.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.850 align:middle line:84%
I was in charge 24/7, except
for one weekend a semester.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.970 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't go anywhere
without quitting my job,

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.760 align:middle line:84%
and my then wife wasn't
willing to leave.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.410 align:middle line:84%
She didn't have any
place to go either.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.560 align:middle line:90%
I think we both felt trapped.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:84%
So one cold day in
January, I went out

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.410 align:middle line:84%
for a walk on a country road
to clear my head after one

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.660 align:middle line:90%
of our many arguments.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.700 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't paying
attention to my footsteps

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.800 align:middle line:84%
and I stepped on that
place on the ice that

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.110 align:middle line:90%
was covered over with snow.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.200 align:middle line:84%
My feet shot out from under
me, and I landed on my back

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.880 align:middle line:90%
on the hard road.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.550 align:middle line:84%
I hit the back of my
head and saw stars,

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.070 align:middle line:84%
even though it didn't
knock me out completely.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.790 align:middle line:84%
What it did was
knock me into myself.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.070 align:middle line:84%
As I lay there on
that frozen road,

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.950 align:middle line:84%
I had a truly unique
experience, something

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.150 align:middle line:84%
I'd never felt or even thought
of feeling before in my life.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.080 align:middle line:84%
For about two minutes, as I lay
on that deserted country road,

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.360 align:middle line:84%
I had the experience
of seeing down

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.880 align:middle line:90%
into all the levels of myself.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.830 align:middle line:84%
I could see that
the layer of fat

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.860 align:middle line:84%
and the tense muscles
I carried were barriers

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.040 align:middle line:84%
to keep me from feeling all
the emotions I harbored deep

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.690 align:middle line:90%
inside me.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.020 align:middle line:84%
I could see that I carried
a great deal of old sadness

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.340 align:middle line:84%
and anger in me as well as
fears that had sometimes popped

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.890 align:middle line:90%
into my dreams as I slept.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.370 align:middle line:84%
I had never acknowledged or
confronted these feelings

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.430 align:middle line:84%
in my waking life though,
and certainly, never

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.130 align:middle line:84%
talked about them
with anyone else.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.980 align:middle line:84%
I realized that
I ate obsessively

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.010 align:middle line:84%
to avoid feeling
all those emotions.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.110 align:middle line:84%
I think my unconscious
mind had it

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.980 align:middle line:84%
wired up so that if I stayed
fat and worried about my weight

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.130 align:middle line:84%
all the time, it would
keep me from having to deal

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.430 align:middle line:90%
with the feelings inside.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.150 align:middle line:84%
The first secret I learned
that day is one that I want you

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.820 align:middle line:84%
and every other person who
struggles with their weight

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.680 align:middle line:90%
to hear.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.940 align:middle line:84%
At the very center of ourselves,
we are spiritual beings.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.670 align:middle line:84%
That space of pure
consciousness in us

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.720 align:middle line:84%
makes us spiritual beings,
regardless of what religion

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.730 align:middle line:84%
we are or whatever our
past programming has been.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.600 align:middle line:84%
Because we have been hiding
our spiritual essence

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.040 align:middle line:84%
underneath our layers of extra
fat and unexplored emotions,

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.060 align:middle line:84%
and because we want so much to
have our spiritual essence be

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.970 align:middle line:84%
visible in the world, we become
obsessed with our weight.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.570 align:middle line:84%
The second secret is to
have a commitment that

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.710 align:middle line:84%
is big enough to make
all the work worthwhile.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.380 align:middle line:84%
One thing I've learned in
40 years of helping people

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.220 align:middle line:84%
with their weight is
that nothing ever happens

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.060 align:middle line:90%
without a sincere commitment.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.140 align:middle line:84%
The third secret is that there
are specific and very simple

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.020 align:middle line:84%
tools that will help
you not only losing

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.340 align:middle line:84%
weight, but also enjoying
and learning along the way.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Many people associate
losing weight

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.290 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of suffering
and denying yourself

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.990 align:middle line:90%
of good things.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.000 align:middle line:84%
You never need to
suffer or deny yourself

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.570 align:middle line:90%
anything with this approach.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.870 align:middle line:84%
The fourth secret
is so important

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.240 align:middle line:84%
that I urge you to apply it not
only to your journey of weight

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.880 align:middle line:84%
loss, but to every
aspect of your life.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.630 align:middle line:84%
It may sound strange
to talk about love,

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.500 align:middle line:84%
but in a very special way,
love plays a huge role

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.840 align:middle line:90%
in creating your healthy body.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.350 align:middle line:84%
The reason is this-- to
create your healthy body,

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.660 align:middle line:84%
you must learn to love the
body you have, just as it is.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.770 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.160 align:middle line:84%
The real magic of
effortless weight loss

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.970 align:middle line:84%
is to learn to love those
things about yourself that you

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.550 align:middle line:90%
find most unlovable.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.320 align:middle line:90%
I'll show you how to do that.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And once you learn it, you'll
have a life-changing skill

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.140 align:middle line:84%
you can employ to
make positive shifts

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.480 align:middle line:90%
in every area of your life.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's return to
the issue of commitment.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.250 align:middle line:84%
In this program, I'm
committed to helping

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.010 align:middle line:84%
you end your weight
struggles and achieve

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.350 align:middle line:90%
the healthy body you want.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.980 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to make a
real working commitment

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.410 align:middle line:90%
to creating your healthy body.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Please get out a piece of paper
and something to write with.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.870 align:middle line:84%
When you're ready, write down
the following commitment--

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.190 align:middle line:84%
"I commit to discovering a
new and loving relationship

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.290 align:middle line:90%
with my body."

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.270 align:middle line:84%
That commitment
will open the door

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.080 align:middle line:84%
to a wealth of life-changing
learning for you.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.820 align:middle line:84%
If all those things
sound like things

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.750 align:middle line:84%
you'd like for yourselves, take
an important next step with me.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Learn to use your natural,
organic, body wisdom

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.870 align:middle line:84%
to start creating
your ideal body.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Body intelligence
is your ability

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.130 align:middle line:84%
to be more sensitive
to your body,

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.980 align:middle line:84%
and to master the
natural, organic skills

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.380 align:middle line:90%
your body provides for you.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.420 align:middle line:84%
The first element
of body intelligence

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.770 align:middle line:84%
is to learn how to use your
natural gift of breathing.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.914 align:middle line:84%
In our next episode, I'm going
to teach you the "yes" breath.

00:06:59.914 --> 00:07:03.810 align:middle line:10%
