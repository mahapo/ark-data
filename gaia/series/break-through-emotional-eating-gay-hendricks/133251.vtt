00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>>Welcome back to Break
Through Emotional Eating.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm Gay Hendricks.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.010 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we're going
to discuss the Yes Breath.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Deep, easy breathing
can make you feel

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.730 align:middle line:90%
vibrant throughout your day.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.470 align:middle line:84%
The Yes Breath
technique, which we

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.090 align:middle line:84%
taught to thousands of our
students over the years,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.730 align:middle line:84%
is the very best thing
that I can do the quickest

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.350 align:middle line:84%
to help you be in touch
with your emotions,

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and to help you be in touch with
and to express yourself more

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.230 align:middle line:90%
authentically in the world.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Some of the process involves
doing the Yes Breath

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.290 align:middle line:84%
at the same time you're
thinking a new affirmation

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.250 align:middle line:90%
or considering a new idea.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.320 align:middle line:84%
The very first secret
I want to show you

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.150 align:middle line:84%
about healthy breathing
is to let your spine move

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.890 align:middle line:90%
as you breathe.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Let your belly relax and
expand with the in-breath.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Most people hold
their back too stiff

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.930 align:middle line:84%
and their belly muscles too
tight when they breathe.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.090 align:middle line:84%
That's a stressful habit
that keeps the diaphragm

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.490 align:middle line:84%
from moving through the
full range of motion.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.070 align:middle line:84%
What that does is
force the breath up

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.640 align:middle line:84%
into the chest, where you can
never really get a full breath.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.210 align:middle line:84%
So here's the
quick fix for that.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Here's how the Yes Breath looks.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.320 align:middle line:90%
Begin with movement first.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Gently and slowly arch and
flatten the small of your back,

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.230 align:middle line:84%
taking six or seven seconds to
arch and six or seven seconds

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.770 align:middle line:90%
to flatten.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.390 align:middle line:84%
This causes you to rock forward
and back on your sit bones.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.410 align:middle line:84%
So rock your pelvis all the way
to the front and all the way

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.730 align:middle line:84%
to the back, but take
six or seven seconds

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.180 align:middle line:90%
to do this, very peacefully.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.660 align:middle line:84%
As you arch the
small of your back,

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.700 align:middle line:84%
tilt your chin up slightly
toward the ceiling.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.979 align:middle line:84%
And as you flatten the
small of your back,

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.100 align:middle line:84%
tilt your chin down
toward the floor.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.480 align:middle line:84%
So now you're
beginning to see why

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.530 align:middle line:90%
it's called the "Yes Breath".

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.710 align:middle line:84%
It's because as you
do it, your body

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.130 align:middle line:84%
is making a kind of a whole
body yes, as in nodding.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's add your
breathing to the movement.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.990 align:middle line:84%
Breathe all the way
into your relaxed body

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.020 align:middle line:84%
as you arch the small of
your back and look up.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And breathe all
the way out as you

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.710 align:middle line:84%
flatten the small of
your back and look down.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.710 align:middle line:84%
These don't have to
be big movements.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm exaggerating them
so you can see them.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's what I'd like you
to do with your breathing.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.410 align:middle line:84%
If you do the Yes
Breath at a slow pace,

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.940 align:middle line:84%
like six or seven seconds in
and six or seven seconds out,

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.450 align:middle line:84%
you quiet the stress
response in your body.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.930 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, you turn
on a feeling of harmony,

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.090 align:middle line:90%
ease, and vibrancy.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Most people begin to notice the
effects after about 30 seconds

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.530 align:middle line:90%
or so.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.450 align:middle line:84%
The slower and gentler
you can do the breathing,

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.060 align:middle line:84%
the quicker your body will start
to feel that peaceful feeling.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.120 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a
moment to practice it.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.820 align:middle line:10%
Right where you are,
put your left hand

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.170 align:middle line:10%
over your heart
and your right hand

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.600 align:middle line:10%
down around your belly button.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I want
you to do, I want

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.520 align:middle line:84%
you to breathe so that
your hands go further apart

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.270 align:middle line:84%
and then come back
together as you breathe.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.180 align:middle line:84%
So let your hands swell
apart on the in-breath

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.010 align:middle line:84%
and then come closer
together on the out-breath.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.240 align:middle line:10%
At the same time you're flexing
your spine with the breathing,

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.200 align:middle line:10%
you're arching the
small of your back

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.040 align:middle line:10%
as you breathe in with
the relaxed belly.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.930 align:middle line:10%
And then, you're flattening
the small of your back

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.780 align:middle line:10%
as you breathe
out and look down.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:90%


00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.700 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's add commitment.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.580 align:middle line:84%
It's important to learn
how to breathe correctly,

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.680 align:middle line:84%
because then you can integrate
your body's intelligence

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.710 align:middle line:90%
with your mind's intelligence.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, you can use it
to make your commitments more

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.640 align:middle line:90%
powerful and lasting.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Begin using your Yes Breath
right now-- easy, slow,

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.450 align:middle line:84%
six- to seven-second breaths
in and easy, slow, six to seven

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.647 align:middle line:84%
breaths out, letting
your spine move with it.

00:04:33.647 --> 00:04:39.100 align:middle line:90%


00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.720 align:middle line:84%
You can even keep
your hands there

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.630 align:middle line:84%
if you'd like to remind
yourself how to do it.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Let your hands go apart
when you breathe in

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.140 align:middle line:84%
and come closer together
when you breathe out.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.080 align:middle line:84%
As you do that peaceful
breath, relaxing

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.530 align:middle line:84%
with the flow of
easy breath, I'd

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.870 align:middle line:84%
like you to say the following
sentences in your mind.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.050 align:middle line:90%
Say them about every 15 seconds.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.660 align:middle line:84%
So get your breathing
going and now flow

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.390 align:middle line:84%
this thought through
your mind very gently,

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.890 align:middle line:84%
whispering it to yourself--
"I commit to discovering a new

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.530 align:middle line:84%
and loving relationship
with my body.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.340 align:middle line:84%
I commit to discovering a
new and loving relationship

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.260 align:middle line:90%
with my body."

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Say it, and then
take two easy breaths

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.960 align:middle line:90%
to let it settle into your body.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.220 align:middle line:90%


00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.130 align:middle line:84%
Feel free to return to this
part of the program over

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.910 align:middle line:84%
and over again, as
many times as you need,

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.750 align:middle line:84%
until you can really feel
that easy breath while you're

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.590 align:middle line:90%
saying the commitment.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Let's begin right now to
develop that new and loving

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.070 align:middle line:84%
relationship with your
body that you've just

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.450 align:middle line:90%
committed to enjoying.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Take this moment right
now to love yourself

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.710 align:middle line:84%
for all the attempts
you've made in the past.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.850 align:middle line:84%
Love yourself for
all the attempts

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.840 align:middle line:84%
you ever made so far to
deal with your weight.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Love, honor, and appreciate
yourself for all that effort,

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.030 align:middle line:84%
even if it hasn't paid
off, even if there's

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.820 align:middle line:84%
been tremendous pain and
suffering associated with it.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.030 align:middle line:84%
I want you to at least
honor and salute yourself

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.910 align:middle line:90%
for having done that.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.770 align:middle line:84%
It signifies that
deep down in you, you

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.530 align:middle line:84%
have a deep desire to
bring your spirit out

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.990 align:middle line:90%
so everyone can see it.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you are,
take this moment

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.210 align:middle line:84%
to love yourself for all
the attempts you've ever

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.310 align:middle line:90%
made in the past.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go back to enjoying
your deep, easy breathing.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.450 align:middle line:84%
It quiets down your body's
stress chemistry quicker

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.670 align:middle line:90%
than almost anything else.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And to me, learning
is better when

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.740 align:middle line:84%
you're feeling good
and having a good time.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm not one of those who
believe that learning has

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.200 align:middle line:90%
to be accompanied by suffering.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.170 align:middle line:84%
So let's do our
best in this program

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.100 align:middle line:84%
to always stay in your
zone of ease and comfort.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Breathing is one of the
best ways to do that.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.110 align:middle line:84%
As you breathe, I'd like you to
ask yourself a really important

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:14.440 align:middle line:90%
question now.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Consider all the
energy you've put

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.580 align:middle line:84%
into worrying about your
weight, now and in the past.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.340 align:middle line:84%
If you could re-channel that
energy into creative projects,

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.650 align:middle line:84%
what are the top three projects
you would choose to produce?

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:32.170 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you could
stop worrying about your weight

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.730 align:middle line:84%
and re-channel that energy
into creative projects

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.980 align:middle line:84%
that you'd like to
accomplish, what

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.935 align:middle line:84%
are the three that are
most important to you?

00:07:41.935 --> 00:07:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Focus on those
questions for a moment.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.200 align:middle line:84%
One of the most important
things I discovered

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.590 align:middle line:84%
is that our extra weight is
stored creative potential.

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.530 align:middle line:84%
The energy you put into
worrying about your weight

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.230 align:middle line:84%
can be redirected
so that it's fuel

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:59.540 align:middle line:90%
for your creative projects.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.060 align:middle line:84%
With that in mind,
ask yourself, what

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.940 align:middle line:84%
are the creative dreams
that live within me?

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.750 align:middle line:84%
If I had access to
all the energy I now

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.080 align:middle line:84%
consume worrying
about my weight,

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.360 align:middle line:84%
what would I most love
to focus that energy on?

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.110 align:middle line:84%
I invite you to write in a
journal after our sessions

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.150 align:middle line:84%
and do some work getting
clear on your top three

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.350 align:middle line:90%
creative endeavors.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.600 align:middle line:84%
In our next episode,
I'm going to talk to you

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.150 align:middle line:90%
about emotional awareness.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:30.500 align:middle line:10%
