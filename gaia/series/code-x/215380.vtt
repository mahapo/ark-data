00:00:08.712 --> 00:00:22.160 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm Robert Grant,
and this is Code X.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.150 align:middle line:84%
We started this season with
the concept of the pyramid

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.160 align:middle line:90%
of perception.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, this episode, we're
going to go even deeper

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.870 align:middle line:84%
into this concept of
the gradation of light,

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.750 align:middle line:84%
and how our experience
within duality

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.780 align:middle line:84%
can often leave us feeling
very, very sad and upset and as

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.500 align:middle line:84%
though we're suffering through
life because we're missing

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.590 align:middle line:90%
the proper context of that.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.870 align:middle line:90%


00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.550 align:middle line:10%
Pythagoras spent almost
30 years in Egypt.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.660 align:middle line:10%
Historically, he was well
known not only for his work

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.590 align:middle line:10%
around the Pythagorean theorem,
a squared plus b squared

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.210 align:middle line:10%
equals c squared.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's used around the
world in architecture,

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.500 align:middle line:84%
in all kinds of
design templates,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.960 align:middle line:90%
as well as in artistry.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.990 align:middle line:10%
But Pythagoras was
also a musician.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.680 align:middle line:10%
And he is the one that gave us
the Just tuning scale, which

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.990 align:middle line:10%
included all of the
mathematical intervals.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras learned that by
walking by a blacksmith,

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.950 align:middle line:84%
he would hear the clanging
of a hammer against an anvil,

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.330 align:middle line:84%
and it would make different
sounds, which fascinated him.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.540 align:middle line:84%
It led him to look
at strings, and he

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.820 align:middle line:84%
found that if he
plucked a string

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.550 align:middle line:84%
and then halve
that string, as he

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.680 align:middle line:84%
went to the half
point of that string,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.810 align:middle line:90%
it would double the octave.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.130 align:middle line:84%
It would be the next
octave of expression.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And he could keep doing
that by having and having.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.110 align:middle line:84%
If he did it as a
third, then it would

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.890 align:middle line:90%
be a major third relationship.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And all of the
relationships musically

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.770 align:middle line:84%
could be depicted on strings
that we now use on guitar frets.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.720 align:middle line:84%
These concepts are fundamental
to universal architecture.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Math and music and geometry
are irrevocably interlinked.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.770 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
that can be separated.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.430 align:middle line:84%
It's only our perception
that's causing us

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.230 align:middle line:90%
to see it as separate aspects.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.570 align:middle line:84%
But actually, it's simply
separate representations

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.745 align:middle line:84%
of the same one divine
universal matrix of mind.

00:02:36.745 --> 00:02:39.830 align:middle line:90%


00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.080 align:middle line:10%
When we look at this
and go more deeply

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.390 align:middle line:10%
into this concept
of why Pythagoras

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.740 align:middle line:10%
was able to find all of these
different aspects of music,

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.860 align:middle line:10%
we also know that he
was a leader of what

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.520 align:middle line:10%
many deem to have been a
cult, the Pythagorean cult.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.170 align:middle line:10%
And they believed
themselves to be

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.430 align:middle line:10%
the keepers of intense
wisdom around very

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.840 align:middle line:10%
esoteric mathematics, including
square roots of numbers.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.210 align:middle line:84%
What he found also
was the tetractys.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.580 align:middle line:84%
The tetractys was a triangle
that basically could be depicted

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.150 align:middle line:84%
with four dots, and then
atop those four dots

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.300 align:middle line:84%
were three dots, and then
two dots, and then one dot.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And 4, 3, 2, 1 was
this numerical exchange

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.830 align:middle line:90%
that added to 10.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.820 align:middle line:10%
And 4 times 3 times
2 times 1, to find

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.420 align:middle line:10%
the product of these
dots, would actually

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.610 align:middle line:10%
represent the number 24.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.270 align:middle line:84%
24 is a fundamental
aspect that is

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.890 align:middle line:84%
found in physics in the
cuboctahedral structure of Bucky

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Fuller, and what we refer to
today as the vector equilibrium.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.780 align:middle line:84%
The geometric form that
from its center point

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.400 align:middle line:84%
is equidistant from
each of its vertices.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.660 align:middle line:90%
It has 24 edges.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we flatten that, it
will make it mod 24 wheel.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And on this mod 24 wheel is
what I discovered the ability

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.530 align:middle line:84%
to be able to predict
prime numbers infinitely

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.280 align:middle line:84%
and accurately by defining a new
type of number that showed up

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.029 align:middle line:84%
in the same modular spokes or
positions as all prime numbers.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And these were called
quasi prime numbers.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.780 align:middle line:84%
24 is fundamental
to our experience.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.590 align:middle line:84%
It's not only experience
from a time perspective

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.640 align:middle line:84%
because we have
24 hours in a day,

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.030 align:middle line:84%
but 24 seems to point us
also to a divine knowledge.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.000 align:middle line:84%
X is the 24th letter of
the alphabet in English.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Because as we start to realize
that our chakras are expanding

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.090 align:middle line:84%
from seven chakra
positions, from the root

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.710 align:middle line:84%
chakra to the crown chakra,
now expanding all the way out

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.590 align:middle line:84%
to 24 levels of
expression, 24 chakras.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, along with these 24 chakras
will come an expansion in DNA.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:10.720 align:middle line:10%
DNA also expanding to 24
positions, or what we call

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.550 align:middle line:10%
strands within DNA.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And we find that all
of this is actually

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.940 align:middle line:84%
just inherent to the stacking of
dodecahedra that create the DNA

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.570 align:middle line:90%
structure in the first place.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.500 align:middle line:84%
When we realize that the
dodecahedron does not

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.070 align:middle line:84%
exist without its
icosahedron pairing, which

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.040 align:middle line:84%
is what's called a
dual solid complement,

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.110 align:middle line:84%
you simply connect
the center points

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.580 align:middle line:84%
of each of the sides
of a dodecahedron,

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.580 align:middle line:84%
and you will have an
icosahedron, which

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.680 align:middle line:90%
represents water clusters.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.830 align:middle line:10%
When we look at the
protruding stellations

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.200 align:middle line:10%
on this icosidodecahedral
stacking array,

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.280 align:middle line:10%
we'll find that when you go
both directions with that weave,

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.240 align:middle line:10%
or the what we call
the strands of DNA

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.790 align:middle line:10%
connecting each of
those stellations going

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.420 align:middle line:10%
both directions, you end
up with 24 strand DNA.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:06.180 align:middle line:84%
24 is a number that shows up
over and over and over again.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And it relates back
to prime numbers.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.410 align:middle line:10%
Every prime number
larger than three squared

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.050 align:middle line:10%
will be a multiple of 24
plus 1 without exception.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.010 align:middle line:84%
As an example, 5
times 5 equals 25.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.120 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's 1 times 24 plus 1.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.970 align:middle line:90%
7 times 7 is 49.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.720 align:middle line:90%
And that's 2 times 24 plus 1.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.720 align:middle line:84%
If we take that all the way
further, 11 times 11 is 121.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.110 align:middle line:90%
That's 5 times 24 plus 1.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And then 13 times 13,
the next prime number,

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.880 align:middle line:84%
equals 169, which is
7 times 24 plus 1.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.560 align:middle line:84%
What we found Talal
Ghannam, PhD, mathematician,

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.210 align:middle line:84%
and physicist that I
work very closely with,

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.230 align:middle line:84%
we found that if we
expand this analysis all

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:59.290 align:middle line:84%
the way through infinity, we
find that every prime number

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.410 align:middle line:84%
will always square
to a number that will

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.680 align:middle line:90%
be a multiple of 24 plus 1.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:10.660 align:middle line:84%
24-ness is fundamental
to our experience.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we find with 24-ness
is that in music as well,

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.240 align:middle line:84%
it seems that because we have
different pentatonic scales

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.160 align:middle line:84%
in all the indigenous
cultures in the world,

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.210 align:middle line:84%
which would be similar if you
think about pentatonic to what

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.780 align:middle line:84%
we know popularly as
the song that was played

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.360 align:middle line:84%
by the Temptations that
goes, bum bum, ba dum,

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.360 align:middle line:84%
ba dum bum bum ba
dum, ba dum bum.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.720 align:middle line:90%
That is a pentatonic scale.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.760 align:middle line:84%
We in Western music
will take a scale

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.410 align:middle line:90%
and we think of it as 12 notes.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And those 12 notes would
be a chromatic scale.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:53.770 align:middle line:84%
But when we think
about a 24-note scale,

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:59.440 align:middle line:84%
for the first time in this age,
we're able to actually combine

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:04.270 align:middle line:84%
all of the pentatonic scales
along with the Western music

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.710 align:middle line:90%
scale.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, it is interesting that the
Vedic mathematicians have used

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.620 align:middle line:90%
historically a 24-note scale.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.540 align:middle line:10%
It's also interesting that
Egyptians and Arabs used

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.050 align:middle line:10%
a 24-note scale.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.920 align:middle line:10%
This would be a
quarter tone scale.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.350 align:middle line:10%
So you can imagine that for
every note in that scale,

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.450 align:middle line:10%
there's a different color that
would be associated with that.

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:30.670 align:middle line:90%


00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:36.400 align:middle line:84%
In order to take us more deeply
into this introspective review,

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.690 align:middle line:84%
I want to take us back to the
foundational basis of duality.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:46.160 align:middle line:10%
I mentioned in the last episode
that 2 can represent duality.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.990 align:middle line:10%
Let's imagine that we start
with a sphere, or just a circle

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:51.880 align:middle line:10%
on a piece of paper.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And we cut this sphere in two
by dividing it with one line

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:90%
down its center.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:02.050 align:middle line:84%
That one line down
the center creating

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:06.580 align:middle line:84%
this division of two
semicircles is actually

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:10.190 align:middle line:84%
creating this concept
of light and dark.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:13.810 align:middle line:84%
We can imagine that there's
now a mirror, that this line is

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:18.160 align:middle line:84%
acting as a mirror between
light's reflection and light's

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.160 align:middle line:90%
absorption.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.750 align:middle line:84%
So we can have on one
side a black semicircle,

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:25.210 align:middle line:84%
and on the other side
a white semicircle.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:29.830 align:middle line:84%
If we spin it in motion,
it'll appear as a yin yang.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's
interesting about this

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.020 align:middle line:84%
is that we tend to perceive
the world around us

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.140 align:middle line:84%
from a duality perspective,
and we don't really

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.690 align:middle line:84%
realize that the
number 2 is actually

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:43.730 align:middle line:84%
a compression for an
infinitely long number.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.940 align:middle line:84%
The knowledge and
information that

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:51.310 align:middle line:84%
can be derived from just
the number 2 is infinite,

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:54.610 align:middle line:84%
and it can be found in
its square root function.

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:58.250 align:middle line:84%
The square root
of two is 1.4142.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, this could then
be said is the infinite

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:05.060 align:middle line:84%
or spiritual or essence
aspect of the number 2.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.800 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't die.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.620 align:middle line:84%
It's not quantifiable
because it's infinite.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.580 align:middle line:90%
The number never stops.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we look
more deeply into this

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.300 align:middle line:84%
to understand it
better, we could

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.630 align:middle line:84%
say that the essence of duality,
of the separation of light

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:23.500 align:middle line:84%
from darkness, the
first differentiation

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.030 align:middle line:84%
across this mirror
of consciousness,

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.990 align:middle line:84%
the conscious mind and the
light and the subconscious

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.510 align:middle line:84%
and the unconscious
mind and the dark.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we look
at this, we could

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:37.450 align:middle line:84%
say that the duality experience
is not the most pleasant.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:38.690 align:middle line:90%
We suffer.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:40.640 align:middle line:90%
There is starving in this world.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.350 align:middle line:90%
There's death in this world.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:46.030 align:middle line:84%
There are consequences
in this world.

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:49.900 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it seems and
feels like happenstance.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Until we make our unconscious
aspects conscious,

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.510 align:middle line:90%
we will call it fate.

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And we will experience
the same experiences

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:04.120 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.670 align:middle line:84%
It becomes incumbent upon
us to start to notice

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.860 align:middle line:90%
the patterns of our lifetime.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, within this duality
experience of the square root

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.460 align:middle line:84%
or the essence of duality,
the square root of 2,

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:18.460 align:middle line:84%
without proper
context, we could feel

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:23.500 align:middle line:84%
like this is a lead
weight in our backpack.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.930 align:middle line:84%
We're carrying
all this challenge

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:28.180 align:middle line:84%
and difficulty and
trauma associated

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.760 align:middle line:90%
with the duality experience.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Some believe that this matrix
of mind is too much for them,

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:38.110 align:middle line:84%
and therefore they'd rather
just escape and get off

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:41.260 align:middle line:90%
the planet somehow, some way.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:47.050 align:middle line:84%
But maybe the only way to
transcend the duality experience

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:52.500 align:middle line:84%
is to learn to fall in love
with it, just as it is.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.740 align:middle line:10%
The square root of two
also resembles the symbol

00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:00.390 align:middle line:10%
used to represent Saturn
in alchemy, which also

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:03.840 align:middle line:10%
is another symbolism for lead.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.060 align:middle line:10%
Saturn represents lead.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And the god of
Saturn is also known

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:12.900 align:middle line:90%
as Cronos, the god of time.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:18.540 align:middle line:84%
This god of time is the god that
is responsible and sometimes

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.400 align:middle line:90%
referred to as father time.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:25.230 align:middle line:84%
For the duality experience
that we have throughout time,

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:28.860 align:middle line:84%
we tend to separate the
world into this circle

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:33.360 align:middle line:84%
of black and white, the two
semicircles that could also

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.880 align:middle line:84%
be representative
of past and future.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.410 align:middle line:84%
When in reality, these
are only perceptions.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Now is the only experience
that we ever have.

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Cronos gives us the
backdrop of duality.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.390 align:middle line:84%
It leads to all of the
conditions of scarcity,

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:57.690 align:middle line:84%
puts a time clock
on tests, makes

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:00.280 align:middle line:84%
life challenging
and more difficult.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And without such a clock, life
would not have the same context

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:08.730 align:middle line:84%
and reference point,
because we would never

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:11.200 align:middle line:84%
feel like we were
running out of time.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And yet, in this world,
due to Cronos and Saturn,

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:20.970 align:middle line:84%
we experience the lead of that
duality and we call it time.

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.640 align:middle line:10%
But if we look at
the square root of 2

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.350 align:middle line:10%
within the context of
the square root of 3,

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:29.830 align:middle line:10%
the square root of three being
the divine trinity essence,

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:35.010 align:middle line:10%
the essence of the triangle, the
Father, the Mother, and the Son.

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.900 align:middle line:10%
This trinity aspect,
when I say the mother,

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.320 align:middle line:10%
it could also be a reference to
the Holy Ghost, the Father, Son,

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.640 align:middle line:10%
Holy Ghost, the
Father, Mother, Son.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.980 align:middle line:84%
We know that the universe is
ultimately always balanced.

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.520 align:middle line:84%
As Isaac Newton
and Einstein said,

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:54.750 align:middle line:84%
every action requires an
equal opposite reaction.

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And we see this time and
time again in science.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, as we look at this
circle that we've just

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.670 align:middle line:84%
split into two semicircles,
one side being black

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.760 align:middle line:84%
and the other side being
white, and the center

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.590 align:middle line:90%
point being this mirror.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.680 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the context
of the square root of 2

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:18.510 align:middle line:84%
and add it as a sum to
the square root of 3,

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:25.230 align:middle line:84%
the square root of 2 plus the
square root of 3 adds to 3.146.

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, you might recognize
that's awfully close to pi.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:33.450 align:middle line:90%
Pi is 3.1416.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.840 align:middle line:84%
The only difference is
that we're missing the 1

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.270 align:middle line:90%
in between the 4 and the 6.

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:43.570 align:middle line:84%
But ostensibly, it
is very, very close.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And as we look more
closely at this,

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:50.070 align:middle line:84%
we realize that the proportion
of the circle that represents

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:53.340 align:middle line:84%
the square root of 2 adding
to the square root of 3

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:58.380 align:middle line:90%
comes out to 161.8 degrees.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And you might recognize that
as related to Fibonacci numbers

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:05.290 align:middle line:84%
and also related to
the golden ratio.

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:09.340 align:middle line:10%
The golden ratio is something
we find everywhere in nature,

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:14.430 align:middle line:10%
from the waist to the hip
ratio on beautiful statues

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:17.380 align:middle line:10%
that are made in
ancient Greece and Rome,

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.920 align:middle line:10%
to the artwork of
Leonardo da Vinci

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:24.030 align:middle line:10%
and the use of the golden ratio
proportion in all of Leonardo's

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:29.740 align:middle line:10%
paintings, to different aspects
that we see even in biology,

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.160 align:middle line:10%
which includes the number
of branches on a tree

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.060 align:middle line:10%
as the tree grows and
expands up toward the sky.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.660 align:middle line:84%
But additionally, we
can even find it in DNA.

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:43.860 align:middle line:84%
For the measurement of
a single segment of DNA

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:51.490 align:middle line:84%
has a length of 34
angstroms and a width of 21,

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:58.900 align:middle line:84%
and that relationship is
approximately 1.618, 34 over 21.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.150 align:middle line:84%
All Fibonacci
numbers will always

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:03.880 align:middle line:90%
carry that same proportionality.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:07.220 align:middle line:84%
But now we've taken the duality,
the suffering, the difficulty,

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:10.690 align:middle line:84%
the square root of 2 and added
it to the square root of 3,

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:13.960 align:middle line:90%
the context of the divine.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And now we've taken
lead and just turned it

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:19.540 align:middle line:90%
to the golden ratio.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.970 align:middle line:90%
Lead turns to gold.

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:26.930 align:middle line:84%
With the context of divinity,
we can see that actually

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:30.910 align:middle line:84%
what we thought was suffering
and difficulty was always

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:34.180 align:middle line:84%
for our highest and
best benefit all along.

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.470 align:middle line:84%
The universe isn't
happening to us.

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.600 align:middle line:84%
The universe is
happening for us.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.710 align:middle line:84%
Everything we experience
in this matrix game

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:46.600 align:middle line:84%
is for our highest and best
benefit towards us realizing

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.540 align:middle line:90%
our own divinity within.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Time has the
ability to polarize.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And time itself is no
different than this circle

00:16:56.020 --> 00:17:00.160 align:middle line:90%
being cut into two semicircles.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.050 align:middle line:90%
What do I mean?

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:06.339 align:middle line:84%
The ultimate duality
experience is time.

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:10.480 align:middle line:90%
Past versus future versus now.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.930 align:middle line:10%
The past doesn't really
exist, and the future likewise

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.020 align:middle line:10%
doesn't really exist.

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:19.000 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that exists
is the moment of now.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.849 align:middle line:84%
And yet we tend to spend our
days worrying about the future

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:29.080 align:middle line:84%
and maybe looking back
with regret on the past.

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.660 align:middle line:84%
It's only up to each
and every one of us

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:37.450 align:middle line:84%
to learn why we chose what we
chose in the matrix of mind.

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go back for a
moment to this concept of 24.

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Because as we've just
analyzed from the square root

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.640 align:middle line:84%
values and extend
that now all the way

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:55.440 align:middle line:84%
into the prime number patterns
that were always multiples

00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:01.290 align:middle line:84%
of 24 plus 1, we could start to
see as well another aspect that

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.240 align:middle line:90%
emerges out of this.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's widely known
that Pythagoras himself was

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.680 align:middle line:90%
a proponent of 432 hertz music.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.190 align:middle line:84%
He believed that A
should be properly tuned

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:17.290 align:middle line:90%
at its first octave as 27 hertz.

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:20.970 align:middle line:84%
He found that that was
the lowest vibration that

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:26.280 align:middle line:84%
could be audibly conceived
and understood and be heard.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And as he plucked that string
and then have that string,

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:34.410 align:middle line:84%
from 27 hertz, it
would go up to 54.

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:38.470 align:middle line:84%
So the doubling of the math
would take that from 27 to 54.

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And then 54, halving the
string again, would go to 108.

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And then 108, having that
string again, goes to 216 hertz.

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And then 216 hertz, doubling
the octave again to 432.

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:52.950 align:middle line:90%
And then 864.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, is it any wonder that in
the first season of Code X,

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:59.070 align:middle line:84%
we talked a lot
about these numbers?

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:03.330 align:middle line:84%
Because 864 relates to the
number of seconds we have in one

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:06.990 align:middle line:90%
day, 86,400 seconds.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:12.370 align:middle line:84%
It also relates to the diameter
of our sun, 864,000 miles.

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I were going to
create a perfect time system,

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:19.200 align:middle line:84%
would I not somehow ascribe
it value to the orbit

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.540 align:middle line:90%
I would have around the sun?

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.742 align:middle line:84%
So one second maybe
for every mile

00:19:24.742 --> 00:19:26.700 align:middle line:84%
of the diameter of the
thing that I'm basically

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.610 align:middle line:90%
orbiting around?

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:29.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what
time turned out to be.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.280 align:middle line:90%
Pretty genius, I'd say.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.910 align:middle line:84%
So as we look at
this 24-note scale,

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:39.220 align:middle line:84%
what we find is that
there are two aspects.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.800 align:middle line:10%
If we go back and look
at the Giza Plateau,

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:46.010 align:middle line:10%
the Giza Plateau has
a base length of 432

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:49.200 align:middle line:10%
and the length across
the entire plateau,

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.030 align:middle line:10%
the long section of the
rectangle taking the northeast

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:55.190 align:middle line:10%
corner of the Great Pyramid
down to the southwest

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:58.280 align:middle line:10%
corner of Menkaure Pyramid,
gives us a perfect ratio

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.040 align:middle line:10%
of 432 versus 528.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:06.480 align:middle line:10%
Now, both 432 and 528 are
known as healing frequencies.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And there's been some
degree of argument as to

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:13.130 align:middle line:84%
whether or not the
528 scale should

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:17.720 align:middle line:84%
be more superior for healing
properties than the 432 scale.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I found was
actually that they're

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:24.020 align:middle line:90%
both part of the same scale.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:28.200 align:middle line:84%
When I applied the 1.26
for the major third,

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:34.620 align:middle line:84%
changing its reference point
from 5/4 and 1.25 to the 1.26,

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:39.130 align:middle line:84%
I found that this corrected for
the proper temperament across

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:39.930 align:middle line:90%
the scale.

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:42.470 align:middle line:84%
So I applied that
to 432 and launched

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:45.140 align:middle line:84%
a whole new tuning standard
called Precise Temperament

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.640 align:middle line:90%
Tuning.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
examples of it

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:52.040 align:middle line:84%
that can be found all
over the internet now.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.710 align:middle line:10%
But in addition to that, I
thought, well, let me go ahead

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:57.440 align:middle line:10%
and apply this
same concept to 528

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.560 align:middle line:10%
to see what happens, because
the Giza Plateau must

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.420 align:middle line:10%
have this proportionality
for a reason.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.820 align:middle line:84%
So as I investigated
this further,

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:09.650 align:middle line:84%
I found that when I applied
Precise Temperament Tuning

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:15.710 align:middle line:84%
principle of 1.26 in place of
the 1.25 of the Pythagorean

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Just tuning for
the major third, I

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:27.320 align:middle line:84%
found that actually the result
was a scale that put 528 hertz

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:34.040 align:middle line:84%
exactly in between each
of the notes of 432.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So then we could
say that this could

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:39.380 align:middle line:90%
be represented as two snakes.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:45.090 align:middle line:84%
One snake, let's call it
Ida, represents the feminine,

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:46.470 align:middle line:90%
the divine feminine.

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:48.690 align:middle line:90%
And it's based on 432.

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And then when we look at
528, we can assign that

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:57.440 align:middle line:84%
to the name of Pingala,
the divine masculine.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:04.050 align:middle line:84%
432 and 528 fit seamlessly
and perfectly into one,

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:06.050 align:middle line:90%
not two scales.

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:09.950 align:middle line:90%
It's one scale of 24 notes.

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:17.360 align:middle line:84%
If I were holding a cylinder and
showed it to you from one angle,

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.040 align:middle line:84%
and let's say you only saw
the bottom of the cylinder,

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:23.100 align:middle line:84%
so it would cast a shadow
behind me on the wall.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And the shadow
cast would actually

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.450 align:middle line:90%
make the shape of a circle.

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:30.150 align:middle line:84%
But if I held it to another
group of people from its side,

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:33.680 align:middle line:84%
it would look and cast
a shadow of a rectangle.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, there could be a lot
of debate and discussion

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:40.070 align:middle line:84%
between the onlookers
of this rectangle

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:44.270 align:middle line:84%
and this circle on
what the truth is.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:47.160 align:middle line:84%
But only I, holding
the cylinder,

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:51.140 align:middle line:90%
realize that both are correct.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:54.960 align:middle line:84%
It is both a circle
and a rectangle,

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.780 align:middle line:84%
but the higher
dimensional knowledge

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:59.810 align:middle line:84%
is that it is a
cylinder, in fact.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:04.340 align:middle line:84%
How many of the arguments that
we experience among ourselves

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:09.170 align:middle line:84%
and humanity are based on
these lack of understandings

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:11.790 align:middle line:84%
that we have of higher
dimensional aspects?

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Because we're only seeing
one facet rather than fact.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.430 align:middle line:90%
But we thought it was a fact.

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:25.850 align:middle line:84%
What I propose to you is that
there is no objective truth.

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:29.960 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that could be
considered an objective truth

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:33.920 align:middle line:84%
in the spectrum of
light and sound,

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.780 align:middle line:84%
is the love that
underlies it all.
