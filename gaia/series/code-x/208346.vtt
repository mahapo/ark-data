00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Robert Grant, and
this is "The Code X."

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:22.150 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.850 align:middle line:10%
I've had the opportunity
over my lifetime

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.890 align:middle line:10%
to live in nine
different countries

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.040 align:middle line:10%
and visit over 140
different countries.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.960 align:middle line:84%
I feel very blessed
and lucky to have

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.013 align:middle line:84%
been able to see
the world like that.

00:00:34.013 --> 00:00:35.680 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I thought
the best way to learn

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.888 align:middle line:84%
the cultures of those
countries was to actually learn

00:00:37.888 --> 00:00:38.930 align:middle line:90%
the languages.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.860 align:middle line:84%
So I've learned eight
languages in my lifetime,

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.080 align:middle line:84%
and I speak five of
them fluently today.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.140 align:middle line:84%
Because of that view
of looking at the world

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.650 align:middle line:84%
through the lens of language,
I looked very differently

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.190 align:middle line:84%
at all the patterns in life
that I would come across.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.710 align:middle line:84%
This is true also
for mathematics.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And I started looking
very differently

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.210 align:middle line:90%
at patterns in general.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.239 align:middle line:10%
I would always see things
that some of my colleagues

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.490 align:middle line:10%
that I worked with would never
see in quite the same way.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that was just sort
of like a weird co-inky dink

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.390 align:middle line:84%
in how I saw the world a
little bit differently.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.430 align:middle line:84%
But when I went to
Egypt and started

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.020 align:middle line:84%
traveling to all
the ancient sites,

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.590 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't help but notice
the numerous patterns

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.020 align:middle line:84%
that were left behind
by the architects

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.020 align:middle line:90%
and builders in living stone.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.100 align:middle line:84%
In 2019, I took a group
of about 50 people

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.650 align:middle line:84%
to Egypt with me on
a discovery mission.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.100 align:middle line:10%
We went there following
the encryptions left to us

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.640 align:middle line:10%
by Leonardo da Vinci embedded
inside the "Vitruvian Man,"

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.220 align:middle line:10%
as well as the "La
Belle FerronniÃ©re,"

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.120 align:middle line:10%
the portrait of Anne Boleyn,
the mother of Queen Elizabeth I,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.850 align:middle line:10%
as well as "The
Last Supper" itself.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.120 align:middle line:84%
We realized on that trip
that the Last Supper

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.750 align:middle line:84%
was a working map of
the king's chamber

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.550 align:middle line:90%
in the Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.725 align:middle line:84%
And we discovered while there
were eight new stone reliefs.

00:02:03.725 --> 00:02:07.760 align:middle line:90%


00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that we found was
right underneath the chevrons

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.660 align:middle line:84%
at the original entrance
of the Great Pyramid.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.740 align:middle line:10%
In the basin, along with
my colleague Alan Green,

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:26.300 align:middle line:10%
we found very ancient letters
written into this altar basin.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.350 align:middle line:84%
When asked later on what
these letters might mean,

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.690 align:middle line:84%
they appear to be some form of
Proto-Hebraic, a language that

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.240 align:middle line:84%
is more of a phonetic language
than hieroglyphics that might

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:47.030 align:middle line:84%
actually point back to an
earlier language likened unto

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.830 align:middle line:90%
Atlantean.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.840 align:middle line:84%
You can see these letters as
four symbols, a V, a circle

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.120 align:middle line:84%
with a horizontal line, like the
Greek letter theta, three lines

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.570 align:middle line:84%
that look like a
Chinese character,

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and then two lines,
vertical in their position,

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.860 align:middle line:90%
inscribed within a circle.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.750 align:middle line:10%
These letters, we are told by a
researcher who originally found

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.110 align:middle line:10%
these letters, by the name
of Robert Schoch, the very

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.890 align:middle line:10%
same geologist from Boston
University, who has dated

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.710 align:middle line:10%
the Sphinx to being much older
than dynastic Egyptian times,

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.260 align:middle line:10%
that would point to a
construction of the Giza

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.090 align:middle line:10%
Plateau, at least
for the Sphinx,

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.930 align:middle line:10%
somewhere along the
timeline of 2,500 BC,

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.990 align:middle line:10%
actually showing that
through water erosion,

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.970 align:middle line:10%
we can actually
date the Sphinx back

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.060 align:middle line:10%
to something much older and
probably closer to 10,000 years

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.810 align:middle line:10%
BC.

>> Robert Grant's discovery of
the symbols first found by Dr.

Robert Schoch, inscribed
into the stone basin beneath

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.170 align:middle line:84%
the chevrons of the Great
Pyramid, begs the question,

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.440 align:middle line:84%
what language has
been left here,

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.250 align:middle line:84%
and what other enigmatic symbols
are waiting to be discovered

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.250 align:middle line:84%
within the Great Pyramid
that will shed light upon

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.690 align:middle line:90%
the mystery of the ages?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.209 align:middle line:84%
>> So we had the opportunity to
spend two nights in the Great

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Pyramid, and I have actually
spent five nights in total

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.220 align:middle line:90%
inside the Great Pyramid.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.550 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid, at
night, is a magical place.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Something about
it speaks to you.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.200 align:middle line:84%
As we look through
history, the people

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.530 align:middle line:84%
that prominently spent the
night inside the Great Pyramid

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.630 align:middle line:90%
are some notable figures.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.770 align:middle line:90%
One of them was Julius Caesar.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.700 align:middle line:84%
He was said to have spent the
night in the Great Pyramid,

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.290 align:middle line:84%
and came out of it in the
next morning a changed person.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Another person who spent the
night in the Great Pyramid

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.300 align:middle line:90%
was Alexander the Great.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And additionally, we
have another person

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.660 align:middle line:84%
who was spending time inside
the Great Pyramid that

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.980 align:middle line:84%
is closer to our day, and his
name was Napoleon Bonaparte.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.520 align:middle line:84%
But Napoleon was famous
as well for having come up

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.450 align:middle line:84%
with different forms of
geometric and mathematical

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.040 align:middle line:90%
discovery.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.420 align:middle line:10%
In fact, there's
something called

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.210 align:middle line:10%
the Napoleon, or
Bonaparte, constant,

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.660 align:middle line:10%
and it was innovated
entirely by Napoleon himself.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.340 align:middle line:10%
In fact, before he was
exiled to Helena and Elba,

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.550 align:middle line:10%
he was said to have been saying
to his friends and relatives

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.790 align:middle line:10%
that his greatest dream would
be to go and focus solely

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.210 align:middle line:10%
on mathematical and
scientific discovery.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.930 align:middle line:84%
What was it about spending the
night in the Great Pyramid that

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.400 align:middle line:84%
had such an indelible impact on
these three massive characters

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.950 align:middle line:90%
in our history?

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.230 align:middle line:84%
We know that the Last
Supper has already

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.660 align:middle line:84%
yielded for us many
things that we've

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.000 align:middle line:90%
shown on our prior episode.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.700 align:middle line:84%
However, are there
potentially more things

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.980 align:middle line:84%
hidden within the
Last Supper that we

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.700 align:middle line:84%
can glean as another
additional message

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.300 align:middle line:84%
that's been encrypted
through time by Leonardo?

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.840 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that we cannot
get out of our minds is this

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.640 align:middle line:84%
whole reference
to Bull Mountain.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.570 align:middle line:84%
The ancient name of the Great
Pyramid was Bull Mountain.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:16.380 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And the hieroglyphics
of it are the chevrons.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:25.410 align:middle line:84%
The chevrons, and of course,
the symbol of the Apis bull.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.770 align:middle line:84%
Now the Apis bull is
from another reference

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:35.610 align:middle line:84%
to the same story of Osiris, and
Osiris' eventual resurrection.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Osiris had a fight
with Seth, and Seth

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.470 align:middle line:84%
was able to defeat Osiris
and cut him into 14 parts.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And Leonardo's Vitruvian Man
was likewise cut into 14 parts.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.710 align:middle line:84%
As Leonardo cut
him into 14 parts,

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.720 align:middle line:84%
we saw already
that the placement

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.140 align:middle line:84%
of the horizontal lines
that he placed on the torso,

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.130 align:middle line:84%
and on the knees, and then on
the head, at the eyebrow line,

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.780 align:middle line:84%
as well as the
throat chakra line,

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.320 align:middle line:84%
is pointing to
potentially new chambers

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.430 align:middle line:84%
in the Great Pyramid that
have yet to be discovered.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.000 align:middle line:10%
And are there other
references to the bull and cow

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.010 align:middle line:10%
in the Last Supper?

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.930 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that we discovered

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.870 align:middle line:84%
inside the Great
Pyramid was actually

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.720 align:middle line:90%
discovered by my wife Suzy.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.350 align:middle line:84%
She came over and she said,
hey, I think I found something

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.020 align:middle line:90%
on the North wall.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Now the West wall is
what is the back wall

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.700 align:middle line:84%
behind the sarcophagus,
but as you're

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.830 align:middle line:84%
walking into the King's
Chamber and looking

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.140 align:middle line:84%
at it as if it is the
Last Supper painting,

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.330 align:middle line:90%
it would be on the right side.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Now to put this into
context, here we

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.360 align:middle line:84%
are in the King's
Chamber, famously devoid

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.300 align:middle line:84%
of any writing or
imagery on the walls,

00:07:53.300 --> 00:08:00.010 align:middle line:84%
and yet, we're finding a
6 and 1/2 foot wide bull.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And the reference of
the hieroglyphic writing

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.770 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid
is Bull Mountain,

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and Leonardo da Vinci
references it in his letter

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:12.520 align:middle line:84%
to the Lieutenant of the
Devatdar of the Sultan of Cairo

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.320 align:middle line:90%
as Bull Mountain as well.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.600 align:middle line:10%
And here on the North wall,
we are finding a bull.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.570 align:middle line:84%
As we looked at this
photographic footage, and film

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:26.980 align:middle line:84%
footage later, we noticed
that not only was there a bull

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.670 align:middle line:84%
to be seen on the right
wall, the North wall,

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:37.770 align:middle line:84%
but we also noticed around
that bull is a larger cow.

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:43.059 align:middle line:10%
And this larger cow extends
for, again, in total about 8

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:46.690 align:middle line:10%
and 1/2 feet, from
left to right.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:51.040 align:middle line:84%
But as we look at this cow, we
can't help but ask ourselves,

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.610 align:middle line:84%
what is going on, and how
could this have been missed?

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:58.140 align:middle line:10%
As we looked at the imagery
as well from side footage,

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:02.850 align:middle line:10%
you can see how the markings
of the cow and the bull

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:06.610 align:middle line:10%
are almost burned, as if
by some type of technology

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:11.440 align:middle line:10%
we don't know today,
and left into the wall,

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.080 align:middle line:10%
albeit very clear for
us to be able to see it.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And I have seen
these images before,

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:19.860 align:middle line:84%
but I never associated
it with a bull

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.328 align:middle line:90%
or a cow 8 and 1/2 feet wide.

00:09:23.328 --> 00:09:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is not something
that's small, like the Alpha

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Omega, but is it
potentially referencing

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.430 align:middle line:84%
us back to the self same
images of the Alpha Omega

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.435 align:middle line:84%
that we already discovered on
the rim of the sarcophagus?

00:09:35.435 --> 00:09:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, to understand
that, we have

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.564 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
story of the Apis bull.

00:09:39.564 --> 00:09:41.460 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>> The iconic Egyptian
goddess Hathor was the mother

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.400 align:middle line:90%
of the Apis bull.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.270 align:middle line:84%
She is often represented in
Egyptian art and mythology

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.550 align:middle line:90%
as the omega symbol.

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:57.030 align:middle line:84%
Most notably, when
looking at Hathor's hair,

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:01.920 align:middle line:84%
the representation of the
omega symbol is clearly seen.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Also of note, the Apis bull is
represented by the letter A,

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:11.640 align:middle line:84%
harkening us back once more to
the ubiquitous alpha and omega

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.810 align:middle line:90%
symbols.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:17.590 align:middle line:84%
We are told, in the
story of the Apis bull,

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:21.370 align:middle line:84%
that he had to learn to
sacrifice himself in order

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:24.880 align:middle line:84%
to merge back into
his mother Hathor.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.420 align:middle line:10%
In essence, sacrificing
his own ego to be

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:32.050 align:middle line:10%
reunited once again with
universal consciousness

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:32.965 align:middle line:10%
for the greater good.

00:10:32.965 --> 00:10:35.540 align:middle line:90%


00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>> This process is also
represented in Saqqara,

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and it also relates back to the
same process that Osiris had

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.800 align:middle line:84%
to go through when
Isis, his wife,

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:50.030 align:middle line:84%
put him back together again
such that he could be fully

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.040 align:middle line:90%
resurrected.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And the symbology from
a hermetic perspective,

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:59.180 align:middle line:84%
an esoteric standpoint, is that
the Great Pyramid represents

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:04.340 align:middle line:84%
the place for the Apis bull
to allow his ego to die

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.060 align:middle line:84%
and for him to be
re-risen, to rise again

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.780 align:middle line:84%
in resurrection,
in the sarcophagus

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:16.370 align:middle line:90%
as a new super conscious being.

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:20.120 align:middle line:84%
This is symbology that you'll
find in many places in Egypt.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.480 align:middle line:84%
It is directly linked to
the same story of Osiris,

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.020 align:middle line:84%
and this Apis bull
is representative

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.450 align:middle line:90%
of that same experience.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.450 align:middle line:10%
So then that begs
the question, well,

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:36.950 align:middle line:10%
wait a minute, if we have a
bull in a cow on the right wall,

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:40.970 align:middle line:10%
or North wall, of the
King's Chamber, perhaps

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:44.570 align:middle line:10%
is there a bull and
cow somehow hidden

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:49.988 align:middle line:10%
in the right wall of The Last
Supper by Leonardo da Vinci?

00:11:49.988 --> 00:11:51.740 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:57.980 align:middle line:84%
If we zoom in on this
fresco in Milan yet again,

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.980 align:middle line:84%
and we notice that
the tapestries hanging

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:05.900 align:middle line:84%
on the right wall are
actually embedding within them

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.800 align:middle line:90%
a hidden pattern of a cow.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.170 align:middle line:84%
The two horns are
very prominent,

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:14.660 align:middle line:84%
and you can even see the
nostrils and the ridge

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:18.410 align:middle line:84%
of this cows back, extending
through the white section

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:23.300 align:middle line:84%
of the painted wall, and
then into the tapestry that

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.720 align:middle line:90%
is next to it.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.040 align:middle line:84%
So this would be the far
tapestries on the right side,

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.850 align:middle line:84%
starting with the farthest
one going to the middle one.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.760 align:middle line:84%
We also noted that at the
top of these tapestries

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.400 align:middle line:90%
seem to be writings.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.530 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know exactly
what those writings were,

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:43.460 align:middle line:84%
but we could faintly make out
that on the middle tapestry,

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:48.770 align:middle line:84%
at the very top, are
the numbers 2, 4, and 6.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:54.140 align:middle line:84%
We noticed clearly the image
of a cow embedded and hidden

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:57.650 align:middle line:84%
within this tapestry, and the
adjacent tapestry, and the wall

00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:59.150 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.160 align:middle line:90%
But what about the bull inside?

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Is there another cow, or bull,
hidden within this larger cow

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.380 align:middle line:90%
that we see?

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:13.190 align:middle line:84%
As we get closer and closer into
the white section in between,

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:18.110 align:middle line:84%
we can very clearly notice
the image of a bull,

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:23.900 align:middle line:84%
with a taurus symbol right in
the center of its forehead.

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:28.430 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly matching
in the same location

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:32.630 align:middle line:84%
on the right North wall
of the King's Chamber,

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:36.050 align:middle line:84%
in the same position
in both the painting

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:38.900 align:middle line:84%
and on the wall of
the King's Chamber.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:45.700 align:middle line:84%
A very large cow and bull
encrypted right into the wall.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Now why is it that Hathor
represents the omega, which

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:53.910 align:middle line:84%
of course draws the conclusion
for us that the two things must

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:55.470 align:middle line:90%
be irrevocably linked?

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:58.590 align:middle line:84%
The alpha and omega on
the rim of the sarcophagus

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:02.880 align:middle line:84%
must relate very directly
somehow through this story,

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.370 align:middle line:84%
this mythological
story of the Apis bull

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:09.500 align:middle line:84%
and Hathor, his mother, and
this notion of sacrificing

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.220 align:middle line:84%
the ego in favor of a
higher consciousness,

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:17.810 align:middle line:84%
sacrificing the separation in
favor of a unity consciousness.

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:19.400 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.910 align:middle line:84%
All of this is pointing back
to this same omega and alpha

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:24.060 align:middle line:90%
symbol.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at the letter
A in the uppercase form,

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.190 align:middle line:90%
it kind of looks like a pyramid.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And as we look at a lowercase
form of the letter A,

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:40.700 align:middle line:84%
we notice that it can both be
an omega symbol when we simply

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:44.930 align:middle line:84%
rotate it, or if we have it
in its normal lowercase form

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:49.010 align:middle line:84%
as a letter A, it's just
the Greek letter alpha.

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:51.950 align:middle line:84%
So very interestingly,
is it as simple

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:57.350 align:middle line:84%
as that, that the masculine
form is just a flip in polarity

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.660 align:middle line:84%
of the feminine
form, and that what

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.730 align:middle line:84%
we're perceiving as
different and separate

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:06.080 align:middle line:84%
might actually simply just be
our product of our own polarity

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.290 align:middle line:90%
and perception?

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And what about the symbol
of Mercury and Hermes?

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:17.860 align:middle line:10%
Rosicrucianism, the rose cross,
and all of this symbolism

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:20.530 align:middle line:10%
through alchemy through
many ages of time,

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:23.920 align:middle line:10%
all the way back to
the "Epic of Gilgamesh"

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.460 align:middle line:10%
seems to be pointing us
to this universal symbol

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:32.620 align:middle line:10%
of a merger between the
representation of Venus

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:37.420 align:middle line:10%
and the representation of
the aleph, or the bull.

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:41.540 align:middle line:10%
Aleph is the Hebrew
name of the letter A.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.360 align:middle line:10%
And in Hebrew, there's
only 22 letters,

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.550 align:middle line:10%
but the last letter is tav.

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:51.220 align:middle line:84%
That got replaced with the omega
symbol in the Greek alphabet,

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:52.450 align:middle line:90%
with 24 letters.

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And in English, we have 26
letters in our Roman alphabet.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.500 align:middle line:90%


00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:00.080 align:middle line:90%
The omega represents fertility.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:05.950 align:middle line:84%
It represents the uterus, the
womb, and the fallopian tubes.

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is also the symbolism
of the hair of the Hathor,

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:12.700 align:middle line:84%
the Cow, the mother
of the Apis bull.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:17.140 align:middle line:10%
We were stunned to find
the exact same place

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.650 align:middle line:10%
in both the King's Chamber,
as well as in the Last Supper

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:25.660 align:middle line:10%
painting from over 500 years
ago in plain sight, the Apis

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:28.810 align:middle line:10%
and the Hathor, tying
right back directly

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.330 align:middle line:10%
through the symbology
and mythology

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.820 align:middle line:10%
of the alpha and omega.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Again, pointing
us to the metaphor

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:43.340 align:middle line:84%
that we also must give up
our egos and our separation--

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:46.460 align:middle line:84%
to a certain extent,
our own individuality

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.190 align:middle line:84%
or our belief of separation
from everyone else,

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:53.210 align:middle line:84%
in order to experience
a unity consciousness,

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:58.100 align:middle line:84%
and be born and reborn by
coming out of the sarcophagus,

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:02.160 align:middle line:84%
just as Hermes
Trismegistus exhorts us

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.770 align:middle line:90%
to do in the Emerald tablets.

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:09.240 align:middle line:84%
He says, lay in my
sarcophagus, and I

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:13.050 align:middle line:84%
will reveal unto you the
great mysteries in the Emerald

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.780 align:middle line:84%
tablets of Thoth and
the Doreal translation.

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Is Thoth also known as
the divine hermaphrodite,

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:23.040 align:middle line:84%
the perfect balance
of consciousness

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.910 align:middle line:84%
of the subconscious mind and the
conscious mind merging together

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:31.290 align:middle line:84%
into unity consciousness,
ushering in a new reality

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and a new experience
of less judgment,

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:39.720 align:middle line:84%
less fear, less
scarcity, less struggle?

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.840 align:middle line:10%
Another thing to note about
the sarcophagus, by the way,

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:46.290 align:middle line:10%
is it actually relates to a very
important mathematical constant

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:49.440 align:middle line:10%
and physics constant
that is possibly

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:54.360 align:middle line:10%
the most universally mysterious
of all mathematical constants,

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.600 align:middle line:10%
that is called the
Alpha constant.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:02.310 align:middle line:84%
>> In physics, the alpha,
or fine structure constant,

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:07.470 align:middle line:84%
has a numerical
value of 1 over 137,

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:11.220 align:middle line:84%
and is a fundamental physical
constant which quantifies

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.420 align:middle line:84%
the strength of electromagnetic
interaction between elementary

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.970 align:middle line:90%
charged particles.

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>> 137.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.590 align:middle line:90%
The 33rd prime number.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:25.660 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the physicist
Richard Feynman

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:30.190 align:middle line:10%
said that somehow, it appears
as though God has given us

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:34.940 align:middle line:10%
this number, but we don't
know how he pushed his pencil.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:42.740 align:middle line:10%
137 and its reciprocal
value, which is 0.00729735,

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.900 align:middle line:10%
is substantially
important as well

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:48.170 align:middle line:10%
to the King's Chamber
and the sarcophagus.

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:50.630 align:middle line:10%
I've mentioned before that
the length of the room

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:56.500 align:middle line:10%
is 20 cubits, and the width
of the room is 10 cubits.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:57.300 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, the cubit, as a unit
of measure, is 1.718 feet.

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:07.820 align:middle line:84%
So when you measure the
perimeter of the room,

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:11.450 align:middle line:84%
it turns out that
in meters, 60 cubits

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:18.140 align:middle line:84%
is exactly pi times 10
meters, so 31.4159 meters,

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.420 align:middle line:90%
to perfection.

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:24.090 align:middle line:10%
Showing again, a very
direct relationship,

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:26.300 align:middle line:10%
and also showing
some unification

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:30.350 align:middle line:10%
in the builder's thinking of how
they built the pyramid pointing

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:34.670 align:middle line:10%
to the possibility, at
least, that the foot cubit

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:39.350 align:middle line:10%
and meter were all used in
the pyramid's construction,

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:43.220 align:middle line:10%
challenging our very notion
of what the builders even

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:47.270 align:middle line:10%
understood and knew
about our time today.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Just as I mentioned
before, the geocoordinates

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:55.310 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid point us
to directly the speed of light

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:59.790 align:middle line:84%
down to 1 meter per
second accuracy.

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:04.430 align:middle line:10%
So there seems to
be more to find yet,

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:08.660 align:middle line:10%
and maybe it points even more
back to the Ultimate Alpha

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:15.860 align:middle line:10%
Omega itself, which is in
the symbolism of Mercury,

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:20.650 align:middle line:10%
the messenger god, Thoth.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:22.470 align:middle line:10%
We also found on
the sarcophagus,

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:26.760 align:middle line:10%
on the front side, another
eye of Ra on the right side.

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And on the back side, we
found another eye of Horus.

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.630 align:middle line:10%
Additionally, we found
a Tudor rose along

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:38.760 align:middle line:10%
the rim of the sarcophagus, just
adjacent to both the compass

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:43.680 align:middle line:10%
that was just underneath the
Alpha Omega, as well as a tau

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:47.340 align:middle line:10%
cross and a flower of life.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:51.840 align:middle line:84%
You heard me, a flower
of life on the back side

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:56.310 align:middle line:84%
of the sarcophagus that
is prominently displayed

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:58.890 align:middle line:90%
when we know what to look for.

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Additionally, we found more
geometry above the entryway.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Another tau cross, another
reference to the ros tau.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.150 align:middle line:10%
One of the things
that is also very

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:15.180 align:middle line:10%
interesting about this room,
and about the sarcophagus

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:18.750 align:middle line:10%
in general, is that the
dimensions of the sarcophagus,

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:22.770 align:middle line:10%
if we take it and stack it on
its side, and we stack it from

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:27.360 align:middle line:10%
left to right, it will fit
perfectly five sarcophagi

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.830 align:middle line:10%
along the floor.

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And we can stack six
sarcophagi on top of each other

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:34.400 align:middle line:90%
up to the ceiling.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we continue
to fill the room out

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:41.620 align:middle line:84%
with those stacked sarcophagi,
guess how many sarcophagi

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.920 align:middle line:90%
will fit inside that room?

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.910 align:middle line:90%
137.

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:52.150 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, it turns
out to be 137 and 1/2,

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:56.200 align:middle line:10%
which is the same number
as the golden angle, which

00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:00.190 align:middle line:10%
is fundamental to phyllotaxis,
and flowers, and sunflower

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:01.690 align:middle line:10%
seeds, and all of
the things that we

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:03.910 align:middle line:10%
observe in nature around us.

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:08.680 align:middle line:84%
But when you take out the empty
space inside the sarcophagus,

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:13.210 align:middle line:84%
it comes down to exactly
the Alpha constant,

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:19.090 align:middle line:90%
the ratio being 1 over 137.

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we go back and look
at the ancient name of God,

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:27.130 align:middle line:84%
in Hebrew it is written
as Yud, Hei, Vav, Hei.

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:30.070 align:middle line:10%
These letters seem
like the letters

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.230 align:middle line:10%
that we've all seen
many times over,

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:34.870 align:middle line:10%
and are referenced in the
Bible as the name of God, which

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:39.660 align:middle line:10%
is not intended to be spoken,
and is pronounced yahweh.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.800 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.310 align:middle line:84%
To our surprise,
what we also noticed

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:50.590 align:middle line:84%
is that the Hei
in Yud Hei Vav Hei

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:54.220 align:middle line:84%
is actually the symbol for
a mathematical constant

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.420 align:middle line:90%
we all know as pi.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:58.060 align:middle line:90%


00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.070 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
this is an equation?

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And what would the
equation read as?

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:09.950 align:middle line:10%
Because the Yud and the
Vav look like the number 7.

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Now interestingly, if
we took that and read it

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:14.960 align:middle line:84%
as an equation,
the equation would

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:22.550 align:middle line:84%
read pi to the seventh
power, and pi times 7.

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:29.300 align:middle line:10%
Pi times 7 is just under 22,
and pi to the seventh power

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:34.010 align:middle line:10%
is 3,020, which is one
of the measured values

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:41.850 align:middle line:10%
of the perimeter of the Great
Pyramid in feet, 3,020 feet.

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:46.290 align:middle line:10%
Now some would say that
because it's 440 cubits, that

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:50.150 align:middle line:10%
would lead us to 756 feet.

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.270 align:middle line:10%
And what would
that be telling us?

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:56.780 align:middle line:10%
756 then would say that
we multiply that by 4,

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:59.270 align:middle line:10%
and we would end up
with 3,024, which

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:05.750 align:middle line:10%
is remarkably close to 3,020,
which would assume sort of 755

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:09.480 align:middle line:10%
feet and just a little bit.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:14.160 align:middle line:10%
If we run this
equation as division,

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:20.857 align:middle line:10%
pi to the seventh power, divided
by pi times 7, is equal to 137.

00:24:20.857 --> 00:24:24.420 align:middle line:90%


00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And if we look
differently at yahweh,

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:32.100 align:middle line:84%
you could even look
at it as TH, TH.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:35.970 align:middle line:10%
In Hebrew, it's not
necessary to show the letter

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:37.560 align:middle line:10%
because it's only consonants.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.900 align:middle line:10%
There's no vowels that appear
in the Hebrew language.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:44.550 align:middle line:84%
So if we were to look
at this as TH, TH,

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:47.280 align:middle line:84%
then it would be represented
as having an O in between.

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.930 align:middle line:90%


00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:55.750 align:middle line:84%
Is this name even of
Yahweh, Yud Hei Vav Hei,

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:59.020 align:middle line:84%
pointing us to the same
dimensional proportions

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:02.800 align:middle line:84%
of the sarcophagus in
the King's Chamber?

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And all the things that we have
found and are yet still finding

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.140 align:middle line:84%
that relate and point
us back from this map

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:19.010 align:middle line:84%
within the Last Supper of this
enigmatic and mysterious room,

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:22.260 align:middle line:84%
is it pointing even to
more for us to understand?

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Is this an unfolding encryption
that we're only barely

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.230 align:middle line:90%
scratching the surface on?

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:32.130 align:middle line:90%
That's what I believe.

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it's leading
us to remember who we are.
