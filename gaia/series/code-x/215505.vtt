00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.700 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Robert Grant.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.164 align:middle line:10%
And this is Code X.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.230 align:middle line:84%
So far, this season has been all
about expanding our perception,

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.970 align:middle line:84%
seeing new perspectives, looking
at things that maybe we've

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.950 align:middle line:84%
looked at in plain sight for
many years but seeing altogether

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.240 align:middle line:90%
new things inside of them.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.340 align:middle line:84%
This is how we expand our
awareness and consciousness.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.360 align:middle line:10%
Because as we talked
about two episodes ago,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.320 align:middle line:10%
I was able to directly
correlate musical interval

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.670 align:middle line:10%
with slope angle--

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.410 align:middle line:10%
and those slope angles matching,
not only the musical interval

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.370 align:middle line:10%
and number theory of
ratio, but perfectly

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.120 align:middle line:10%
matching the slope angles that
we see on the Giza Plateau.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.640 align:middle line:84%
But as we go further out,
the next musical interval

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.830 align:middle line:84%
should be the minor third
and the major sixth.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And this would imply a
6 over 5 relationship,

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.570 align:middle line:90%
or a 10 over 6 relationship.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.450 align:middle line:10%
It gives us a
67.38 degree angle.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.785 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:28.785 --> 00:01:30.190 align:middle line:90%


00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.460 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't aware of any
pyramids on the Giza Plateau,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.070 align:middle line:84%
or anywhere else, that
had a 67.38 degree angle.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.680 align:middle line:90%
So this just stuck in my head.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.040 align:middle line:84%
The next one I wanted to look
at beyond the minor third

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.580 align:middle line:90%
is the major second.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.470 align:middle line:84%
The major second has an
interval of 9 over 8.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.560 align:middle line:90%
That's 1.125 as a ratio.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And that would yield
specifically a 48.366 degree

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.440 align:middle line:90%
angle.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And then the final is the minor
second, which is 25 over 24.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And its inverted interval
would be 48 over 25.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And I also wasn't aware of
where that particular slope

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.640 align:middle line:90%
angle would appear.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.230 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
I did was start

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.050 align:middle line:84%
to look in the vicinity
for this other pyramid.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.280 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't find the
minor third pyramid.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Where is the minor
third pyramid?

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.740 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to look
South in Saqqara.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.320 align:middle line:10%
In the Saqqara and Dahshur
area is the Djoser pyramid,

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.070 align:middle line:10%
often believed by many in
the archeology community

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.730 align:middle line:10%
to be the first pyramid.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.440 align:middle line:84%
It holds a similar type
of architectural design

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.910 align:middle line:84%
as a ziggurat, as
a stepped pyramid.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.660 align:middle line:84%
It is referred to
as a step pyramid.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:58.410 align:middle line:10%
It turns out that that pyramid
in Saqqara in the Djoser complex

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.660 align:middle line:10%
holds a 48.366 degree
angle, precisely,

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.180 align:middle line:10%
matching exactly the
major second of 9 over 8

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.180 align:middle line:10%
and 16 over 9, its
inverted pairing.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.960 align:middle line:10%
So now, out of the
13 musical intervals

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.890 align:middle line:10%
to make up one
scale of 12 notes--

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.100 align:middle line:10%
the 13th note being the
beginning of the next octave--

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.580 align:middle line:10%
we're able to identify
the diminished fifth,

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.750 align:middle line:10%
the augmented fourth.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.390 align:middle line:90%
That's the first two--

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.320 align:middle line:84%
the perfect fifth, the perfect
fourth, the major third,

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.430 align:middle line:84%
and the minor sixth, and the
major second with the Djoser

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.880 align:middle line:84%
pyramid, and the minor seventh,
as well as the unison and octave

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.020 align:middle line:90%
double.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.450 align:middle line:10%
That's beyond coincidence now,
with the slope angles matching

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.860 align:middle line:10%
precisely each of these
pyramids, leaving us

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:02.210 align:middle line:10%
only the other two pairings
of four intervals total--

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.730 align:middle line:10%
which include the minor
third, the major sixth,

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.880 align:middle line:10%
its interval pair, and the minor
second, and the major seventh.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.870 align:middle line:84%
So I was on the hunt
to find the minor third

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:15.970 align:middle line:90%
and major sixth pyramid.

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.620 align:middle line:90%


00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.829 align:middle line:84%
In order to do that,
I had to go and take

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.700 align:middle line:84%
an aerial view of
the Giza Plateau.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.840 align:middle line:10%
And what I'd noticed is
something that had been somewhat

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.390 align:middle line:10%
of an enigma and only
discovered, really,

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.100 align:middle line:10%
in the 1950s by two
Italian explorers.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.910 align:middle line:10%
These two explorers
found what were

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:44.480 align:middle line:10%
the remains of two pyramids on a
plateau that was 300 feet higher

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.680 align:middle line:10%
in elevation than
the Giza Plateau.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.400 align:middle line:10%
The two pyramids that are
there were badly destroyed,

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.660 align:middle line:10%
leaving only the first several
concourses still intact.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.600 align:middle line:84%
The pyramids were believed
to have been built both of

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.770 align:middle line:84%
rose granite, the most
expensive of granite--

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.860 align:middle line:84%
and holding the property
of 55% quartz crystal.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.410 align:middle line:84%
These two pyramids are
ostensibly crystal pyramids.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Some have referred in
the archeology community

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.910 align:middle line:84%
to these pyramids as
being the great pit.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Because the larger
of the two pyramids,

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.820 align:middle line:84%
known as the Djedefre pyramid,
has a large pit inside

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.030 align:middle line:84%
from where the material
exploded out from,

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.940 align:middle line:90%
leaving the inner chambers open.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.290 align:middle line:84%
I also found an entrance into
an underground network that was

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.455 align:middle line:90%
blocked off by a lot of debris.

00:05:40.455 --> 00:05:43.030 align:middle line:90%


00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.390 align:middle line:84%
These two pyramids have
very, very unique angles

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.490 align:middle line:90%
and were very steep.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.690 align:middle line:10%
The larger of the two pyramids,
known as the Djedefre pyramid,

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.410 align:middle line:10%
versus its satellite,
which I will

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.090 align:middle line:10%
refer to as the
philosopher's stone,

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.320 align:middle line:10%
had a slope angle
of 60 degrees, the

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.560 align:middle line:10%
same as an equilateral
triangular pyramid--

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.490 align:middle line:10%
a 60-degree angle.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.490 align:middle line:10%
Now, with that pyramid having
stood on the Abu Rawash plateau

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.790 align:middle line:10%
at 300 feet higher
than the Giza Plateau--

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:23.010 align:middle line:10%
if a viewer were looking at the
pyramid complex from the Giza

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.880 align:middle line:10%
Plateau, exactly 8,000 meters,
8 kilometers in distance,

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.980 align:middle line:10%
about 5 miles in distance
from the Great Pyramid

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.060 align:middle line:10%
to the northwest, you would have
seen a pyramid that appeared

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.990 align:middle line:10%
to be nearly 600 feet high
versus the Great Pyramid's 481

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.790 align:middle line:10%
feet.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:48.240 align:middle line:90%


00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, to put this into
context, the Great Pyramid was

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.550 align:middle line:84%
the tallest building on planet
Earth known to man all the way

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.450 align:middle line:90%
up until the 17th century.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.590 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't until Elizabethan
times in England

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.530 align:middle line:10%
that another
structure made by man

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.310 align:middle line:10%
surpassed that of
the Great Pyramid.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine another 120
feet higher than that

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.350 align:middle line:84%
structure on the
Abu Rawash plateau,

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.840 align:middle line:90%
known as the Djedefre pyramid.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Its satellite right next to
it held an even steeper angle.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:25.830 align:middle line:10%
The angle on that pyramid, the
Djedefre satellite pyramid--

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.670 align:middle line:10%
or what I call the
philosopher's stone pyramid--

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:34.280 align:middle line:10%
is exactly 67.38 degrees.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:39.200 align:middle line:10%
Now, if you happen to have a
dollar bill in your pocket,

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.290 align:middle line:10%
and you take that dollar bill
out of your pocket and look

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.380 align:middle line:10%
at the backside on the great
seal of the United States

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:49.580 align:middle line:10%
of America, the pyramid
that appears with the Eye

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:55.720 align:middle line:10%
of Providence embedded within it
is exactly the same proportions,

00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:01.240 align:middle line:10%
a 67.38-degree angle.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:06.550 align:middle line:10%
Now, interestingly, that
pyramid slope angle perfectly

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:10.660 align:middle line:10%
matches the same
musical interval scale

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.650 align:middle line:10%
of the minor third
and the major sixth,

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:21.370 align:middle line:10%
deriving for us
exactly 67.38 degrees.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is quite
enigmatic and mysterious.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Because why would have
this shown up on the dollar

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.720 align:middle line:90%
bill in the first place?

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And what are the associations
with this dollar bill

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.020 align:middle line:90%
pyramid or Eye of Providence?

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:40.179 align:middle line:10%
Why is it part of the
consciousness that it shows up

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:45.730 align:middle line:10%
in freemasonry and in particular
ancient alchemical symbology

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:47.816 align:middle line:10%
the world over?

00:08:47.816 --> 00:08:49.570 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.610 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I would propose.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.700 align:middle line:84%
That triangle is
unique, because it's

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:59.660 align:middle line:84%
the only triangle that in
a 5, 12, 13 proportion--

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.080 align:middle line:84%
so the base being
5, the height being

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:07.240 align:middle line:90%
12, 13 being its hypotenuse--

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.820 align:middle line:90%
gives you a value of 30.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:15.670 align:middle line:84%
So 5 times 12 times
1/2 gives us the area.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And that being 30 is
matching the perimeter of 5

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:25.130 align:middle line:90%
plus 12 plus 13, 30 and 30.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.360 align:middle line:10%
Now if we double
this triangle, we'll

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.270 align:middle line:10%
have one triangle
with an area of 30

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.090 align:middle line:10%
and another triangle
of an area of 30

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:37.330 align:middle line:10%
adjacent to each other to
form the philosopher's stone

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.060 align:middle line:10%
pyramid, the same one
on the dollar bill

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.660 align:middle line:10%
as a cross-section-- the dollar
bill representation being

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.560 align:middle line:10%
a third-dimensional projection
drawn in perspective,

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.510 align:middle line:10%
the same technique used by
Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael,

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.490 align:middle line:10%
and many others
throughout history

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.730 align:middle line:10%
to depict this understanding
of ancient wisdom

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.950 align:middle line:10%
and higher knowledge.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we look further and
more deeply at this structure,

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:06.330 align:middle line:84%
is there something
else that makes sense

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.460 align:middle line:84%
around this
particular structure?

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we think about the
ultimate duality as being time,

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:18.120 align:middle line:84%
past versus the
future, is there a way

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.790 align:middle line:84%
that we can ascribe
some relationship

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.610 align:middle line:90%
to time in this pyramid?

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out
that there are many.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.330 align:middle line:84%
If we think about one
minute having and possessing

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:35.640 align:middle line:84%
60 seconds, you could apply
two two-dimensional triangles

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:40.410 align:middle line:84%
of 30 and 30 and 30 and 30 for
the perimeter and area values

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:45.220 align:middle line:84%
being the masculine
aspect of one minute,

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:49.080 align:middle line:84%
then descending into the
feminine aspect of a sine cosine

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:53.900 align:middle line:84%
wave, 30 and 30 being the
first 30 seconds of the minute

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.780 align:middle line:84%
and then the second
seconds of the minute.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:01.460 align:middle line:84%
That then means that we
have a perimeter, including

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:05.520 align:middle line:84%
the central line, of
60 and an area of 60--

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.990 align:middle line:90%
again, matching that of time.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Is there some
mathematical relationship

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:16.070 align:middle line:84%
that creates a portal when
we can find the perfect match

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:18.920 align:middle line:90%
between perimeter and area?

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.610 align:middle line:84%
It feels and sounds a lot
like the challenge of squaring

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:24.110 align:middle line:90%
the circle, doesn't it?

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.720 align:middle line:84%
This is the only
triangle that is

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.410 align:middle line:84%
able to accomplish this so
simply and so beautifully.

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was known by esotericist
hermetic wisdom teachers

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.902 align:middle line:90%
and philosophers alike.

00:11:38.902 --> 00:11:41.360 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.020 align:middle line:84%
As we look to the ancient
philosophers and what this

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:50.000 align:middle line:84%
means, also, with the musical
notes on a 24-note scale,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.350 align:middle line:84%
we could depict this as two
snakes of hermetic wisdom.

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:59.290 align:middle line:10%
These two snakes-- one,
starting with 432 hertz,

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:02.930 align:middle line:10%
the other connecting
to 528 hertz,

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:07.900 align:middle line:10%
both creating 12-note chromatic
scales that perfectly intertwine

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:14.080 align:middle line:10%
one with another to create
one universal experience.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.990 align:middle line:10%
But in addition to that, the
other philosopher's stone

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.400 align:middle line:10%
depiction is that of an
equilateral triangle,

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:23.630 align:middle line:10%
the divine trinity, a
triangle with three sides.

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:28.060 align:middle line:10%
Each side could
represent 1 or 1 pi.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.600 align:middle line:10%
And to the extent that it
represented an equilateral side

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.200 align:middle line:10%
of 1 pi, the height
of that triangle

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.290 align:middle line:10%
becomes the Euler number.

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, an easy way to
remember the Euler number

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:44.800 align:middle line:84%
is that it's the thing that
banks use to actually measure

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.040 align:middle line:90%
your interest.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.030 align:middle line:84%
It determines how much compound
interest you could have.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And what you find is that this
is a universal constant that

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:58.170 align:middle line:84%
not only does the limitation on
all wave growth and expansion.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:01.200 align:middle line:84%
If the speed of light
is the speed limit

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.070 align:middle line:84%
for the entire universe, the
speed limit of that speed limit

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.860 align:middle line:84%
is the Euler number
mathematically.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:11.100 align:middle line:10%
Whereas, pi is a
transcendental constant that

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.250 align:middle line:10%
creates circles and
circularity, the Euler number

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:15.780 align:middle line:10%
is a transcendental
constant that

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:19.710 align:middle line:10%
creates squares that go along
with it, the masculine combining

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:20.920 align:middle line:10%
with the feminine.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.370 align:middle line:10%
And we find both of
them in the beauty

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:27.750 align:middle line:10%
of an equilateral triangle,
with each side being pi

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:29.780 align:middle line:10%
and the height being
the Euler number.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.210 align:middle line:90%


00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:35.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, interestingly,
this was a math constant

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.670 align:middle line:84%
that was found and used
by Jacob Bernoulli.

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:43.560 align:middle line:84%
It was used by Isaac
Newton, Charles Napier,

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:47.100 align:middle line:90%
probably discovered by Napier.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.490 align:middle line:84%
But this particular
constant we find in Egypt.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:57.150 align:middle line:84%
For it is the royal Egyptian
cubit plus 1 that equals 2.718.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:59.760 align:middle line:90%
That is the Euler number.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:22.900 align:middle line:10%
The Vitruvian Man being the most
famous depiction in the world,

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.920 align:middle line:10%
possibly the world's
most recognizable image

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.610 align:middle line:10%

the most famous divine

into the simplicity of
one circle and one square,

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:54.300 align:middle line:84%
the area of the circle being
pi and the area of the square

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.790 align:middle line:90%
being the Euler number.

00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:01.950 align:middle line:84%
When we take the base of the
square of Leonardo da Vinci's

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Vitruvian man depiction
and connect the two

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.980 align:middle line:84%
corners on the left and
right side of that square

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:13.260 align:middle line:84%
to the center, the highest
point on the circle that

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:17.610 align:middle line:84%
is above the Vitruvian man's
head, and we connect all of that

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:19.680 align:middle line:84%
into the form of
one triangle, what

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.580 align:middle line:90%
is the slope angle that we get?

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:26.790 align:middle line:10%
Surprise, surprise 67.38
degrees, the minor third

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:30.390 align:middle line:10%
and the major
sixth, the knowledge

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:32.940 align:middle line:10%
of transcendence of duality.

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we take this
one step further

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:42.780 align:middle line:84%
and overlay The Mona Lisa
on top of The Vitruvian Man,

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.820 align:middle line:90%
another surprise.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:49.900 align:middle line:84%
The proportions precisely when
we match the feet to be resting

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:54.400 align:middle line:84%
of The Vitruvian Man on the
same block of wood that The Mona

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Lisa's hands are resting
upon and we take the fingers

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.910 align:middle line:84%
of the Vitruvian man and
extend it to the edges,

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:08.950 align:middle line:84%
exact edges of the rectangular
shape of The Mona Lisa,

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:13.150 align:middle line:84%
we then see that the circle
perfectly inscribes The Mona

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:19.960 align:middle line:84%
Lisa's crown and that her
exact body shape from her elbow

What does this all mean?

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Why did da Vinci
depict all of this

00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:00.780 align:middle line:84%
in such incredible metaphor,
going to such lengths

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.980 align:middle line:84%
to occult it in this way
so that it would be found

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:08.010 align:middle line:90%
at some future point in time?

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Does this explanation of this
balance of hemi-synchronization

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:16.440 align:middle line:84%
have a physical
manifestation, in addition to

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:22.890 align:middle line:84%
this metaphorical spiritual
application of divine wisdom?

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:24.480 align:middle line:90%
Consider this.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:29.430 align:middle line:84%
When we achieve the full
awareness of the philosopher's

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:35.640 align:middle line:84%
stone, the stone that is formed
is, not only in the heart,

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:41.400 align:middle line:84%
but it is also now resident as
the knob on the staff of Hermes

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.720 align:middle line:84%
in the cave of Brahma
in the location

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:50.780 align:middle line:84%
between the pineal gland
and the pituitary gland.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:54.080 align:middle line:84%
The pituitary gland sits
at the location where

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.220 align:middle line:84%
the left eye connects
to the right brain

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.780 align:middle line:84%
and the right eye connects
to the left brain.

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is called the optic
chiasm, another representation

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:07.160 align:middle line:90%
of the X.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:11.090 align:middle line:84%
This is an achievement of
this perfection in balance.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And when this occurs, we
start to grow a new crystal

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:18.440 align:middle line:90%
inside the cave of Brahman.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:22.200 align:middle line:10%
The pineal gland is represented
by the philosopher's stone,

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.260 align:middle line:10%
Jade satellite, pyramid.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And the pituitary gland is
represented in its proportions

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:32.790 align:middle line:84%
as the divine feminine,
the two together,

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:37.670 align:middle line:84%
creating the sacred secretion
that comes down the spine

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:41.250 align:middle line:84%
and then back up from the
coccyx through the spine

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:44.380 align:middle line:84%
and through the energy
centers of the chakras

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:49.480 align:middle line:84%
to find its resting place in
the full activation of the crown

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:50.770 align:middle line:90%
chakra.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:55.030 align:middle line:84%
This crown chakra activation
is accompanied by the formation

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:57.190 align:middle line:90%
of a new crystal.

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:59.740 align:middle line:84%
This crystal, unlike
the ring cell,

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.720 align:middle line:90%
is not simply an amber crystal.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.560 align:middle line:84%
This takes on a
different quality.

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:08.980 align:middle line:10%
The crown chakra is ruled
by the planet Jupiter.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.770 align:middle line:10%
And therefore,
the planet Jupiter

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:15.190 align:middle line:10%
is best represented
by the tiger's eye.

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:18.460 align:middle line:84%
The tiger's eye becomes the
knob on the staff of Hermes.

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:23.650 align:middle line:84%
It becomes the new
way for us to perceive

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:26.050 align:middle line:90%
beyond the time construct.

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:30.190 align:middle line:84%
The stone that grows in between
our hemispheres of our brain

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:31.430 align:middle line:90%
in the cave of Brahman--

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:33.850 align:middle line:84%
or often referred to
as the wedding hall--

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:39.340 align:middle line:84%
is called the kalindra
stone, the kali dragonstone,

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.190 align:middle line:90%
the tiger's eye.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:46.330 align:middle line:84%
This represents the
transcendence of duality

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:50.180 align:middle line:84%
and its ultimate representation,
the time construct,

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:55.130 align:middle line:84%
the realization that time does
not only go in one direction

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:59.330 align:middle line:84%
but that it simultaneously
goes in the opposite direction.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:04.160 align:middle line:84%
As we proceed through
the equinox, we are also,

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:10.000 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, simultaneously
precessing going backwards

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.750 align:middle line:84%
on the processional
cycle of 24,000 years.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:20.200 align:middle line:84%
That 24,000 year cycle means
that Pisces goes backward

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.290 align:middle line:90%
to Aquarius, where we are now.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Our viewpoint of
our understanding

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.580 align:middle line:84%
of our consciousness
and where we are,

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:34.060 align:middle line:84%
will now adjust to the new
paradigm of the Aquarian

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.520 align:middle line:90%
operating system.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.600 align:middle line:84%
The Aquarian operating
system, for us,

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.680 align:middle line:84%
means an entirely
new paradigm on how

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.890 align:middle line:84%
we experience time, how we
interact with others, how

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:46.200 align:middle line:90%
we conduct our relationships.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Even the very basis and
foundation of the nuclear family

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:53.800 align:middle line:84%
unit will now be looked
at in a new construct,

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:59.640 align:middle line:84%
whether or not humanity will
be subservient to overlords,

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.550 align:middle line:84%
to greater governance
and more control.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:09.450 align:middle line:84%
Or will it now move into
a new paradigm of freedom

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:14.160 align:middle line:84%
that is represented by the
personality and the culture that

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:18.360 align:middle line:84%
will come along with the
frequency of the Aquarian age?

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:22.350 align:middle line:84%
This is the experience that we
are going through right now.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And it has a profound impact
on our day-to-day lives.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:31.320 align:middle line:84%
We have the opportunity now
to become active participants

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.890 align:middle line:84%
in our experience by
being the change we

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:36.150 align:middle line:90%
want to see in the world.

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:38.600 align:middle line:90%
