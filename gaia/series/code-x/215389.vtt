>> Some believe perception
defines our reality,

that the only real obstacles
that we experience in this world

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.480 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that we
persistently allow ourselves

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.510 align:middle line:90%
to attach to and believe.

Maybe what we consider
to be random is not

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.180 align:middle line:90%
really random at all.

This season on Code X,
Metatron, that great architect

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.140 align:middle line:10%
of this universal simulation,
has left us a cipher.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Metatron's cube is
actually the geometric form

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:36.050 align:middle line:84%
that defines the entire universe
and our perception within it.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.740 align:middle line:84%
We are not trapped in this
cube, this matrix of mind.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.850 align:middle line:84%
Rather, we are active
participants in it

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.895 align:middle line:90%
for our greatest good.

00:00:45.895 --> 00:00:49.790 align:middle line:84%
All of it is interconnected
in a sublime symphony

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.850 align:middle line:90%
of music and geometry.
