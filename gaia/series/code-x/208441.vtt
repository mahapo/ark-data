>> In our previous episodes,
we've seen already how Leonardo

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.470 align:middle line:10%
da Vinci has encrypted
detailed mathematical constants

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.730 align:middle line:10%
and other information into his
various works after the time he

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.520 align:middle line:10%
spent in Egypt,
"The Vitruvian Man"

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.030 align:middle line:10%
being principal in the first
encryption that I was able

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.410 align:middle line:10%
to decrypt.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.880 align:middle line:84%
Besides Leonardo
da Vinci, however,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.010 align:middle line:84%
were there other people
during the Renaissance who

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.530 align:middle line:90%
possessed similar knowledge?

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Because surely it
couldn't only be

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.910 align:middle line:84%
that Leonardo had access
to such profound insights

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.450 align:middle line:90%
and information.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.010 align:middle line:84%
The others that we noted
that we have found thus far--

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.610 align:middle line:84%
and there are probably many that
we don't yet know or realize--

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.520 align:middle line:84%
actually were so concerned
that they might be found out

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.940 align:middle line:84%
that they felt the need to
encrypt all of their efforts

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.810 align:middle line:84%
not only in the
form of encryption

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.540 align:middle line:84%
that we found already, both
mathematical and artistic

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.490 align:middle line:84%
related, but even
under a pen name.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Might that pen name have
been William Shakespeare?

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.530 align:middle line:84%
William Shakespeare
is quite possibly

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.240 align:middle line:84%
one of the most famous
people and prominent figures

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.820 align:middle line:90%
in English literature.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.210 align:middle line:10%
Today, just the volume
of words that he

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.160 align:middle line:10%
himself innovated and brought
to the world is astounding.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.620 align:middle line:84%
One could write an
entire dictionary out

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.250 align:middle line:84%
of just the words he introduced
to the English language alone.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And yet, he even
introduced concepts

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.440 align:middle line:84%
that were prevalent
in other languages

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.199 align:middle line:84%
in the course of
his plays, sonnets,

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.660 align:middle line:90%
and other literary works.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.300 align:middle line:84%
William Shakespeare,
today, stands

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.850 align:middle line:84%
as a paragon of
English literature

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.930 align:middle line:84%
that is still studied and
re-studied over and over again

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.990 align:middle line:90%
by students the world over.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.390 align:middle line:10%
One of the people
that has done one

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.760 align:middle line:10%
of the most extensive
research projects

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.960 align:middle line:10%
around William Shakespeare
is my friend and colleague,

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.970 align:middle line:10%
Alan Green.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.340 align:middle line:10%
Alan is the quintessential
cryptographer and cryptologist

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.030 align:middle line:10%
that has cracked the
Shakespeare code, realizing

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.130 align:middle line:10%
that William Shakespeare
himself is actually

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.660 align:middle line:10%
a collective of several
different Rosicrucian

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.600 align:middle line:10%
and Renaissance period
polymaths who not only wrote

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.760 align:middle line:10%
the plays of
William Shakespeare,

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.430 align:middle line:10%
but also encrypted the
sonnets, 154 of which

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.200 align:middle line:10%
include deep and profound
messages of significance

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.660 align:middle line:10%
relevant to our day today.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And, in addition, they even
wrote the King James version

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.340 align:middle line:90%
of the Bible.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.580 align:middle line:10%
Alan is going to be
explaining to us what

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.980 align:middle line:10%
he has found as
he has researched

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.900 align:middle line:10%
all of the works of William
Shakespeare and the simplicity,

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.480 align:middle line:10%
as a starting point, of
the cover of "The Sonnets."

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.070 align:middle line:84%
These were poems written
in such beautiful prose.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.240 align:middle line:10%
And they mirror iambic
pentameter mathematical

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.230 align:middle line:10%
principles, yet again
another form of experiencing

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.280 align:middle line:10%
geometric beauty.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.860 align:middle line:90%


00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.210 align:middle line:84%
Alan Green has decrypted
the cover of "The Sonnets."

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.085 align:middle line:84%
And we're excited to
share it with you today.

00:03:58.085 --> 00:04:00.920 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the
original title page

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.810 align:middle line:84%
of Shakespeare's "Sonnets,"
as first published in 1609.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.880 align:middle line:10%
It looks fairly
normal for the period

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.100 align:middle line:10%
except for the two
horizontal lines

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.560 align:middle line:10%
that usually had critical
information between them.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.950 align:middle line:10%
The fact that they are
empty is a clue that's

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.709 align:middle line:10%
been ignored for 400 years.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.140 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to look deeper.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.580 align:middle line:10%
We're going to literally connect
the dots, the punctuation.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.360 align:middle line:10%
The TT Stands for Thomas
Thorpe, the publisher.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.850 align:middle line:10%
Look at the italic
slope of that second T.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.200 align:middle line:10%
It's actually guiding us
to connect this dot at 1609

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.290 align:middle line:10%
to this dot at imprinted, using
the slope in T as a guide.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.830 align:middle line:10%
Is there any other dot that's
drawing attention to itself?

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.990 align:middle line:10%
Well, yeah.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.290 align:middle line:10%
The G dot is only about 10 times
the size it's supposed to be.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.664 align:middle line:10%
And so, let's connect it to
the D dot and to the 1609 dot.

00:04:59.664 --> 00:05:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And we find we have a
perfect right angle triangle.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.250 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, just as that
second T was a guide,

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.350 align:middle line:84%
the dot after that
second T is a guide.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.970 align:middle line:84%
If we look where the 1609
dot is pointing through

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.260 align:middle line:84%
there and on up, it lands at
the right end of this seemingly

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.900 align:middle line:90%
random top horizontal line.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.785 align:middle line:10%
But, obviously, it's not random.

00:05:24.785 --> 00:05:29.920 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to take that point
and connect it to the G,

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.610 align:middle line:10%
and it to the D, and again we
have another second right angle

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.750 align:middle line:10%
triangle.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Kind of makes you wonder
about the second line

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.380 align:middle line:90%
here and, yes, same situation.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.750 align:middle line:10%
The only dot left is
the Aspley dot here.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.510 align:middle line:10%
And if we do the
same thing here,

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.190 align:middle line:10%
we find we've got four
perfect right angle triangles.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.020 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that last
one is more than

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.940 align:middle line:90%
an ordinary rectangle triangle.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.150 align:middle line:10%
It's a perfect three,
four, five triangle.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.970 align:middle line:10%
Well, remember Pythagorean
Theory from high school?

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.870 align:middle line:10%
3 squared plus 4 squared
equals 4 squared, yes?

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.610 align:middle line:10%
So, what is this really?

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.380 align:middle line:10%
It's actually hiding this.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.080 align:middle line:10%
A perfect circle passes
through all the six points.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.990 align:middle line:10%
This is a visual
representation of something

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.200 align:middle line:10%
called Thales Theorem, named
after the Greek philosopher who

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.370 align:middle line:10%
scholars believe was
Pythagoras's mentor.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.615 align:middle line:10%
But Thales is best known
as the first person

00:06:30.615 --> 00:06:32.740 align:middle line:10%
to measure the height of
the Great Pyramid of Giza,

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:38.060 align:middle line:10%
and he did it using the geometry
of right angle triangles.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's complete
the image by connecting

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.340 align:middle line:84%
the two remaining intersections
between the circle

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.450 align:middle line:84%
and the horizontal
lines here and here.

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, obviously, no one works
at this level of precision just

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:50.558 align:middle line:90%
to hide some triangles.

00:06:50.558 --> 00:06:52.100 align:middle line:10%
There's got to be
more going on here.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:59.560 align:middle line:84%
We must measure them,
"By G," "to be," E, NE.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.360 align:middle line:84%
During the Renaissance,
the letter G

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.370 align:middle line:84%
was often used on
maps and emblems

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.950 align:middle line:84%
to indicate the
globe or the Earth.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And, anciently, the
Pythagoreans used the letter G

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.110 align:middle line:90%
to mean geometry itself.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.600 align:middle line:90%
They're measuring the Earth.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.340 align:middle line:84%
So looking again at these
TT dots connected to the G,

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:25.420 align:middle line:84%
we have, in the easterly
direction, E for east.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's a zero
horizontal baseline.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, if it's really about
measuring the Earth, perhaps

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.610 align:middle line:84%
all these lines that
are radiating out

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.510 align:middle line:84%
from this enormous G dot
drawing attention to itself that

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.120 align:middle line:84%
are all radiating out
from it, maybe they

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.060 align:middle line:84%
are intended to be thought
of as lines of latitude.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:53.200 align:middle line:84%
If we measure this one,
it's 20 degrees exactly.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And this one below the
horizontal baseline

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.030 align:middle line:90%
is 20 degrees exactly.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.070 align:middle line:84%
But we have another
baseline here, don't we?

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.650 align:middle line:84%
That we discovered the
tangent to the circle.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:05.650 align:middle line:84%
If we use that as a baseline,
there's another angle here,

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:06.550 align:middle line:90%
20 degrees.

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.280 align:middle line:84%
They're all
perfectly 20 degrees.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.037 align:middle line:84%
Makes you wonder about these
two, the remaining ones that

00:08:12.037 --> 00:08:13.870 align:middle line:84%
are on the circumference,
the only ones that

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.070 align:middle line:90%
have not been measured.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.820 align:middle line:90%
Because they're not perfect.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to measure
them by trigonometry.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.140 align:middle line:90%
I will spare you the math again.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:29.260 align:middle line:84%
But, essentially, we can surmise
that because this is obviously

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:34.270 align:middle line:84%
oriented to the north of its
baseline, and this to the east,

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:39.655 align:middle line:84%
perhaps they are latitude
north, longitude east, "NE."

00:08:39.655 --> 00:08:42.370 align:middle line:90%


00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, the numbers are
here and here worked out.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.280 align:middle line:10%
Is it true that they
are coordinates?

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.806 align:middle line:10%
Let that sink in.

00:08:53.806 --> 00:08:57.280 align:middle line:10%
It's stunning,
exquisite, all done

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.725 align:middle line:10%
by placement of the
punctuation and two lines.

00:09:02.725 --> 00:09:06.462 align:middle line:90%


00:09:06.462 --> 00:09:12.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Alan's research is showing us
that with the simplicity of two

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:17.590 align:middle line:10%
straight lines and six dots, one
of which was oversized by about

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:23.200 align:middle line:10%
10 times versus the others,
the writers of "The Sonnets"

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.580 align:middle line:10%
encrypted something very
profound in a mathematical

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:31.390 align:middle line:10%
relationship called
Thales Theorem.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And, in addition,
as we'll soon see,

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.850 align:middle line:84%
almost all the major
mathematical constants

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:40.300 align:middle line:84%
can be derived from the
extrapolation of the Thales

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.190 align:middle line:90%
Theorem.

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:43.810 align:middle line:90%
But where is this going?

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:48.910 align:middle line:10%
Why would these Rosicrucian,
hermetic wisdom seekers

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:53.260 align:middle line:10%
be encrypting the
cover of "The Sonnets"?

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.900 align:middle line:84%
First and foremost, probably
to protect their own lives

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.530 align:middle line:90%
and identity.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Many of these people were
involved in higher society

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.780 align:middle line:90%
in England at the time.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Their queen, Queen Elizabeth,
was known as the Virgin Queen,

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:14.380 align:middle line:84%
very much attempting to protect
her status as a virgin, which

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:20.380 align:middle line:84%
was very important politically
vis-a-vis the Pope in Rome.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And let's not forget that
her father, King Henry VIII,

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:28.330 align:middle line:84%
was definitely and
athmatically seen

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:32.060 align:middle line:84%
in Rome because of
his breakaway church

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.910 align:middle line:90%
in the Church of England.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:36.940 align:middle line:90%
This was a highly charged time.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.420 align:middle line:84%
The identities and
actions of those

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:45.640 align:middle line:84%
that use the pen name of William
Shakespeare were very important

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.330 align:middle line:90%
and must be protected.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:52.270 align:middle line:84%
The individuals that were among
those people that collectively

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:54.100 align:middle line:84%
were considered
William Shakespeare

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:57.130 align:middle line:84%
were none other than the
Queen's mathematician

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:01.660 align:middle line:84%
and astrologer,
John Dee, as well as

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:07.840 align:middle line:84%
her lover, Edward de Vere,
including as well Sir Francis

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Bacon, and beyond
that, others inclusive

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:14.950 align:middle line:90%
of Christopher Marlowe.

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:18.200 align:middle line:84%
These people wrote together
the works of "The Sonnets"

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.000 align:middle line:90%
and the plays.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.340 align:middle line:90%


00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:28.290 align:middle line:84%
But what and why
have they encrypted?

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, Alan, through his
17 years of research,

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:38.360 align:middle line:84%
has been able to uncover
these encryptions for us today

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:44.050 align:middle line:84%
and a great mystery pointing
to one irrevocable place,

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:48.180 align:middle line:90%
the Rostau, or Giza Plateau.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:53.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, here are the two
proportions that produced the e

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.000 align:middle line:10%
minus 1 ratio followed by
another sequence of proportions

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.210 align:middle line:10%
in purple.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:00.460 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to do the math.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Just hold your breath because
the ratios of these proportions

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:12.670 align:middle line:84%
are to an incredible 2/5,000 of
a foot and 4/5,000 of a meter,

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:14.150 align:middle line:90%
staggering.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:18.190 align:middle line:10%
So the three most
prominent units of measure

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:21.700 align:middle line:10%
are found intimately
connected to each other

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:26.410 align:middle line:10%
in the basic proportions of the
pyramid and in the same place

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:32.240 align:middle line:10%
where we found the
12 math constants.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:38.470 align:middle line:84%
If we reduce the
green foot to Unity,

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:44.890 align:middle line:90%
the red measures 1.718 feet.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:48.520 align:middle line:84%
This is actually the
structure of Euler's number

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:53.170 align:middle line:90%
e, the ratio 1 to 1.718.

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:57.130 align:middle line:90%
And so the cubit is e minus 1.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:01.240 align:middle line:84%
This is the relationship
between foot and cubit.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.860 align:middle line:10%
Jacob Bernoulli, in 1683,
working on compound interest,

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.290 align:middle line:10%
discovered this
formula, the same one

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.570 align:middle line:10%
that banks use today to
calculate the interest we

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:12.040 align:middle line:10%
owe on our credit cards.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.140 align:middle line:10%
One is the amount
that we borrow.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:19.150 align:middle line:10%
And if we're compounding at
100% interest continuously,

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:23.110 align:middle line:10%
the maximum possible owed
on a loan of $1.00 converges

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:27.850 align:middle line:10%
to 1.718, and the
total is e, 2.718.

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:31.210 align:middle line:10%
And that's the total
owed to the bank.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.370 align:middle line:10%
This rate of growth
is inherently

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:35.170 align:middle line:10%
built in to creation.

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:38.200 align:middle line:10%
It's the natural
base of logarithms.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.570 align:middle line:10%
The incredible thing
is this implies

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:46.690 align:middle line:10%
the foot is synonymous with the
principle, the original Unity,

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:47.830 align:middle line:10%
what we start with.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:50.200 align:middle line:10%
And the cubit, the
interest or growth,

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.340 align:middle line:10%
now doesn't only
apply to banking.

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:56.410 align:middle line:10%
It shows up in calculus,
probability theory.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:00.520 align:middle line:10%
It's used to predict population
growth or the rate of spread

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.660 align:middle line:10%
of an epidemic.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.510 align:middle line:10%
Its inverse is the rate
of radioactive decay.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.490 align:middle line:10%
It's everywhere.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:09.700 align:middle line:10%
Newton found the
same thing in 1669

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.700 align:middle line:10%
with this infinite
series of what's

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.800 align:middle line:10%
called reciprocal factorials.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.020 align:middle line:10%
They're on the bottom with
the exclamation points.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:21.940 align:middle line:10%
They simply mean 1, 2 times 1,
3 times 2 times 1, et cetera,

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.170 align:middle line:10%
to infinity.

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:28.270 align:middle line:10%
And this part of the
series converges to 1.718.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:32.350 align:middle line:10%
And there's the one,
Unity, preceding it exactly

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.975 align:middle line:10%
as in the Bernoulli's formula.

00:14:34.975 --> 00:14:36.850 align:middle line:10%
Haven't we always been
told that the foot was

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:39.760 align:middle line:10%
based on the average
size of a human foot

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.490 align:middle line:10%
and the cubit on the distance
from the point of the index

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:43.870 align:middle line:10%
finger to the elbow?

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:45.590 align:middle line:10%
And doesn't such
an arbitrary choice

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:49.360 align:middle line:10%
sound bizarrely
unscientific, especially now

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.730 align:middle line:10%
that we see beyond
doubt they're both

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.580 align:middle line:10%
based on this mathematically
significant relationship,

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.440 align:middle line:10%
the universal constant of e?

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.200 align:middle line:10%
So what about the meter?

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.950 align:middle line:10%
By reducing it by the same
ratio to match the Unity foot,

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:08.080 align:middle line:10%
we discover this meter is
the equivalent of 3.281 feet.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.480 align:middle line:10%
Now, is there any
mathematical connection

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:14.100 align:middle line:10%
between it and the cubit?

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:18.840 align:middle line:10%
Well, the French derived it
from one 10 millionth part

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.560 align:middle line:10%
of the meridian of the
polar circumference.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.980 align:middle line:84%
At least that's based on
the science of geodesy,

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.710 align:middle line:84%
measuring the actual
size of the Earth

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:31.860 align:middle line:84%
by the inherent
geometry of circles.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.670 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps we should look at other
reliable, consistent attributes

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:39.120 align:middle line:10%
of our planet, like the 12
hours of day and the 12 hours

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.420 align:middle line:10%
of night that mark
the Earth's rotation.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:45.870 align:middle line:84%
Or the 12-month seasons
of its yearly revolution

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:50.670 align:middle line:84%
of the sun, which gives rise
to the 12-month zodiac signs

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:51.790 align:middle line:90%
of the constellations.

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:55.140 align:middle line:10%
Which themselves embody a
retrograde pattern far more

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:58.290 align:middle line:10%
mysterious to track, but which
the ancient Vedic scriptures

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.920 align:middle line:10%
declare is based on a series
of seasons, if you will,

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:06.000 align:middle line:10%
that take our planet through
an inconceivably long cycle

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.750 align:middle line:10%
in multiple increments of 1,200
years each for the Iron Age,

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:12.390 align:middle line:10%
two times 1,200
each for the Bronze,

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.460 align:middle line:10%
three times 1,200 each
for the Silver Age,

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:16.710 align:middle line:10%
four times 1,200 each
for the Golden Age,

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:20.100 align:middle line:10%
and which altogether
constitutes Plato's Great Year,

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.770 align:middle line:10%
a cycle of 12,000
years ascending

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:24.660 align:middle line:10%
to 12,000 years descending.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.930 align:middle line:84%
The question is, do we see a
reflection of such patterns

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:32.820 align:middle line:84%
anywhere but here in the
meter cubit relationship?

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we take a
circle of radius 1 meter,

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:42.450 align:middle line:90%
its circumference is 12 cubits.

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:48.000 align:middle line:84%
So one cubit is exactly
this portion of the arc,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.770 align:middle line:84%
1/6 of a slice of
pie, or pi over 6,

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:55.770 align:middle line:84%
just the way we measure
angles in radians.

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:59.010 align:middle line:90%
Pi over 6 is 0.5236.

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:01.800 align:middle line:84%
If we take the cubit
and feet and divide

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.220 align:middle line:84%
by the meter in feet,
it's precisely the same.

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:08.317 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful, yes?

00:17:08.317 --> 00:17:09.609 align:middle line:90%
Let's take the whole thing now.

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:13.059 align:middle line:84%
Make foot cubit meter
the radius of our circle.

00:17:13.059 --> 00:17:18.500 align:middle line:84%
The circumference
now is 12 pi feet.

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:24.040 align:middle line:84%
That's an astounding
99.9993% accuracy.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Or look at just cubic
meter as the radius.

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.340 align:middle line:90%
Let's stretch this here.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:33.850 align:middle line:84%
That's now 10 pi
feet circumference.

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:37.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when we
make the cubit be

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:42.190 align:middle line:84%
the perfect e minus 1 meter,
the perfect pi over 6,

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:44.320 align:middle line:84%
which works out to this
little formula here,

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:48.250 align:middle line:84%
and the foot is perfect Unity,
the inherent mathematical

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:52.570 align:middle line:84%
perfection is in there
between foot and cubit e,

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:55.690 align:middle line:90%
between cubit and meter pi.

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:57.910 align:middle line:90%
And it produces this--

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:06.580 align:middle line:84%
cubit meter is exactly 5 feet,
all but for a minuscule 0.00004

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:08.120 align:middle line:90%
feet.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:14.410 align:middle line:84%
That's to an incredible
accuracy of 2/50,000 of a foot.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:16.360 align:middle line:84%
To put that into
perspective, it's

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:20.050 align:middle line:84%
roughly the size of a
human red blood cell.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, that means that
all three combined is 6 feet.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, the numbers 5 and
6 are found everywhere

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:32.650 align:middle line:84%
in sacred geometry,
5 representing

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:35.050 align:middle line:84%
the microcosm of the
normal everyday life

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.450 align:middle line:84%
we experience on
Earth, 6 representing

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.580 align:middle line:84%
the macrocosm, the
state of being we

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:43.150 align:middle line:84%
associate with divine wisdom
or our reconnection with God.

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And how does man
attain this state?

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Simply by recognizing
the presence

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:52.030 align:middle line:84%
of the one, the original
Unity, out of which

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:56.050 align:middle line:84%
the five of earthly
existence has grown.

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:59.560 align:middle line:84%
So we see there's a stunning
spiritual metaphor playing out

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:04.030 align:middle line:84%
here in this trinity of the
world's predominant measuring

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:04.870 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Foot, cubic, meter
simultaneously and cumulatively

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.335 align:middle line:84%
representing three
different stages of growth.

00:19:11.335 --> 00:19:15.069 align:middle line:90%


00:19:15.069 --> 00:19:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that we
learned very quickly as we

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:22.230 align:middle line:84%
analyze the Great Pyramid is
the Great Pyramid itself seems

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:middle line:84%
to house within its proportional
dimensions new hidden

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.400 align:middle line:90%
knowledge.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you lived several
thousands of years ago

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and you wanted to
encrypt something

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:37.050 align:middle line:84%
for future generations,
how could you encrypt it

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:41.760 align:middle line:84%
in a way that would be
impervious to physical and

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.670 align:middle line:90%
outside calamity, earthquakes?

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:47.490 align:middle line:84%
How could you ensure that
the papers and papyri

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:50.520 align:middle line:84%
that you wrote on wouldn't
one day be burned and lost

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.400 align:middle line:90%
to history?

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.440 align:middle line:10%
Possibly the only
way to do it would

00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:00.840 align:middle line:10%
be to build a standing structure
of mathematical proportions

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:04.350 align:middle line:10%
that were so obvious
to the seeker

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:07.170 align:middle line:10%
that he or she could
determine on their own

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:12.235 align:middle line:10%
the messages held within in a
message of standing and living

00:20:12.235 --> 00:20:13.035 align:middle line:10%
stone.

00:20:13.035 --> 00:20:15.970 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:20.080 align:middle line:84%
What we've found, and what
Alan's research has revealed,

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.290 align:middle line:84%
is that the Great
Pyramid actually

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:27.850 align:middle line:84%
houses and embeds within it
all the mathematical constants.

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:29.860 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we have
taken this analysis

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:34.180 align:middle line:84%
to include over 80 of the
mathematical and physical

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:37.540 align:middle line:84%
constants that virtually
determine the nature

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.420 align:middle line:90%
of our universe around us.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And, additionally, even the
units of measure themselves

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:48.280 align:middle line:84%
that we use through
the ages, namely

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:56.890 align:middle line:84%
the royal Egyptian cubit,
which is 1.718 feet, the meter,

00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:02.495 align:middle line:84%
as well as the foot, all
embedded into the construction

00:21:02.495 --> 00:21:03.370 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Pyramid.

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:07.420 align:middle line:90%


00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.560 align:middle line:90%
But what does this tell us?

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.850 align:middle line:84%
The ancient builders
of the Giza Plateau

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:17.890 align:middle line:84%
seemed to very clearly have
known the foot, the cubit,

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:21.460 align:middle line:84%
and the meter, and have
embedded in the construction

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.280 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid
advanced knowledge

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.400 align:middle line:84%
possibly exceeding
our own knowledge

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:31.420 align:middle line:84%
today of fundamental
mathematical constants.

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:36.460 align:middle line:84%
What the Renaissance polymaths
had uncovered and understood

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:39.310 align:middle line:84%
is that the Great
Pyramid is simply

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:43.960 align:middle line:84%
a reflection of our own
understanding and ascending

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.470 align:middle line:84%
awareness and greater
consciousness.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:50.030 align:middle line:90%


00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:55.670 align:middle line:84%
John Dee, the Queen's astrologer
in Elizabethan England,

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:58.890 align:middle line:84%
was a genius mathematician
and polymath.

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:02.270 align:middle line:84%
He was also an
incredible cryptographer

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:05.120 align:middle line:90%
who had done amazing things.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.960 align:middle line:84%
Some credit him even
with assisting the Queen

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:13.430 align:middle line:84%
to defeat the Spanish Armada,
more than 500 ships that

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:18.140 align:middle line:84%
came to attack and take
control and conquer England

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:20.660 align:middle line:90%
at its moment of weakness.

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:24.590 align:middle line:10%
Somehow, after the Queen
had met with John Dee,

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:28.610 align:middle line:10%
an incredible storm fell
upon the Spanish Armada,

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:33.360 align:middle line:10%
which left it broken
and destroyed,

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:38.610 align:middle line:10%
paving the way for England
to become a powerhouse nation

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:41.670 align:middle line:10%
vis-a-vis the other countries
across the European theater

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:44.380 align:middle line:10%
at the time.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:48.280 align:middle line:90%
John Dee was also a hermeticist.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:52.830 align:middle line:84%
As a hermeticist, he
understood the relationship

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:55.800 align:middle line:90%
of Thoth, Hermes Tresmegistus.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.940 align:middle line:10%
In fact, in a treatise
that he wrote,

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.760 align:middle line:10%
called "The Monas
Hieroglyphica,"

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.310 align:middle line:10%
he articulated the
details of what

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:10.710 align:middle line:10%
it meant to experience higher
knowledge of Hermeticism.

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:15.300 align:middle line:84%
In that hermetic treatise,
he describes all the details

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:21.510 align:middle line:84%
of this higher dimensional form
of understanding and wisdom.

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:24.360 align:middle line:10%
The "Monas Hieroglyphica"
stands for us today

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.750 align:middle line:10%
as an end sign and an
example of what each of us

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:34.350 align:middle line:10%
can attain to achieve a
higher level of wisdom.

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:36.240 align:middle line:84%
In our next
episodes, we're going

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.990 align:middle line:84%
to be showing you the
relationship of how

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:43.110 align:middle line:84%
we can take this higher
knowledge of hermetic wisdom

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:46.080 align:middle line:90%
and apply it to our daily lives.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:50.220 align:middle line:84%
We're also going to find
deeper, more hidden encryptions

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:53.460 align:middle line:84%
in others of Leonardo
da Vinci's works

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and even examine other
polymaths through time

00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:01.410 align:middle line:84%
who encrypted the selfsame
messages to us for our benefit

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:03.030 align:middle line:90%
and use today.

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:06.080 align:middle line:10%
