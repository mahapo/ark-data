00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.480 align:middle line:10%
What is philosophy?

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we break it down,
it's actually two words--

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.560 align:middle line:84%
"philo," or "philo,"
and "sophia."

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.170 align:middle line:90%
"Philo" just simply means lover.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.290 align:middle line:90%
And "sophia" means wisdom.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.380 align:middle line:90%
Philosophia is lover of wisdom.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.210 align:middle line:10%
But philosophy
was never intended

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.990 align:middle line:10%
to be something that was
simply the study of rhetoric

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.040 align:middle line:10%
or of what other philosophers
said and thought.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.550 align:middle line:10%
Maybe that was an element of
it, but in the ancient sense,

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.400 align:middle line:10%
philosophy was irrevocably tied
to the concept of polymathy.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.550 align:middle line:10%
A polymath-- also,
in the ancient sense,

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.050 align:middle line:10%
"poly" simply means many,
and "math" meant learning.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Philosophy was not
specifically an area of study.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.520 align:middle line:84%
It was something that came
as a result of studying

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.340 align:middle line:84%
many different things,
and those things

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.650 align:middle line:84%
would be a mix of what is today
referred to as the quadrivium.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:33.020 align:middle line:10%
The quadrivium is referring
to music, geometry, astronomy,

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.470 align:middle line:10%
and arithmetic.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Today, we teach
children that math

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.940 align:middle line:84%
is entirely separate from
music, when actually, it's not.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.980 align:middle line:84%
We also teach our young
people that art has nothing

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.920 align:middle line:84%
to do with science, when
actually, that is false.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.810 align:middle line:84%
The way we're teaching our
children in the world today

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.040 align:middle line:84%
is separating them out
from their own things

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.190 align:middle line:84%
that they would like to
pursue in their lives.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.800 align:middle line:84%
I was a musician who
had to give up music

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.280 align:middle line:84%
when I decided to become
a responsible contributor

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.540 align:middle line:90%
to society.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.580 align:middle line:10%
But if I could still be able
to practice music and also

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.720 align:middle line:10%
recognize that it is the
foundational form of geometry

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.260 align:middle line:10%
that informs all
science, then all matter

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.830 align:middle line:10%
and all energy in
the entire universe,

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.610 align:middle line:10%
isn't that something
that's important to know?

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.050 align:middle line:84%
We often think of our brain
as some sort of a hard drive

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.420 align:middle line:90%
for information.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.350 align:middle line:84%
But what if we looked
at this differently?

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.840 align:middle line:10%
What if we recognize that the
brain is really just a radio

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.700 align:middle line:10%
receiver and that in order
for us to tune the receiver,

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.410 align:middle line:10%
our emotional state has
a huge impact on that.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.230 align:middle line:84%
In this analogy, we could
say that the brain is a radio

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and the heart is
the tuning dial.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.260 align:middle line:84%
If we take this
analogy even further,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.200 align:middle line:84%
then maybe some
certain things we

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.960 align:middle line:84%
need to do to be able to
optimize our radio receivers

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.960 align:middle line:84%
and their tuning would
actually benefit us.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.860 align:middle line:84%
If we were a runner and we only
exercise one half of our body,

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.960 align:middle line:84%
that would really
cause a problem

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.160 align:middle line:84%
for having the balance required
to be a very successful runner.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.470 align:middle line:84%
The mental athlete
and philosopher

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.060 align:middle line:84%
knows that they must have
a balance of understanding

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.460 align:middle line:84%
to tune their minds
and their brains

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.820 align:middle line:84%
to their optimal
performance to receive

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.820 align:middle line:90%
universal consciousness.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.980 align:middle line:10%
If we look through
time, we'll notice

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.330 align:middle line:10%
that the people that seem to
discover the most mathematics

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.640 align:middle line:10%
and physics throughout history,
from Pythagoras and Plato

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.630 align:middle line:10%
to Socrates, in
concepts not only

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.610 align:middle line:10%
relational to geometric forms,
like the platonic solids

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.710 align:middle line:10%
or musical ratios and intervals,
like Pythagoras discovered,

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:20.410 align:middle line:10%
but all the way up into
including discrete mathematics

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.100 align:middle line:10%
as well as physics.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.060 align:middle line:10%
Isaac Newton discovered
gravity, but Isaac Newton

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.380 align:middle line:10%
was also a musician.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.060 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't know
that he was a deep alchemist.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.830 align:middle line:84%
In fact, 80% of
his works were all

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.090 align:middle line:84%
centered around concepts
of alchemy and astrology.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.850 align:middle line:84%
Isaac Newton believed
that he was finding

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.340 align:middle line:90%
the signature of the creator.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.570 align:middle line:84%
He was a deeply spiritual
man, and he realized

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.970 align:middle line:90%
that everything was connected.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.700 align:middle line:10%
Just like Johannes
Kepler, who gave us

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.520 align:middle line:10%
the Kepler's laws of motion.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.620 align:middle line:84%
He, also, was looking for this
architect of the universe,

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.610 align:middle line:84%
understanding, as well,
the musical concepts

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.865 align:middle line:84%
in what he termed the
harmony of the spheres.

00:05:12.865 --> 00:05:15.490 align:middle line:90%


00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.930 align:middle line:10%
If we go to RenÃ© Descartes,
the famous philosopher who

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:26.860 align:middle line:10%
references "I think; therefore,
I am," also, a mathematician,

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:33.130 align:middle line:10%
he's the person who gave us the
Cartesian plane in mathematics.

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.690 align:middle line:10%
As we go through
history, we start

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.690 align:middle line:10%
to realize that
even mathematicians

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.370 align:middle line:10%
like Leonhard Euler--

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.880 align:middle line:10%
Euler was an innovator
not only in math

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.440 align:middle line:10%
but across music, as
was Bernhard Riemann,

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.710 align:middle line:10%
of the famed Riemann
hypothesis, still

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:56.770 align:middle line:10%
an open problem in mathematics,
yet to be fully proven.

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:03.165 align:middle line:84%
He's also famous for
Neo-Riemannian music theory.

00:06:03.165 --> 00:06:04.290 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting, isn't it?

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Because today,
we've broken up all

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.790 align:middle line:84%
of these different
disciplines into

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.710 align:middle line:84%
their individual categories
and never the Twain shall meet.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:21.200 align:middle line:10%
Thus, turning off our ability
to receive from the universe.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.200 align:middle line:10%
Ramanujan was a
famous mathematician

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.180 align:middle line:10%
who was deeply spiritual also.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.690 align:middle line:10%
He was never trained
directly in mathematics.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.900 align:middle line:84%
Yet, Cambridge University,
the same university

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:38.930 align:middle line:84%
from which we had Isaac
Newton, declared Ramanujan one

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.870 align:middle line:84%
of the top mathematicians
of all time.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Yet, Ramanujan claims that
his discoveries mathematically

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.990 align:middle line:84%
were received from a
great universal source.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.990 align:middle line:84%
I fundamentally
believe that, as well.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.670 align:middle line:84%
As one who has tapped into this
higher consciousness from time

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:04.040 align:middle line:84%
to time, what I
experience is actually

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.600 align:middle line:84%
that they all come out as
equally balanced across science

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.610 align:middle line:90%
and art.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.530 align:middle line:84%
When I'm drawing
geometry, I'm not

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.500 align:middle line:90%
trying to draw an artistic form.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time
in my efforts, I'm

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.090 align:middle line:84%
actually trying to
discover and understand

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.640 align:middle line:90%
a principle of the universe.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And while I'm trying
to depict it in a way

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:32.090 align:middle line:84%
that my mind can synthesize, it
comes out in an artistic way.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.690 align:middle line:10%
I believe that the
future of humanity

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:40.640 align:middle line:10%
is to go deeply into this
next stage of our evolution,

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:46.100 align:middle line:10%
to realize that our brains are
not actually simply hard drives

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:51.080 align:middle line:10%
and storage units of information
but rather, radio receivers

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.830 align:middle line:10%
with which to receive
and understand

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:58.070 align:middle line:10%
the universal language
of consciousness.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.350 align:middle line:84%
I've said before I don't
really consider myself

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.790 align:middle line:84%
much of a mathematician because
I don't want to be pigeonholed

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.260 align:middle line:90%
into my way of thinking.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.510 align:middle line:90%
The old adage applies.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.100 align:middle line:84%
If you're a hammer,
then everything

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.140 align:middle line:90%
starts to look like a nail.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.470 align:middle line:10%
What I noticed is that for me
to get deeper into understanding

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.890 align:middle line:10%
of mathematics, often,
it is through the doorway

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:27.150 align:middle line:10%
and portal of music
or art or philosophy

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.220 align:middle line:10%
that I'm able to
tap into a higher

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.920 align:middle line:10%
understanding of
the underlying math

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.890 align:middle line:10%
and language behind
the concepts I'm

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.990 align:middle line:10%
trying to understand further.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:42.350 align:middle line:10%
We've all seen the very
famous Sistine Chapel

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:43.610 align:middle line:10%
in the fresco in the ceiling.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And I remember going there
for the very first time

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.930 align:middle line:84%
and just being awestruck at
the beauty of Michelangelo's

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:55.070 align:middle line:84%
artwork on that
Sistine Chapel ceiling.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:09:01.010 align:middle line:84%
We've all seen, also,
Adam outreaching to God

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.020 align:middle line:90%
in this representation.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.410 align:middle line:84%
But I remember the first
time I went there, I

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:08.150 align:middle line:84%
started to ask myself the
question, what is it that's

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:13.490 align:middle line:90%
around God in the painting?

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:18.185 align:middle line:84%
Could it possibly be the cross
section of a human brain?

00:09:18.185 --> 00:09:20.790 align:middle line:90%


00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And as you get deeper
into that analysis,

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.940 align:middle line:84%
you'll notice that the
cerebellum is prominently

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.920 align:middle line:90%
displayed on the right side.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.430 align:middle line:84%
You can also see all of
the different aspects

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:35.960 align:middle line:84%
of the prefrontal cortex,
the temporal lobe.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:40.610 align:middle line:84%
All of it being displayed
simply in this artistic form

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:45.020 align:middle line:84%
that he left on the ceiling
of the Sistine Chapel.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Even God the Father, in
this famous iconic image,

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:56.870 align:middle line:84%
has his leg shaped in a mirrored
imagery of Adam's right leg,

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.770 align:middle line:84%
just as the fingers
outreaching to each other

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:04.160 align:middle line:84%
are mirror images
of the same concept.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.590 align:middle line:84%
What's Michelangelo
trying to tell us?

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Is he trying to
tell us something

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:16.660 align:middle line:84%
about the nature of the
universe and the U-inverse?

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.400 align:middle line:84%
We also notice that
God the Father's head

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:22.600 align:middle line:84%
is in the prefrontal cortex,
where the brain has its highest

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:27.800 align:middle line:84%
degree of higher order
thought and creativity.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.160 align:middle line:84%
But what if the only
means to tap into this

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:36.450 align:middle line:84%
and move beyond this reptilian
brain of fight or flight

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:40.050 align:middle line:90%
is to balance the muscle?

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:45.870 align:middle line:10%
The mental athlete will know
that he or she must be balanced

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.170 align:middle line:10%
above all else, and
that balance can only

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.790 align:middle line:10%
be achieved
intellectually by having

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:57.690 align:middle line:10%
an understanding of music and
its equal, mirrored opposite

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:02.490 align:middle line:10%
across the corpus
callosum, mathematics.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:06.660 align:middle line:10%
Math and music are
simply representations

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.480 align:middle line:10%
of two opposite
sides of our brain,

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.380 align:middle line:10%
but that's also true as
well for visual art, which

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:17.500 align:middle line:10%
we have near our occipital
lobe at the back of the brain.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And its mirrored
opposite representation,

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:24.780 align:middle line:84%
in this context, is
the natural sciences.

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:29.670 align:middle line:84%
So we can now see the brain as a
different kind of receiver that

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:36.210 align:middle line:84%
ultimately is intended to
ignite and activate the center,

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:40.590 align:middle line:84%
right amid the corpus callosum,
the connective tissue that

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:46.410 align:middle line:84%
allows us to both think
and feel simultaneously.

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:49.170 align:middle line:84%
As we can balance
our brain muscle

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:52.530 align:middle line:84%
through our study
of the quadrivium,

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:57.750 align:middle line:84%
then we can actually activate
the pineal and pituitary

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.310 align:middle line:90%
glands.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And when we do so,
it forms a merkaba.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:08.070 align:middle line:84%
That merkaba allows us to access
different fields of awareness

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:11.580 align:middle line:84%
that are above and beyond our
third and fourth dimensional

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.720 align:middle line:90%
planes of understanding.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.500 align:middle line:84%
The philosophers
knew this, and yet it

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.050 align:middle line:84%
was something that
could be very dangerous

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:23.090 align:middle line:90%
during their lifetimes.

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:26.540 align:middle line:10%
Because as they got to this
point of higher knowledge

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:31.760 align:middle line:10%
and ascension, their
lives were at risk,

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.835 align:middle line:10%
and this has been seen over
and over and over again

00:12:34.835 --> 00:12:35.635 align:middle line:10%
throughout history.

00:12:35.635 --> 00:12:38.670 align:middle line:90%


00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.130 align:middle line:84%
The good news for us
today is we're now

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:44.160 align:middle line:90%
living in a different time.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.000 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is intended,
now through this aion,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.710 align:middle line:84%
this portion of our
procession of equinox

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:56.040 align:middle line:84%
and this age of Aquarius
is intended for us

00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:00.450 align:middle line:84%
to be able to seek and not
only seek but also experience

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:04.400 align:middle line:90%
this level of higher awareness.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.920 align:middle line:84%
That what the
philosophers experienced

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.230 align:middle line:84%
and all the myriad
discoveries that they

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:13.550 align:middle line:84%
had in their renaissances
throughout time,

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:16.490 align:middle line:84%
will now be coming
again to this Earth.

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:22.740 align:middle line:90%


00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Carl Jung was a very famous
psychologist and psychiatrist.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:33.090 align:middle line:10%
Carl had been a protege
of Sigmund Freud,

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:37.050 align:middle line:10%
but he realized the
limitations of Sigmund Freud's

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:40.320 align:middle line:10%
philosophical perspective
on psychiatry.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.800 align:middle line:10%
And he noticed that most
of the concepts of Freud

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:50.000 align:middle line:10%
were rooted in these very
arcane approaches and belief

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.820 align:middle line:10%
that mankind was
literally chained

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:57.910 align:middle line:10%
to the lower segments of the
Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:01.870 align:middle line:84%
But Carl Jung believed a
different future for humanity.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:07.640 align:middle line:84%
As a philosophical
wisdom-seeking alchemist,

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:13.430 align:middle line:84%
Carl Jung noted that there was
a divine future for humanity.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:17.390 align:middle line:10%
He called this process
individuation in a book

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.830 align:middle line:10%
that he wrote, called "Aion."

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:23.500 align:middle line:84%
This individuation
process is something

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:27.760 align:middle line:84%
that is achieved through
balanced thought and study

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.200 align:middle line:90%
resulting in philosophy.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.320 align:middle line:84%
What Carl Jung
believed is that as we

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.020 align:middle line:84%
ascend to higher
knowledge through learning

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:42.320 align:middle line:84%
to balance our brain centers
across the quadrivium,

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.310 align:middle line:84%
that we will be able to
experience new higher

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:52.040 align:middle line:84%
dimensional experiences
provided however, that we learn

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.180 align:middle line:90%
how to integrate our shadows.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.810 align:middle line:84%
If we live in a U-inverse,
every experience

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:03.410 align:middle line:90%
you have is your responsibility.

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:06.080 align:middle line:84%
My experiences are
my responsibility.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:11.060 align:middle line:84%
Fear could be real from
the perspective of danger.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:16.100 align:middle line:84%
Danger is real, but fear,
actually, is a choice.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:20.510 align:middle line:84%
How we interact and deal
with the deck of cards

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.940 align:middle line:84%
that we are dealt on
a day-to-day basis

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.880 align:middle line:84%
is what defines our reality,
not the deck of cards

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:26.750 align:middle line:90%
that we're given.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Every moment that we
experience can either

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.270 align:middle line:90%
be the best or the worst.

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:35.150 align:middle line:90%
The choice is up to us.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.760 align:middle line:84%
How we decide to
perceive the world

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.720 align:middle line:84%
defines our ultimate
experience with it,

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.470 align:middle line:84%
and Carl Jung understood
this, and he taught this

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:50.480 align:middle line:84%
in the concepts of
shadow integration.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Whatever we're judging
in other people

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:56.690 align:middle line:84%
is actually what we
do and simply don't

00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:00.660 align:middle line:84%
want to acknowledge in
our conscious minds.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And as we understand
this, we start

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:08.580 align:middle line:84%
to see the world around us
in a very different way.

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:13.720 align:middle line:84%
This is the mirror
of consciousness.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:17.290 align:middle line:84%
In order to access higher
planes and dimensions,

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:23.350 align:middle line:84%
we have to learn to transcend
these notions of duality,

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:27.070 align:middle line:84%
even down to the very
basic concepts of how

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:30.330 align:middle line:90%
we perceive light and dark.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:35.310 align:middle line:84%
The word "guru" comes
from two Sanskrit terms--

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:39.450 align:middle line:84%
"gu" and "ru," which
means light from dark.

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:44.400 align:middle line:84%
The light needs the dark as much
as the dark needs the light.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Even the very separation
of that light from dark

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.740 align:middle line:84%
is simply the polarity
of our own perception.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:55.230 align:middle line:84%
The alchemists
knew this concept.

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:59.550 align:middle line:84%
They taught it in a process
called the alchemical path.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And you can find it in
numerous images, both

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.290 align:middle line:84%
found in hermeticism
and Rosicrucianism

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.990 align:middle line:84%
and its many different
orders and forms.

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:15.170 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine that each
of us is like a iceberg,

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:17.300 align:middle line:84%
and imagine that your
conscious mind is

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.180 align:middle line:84%
the component of the iceberg
that's above the water.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.680 align:middle line:84%
It lives in a world
that it believes

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.400 align:middle line:90%
it's separate from altogether.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.540 align:middle line:84%
All the while, the iceberg may
not even be consciously aware,

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.690 align:middle line:84%
if it were sentient,
that most of the iceberg

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:31.580 align:middle line:90%
is actually underwater.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.980 align:middle line:84%
It perceives all of
it as being separate.

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:39.380 align:middle line:10%
But what if that entire world
above the surface of the water

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:44.240 align:middle line:10%
were actually a projection
from the iceberg that is

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.210 align:middle line:10%
under the surface of the water?

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:53.270 align:middle line:84%
This is the philosophy that
was taught to us by Carl Jung.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:56.600 align:middle line:84%
Everything spins
and all experiences

00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:02.270 align:middle line:84%
come back to oneness, but
it's up to us to perceive it.

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:05.900 align:middle line:84%
In alchemy, the way that this
process of the alchemical path

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:09.545 align:middle line:84%
is represented is through
the representation of birds.

00:18:09.545 --> 00:18:12.230 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:15.380 align:middle line:84%
These different categorizations
of the alchemical path

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:18.770 align:middle line:84%
are broken into the following
categories and stages--

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:26.150 align:middle line:84%
nigredo, or blackening,
the albedo, or whitening,

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:31.710 align:middle line:84%
the rubedo, or the reddening,
and the final stage,

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.800 align:middle line:90%
which is the phoenix.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.080 align:middle line:84%
These different
stages are represented

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:45.210 align:middle line:84%
by a crow for nigredo, a
swan for albedo, a pelican,

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:48.060 align:middle line:84%
representing
sacrifice for rubedo.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:51.750 align:middle line:84%
These images are contemplated
and well portrayed

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:55.470 align:middle line:84%
in numerous pieces
of hermetic art.

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Often at the center, we will
find the divine hermaphrodite,

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.610 align:middle line:84%
often depicted as wearing
both a black cloak on one side

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:06.610 align:middle line:90%
and a white cloak on the other.

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:12.160 align:middle line:84%
We see also the archetypes of
Apollo, the god of the sun,

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.820 align:middle line:84%
and Diana, the god of
the moon, representing

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:20.220 align:middle line:84%
our own way of
seeing the masculine

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:24.090 align:middle line:84%
and the feminine
energies of our universe.

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:27.000 align:middle line:84%
They are accompanied often
by similar archetypes

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.820 align:middle line:84%
of the phoenix that is
on fire that is adjacent

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:35.790 align:middle line:84%
to Apollo, holding the sun
in the palm of his hand,

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:39.800 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, next to a
rampant and powerful lion,

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.090 align:middle line:90%
representing courage.

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, Diana,
on the other hand,

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:49.340 align:middle line:84%
is holding the moon
in her left hand

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:55.010 align:middle line:84%
and accompanied by the deer and
all the representations that

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:58.730 align:middle line:84%
accompany that, the
aguila, or the thunderbird.

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:01.690 align:middle line:90%


00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:04.720 align:middle line:84%
All of these are simply
different perspectives

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:09.530 align:middle line:84%
across polarities of male
and feminine perception.

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And yet, in order for us to
merge these worlds together,

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:20.510 align:middle line:84%
we must balance our minds and
learn to observe rather than

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.290 align:middle line:90%
to judge.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Jesus gave two
great commandments.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.880 align:middle line:84%
He said love the Lord thy God
with all thy heart, might,

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:37.900 align:middle line:84%
mind, and strength, and love
thy neighbor as thyself.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.420 align:middle line:10%
Then he goes on
to say judge not,

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:44.590 align:middle line:10%
lest you be judged with the
same judgment with which you

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:47.530 align:middle line:10%
have judged others.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:51.640 align:middle line:84%
His message was not one
of hate thine enemy.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Take out an eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth,

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.700 align:middle line:84%
as had been taught
in the Old Testament.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:02.800 align:middle line:84%
But the New Testament was one
that was more about good news.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.310 align:middle line:84%
Don't judge because really,
you're just judging yourself

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:09.370 align:middle line:84%
and secondly, love your
neighbor as yourself.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:12.970 align:middle line:10%
The stages of alchemy
are intended for us

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:17.380 align:middle line:10%
to be able to learn to
integrate our shadow side

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:21.730 align:middle line:10%
and accept and love those
things about ourselves

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:24.370 align:middle line:10%
that we have a hard
time accepting.

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:27.400 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, you'll
start noticing crows

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.930 align:middle line:84%
in the world around
you, like, daily,

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:35.670 align:middle line:84%
making their squawking sound,
causing all kinds of havoc.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And make it to the point where
it starts to really bother you.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Then you'll know you're
clearly in the nigredo stage,

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.940 align:middle line:84%
or blackening stage, which
is where you're intended

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:48.810 align:middle line:84%
to confront and learn the
aspects of your shadow,

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:51.690 align:middle line:84%
those aspects of yourself
that you've repressed so

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:53.590 align:middle line:84%
deeply into your
subconscious mind

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:57.710 align:middle line:84%
so as not to identify
with them whatsoever.

00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:02.470 align:middle line:84%
These are the things that you
don't like about yourself.

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Albedo is a respite, and many
confuse the stage of albedo

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.630 align:middle line:84%
as an enlightenment
stage in itself.

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:13.210 align:middle line:84%
You get a bit of
a break, and you

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:17.480 align:middle line:84%
start realizing that life
isn't so bad after all.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Much of this activity
will be precipitated

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:24.090 align:middle line:90%
by some life crisis.

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And Carl Jung also
points this out,

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.730 align:middle line:84%
along with all the other
alchemists through history.

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:31.980 align:middle line:84%
As we proceed to
the next stage, we

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:35.730 align:middle line:84%
start experiencing the
opening of our other eye,

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.490 align:middle line:84%
our third eye, which
can see everywhere,

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:40.830 align:middle line:84%
represented by
the peacock, which

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:44.370 align:middle line:84%
has so many eyes on
all of its feathers.

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:46.590 align:middle line:84%
This is represented
by the yellowing.

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:48.360 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of a greenish-yellow.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And imagine the beauty of
the peacock opening up.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:57.080 align:middle line:84%
This is the center of this
wave of new experience.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:00.020 align:middle line:84%
You'll start experiencing these
things on a day-to-day basis.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:05.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you'll start to see
new experiences and perceptions

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:06.635 align:middle line:84%
that you never had
noticed before.

00:23:06.635 --> 00:23:09.630 align:middle line:90%


00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Then, you'll be
introduced to the concept

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:16.190 align:middle line:90%
of the animus and the anima.

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:20.300 align:middle line:84%
The anima and the animus
would be the representation

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:24.770 align:middle line:84%
of all those things that you
haven't liked about yourself

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:27.050 align:middle line:84%
and have not been
attracted to in yourself

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:32.640 align:middle line:90%
that personify the opposite sex.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Carl Jung says that as
we meet our anima, that

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:40.410 align:middle line:84%
would be their opposite
personality type embodied

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:42.330 align:middle line:84%
in the form of someone
you would not normally

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:44.790 align:middle line:84%
think to be
attractive, and now you

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:52.040 align:middle line:84%
find yourself magnetically
drawn to this personage.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.760 align:middle line:90%
This is called the rubedo.

00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:00.400 align:middle line:10%
The rubedo leads us to
the alchemical marriage,

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:04.360 align:middle line:10%
a necessary step in process
of the final integration

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:07.450 align:middle line:10%
of the shadow into
your consciousness,

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:11.930 align:middle line:10%
whereupon you start to see
the world in terms of empathy,

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:16.040 align:middle line:10%
love, and compassion.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:20.840 align:middle line:84%
The alchemical marriage is such
a critical aspect of alchemy

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.480 align:middle line:84%
that it is something
that must be entered

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:28.070 align:middle line:90%
into as a very sacred union.

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Think of it not as a
physical union, per se,

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:38.060 align:middle line:84%
but rather as a union of
the two sides of your mind--

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.250 align:middle line:84%
the left brain, if
you're right-handed,

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:43.730 align:middle line:84%
representing the rational
thought, the seats

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:46.220 align:middle line:84%
of mathematics and
natural sciences,

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:48.710 align:middle line:90%
like physics and chemistry.

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And the right brain, being
the seat of music, creativity,

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:58.340 align:middle line:84%
irrational thought,
out-of-the-box thinking

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:02.120 align:middle line:90%
and as well, total creativity.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.810 align:middle line:10%
When we learn to merge
these two aspects,

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:11.300 align:middle line:10%
then we find our lives take on
an entirely different meaning

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:16.420 align:middle line:10%
and scope as if by overnight.

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And then the soul emerges
as a newly-resurrected,

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:25.230 align:middle line:84%
and we call this the
stage of the phoenix.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:28.080 align:middle line:84%
This is when the
soul takes flight

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:32.220 align:middle line:84%
to experience, once again,
the oneness of self.

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.970 align:middle line:10%
