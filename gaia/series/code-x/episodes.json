Drawing parallels to Leonardo da Vinci’s mastery of perspective and vanishing points, Grant explains how we construct our own simulation of reality, filtering experience through conditioned biases. \n\nBy decoding Metatron’s Cube, he illustrates how this sacred geometric structure encodes the architecture of existence, shaping space, time, and consciousness itself. Rather than confining us, this framework offers a key to transcending illusion, empowering us to perceive beyond the limits of conditioned awareness and step into a higher understanding of reality.","teaser":"What is the relationship between Metatron’s Cube and our own perceptions?
