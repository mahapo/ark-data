00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.980 align:middle line:10%
The Last Supper painting
by Leonardo da Vinci

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.200 align:middle line:10%
is one of the most
famous pieces of art.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a Fresco located
in Milan, Italy,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.640 align:middle line:84%
and has been the
object of analysis

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.200 align:middle line:84%
by cryptographers for
many, many centuries.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.150 align:middle line:84%
As one of the most famous
works of art in the world

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.790 align:middle line:84%
and because it's
attached to a wall,

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.040 align:middle line:90%
this painting cannot be sold.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.290 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it's priceless.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.300 align:middle line:10%
This painting seems to house
so many inscriptions in it

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.020 align:middle line:10%
that, in fact, it's become the
subject of mainstream media

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.320 align:middle line:10%
and films for many years.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.230 align:middle line:10%
Dan Brown's account
in "The Da Vinci Code"

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.760 align:middle line:10%
is one example of this.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.880 align:middle line:10%
"Holy Blood, Holy
Grail" also points us

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.280 align:middle line:10%
in a similar direction,
hidden inscriptions

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.820 align:middle line:10%
inside the Last Supper painting.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.240 align:middle line:84%
The first of these that
everyone iconically remembers

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.220 align:middle line:84%
is that what we all
believed was John

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.340 align:middle line:84%
the apostle sitting to the
right of Jesus was not,

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.920 align:middle line:84%
in fact, John the
apostle at all.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.170 align:middle line:84%
In his very hermaphroditic
sort of garb and look,

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.200 align:middle line:84%
John is actually the
representation many

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.782 align:middle line:90%
believe to be Mary Magdalene.

00:01:33.782 --> 00:01:35.240 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that we notice is

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.960 align:middle line:84%
that there is a void space
between Jesus and Mary

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.760 align:middle line:90%
Magdalene.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Now Jesus has clearly
a symbol of what

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.640 align:middle line:84%
looks to be an upside
down triangle represented

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.050 align:middle line:90%
as the divine feminine.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.860 align:middle line:84%
What I realized is that
the inverted triangle

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.920 align:middle line:84%
of The Last Supper also
carries the exact same angular

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.830 align:middle line:90%
reference of 51.843 degrees.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Is this yet again pointing
us to the Giza Plateau?

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.710 align:middle line:84%
What we find here also is
other inscriptions deeply

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.680 align:middle line:84%
hidden within this
enigmatic painting.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.360 align:middle line:84%
Another example that we can see
here is that the face of Peter

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.510 align:middle line:84%
the apostle, who strangely
has his hand down the blouse

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.430 align:middle line:90%
of Mary Magdalene.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And his right hand
seems to be holding

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.440 align:middle line:84%
in a contorted
position, a knife.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And who is it that's sitting
in between Peter and Mary

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.600 align:middle line:90%
Magdalene?

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.820 align:middle line:84%
That's none other
than Judas himself.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.810 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you can see him
holding his 30 pieces of silver

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.600 align:middle line:90%
in a small bag.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Why would it appear
as though Peter

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.990 align:middle line:84%
is seeming to conspire
in some way, shape,

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.070 align:middle line:90%
or form with Mary Magdalene?

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And why is it that she's leaning
in to listen to his whisper?

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.900 align:middle line:84%
What would they have
to whisper about?

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And the face, there's something
with the face of Peter also

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.950 align:middle line:84%
that seems to be
drawing attention.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Weren't all the apostles
roughly the same age as Jesus?

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.030 align:middle line:84%
When Jesus was crucified,
he was widely known

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.880 align:middle line:90%
to have been 33 years old.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And yet we see the face of
Peter as being a man probably

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.850 align:middle line:84%
in his late 40s or early 50s,
having almost all gray, even

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.860 align:middle line:90%
white hair.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.170 align:middle line:84%
But is there something else that
we can notice about his face?

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we look at a
self-portrait of Leonardo da

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Vinci from a similar period
but later in his life,

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.640 align:middle line:84%
we'll notice that the face
of Leonardo da Vinci himself

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.110 align:middle line:84%
in his own self-portrait
matches the face of Peter

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:07.490 align:middle line:84%
the apostle, who later became
the head of the entire church.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And is the knife that's
being held behind his back

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.040 align:middle line:90%
a knife held by his hand?

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Or rather is he holding the
wrist of Mary Magdalene?

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:23.560 align:middle line:84%
These questions and more were
the subject of our analysis.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.190 align:middle line:84%
We also looked at the
back wall, noticing

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.150 align:middle line:84%
that there were many other
encryptions that somehow relate

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.375 align:middle line:84%
to other prominent places and
none other than the King's

00:04:34.375 --> 00:04:35.175 align:middle line:90%
Chamber itself.

00:04:35.175 --> 00:04:40.710 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>>: Prior to visiting the
Great Pyramid of Giza in 2018,

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Robert Grant intuitively
sketched two particular Greek

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.520 align:middle line:84%
letters in his notebook,
as if subconsciously making

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.030 align:middle line:84%
connections between the King's
Chamber and the Last Supper

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.980 align:middle line:90%
that were yet to be discovered.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.940 align:middle line:90%


00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>>: When I arrived in
Egypt, I looked down while

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.710 align:middle line:90%
in the King's Chamber.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.140 align:middle line:84%
I noticed the presence
of what looked

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:15.560 align:middle line:84%
to be two letters, the
alpha and the omega.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.340 align:middle line:84%
So, an alpha and omega
on the sarcophagus

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.380 align:middle line:90%
of the King's Chamber?

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.710 align:middle line:84%
Isn't the pyramid famously
devoid of any writing

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.900 align:middle line:90%
or hieroglyphics?

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And for thousands
of years hasn't

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:35.430 align:middle line:84%
this room been frequented by
millions of people potentially?

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Let's not forget this is
the most studied building

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:38.510 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.610 align:middle line:10%
It was the tallest building in
the world for well over 4,000

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.120 align:middle line:10%
years, and the King's
Chamber is the most prominent

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.300 align:middle line:10%
of the chambers within
the Great Pyramid.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.750 align:middle line:10%
How is it even possible
that this could not

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:53.890 align:middle line:10%
have been seen before?

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And is there
anything that relates

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.350 align:middle line:84%
to the Last Supper that might
point us in the same direction?

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.080 align:middle line:84%
You'll note that
underneath the table,

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.070 align:middle line:84%
you can see the feet of
several of the apostles.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.338 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
wearing sandals.

00:06:08.338 --> 00:06:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And you'll notice
as well that if you

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.230 align:middle line:84%
try to look for
the feet of Jesus,

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.105 align:middle line:84%
you will not be able to
see the feet of Jesus

00:06:13.105 --> 00:06:15.580 align:middle line:84%
because they are
obstructed by what

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:21.540 align:middle line:84%
looks to be the upper doorway
of some sort of portal

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.780 align:middle line:84%
in and out of the chapel
where the Last Supper

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.170 align:middle line:90%
painting is housed.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.120 align:middle line:10%
But what's also
interesting about this

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.240 align:middle line:10%
is that when we notice the
location of that portal--

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.980 align:middle line:10%
and if we believe
art historians,

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.160 align:middle line:10%
they say that later
in the 17th century,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.320 align:middle line:10%
a doorway was cut into the wall
of this very famous painting.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.090 align:middle line:84%
This doesn't really
seem to hold water

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.110 align:middle line:84%
for me because Leonardo da Vinci
was famous in his lifetime.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.520 align:middle line:10%
In fact, this was a very famous
Fresco that the King of France

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.450 align:middle line:10%
himself made particular mention
of in historical records.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:02.250 align:middle line:84%
So why would the
owners or the people

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.860 align:middle line:84%
that were taking
care of as caretakers

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.030 align:middle line:84%
of this important place
on hallowed ground

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:14.100 align:middle line:84%
have cut a doorway, obstructing
the painting of Leonardo da

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:14.910 align:middle line:90%
Vinci?

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.550 align:middle line:84%
Potentially even then known
as one of the greatest

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.580 align:middle line:90%
artists of all time.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>>: If in fact the doorway was
not cut into the Fresco years

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:28.800 align:middle line:84%
later, but had always been
there as Robert Grant suggests,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.540 align:middle line:84%
then the question arises, did
Leonardo da Vinci integrate

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.760 align:middle line:90%
this door into his masterpiece?

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And if so, what is
the significance

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.850 align:middle line:90%
of this possible encryption?

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.460 align:middle line:10%
>>: So when I started to notice
that the other proportions

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.930 align:middle line:10%
of the room of the King's
Chamber were relative

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:55.870 align:middle line:10%
to the Last Supper painting and
vice versa, I started to think,

00:07:55.870 --> 00:08:00.120 align:middle line:10%
are there other inscriptions
that might be hidden inside

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.320 align:middle line:10%
the walls of The Last Supper
painting that are showing us

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.885 align:middle line:10%
and pointing us back to
the King's Chamber itself?

00:08:06.885 --> 00:08:10.720 align:middle line:90%


00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>>: What Robert Grant
realized is that the placement

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:19.000 align:middle line:84%
of the alpha and the omega
on the rim of the sarcophagus

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.900 align:middle line:84%
within the King's Chamber
are proportionate to Jesus,

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.080 align:middle line:84%
the alpha, and Mary
Magdalene, the omega,

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.310 align:middle line:90%
within the Last Supper.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.830 align:middle line:90%


00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>>: And when we
place an overlay,

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.380 align:middle line:84%
the exact position of the
sarcophagus in its original

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:41.600 align:middle line:84%
position would occupy exactly
the doorway that is obstructing

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.140 align:middle line:84%
the feet of both Jesus
and Mary Magdalene.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And we'll also notice
that the proportions when

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.010 align:middle line:84%
we place precisely the
line of the ceiling

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.910 align:middle line:84%
against the back wall, which
would reference what we refer

00:08:55.910 --> 00:09:00.110 align:middle line:84%
to as the Western Wall
of the Great Pyramid,

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:05.070 align:middle line:84%
is precisely pointing to the
same proportional dimensions

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.310 align:middle line:84%
so that the entire
table in perspective

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:12.910 align:middle line:84%
could be viewed as being part
of the Last Supper scene.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Is this telling us something
more about the windows

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:20.230 align:middle line:84%
and portals and
tapestries that are

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:24.320 align:middle line:84%
located within the Last
Supper painting itself?

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we also noticed that
the location in the Last Supper

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:30.280 align:middle line:84%
painting of both Jesus
and Mary Magdalene

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:35.560 align:middle line:84%
also conforms precisely to the
golden number and golden cut,

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:40.990 align:middle line:90%
1.618 versus 1.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:44.440 align:middle line:10%
Interesting as well that
again these proportions

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.130 align:middle line:10%
are matched in the alpha
omega that I discovered

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:51.010 align:middle line:10%
on the rim of the
sarcophagus, which

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:55.450 align:middle line:10%
is exactly 5.6 inches wide.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:10:01.840 align:middle line:84%
The King's Chamber
is 31.415926 meters.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And the square root of that
number, which is pi times 10,

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:11.610 align:middle line:90%
turns out to be 5.605 inches.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:17.370 align:middle line:84%
5.605 squared
equals the dimension

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:22.630 align:middle line:84%
of the perimeter of the
King's Chamber room itself.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly as well, the serif
or the peak of the letter A

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:35.130 align:middle line:84%
is precisely at the 33rd
inch of the 89.62 inch

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.290 align:middle line:90%
long sarcophagus.

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:40.200 align:middle line:84%
I and my colleagues
note that is exactly

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.750 align:middle line:90%
1 over the Euler number.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.290 align:middle line:90%


00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>>: Euler's number is best
known as the base for natural

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.510 align:middle line:84%
logarithms and is used in
everything from explaining

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:56.840 align:middle line:84%
exponential growth,
radioactive decay,

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.060 align:middle line:84%
and calculating
compound interest.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.890 align:middle line:90%


00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.460 align:middle line:84%
>>: This is a very important
number as fundamental

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.720 align:middle line:90%
as a transcendental pi.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.560 align:middle line:10%
In fact, if we take
both of those numbers

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.230 align:middle line:10%
and we apply them together
in the relationship

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:15.780 align:middle line:10%
of a tetrahedron
nested within a sphere,

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:19.830 align:middle line:10%
we find that when we consider
that a tetrahedron nested

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:24.240 align:middle line:10%
within a sphere would
have a displacement of 1/3

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.540 align:middle line:10%
of the volume of the sphere
inside the tetrahedron

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:30.960 align:middle line:10%
and 2/3 being outside
of the tetrahedron

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.490 align:middle line:10%
nested within that sphere.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And we apply those same
proportions in a weighted

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:43.110 align:middle line:84%
average calculation, what we
find is that pi times 2/3 plus

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Euler number, which
is 2.718, times 1/3,

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:53.280 align:middle line:84%
added together in a weighted
average calculation gives us

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:58.900 align:middle line:90%
integer value 3.000.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Both of these numbers seem to be
boundary conditions for integer

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:04.480 align:middle line:90%
value 3.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.890 align:middle line:84%
But why would we
have the Euler number

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:14.120 align:middle line:84%
pointed to the alpha and omega
on the rim of the sarcophagus?

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.060 align:middle line:90%
Advanced knowledge?

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Additionally, in
the Vitruvian Man,

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo da Vinci
left an area value

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.480 align:middle line:84%
of the square that
didn't match the area

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.530 align:middle line:84%
value of the circle, which
is pi, with a radius of 1.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:36.620 align:middle line:84%
Instead, he left us an encrypted
message for all to see,

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.650 align:middle line:84%
which is that the area, if
we take the time to actually

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:42.950 align:middle line:84%
measure it using the radius
value of one of the circle

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:47.060 align:middle line:84%
turns out to be precisely
the Euler number.

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:51.790 align:middle line:84%
200 years prior to this
purported discovery

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:54.910 align:middle line:84%
of the Euler number
and its attributes.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Arguably the second most
important mathematical

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.880 align:middle line:84%
constant to mathematicians
even of our day today.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.340 align:middle line:90%


00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.530 align:middle line:84%
What was Leonardo
trying to tell us?

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:10.010 align:middle line:84%
What else can we see inside
the Last Supper painting?

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:13.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's look a little bit closer
at the window behind Jesus.

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:17.750 align:middle line:84%
If we look closely at
the pediment above Jesus,

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:22.010 align:middle line:84%
immediately above him and
above the window behind him,

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.560 align:middle line:90%
we'll notice an eye.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Not only is this
orientation showing us

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.990 align:middle line:84%
and pointing to an
eye, but we're also

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:34.220 align:middle line:84%
seeing that this is
an ancient symbol used

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:36.800 align:middle line:84%
in Freemasonry
and Rosicrucianism

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.430 align:middle line:90%
as an all seeing eye.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:45.160 align:middle line:84%
But in Egyptian mythology
and history, we know better.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:51.980 align:middle line:84%
This eye is the eye
of Ra, god of the sun.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:55.220 align:middle line:10%
So, quite fitting, in fact,
that it's above, immediately

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.540 align:middle line:10%
above the son of God.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.760 align:middle line:10%
But in esotericism,
this goes deeper

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:06.650 align:middle line:10%
to explain the separation
between the conscious mind,

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:11.880 align:middle line:10%
which is acting for us like
a sun to the outside world,

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.860 align:middle line:10%
and the subconscious
mind is the missing eye.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:20.180 align:middle line:10%
But it's the eye that's
always there but not shown

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.390 align:middle line:10%
in this outward world.

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:26.260 align:middle line:10%
This eye is referred
to the eye of Horus.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, going back into
Egyptian mythology

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:30.580 align:middle line:90%
and the story of Osiris.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Osiris had quite a conflict
and battle with Seth.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And Seth was able
to defeat Osiris

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:42.120 align:middle line:84%
and, in fact, he cut
him into 14 parts.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And as he cut him into
14 parts, of course,

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:49.590 align:middle line:84%
his son Horus wanted to avenge
the death of his father.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Horus took on a
battle with Seth.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And in that battle,
Horus lost his left eye.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.880 align:middle line:84%
It was plucked out as
the mythology tells us

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.960 align:middle line:90%
in the Egyptian pantheon.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.140 align:middle line:84%
This plucking out of
the left eye of Horus

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.170 align:middle line:84%
could be pointing to
something more significant.

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And in esoteric
circles, it actually

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:17.170 align:middle line:84%
represents the loss of
our intuitive sight.

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:22.210 align:middle line:84%
The loss of the feminine,
which this eye which is often

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:25.210 align:middle line:90%
referenced as the eye of Thoth.

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Because it was restored
eventually by Thoth.

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:31.390 align:middle line:84%
Horus had lost his
left eye, went to Thoth

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:34.460 align:middle line:84%
and asked Thoth to
repair it for him.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And Thoth used magic
to repair the eye.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:41.090 align:middle line:84%
So often this eye is referred
to as the eye of Thoth.

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:44.630 align:middle line:10%
The two eyes of Horus, the
right eye being the eye of Ra

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:48.110 align:middle line:10%
and the left eye being
the eye of Thoth.

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:53.210 align:middle line:10%
Represented by the moon,
intuition, the feminine, that

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:56.760 align:middle line:10%
which might be in a
mathematical sense irrational

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:01.290 align:middle line:10%
and merging it together with the
linear lines of the rational.

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:04.710 align:middle line:84%
The conscious mind taking
over the personification

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:08.980 align:middle line:90%
of our own persona and ego.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And the unconscious
or subconscious mind

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.570 align:middle line:84%
being represented
by this eye that

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:16.240 align:middle line:90%
was missing and plucked out.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.070 align:middle line:90%
So where is this eye of Horus?

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we need to turn to yet
another da Vinci painting

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:24.770 align:middle line:84%
to see where this
might connect us

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:28.340 align:middle line:84%
back to this eye of
Horus that's the left eye

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:32.060 align:middle line:84%
and often referred to
as the eye of Thoth.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>>: The clues to locate the
eye of the Thoth may be found

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:40.790 align:middle line:84%
in another da Vinci masterpiece,
possibly inspired by a famous

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:45.200 align:middle line:84%
woman of royalty who once
lived with Leonardo da Vinci.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.550 align:middle line:84%
The controversial wife of
King Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn.

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.410 align:middle line:90%


00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>>: Anne Boleyn.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Anne Boleyn was known as one
of the most enchanting women

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.180 align:middle line:90%
of the day.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:07.569 align:middle line:10%
From 1516 until 1519, Leonardo
da Vinci lived in the same home

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:09.680 align:middle line:10%
as Anne Boleyn.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.589 align:middle line:10%
What had happened was
King Francis of France

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:16.530 align:middle line:10%
had conquered Milan
and the Sforza family.

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:19.115 align:middle line:84%
And when he went to
Milan, he immediately

00:17:19.115 --> 00:17:20.990 align:middle line:84%
asked to go into the
chapel, and they did not

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:22.970 align:middle line:90%
want it to be destroyed.

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:27.530 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to see this very
famous Fresco by Leonardo da

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:28.790 align:middle line:90%
Vinci.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:32.960 align:middle line:84%
da Vinci was, of course, still
alive, in his aging years.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:36.830 align:middle line:84%
He was asked by King Francis
to move into his palace

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.160 align:middle line:84%
to spend the rest of his
days helping to design

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.740 align:middle line:90%
an ambitious new castle.

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:46.970 align:middle line:84%
So he recruited him to do so,
and Leonardo moved everything

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:50.330 align:middle line:84%
in his life at that
time out of Vinci

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:54.980 align:middle line:84%
to Chateau d'Amboise, which
was the seat at the time

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.212 align:middle line:90%
of the French court.

00:17:57.212 --> 00:18:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Anne Boleyn happened to
eventually enchant King Henry

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:07.630 align:middle line:84%
VIII so much that he left his
first wife in a period of time

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:10.090 align:middle line:84%
that this was expressly
forbidden unless granted

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.640 align:middle line:84%
an annulment from the
Pope of Rome himself,

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:16.690 align:middle line:84%
which the Pope refused to grant
to the King of England, Henry

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:17.680 align:middle line:90%
VIII.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:22.180 align:middle line:10%
So Henry VIII was able
to finally divorce her

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:25.400 align:middle line:10%
by establishing his own new
church the Church of England,

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.820 align:middle line:10%
which is today the
Episcopal Church.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Anne Boleyn later
became the mother

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:35.200 align:middle line:84%
of Elizabeth I.
Elizabeth I, who was

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:39.970 align:middle line:84%
one of the greatest and longest
reigning monarchs of Great

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:42.220 align:middle line:90%
Britain since that time.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Only eclipsed today
by Elizabeth II.

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:49.360 align:middle line:84%
Anne Boleyn was
also famously tried

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.810 align:middle line:84%
for having had an adulterous
affair with another man

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:55.330 align:middle line:84%
while she was
married to the king.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:57.610 align:middle line:84%
The king used that
as the impetus

00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:59.170 align:middle line:90%
to cut off her head famously.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:04.180 align:middle line:90%


00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:07.330 align:middle line:84%
But Anne Boleyn lived
in the same house

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:13.030 align:middle line:84%
in her late teenage years
as Leonardo da Vinci.

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And today, we believe that
there's a painting that

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.790 align:middle line:90%
represents their meeting.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:21.580 align:middle line:10%
And that painting
is referred to today

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:27.100 align:middle line:10%
as La Belle Ferronniere,
the iron maker's daughter.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:28.870 align:middle line:10%
Now, as we look
at this painting,

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:30.760 align:middle line:10%
we'll notice some
prominent things about it.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.600 align:middle line:10%
First of all, it has a
very dark background,

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.370 align:middle line:10%
almost like the night sky.

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And as we look at it, we'll
also notice that her part

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.250 align:middle line:90%
seems to be very significant.

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:47.530 align:middle line:10%
It represents an inverted T
or tau cross, another symbol

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:51.040 align:middle line:10%
of Rosicrucian encryption.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.020 align:middle line:10%
Additionally, we
also notice that she

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:56.290 align:middle line:10%
has what looks to be
some sort of amber gem

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:59.320 align:middle line:10%
right over her forehead,
right between her eyes,

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.600 align:middle line:10%
not far from where
we'd expect to see

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:06.700 align:middle line:10%
like a bindi in an Indian person
who is representing their Ajna

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:09.740 align:middle line:10%
chakra, their third eye.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:13.090 align:middle line:84%
We also notice
that the light that

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:16.600 align:middle line:84%
is caressing the
strands of her hair,

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.360 align:middle line:84%
adjacent to her
part line, actually

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.105 align:middle line:90%
looks very similar to an iris.

00:20:22.105 --> 00:20:24.880 align:middle line:90%


00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:31.060 align:middle line:10%
Can we also see that the hair
and the light bouncing off

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:34.090 align:middle line:10%
of the strands of her hair
adjacent to her part line

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:38.440 align:middle line:10%
are actually forming the lines
of the iris of this eye that

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.687 align:middle line:10%
is surrounding her
head in the darkness?

00:20:42.687 --> 00:20:44.270 align:middle line:84%
Because of the
orientation of the eye,

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:47.370 align:middle line:84%
we notice that of
course it is a left eye.

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And if we place this
painting immediately

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.240 align:middle line:84%
adjacent to the
Last Supper scene,

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.960 align:middle line:84%
is this the missing
eye of Horus that we

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:02.130 align:middle line:84%
find on this female
archetype in Anne Boleyn,

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:04.530 align:middle line:84%
a famous character
in history who

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:07.740 align:middle line:84%
happened to live in the
same home as Leonardo da

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Vinci for three years
prior to his death?

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Is Leonardo pointing
us yet again

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:19.980 align:middle line:84%
to this merger of heart,
brain consciousness?

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.840 align:middle line:84%
We'll also notice
on the back wall,

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.660 align:middle line:84%
there appear to be many
hidden inscriptions.

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:25.980 align:middle line:90%
You could see a lantern.

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.890 align:middle line:90%
You can also see script writing.

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And you can also see what looks
to be the profile of a lion.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:38.070 align:middle line:84%
On the left side, we'll also
notice a letter A prominently

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:43.470 align:middle line:84%
above the tapestries that is on
the left wall as we look at it.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.420 align:middle line:84%
But can we find
other things as well

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:50.160 align:middle line:84%
that are hidden into this
painting that might actually

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:55.050 align:middle line:84%
point us like a map to other
things inside of the King's

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:57.680 align:middle line:90%
Chamber itself?

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's first look to see if
we can find the eye of Ra

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:03.260 align:middle line:84%
on the back wall of
the King's Chamber

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:06.110 align:middle line:84%
behind the sarcophagus
on the Western Wall.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:07.880 align:middle line:84%
In the exact same
location when we

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.150 align:middle line:84%
mirror match the
precise location

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:16.140 align:middle line:84%
of the seam between the
ceiling and the back wall,

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:19.110 align:middle line:84%
crossing over two
stones, and you

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:24.030 align:middle line:84%
can see the line
of the entire eye

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:28.980 align:middle line:84%
and also what looks to be
almost like a yin-yang iris

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:34.470 align:middle line:84%
inside that eye on the same
location of the back wall.

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:36.420 align:middle line:84%
The King's Chamber,
famously devoid

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:40.980 align:middle line:84%
of any markings or writings,
now has yielded up to us

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.140 align:middle line:90%
an alpha omega on the rim.

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:48.750 align:middle line:84%
We also found a compass not far
from the alpha omega pointing

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:51.870 align:middle line:84%
out degree references,
and now we're

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:55.650 align:middle line:84%
seeing that the back wall
of the King's Chamber

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:59.340 align:middle line:84%
is matching up with
what is painted

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.850 align:middle line:84%
more than 500 years ago
into the Fresco in Milan

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:05.880 align:middle line:90%
by Leonardo himself.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.760 align:middle line:84%
What other things can we
find in this painting?

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.870 align:middle line:84%
On the right wall, we
can see the faint letters

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:18.930 align:middle line:84%
of alpha A, written in a script
from the period, Renaissance

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:26.430 align:middle line:84%
period script alpha Q, W.
W is a lowercase omega.

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:27.900 align:middle line:90%
Alpha, chi, omega.

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:32.230 align:middle line:90%


00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:35.560 align:middle line:10%
The Last Supper painting,
just like the Vitruvian Man

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.380 align:middle line:10%
painting, houses
within it hidden

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:43.060 align:middle line:10%
inscriptions that Leonardo da
Vinci more than 500 years ago

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:46.810 align:middle line:10%
left to us to find through time.

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:50.350 align:middle line:10%
Representing this
very ancient symbology

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:53.380 align:middle line:10%
of balancing the
square and the circle,

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.530 align:middle line:10%
finding the balance between
the masculine and the feminine

00:23:56.530 --> 00:24:01.900 align:middle line:10%
and bringing together polarity
into unity consciousness.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Merging the rational mind with
the unconscious creativity

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:12.220 align:middle line:84%
that is resonant within
achievement of the heart,

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:15.520 align:middle line:90%
brain, mind and consciousness.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Could Leonardo da Vinci be
pointing us to a deeper hidden

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:24.180 align:middle line:90%
esoteric wisdom teaching?

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:26.310 align:middle line:84%
Join us for our
next episode where

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:29.220 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go deeper
into this great mystery

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:31.680 align:middle line:84%
to understand what
it means for us.
