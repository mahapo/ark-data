how are they potentially
different from our new reality?

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.850 align:middle line:10%
Is what we've been
experiencing our whole lives

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.320 align:middle line:10%
actually leading and culminating
to some bigger story?

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And how, if it is,
could we ever find that?

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.160 align:middle line:84%
One of the people that I've
looked to my entire life

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.260 align:middle line:90%
is Leonardo da Vinci.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.660 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo da Vinci was
born in 1452 in Italy.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Referred to as the greatest
polymath of all time,

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.990 align:middle line:84%
he was clearly a genius
mind who could span

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.060 align:middle line:90%
multiple different disciplines.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.180 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things he's
most famously noted for

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.300 align:middle line:10%
is that he was an
incredible cryptographer.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.870 align:middle line:10%
Of the 20 or so paintings
that he left as masterpieces,

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.990 align:middle line:10%
most of them are still
studied vigorously today

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.970 align:middle line:10%
for their hidden
inscriptions and have

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.780 align:middle line:10%
been the subject of film and
other mainstream programming

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.040 align:middle line:10%
to basically show us all what
da Vinci was trying to tell us.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Probably his most enigmatic
painting, of course,

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.740 align:middle line:84%
is the "Mona Lisa" But
the one that stands out

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.790 align:middle line:84%
as most recognizable
to all humans today

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.220 align:middle line:90%
is the "Vitruvian Man."

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And in it, Leonardo
tried to answer

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.460 align:middle line:84%
this question of squaring
the circle because this age

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.710 align:middle line:84%
old mystery of
squaring the circle

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.580 align:middle line:84%
somehow represented even as
far back as the ancient Greeks

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.430 align:middle line:90%
some merger of consciousness.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.180 align:middle line:84%
The feminine, represented by
the circle, and the masculine,

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.085 align:middle line:90%
represented by the square.

00:02:59.085 --> 00:03:01.750 align:middle line:90%


00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.940 align:middle line:10%
>> The concept of squaring
the circle basically involves

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.530 align:middle line:10%
constructing a square with an
equal surface area to a circle

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.640 align:middle line:10%
or vice versa using nothing
more than a compass and straight

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.470 align:middle line:10%
edge.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo da Vinci's drawing of a
male figure perfectly inscribed

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.360 align:middle line:84%
in a circle and square,
the "Vitruvian Man,"

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.550 align:middle line:84%
illustrates what
he believed to be

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.070 align:middle line:84%
a divine connection between the
human form and the universe.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>> It was believed by ancient
Greeks for thousands of years

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.250 align:middle line:84%
that if we could successfully,
without measurement,

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.700 align:middle line:84%
square a circle, then we would
be able to achieve a balanced

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.870 align:middle line:84%
consciousness in a super
conscious way that somehow,

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.570 align:middle line:84%
the very act of drawing
the geometry out to square

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.670 align:middle line:84%
the circle would lead to
irrevocable changes within

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.600 align:middle line:90%
the human psyche.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.270 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo left for
us an end sign.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.050 align:middle line:84%
He left for us an archetype
of squaring of the circle.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.660 align:middle line:84%
But if we look at it, we'll
notice that he didn't actually

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.830 align:middle line:90%
square the circle.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.100 align:middle line:84%
In fact, his square
wasn't a perfect square.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.230 align:middle line:84%
I started sketching
in my notebook

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.510 align:middle line:84%
the "Vitruvian Man"
because I wanted to get

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.328 align:middle line:90%
into the mind of Leonardo.

00:04:16.328 --> 00:04:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
I first noticed

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.899 align:middle line:84%
was that I thought
I need to measure

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:24.480 align:middle line:84%
the angle between the navel
in the upper left corners

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.280 align:middle line:90%
of the square.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Because what Leonardo
had done is he

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.850 align:middle line:84%
placed the square in a
very unique position where

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.330 align:middle line:84%
the base of the circle
was tangent to the base

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.440 align:middle line:90%
of the square.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you measure
it, the square

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.270 align:middle line:84%
doesn't actually measure
the same area value.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.130 align:middle line:90%
It's far too small.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.780 align:middle line:10%
Da Vinci worked
on this according

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.300 align:middle line:10%
to Walter Isaacson, a
noted biographer who wrote

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.750 align:middle line:10%
a complete story of his life.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.650 align:middle line:10%
>> According to Walter
Isaacson, Leonardo da Vinci was

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.010 align:middle line:10%
the co-author of a book
on geometry called "Divina

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.850 align:middle line:10%
Proportione" or
"Divine Proportion"

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.910 align:middle line:10%
in which they broke down
the golden ratio and its

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.320 align:middle line:10%
application to geometry through
the visual arts of perspective

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.790 align:middle line:10%
and architecture, something
da Vinci was a master at.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So clearly, he
understood proportion.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the square turns
out to be a different value

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.810 align:middle line:90%
than the circle in area.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.900 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that Leonardo
always did, and he did it also

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.960 align:middle line:84%
in the "Vitruvian Man,"
is he always wrote

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.180 align:middle line:90%
in backwards mirrored text.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.070 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when he doesn't write
the backward mirrored text,

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.120 align:middle line:84%
we can assume that he
did that for a reason.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Though the exact
reasoning behind Leonardo da

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Vinci's backwards writing
may never be known,

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.400 align:middle line:84%
several researchers believe it
was a way for him to hide his

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.140 align:middle line:84%
ideas from prying eyes of the
Roman Catholic Church whose

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.580 align:middle line:84%
teachings stood in opposition to
many of da Vinci's observations

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.020 align:middle line:90%
and ideas.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.860 align:middle line:84%
It would only make sense for him
to encrypt his writings so as

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.860 align:middle line:84%
to protect himself from
any possible persecution.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.760 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>> What da Vinci was doing
was showing us his cipher key

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.190 align:middle line:90%
to his inscriptions.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.370 align:middle line:10%
Because when da Vinci writes
in the normal way forward,

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.940 align:middle line:10%
left to right without
mirroring the text,

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.950 align:middle line:10%
he's actually telling
us and giving us

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:35.590 align:middle line:10%
a hint that herein lies one
of his famous inscriptions.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And as we look at
the "Vitruvian Man,"

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.100 align:middle line:84%
our deeper analysis
shows us that he has

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.220 align:middle line:90%
hidden a lot more encryption.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:50.170 align:middle line:10%
>> The iconic "Vitruvian Man,"
drawn circa 1490 by the great

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:54.790 align:middle line:10%
Leonardo da Vinci, is probably
the most famous image of all

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:55.930 align:middle line:10%
time.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.810 align:middle line:10%
And yet, for over
five centuries,

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:03.040 align:middle line:10%
no one has noticed he encoded
within it astounding knowledge

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.980 align:middle line:10%
of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.990 align:middle line:10%
I recently observed
that the angle

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.020 align:middle line:10%
from the navel to the
top corner of the square

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.940 align:middle line:10%
exactly matches the side
slope angle of the pyramid.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.330 align:middle line:10%
I asked cryptologist
Alan Green to investigate

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.620 align:middle line:10%
da Vinci's masterpiece with
the same mathematical rigor.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.920 align:middle line:10%
What we found challenges
our entire concept

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:32.120 align:middle line:10%
of what this enigmatic work
of art is really about.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.540 align:middle line:10%
It's widely known
that the Great Pyramid

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.950 align:middle line:10%
embodies the ratio of the
radiuses of the Earth and moon.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:42.580 align:middle line:10%
But Green realized that by
inscribing a circle within da

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.230 align:middle line:10%
Vinci's square and raising that
circle so its center coincides

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.540 align:middle line:10%
with the center of
the "Vitruvian Man"

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:54.370 align:middle line:10%
circle at the navel, six
perfect pyramid cross-sections

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:58.540 align:middle line:10%
are revealed, along with
an exact geometrical match

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:03.520 align:middle line:10%
of the Earth-moon-pyramid
relationship.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.210 align:middle line:10%
Da Vinci states explicitly in
the backwards mirrored texts

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:11.350 align:middle line:10%
surrounding his image that its
proportions are exact integer

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.840 align:middle line:10%
ratios of the whole man.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.560 align:middle line:10%
And he has cut his
man in 14 places,

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.040 align:middle line:10%
clearly identifying
these proportions.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:26.440 align:middle line:10%
In addition, he says, decrease
the height of man by 1/14.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.610 align:middle line:10%
A second veiled reference to
the Horus Eye myth in which set

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.714 align:middle line:10%
cuts Osiris's body
into 14 parts.

00:08:33.714 --> 00:08:37.640 align:middle line:90%


00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.870 align:middle line:84%
So Leonardo seems to have
encrypted the Great Pyramid

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:48.340 align:middle line:84%
of Giza into the proportions of
the square versus the circle.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.130 align:middle line:84%
He had to deliberately
make that square too

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.260 align:middle line:90%
small to match the area.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.850 align:middle line:84%
But actually, what
it's doing is it's

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:58.550 align:middle line:84%
encrypting for us
the slope angle

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.860 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>> According to
the Rhind Papyrus,

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.350 align:middle line:84%
the seked of the Great
Pyramid, which is the unit

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.200 align:middle line:84%
of measurement used by
the pyramid builders,

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.200 align:middle line:84%
was five palms and
two fingers per cubit.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.380 align:middle line:10%
This unit of measurement
allowed for the slope

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.550 align:middle line:10%
of the face of the
pyramid to be 14/11,

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.970 align:middle line:10%
which is the mathematical
relationship of phi.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough, the
inverse slope of its edges

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:32.280 align:middle line:84%
is 9/10, which gives us
the relationship of pi.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.890 align:middle line:84%
When used in
conjunction, these two

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.970 align:middle line:84%
advanced mathematical
formulas provide a stability

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:42.270 align:middle line:84%
to the Great Pyramid that
isn't found in the other bent

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:43.290 align:middle line:90%
pyramids of the region.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.400 align:middle line:90%


00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And for those of you
that study and have studied

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.160 align:middle line:84%
the Great Pyramid,
Egyptologists alike,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.980 align:middle line:84%
you'll notice that the
most important number that

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.580 align:middle line:84%
determines the volume of the
Great Pyramid on the entire

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:04.190 align:middle line:90%
Giza plateau is 51.843 degrees.

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And here, da Vinci encrypted
it right into the upper corner

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.480 align:middle line:84%
with both hands
pointing exactly to it,

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.070 align:middle line:84%
as if begging us to
look further here.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>> It became clear that da
Vinci had intimately profound

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.980 align:middle line:90%
knowledge about the pyramid.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.085 align:middle line:84%
But is there any proof that
da Vinci ever visited Egypt?

00:10:26.085 --> 00:10:29.010 align:middle line:90%


00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it happens that he
wrote a letter that showed up

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.630 align:middle line:84%
in "The Codex Atlanticus" which
is a compendium of many of his

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:37.920 align:middle line:90%
sketches.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.410 align:middle line:84%
What we do also notice is
that this forward written

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.710 align:middle line:84%
letter that he left in
The Codex Atlanticus which

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:47.580 align:middle line:84%
is titled "To the
Devatdar of the Lieutenant

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:51.120 align:middle line:84%
of the Sultan of
Cairo, Babylon."

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.130 align:middle line:10%
And in this letter,
he points out

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:57.270 align:middle line:10%
that he was working under
an engagement for Sultan

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:01.890 align:middle line:10%
Qaitbay, a famous Mamluk
sultan to this day, that

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.400 align:middle line:10%
is known as being a
great philosopher king

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.000 align:middle line:10%
and being the creator of
many archaeological monuments

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.590 align:middle line:10%
and buildings that still
stand to this day in Cairo.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Da Vinci references
in his letter

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.790 align:middle line:90%
that he arrived in Cairo.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, from 1482 until
1486, even Walter Isaacson

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:27.320 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know what happened
to the historical record

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.340 align:middle line:90%
of Leonardo da Vinci.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Some refer to this time
period as the lost years

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:32.750 align:middle line:90%
of Leonardo's life.

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.320 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Leonardo da Vinci was
considered one of the most

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.930 align:middle line:90%
famous people of his time.

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Most of his life was chronicled
except for a few lost years.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that "The
Codex Atlanticus" points us

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:54.140 align:middle line:84%
to what he was doing during that
undocumented period of time?

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And if so, what else might it
reveal about what Leonardo da

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:01.390 align:middle line:90%
Vinci saw while in Egypt?

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>> But in this letter, da Vinci
not only references arriving

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.110 align:middle line:90%
into Cairo.

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:09.100 align:middle line:84%
He also references the
great Mount Taurus--

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.820 align:middle line:84%
chronically, his
experience and review

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.942 align:middle line:84%
of that mountain
in abject detail.

00:12:15.942 --> 00:12:17.650 align:middle line:84%
This might actually
be one of the reasons

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:21.550 align:middle line:84%
why art historians tend to
believe that this is simply

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.640 align:middle line:84%
a fictional account
because his description is

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:30.440 align:middle line:84%
so colorful that they believe
that it must not be real.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.510 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he goes into
such abject detail

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:37.010 align:middle line:84%
about the mountain, as well
as his experience going inside

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:40.940 align:middle line:84%
of one of the chambers
of that mountain

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:44.480 align:middle line:84%
that he ends up having
the reader believe

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.660 align:middle line:84%
with the lack of knowledge
that he's referencing something

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.620 align:middle line:90%
altogether different.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:53.550 align:middle line:84%
But Bull Mountain and his
reference to Mount Taurus

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:58.440 align:middle line:84%
is well known to
Egyptologists because that is

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.140 align:middle line:90%
the name of the Great Pyramid--

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Bull Mountain, signified
by two chevrons and a bull

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.930 align:middle line:90%
which represents the Apis bull.

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:10.170 align:middle line:90%


00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Originally called Bull
Mountain or Mount Taurus,

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:19.050 align:middle line:84%
the Great Pyramid at Giza was
associated with Apis, or Hep,

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:22.330 align:middle line:84%
which was the chief
bull deity of Egypt.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:27.090 align:middle line:84%
He was later renamed the
Apis bull by the Greeks.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:30.780 align:middle line:10%
In the chronicles about Mount
Taurus, or the Great Pyramid,

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:35.490 align:middle line:10%
Leonardo da Vinci wrote, "The
peaks of the great Mount Taurus

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:36.990 align:middle line:10%
to the West.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.080 align:middle line:84%
These peaks are of
such a height that they

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.030 align:middle line:90%
seem to touch the sky.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And in all of the world,
there's no part of the Earth

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:47.160 align:middle line:90%
higher than its summit.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.000 align:middle line:10%
And the rays of the sun
always fall upon its East side

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.370 align:middle line:10%
four hours before daytime.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And being of the
whitest stone, it

00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:01.590 align:middle line:84%
shines resplendently to
fulfill the function of these."

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:05.220 align:middle line:84%
Though Leonardo da Vinci's
colorfully detailed accounts

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:09.330 align:middle line:84%
of his time in Cairo have been
perceived as a work of fiction

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:13.380 align:middle line:84%
by some historians, it is
clear his understanding

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.140 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid
appears more factual

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.020 align:middle line:84%
once the esoteric meanings
behind his accounts

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:20.550 align:middle line:90%
are revealed.

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:24.780 align:middle line:84%
But what else might we
glean from his writings?

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>> The original name of the
Giza Plateau was not Giza.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:36.750 align:middle line:84%
The original name was
Rostau, The Rose Cross.

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:40.350 align:middle line:84%
In Greek, the word
"Taurus" also means bull.

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:45.810 align:middle line:84%
It would be spelled if we wrote
it out in English, T-A-U-R-O-S.

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:51.210 align:middle line:84%
But if we read it backwards,
it would be read as Rostau.

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Da Vinci had encrypted in this
letter esoteric understanding

00:14:56.430 --> 00:15:01.080 align:middle line:84%
and wisdom that only one who
had understood the connection

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.740 align:middle line:84%
to the alpha, which is
the reference to the bull,

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:09.720 align:middle line:84%
the letter A, could potentially
mean and make the connection

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.180 align:middle line:90%
back to the Great Pyramid.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:16.170 align:middle line:84%
That, along with the
51.843 degree reference,

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:20.130 align:middle line:84%
points irrevocably
to something more

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:22.800 align:middle line:84%
during his time
of his lost years,

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.560 align:middle line:90%
spending that time in Egypt.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Da Vinci is here referencing
in his encrypted form

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:33.180 align:middle line:84%
of this letter his
visitation and review,

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:39.190 align:middle line:84%
his personal observation of the
pyramids of the Rostau Plateau.

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:43.240 align:middle line:84%
In addition, we also
have to look more closely

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.640 align:middle line:90%
at Rosicrucianism.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:49.480 align:middle line:10%
Rostau means rose cross--

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.590 align:middle line:10%
the tau cross, also in
reference to the cross

00:15:53.590 --> 00:16:00.390 align:middle line:10%
that Jesus was nailed to,
shaped like the letter T.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:03.780 align:middle line:84%
So the Great Pyramid has
another perspective on it.

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:10.380 align:middle line:10%
And that is that each base side
is between 755 and 756 feet,

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.840 align:middle line:10%
with slight variation
at each one.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.620 align:middle line:10%


00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.130 align:middle line:10%
But what we see is that,
very interestingly,

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.500 align:middle line:10%
another reference to
squaring of the circle

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.410 align:middle line:10%
is embedded within the
proportional dimensions

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:28.220 align:middle line:10%
of the Great Pyramid if we use
the height of the Great Pyramid

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:34.020 align:middle line:10%
as a reference point to advise
us of the radius of a circle.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:35.930 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at
this reference point

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:42.140 align:middle line:84%
and say that the
radius of the circle

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:45.950 align:middle line:84%
would inform the height of
the Great Pyramid of 481 feet

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:50.780 align:middle line:84%
or 280 cubits and
the side of its base

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:56.720 align:middle line:84%
would be 440 cubits or 756
feet, then what we find

00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:00.170 align:middle line:84%
is that it informs exactly
the proper squaring

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:02.750 align:middle line:84%
of the circle
where the perimeter

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:08.408 align:middle line:84%
value will match the
circular circumference value.

00:17:08.408 --> 00:17:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are two ways
anciently to square the circle.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:15.170 align:middle line:84%
One is to square it, matching
the area for the square

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:17.290 align:middle line:90%
and the area of the circle.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:20.599 align:middle line:84%
This is the more prominent of
the two methods of measurement.

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:24.550 align:middle line:84%
But what the Great Pyramid
does is it goes and points us

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:26.140 align:middle line:84%
toward the second
measurement, which

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.870 align:middle line:84%
is the perimeter of
the square equaling

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.510 align:middle line:84%
the circumference of
the circle, speaking

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:35.200 align:middle line:84%
yet again to some
relationship of this balance

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.860 align:middle line:84%
that the builders felt was
necessary to communicate back

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.830 align:middle line:84%
to us in our day
thousands of years

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:48.850 align:middle line:84%
later in a living manifest of
stone somehow to the importance

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:50.980 align:middle line:90%
of this understanding.

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:55.300 align:middle line:10%
What we also see is
that the Great Pyramid--

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.970 align:middle line:10%
when we understand
that it's embedded

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:01.850 align:middle line:10%
within the "Vitruvian
Man," we start

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:05.990 align:middle line:10%
to find other inscriptions
deeply embedded

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.980 align:middle line:10%
within this image.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:10.050 align:middle line:90%


00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:12.600 align:middle line:90%
Now, the magic.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.080 align:middle line:10%
Da Vinci's lines reveal
a perfect blueprint

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.740 align:middle line:10%
of the internal structure
of the pyramid's chambers.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.440 align:middle line:10%
Only the Queen's chamber
seems to be missing.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.060 align:middle line:10%
But is it?

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.540 align:middle line:10%
Queen Isis mourning the
cutting of her husband's body

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:33.750 align:middle line:10%
into 14 parts represents the
14 phases of the waning moon.

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:38.310 align:middle line:10%
Her reconstituting Osiris's
body represents the 14 phases

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:40.170 align:middle line:10%
of the waxing moon.

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:42.480 align:middle line:10%
Da Vinci has
precisely identified

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:47.670 align:middle line:10%
the presently known subterranean
Queen's and King's chambers,

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:51.690 align:middle line:10%
the ground level of the pyramid,
its defining side angle,

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:55.860 align:middle line:10%
and its mathematical
relationship to Earth and moon

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.730 align:middle line:10%
centuries before these
were supposedly known,

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:04.650 align:middle line:10%
which begs the question, do his
upper lines represent presently

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:06.960 align:middle line:10%
unknown chambers?

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.380 align:middle line:10%
Da Vinci seems to be telling
us the Great Pyramid hides

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:15.600 align:middle line:10%
a deeper esoteric symbolism
that has ever been suspected--

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.930 align:middle line:10%
a blueprint of man's
unfolding spiritual journey

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:22.590 align:middle line:10%
through the sacred energy
centers of the spine known

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:25.220 align:middle line:10%
as the chakras.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:28.670 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps finding these
inner chambers in ourselves

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:32.150 align:middle line:10%
is our ultimate purpose,
and the Great Pyramid

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:35.480 align:middle line:10%
but a metaphor for the
true measure of mankind.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.410 align:middle line:90%


00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:43.840 align:middle line:10%
So Leonardo da Vinci
left us a blueprint

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:50.170 align:middle line:10%
of the Great Pyramid embedded
within this iconic image

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:54.130 align:middle line:10%
of the "Vitruvian Man"
where each line that

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:58.285 align:middle line:10%
is both horizontal and
vertical we have now only

00:19:58.285 --> 00:20:01.880 align:middle line:10%
to the conclusion
to draw are actually

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:09.350 align:middle line:10%
encrypted important locations
of the Great Pyramid itself.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:13.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Is it possible that these
lines within Leonardo da

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:17.390 align:middle line:10%
Vinci's "Vitruvian Man" point
not only to the chambers within

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:20.720 align:middle line:10%
the Great Pyramid but to other
chambers that we have yet

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.090 align:middle line:10%
to discover?

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:27.770 align:middle line:10%
In 2017, while Robert
Grant was in Egypt visiting

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:30.590 align:middle line:10%
the Great Pyramid, a
Japanese delegation

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:33.680 align:middle line:10%
was there, called the
Scan Pyramid Project,

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:37.430 align:middle line:10%
using ground-penetrating
radar and muon transfer

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:40.670 align:middle line:10%
technology to locate
undiscovered voids

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:44.120 align:middle line:10%
within the great structure.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>> The Japanese delegation
had located a void space above

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:51.470 align:middle line:84%
the Grand Gallery that appears
to lead exactly to the throat

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:55.130 align:middle line:84%
chakra line on the
"Vitruvian Man,"

00:20:55.130 --> 00:21:00.560 align:middle line:84%
indicating that where da Vinci
has left us another horizontal

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.740 align:middle line:84%
line on the
Vitruvian man's body,

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:07.160 align:middle line:84%
might be leading us exactly to
the precise location of another

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.720 align:middle line:90%
chamber heretofore undiscovered.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.870 align:middle line:84%
Additionally, there are
other lines at the forehead,

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:18.740 align:middle line:84%
at the pineal gland,
and at the crown chakra.

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And further, there are lines
very deep on both knees,

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.630 align:middle line:84%
potentially pointing
us to other chambers

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:30.070 align:middle line:84%
that we just don't
know about yet.

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:34.090 align:middle line:84%
What is it that Leonardo is
trying to point us towards?

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:37.000 align:middle line:10%
He further gave us
another inscription

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.350 align:middle line:10%
in his backward mirrored text
where he references 1/14,

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:47.030 align:middle line:10%
which, of course, is relational
to the Osiris mythology

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:51.530 align:middle line:10%
where Seth cuts his
body into 14 parts

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:53.990 align:middle line:10%
and does the same
by separating out

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:58.610 align:middle line:10%
the body of the Vitruvian
man in 14 different places.

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:03.230 align:middle line:84%
But very interestingly and
something we cannot miss is

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:08.120 align:middle line:84%
that Leonardo is potentially
pointing us to something that

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:12.020 align:middle line:84%
relates directly to the
perfect squaring of the circle.

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Because if we are
to place a 1/14

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:20.210 align:middle line:84%
separation of the Vitruvian Man
down at the base of the circle

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:22.970 align:middle line:84%
and center the square
over that circle,

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:25.850 align:middle line:84%
it will give us
exactly the location

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:28.010 align:middle line:90%
of placement of a square.

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Proportionally, that would
give us precisely the same area

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:35.780 align:middle line:84%
value as the circle, thus
fulfilling the ancient mystery

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:39.740 align:middle line:84%
that is believed to be
impossible since 1882:

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:45.960 align:middle line:84%
to square the circle without
any measurements whatsoever,

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.585 align:middle line:84%
using only a compass
and a straight edge.

00:22:48.585 --> 00:22:52.030 align:middle line:90%


00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.670 align:middle line:84%
I can't help but
ask the question,

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:56.370 align:middle line:84%
maybe that the Great
Pyramid is really

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:59.940 align:middle line:84%
a reflection of our own
conscious progression.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.180 align:middle line:84%
That as we ascend
to understand more

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:07.170 align:middle line:84%
about our own selves and
our own consciousness

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:10.530 align:middle line:84%
is expanding through each
of our chakra centers,

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:12.630 align:middle line:84%
that maybe, we'll
understand more

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:15.120 align:middle line:84%
of the mysteries
of this reflection

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.265 align:middle line:90%
that we call the Great Pyramid.

00:23:17.265 --> 00:23:21.700 align:middle line:90%


00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Join me in this
journey through time

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:27.250 align:middle line:84%
and this journey
around the globe

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:31.690 align:middle line:84%
as we crack this mystery left
to us not only by Leonardo,

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:34.600 align:middle line:84%
but other Renaissance
and ancient polymaths

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.420 align:middle line:84%
and philosophers who have
been endlessly pointing us

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:41.500 align:middle line:84%
to the same conclusions
that the world is now

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.240 align:middle line:90%
on the brink of change.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:47.890 align:middle line:84%
As we enter a new age
and Aquarian Renaissance

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:50.230 align:middle line:84%
that we'll be
discovering and working

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:53.830 align:middle line:84%
on together throughout
the course of this series,

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:57.340 align:middle line:84%
it may have an indelible
impact on how you

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.650 align:middle line:90%
perceive your world around you.

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:02.110 align:middle line:84%
It might actually
impact you to see

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:07.120 align:middle line:84%
the world in different terms
and recognize that what we judge

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.390 align:middle line:84%
is what we attract
until we no longer judge

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:13.840 align:middle line:90%
those things that we attract.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining me on
this episode of The Code-X.
