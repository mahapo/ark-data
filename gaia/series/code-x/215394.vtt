00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever asked
yourself the question

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.500 align:middle line:84%
that what you
consider to be reality

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.850 align:middle line:84%
might actually be a
simulation of mind?

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Have you further considered
that simulation of mind

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.140 align:middle line:84%
might have a purpose, a
veritable game for you

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.850 align:middle line:84%
to learn to expand awareness
and consciousness in new ways

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.940 align:middle line:84%
and to question the
very foundation of what

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.760 align:middle line:90%
it means to be human?

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.980 align:middle line:84%
This season on
Code X, we're going

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.600 align:middle line:84%
to go through the world that was
left to us encrypted by Metatron

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.060 align:middle line:90%
and his many incarnations.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.960 align:middle line:84%
We are going to
investigate how Metatron,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.910 align:middle line:84%
that great architect of
this universal simulation,

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.330 align:middle line:90%
is now being revealed to us.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.520 align:middle line:10%
Metatron has left us a cipher.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.270 align:middle line:84%
We are going to investigate
all of the works of Leonardo da

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.120 align:middle line:90%
Vinci.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.780 align:middle line:84%
We'll see how all
of these paintings

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.680 align:middle line:84%
actually overlay and
interweave into one another

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.240 align:middle line:84%
as a mosaic of a larger,
grander encryption.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.770 align:middle line:10%
You're going to learn some of
the great mysteries about Giza

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.540 align:middle line:10%
Plateau and the musical
awareness behind it,

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.460 align:middle line:10%
as well as its impact on time
and the great calendar that

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.360 align:middle line:10%
is embedded within the
King's Chamber itself.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.420 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to the King's Chamber
of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Join me on this quest
to find and remember

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.500 align:middle line:84%
who we are at this
precipice of entering

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.183 align:middle line:84%
into a new age, the
Age of Aquarius.

00:02:05.183 --> 00:02:07.690 align:middle line:90%


00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Some believe perception
defines our reality.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.460 align:middle line:84%
But is there a deeper
story about perception?

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Is it true that
we don't actually

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.530 align:middle line:84%
perceive the world as it is,
we perceive it as we are?

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.560 align:middle line:84%
If you go to a courtroom and
see a standard misdemeanor case,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.120 align:middle line:84%
very often you'll hear a story
from an eyewitness account.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.390 align:middle line:84%
When there are more
than one eyewitness,

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.430 align:middle line:84%
very often you'll
note that there

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.150 align:middle line:84%
are multiple different
stories of what occurred.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in one
case recently, there

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.540 align:middle line:84%
were over 30 eyewitnesses
and 30 entirely

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.960 align:middle line:84%
different eyewitness
accounts of what transpired

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.690 align:middle line:90%
with a simple theft of a purse.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.900 align:middle line:84%
How is it that one person
can perceive one thing

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.530 align:middle line:84%
and be at the exact
same scene of the crime

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.310 align:middle line:84%
as another person who sees
something entirely differently?

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer is
actually quite simple.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.220 align:middle line:84%
It is because we cannot separate
our own conditioning biases from

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.235 align:middle line:90%
our perception of reality.

00:03:19.235 --> 00:03:21.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that the
world is a difficult place

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.790 align:middle line:84%
because people don't
like each other.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.190 align:middle line:84%
I believe the world can
be a very difficult place

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.100 align:middle line:84%
because people don't
like themselves.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.310 align:middle line:84%
The cognitive biases that
we have about ourselves

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.790 align:middle line:84%
inform our reality because
the universe around us

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.180 align:middle line:84%
can be said to be a reflection
or a projection of what's

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.230 align:middle line:84%
inside of each one of us,
a veritable you-inverse

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.700 align:middle line:90%
of experience.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.380 align:middle line:84%
The more you give to
that world around you,

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.670 align:middle line:84%
the more the world will
likewise give back.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.460 align:middle line:84%
It's as if it's a mirror of
consciousness, a karmic mirror,

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.400 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.320 align:middle line:10%
A mirror where I'm
giving a gift to someone,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.170 align:middle line:10%
and in the karmic
mirror the gift

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.220 align:middle line:10%
is given back to
me in like fashion.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.010 align:middle line:84%
This karmic mirror
has the ability

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.520 align:middle line:84%
to play with us, to make
sure that, in this illusion,

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.210 align:middle line:84%
we get the maximum
benefit from the learning.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And what would an
experience be if we

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.860 align:middle line:90%
didn't believe it was real?

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:28.460 align:middle line:84%
This is why we come to
this zone of perception

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.450 align:middle line:84%
to learn that what we accumulate
and believe to be facts

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:38.280 align:middle line:84%
might actually simply be facets
of a larger prism of a deeper,

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.100 align:middle line:90%
more significant truth.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.510 align:middle line:84%
That the only way to
capture higher wisdom

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.850 align:middle line:84%
is to accumulate all possible
subjective perspectives

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.520 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.130 align:middle line:84%
In this episode,
we're going to learn

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.570 align:middle line:84%
how perception is
our reality, how

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:04.400 align:middle line:84%
to deal with that, to become
aware that it is informing

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.900 align:middle line:84%
our decisions and
our emotional states,

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.540 align:middle line:84%
and how to take that knowledge
and transform our living

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.760 align:middle line:90%
and life experience.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.370 align:middle line:10%
One of the people
that was so focused

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.230 align:middle line:10%
on this art of dynamically
playing with perception

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.190 align:middle line:10%
was Leonardo da Vinci, the
polymath from the Renaissance,

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.610 align:middle line:10%
who used perspective
artwork in order

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.440 align:middle line:10%
to trick the eye into believing
that two dimensional objects

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.100 align:middle line:10%
on a flat plane could be
perceived in a third, fourth,

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.920 align:middle line:10%
or higher dimension.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Every time there's been a
Renaissance in human history,

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.220 align:middle line:84%
it has always been
accompanied with a new way

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.750 align:middle line:84%
of thought, a new way to
perceive the world around us.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.700 align:middle line:84%
The Renaissance scholars and
polymaths became very adept

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.350 align:middle line:84%
because in 1451, thousands
of hermetic texts

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.500 align:middle line:84%
were released from the Vatican
libraries to the general public

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.250 align:middle line:84%
and became the foundational
basis for Rosicrucian movement,

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.230 align:middle line:84%
of which Leonardo
da Vinci eventually

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.110 align:middle line:90%
became a leader within.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.830 align:middle line:90%
But not only Leonardo.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.520 align:middle line:10%
Albrecht Dürer and several
other polymaths and scholars.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.300 align:middle line:10%
Michelangelo, those
people that seemed somehow

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.570 align:middle line:10%
to push the boundary
on human experience,

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.630 align:middle line:10%
to go beyond the
limitations that we all

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.440 align:middle line:10%
tend to perceive of ourselves.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they
understood the notion

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.090 align:middle line:84%
that the only real obstacles
that we experience in this world

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.120 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that we
persistently allow ourselves

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.610 align:middle line:90%
to attach to and believe in.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.610 align:middle line:84%
The two words that are the
most difficult words for us

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.690 align:middle line:84%
all to integrate and
fully understand--

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.740 align:middle line:90%
to know thyself.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.130 align:middle line:84%
In this world of perception
and perspective drawing,

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:01.690 align:middle line:84%
one can easily see how an
illusion, a trick of the eye,

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.780 align:middle line:84%
can inform different outcomes,
different perceptions.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And maybe the way to
change our perception

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.470 align:middle line:84%
is as simple as
seeing it differently.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, as Gandhi
puts it to us, we

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.250 align:middle line:84%
can all be the change we
want to see in the world.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:28.420 align:middle line:84%
The old axiom may not apply
anymore in this context

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.850 align:middle line:90%
that seeing is believing.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.990 align:middle line:90%
Maybe believing is seeing.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And Leonardo da
Vinci is someone who

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:43.690 align:middle line:84%
was able to trick our mind's eye
so easily using the technique

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:48.460 align:middle line:84%
that we call linear perspective
drawing in illustration.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:54.310 align:middle line:84%
He used it so adeptly that
during the Renaissance period,

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.520 align:middle line:84%
he and other
polymaths and scholars

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:01.360 align:middle line:84%
were able to use perspective
drawing to expand consciousness,

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:06.810 align:middle line:84%
to see things that a simple,
flat piece of paper or canvas

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.420 align:middle line:84%
should not have
been able to depict.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And yet we see it in
a higher dimension.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:16.170 align:middle line:84%
One of the most important
aspects of our perception

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:19.680 align:middle line:84%
is what we call the
vanishing point.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.170 align:middle line:84%
The vanishing point
is when you're

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:25.350 align:middle line:84%
making a perspective
drawing, you pick a point off

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.420 align:middle line:90%
in the horizon.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:31.680 align:middle line:84%
We don't necessarily see that
point as a tangible object,

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.380 align:middle line:84%
but it is the central focus
of our vision and our distance

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.770 align:middle line:90%
vision and sight.

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:41.340 align:middle line:84%
From that, all
angles of perception

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:45.725 align:middle line:84%
basically cascade back to the
viewer, to the lens of the eye.

00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:48.410 align:middle line:90%


00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo da Vinci was
possibly the first person

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.950 align:middle line:84%
to have actually
invented what we know

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:57.890 align:middle line:90%
of today as virtual reality.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:59.960 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo was an
expert in optics,

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.770 align:middle line:84%
and he was an expert in
perspective illustrations.

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:07.100 align:middle line:84%
In fact, every time
humanity has gone

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.090 align:middle line:84%
through an upshift
in consciousness,

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:14.330 align:middle line:84%
it has always been accompanied
by perspective illustration.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:18.860 align:middle line:10%
It helps humanity to expand
to a higher level of awareness

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.820 align:middle line:10%
by expanding its perception.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:26.390 align:middle line:10%
Its perception is
derivable directly

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:30.230 align:middle line:10%
from what it believes it's
seeing in front of it.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Each of us do this
every day, and we're

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.730 align:middle line:84%
not even conscious of
the fact that we do this.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:36.750 align:middle line:84%
But when we look off
into the distance,

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:40.640 align:middle line:84%
we are creating a vanishing
point that our lens of our eye

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.100 align:middle line:90%
is focused on.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, as we look at
that perception,

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.770 align:middle line:84%
you could say that
it creates for us

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:53.900 align:middle line:84%
a pyramidal shape in our
vision and that pyramidal shape

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:58.340 align:middle line:84%
with its point or apex being
off in the distance in what we

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.290 align:middle line:90%
call this vanishing point.

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.350 align:middle line:84%
Now at the lens of the eye,
the lens takes in this data

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.210 align:middle line:84%
and information, just as
we see in this depiction--

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:10.040 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful illustration
by Leonardo da Vinci himself--

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.440 align:middle line:84%
and takes that image
and projects it

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:17.690 align:middle line:84%
into the back of our retina,
forming another inverted pyramid

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.390 align:middle line:84%
that finds its point at
the retinal receptors

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:23.570 align:middle line:84%
around the macula and fovea
in the back of the eye

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:25.550 align:middle line:90%
that we can focus on.

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:28.940 align:middle line:84%
So you literally now have
an octahedral structure.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Its slope angle is adjusting
based on its distance

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.250 align:middle line:84%
and also based on the focal
point in the back of your eye.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.460 align:middle line:84%
These are the
foundational principles

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:42.830 align:middle line:84%
of optics and engineering
related to those optics.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Another example of Leonardo's
use of perspective technique is

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:51.170 align:middle line:84%
found in The
Adoration of the Magi,

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:55.930 align:middle line:84%
a painting that was commissioned
by a chapel in the early 1480s

00:10:55.930 --> 00:11:00.280 align:middle line:84%
that many believed was never
finished because of the way that

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.600 align:middle line:90%
it was painted.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.900 align:middle line:84%
We can see the use of
perspective drawing here.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And by connecting the
stairs in the background

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.280 align:middle line:84%
to each other as a
point line reference,

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.750 align:middle line:84%
we can find the vanishing
point off in the distance.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.030 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that
we notice in this painting

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:22.390 align:middle line:84%
immediately are the columns
that are in the background

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.250 align:middle line:90%
above the staircases.

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:29.380 align:middle line:10%
Those columns are a very
specific type of column,

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:33.760 align:middle line:10%
for they represent the exact
columns that we find today

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:39.250 align:middle line:10%
in Edfu and Esna, Egypt, as
well as the old temple that

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:44.370 align:middle line:10%
was located in Heliopolis,
also known as On, or Aon.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:48.900 align:middle line:10%
So The Adoration of the Magi is
telling the story of the three

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:53.190 align:middle line:10%
kings who came from the East to
give gifts to Jesus following

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.620 align:middle line:10%
his birth in the manger.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:59.320 align:middle line:10%
In the left, we see the
remains of an Egyptian temple.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.230 align:middle line:10%
But how could they
all be flanked

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:04.530 align:middle line:10%
by Roman soldiers,
Greek soldiers that

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:07.140 align:middle line:10%
are sitting on the
staircase and an elephant

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.270 align:middle line:10%
far in the background?

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.430 align:middle line:10%
How is it that all
of these things

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:15.660 align:middle line:10%
are happening at the
same moment in time?

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.770 align:middle line:10%
As we look at Mary--

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:22.770 align:middle line:10%
the Virgin Mary sitting with
her newborn child, Jesus--

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:24.930 align:middle line:10%
we see the background
includes a sycamore

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:30.540 align:middle line:10%
tree, a prominent symbology
of Mary, the mother of Jesus,

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.540 align:middle line:10%
as well as a palm tree
in the background.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.210 align:middle line:10%
There's a place
today in Heliopolis

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:40.260 align:middle line:10%
that represents the
place of the Virgin Mary

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:45.150 align:middle line:10%
that matches very closely to
this depiction that we see.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:48.510 align:middle line:10%
Why would Leonardo have
painted this painting

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:51.960 align:middle line:10%
in such a way and to have
depicted so many people

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.220 align:middle line:10%
at the scene of The
Adoration of the Magi

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.620 align:middle line:10%
when that was not
the way that it

00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:00.540 align:middle line:10%
was described in the Book of
Luke, Matthew, Mark or John?

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:05.220 align:middle line:84%
In Leonardo's depiction, we can
see all these different time

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.250 align:middle line:90%
dimensions.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Does this mean to
say that Leonardo

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:15.000 align:middle line:84%
was able to perceive more
expanded dimensions of time?

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, we all know Leonardo
is very famous for having

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:21.540 align:middle line:90%
seen forward hundreds of years.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Some of his inventions are
still only being made today.

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:28.840 align:middle line:84%
The Mars Lander had design
elements related to it,

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.260 align:middle line:84%
as well as the
Venus Lander that's

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:36.060 align:middle line:84%
actually taken on the
name of Leonardo da Vinci.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:40.370 align:middle line:84%
These monitoring devices include
very advanced technologies,

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:43.080 align:middle line:84%
such as optical
coherence tomography,

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.650 align:middle line:84%
to be able to see through
planetary structures

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.440 align:middle line:90%
deep into their core.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:52.850 align:middle line:84%
These technologies in some ways
had some of their major design

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:55.200 align:middle line:84%
elements coming from
Leonardo himself,

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.140 align:middle line:84%
a man who died more
than 500 years ago.

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.970 align:middle line:90%


00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:06.230 align:middle line:84%
A vanishing point is
a fundamental aspect

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:08.270 align:middle line:90%
of our perception.

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:13.160 align:middle line:84%
We all use vanishing points
in our day-to-day perception.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.290 align:middle line:84%
We look into the
distance, and our eyes

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:19.160 align:middle line:84%
are focused on something
far off in the distance.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.250 align:middle line:84%
All of that can be
depicted in illustration

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.850 align:middle line:84%
using perspective drawing
techniques and geometry.

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:28.790 align:middle line:84%
This higher order
aspect of geometry

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:34.010 align:middle line:84%
can even be found inside
of Metatron's cube, where

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:37.970 align:middle line:84%
we can see very clearly
every geometric form that

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:40.430 align:middle line:90%
exists in regular form.

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:46.280 align:middle line:84%
The tetrahedron, the cube, the
octahedron, the dodecahedron

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:50.900 align:middle line:84%
and the icosahedron and
the icosidodecahedron all

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.470 align:middle line:84%
can be found with the
simple line intersections

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:57.800 align:middle line:90%
inherent to Metatron's cube.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.670 align:middle line:84%
In fact, every
structure known to man

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:06.200 align:middle line:84%
in lower and higher
dimension can be found inside

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:11.510 align:middle line:84%
of this simple 6 and 12 point
perspective drawing technique.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, this becomes such
a powerful way for us

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:18.900 align:middle line:84%
to perceive the
universe around us

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.590 align:middle line:84%
when we recognize
that all that we

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:25.190 align:middle line:84%
call higher dimension
and perspective

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:28.340 align:middle line:90%
can be found in a flat plane.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:33.140 align:middle line:84%
The ultimate framework
for this illusion of maya,

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:36.690 align:middle line:84%
this simulation of mind,
is Metatron's cube.

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:39.416 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
marvels of geometry.

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:46.510 align:middle line:10%
The lines of
Metatron's cube, which

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:50.110 align:middle line:10%
form off of this simple
structure that we often refer to

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:55.210 align:middle line:10%
as the Seal of Solomon,
two opposing triangles

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:59.530 align:middle line:10%
representing masculine
and feminine energies.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:02.660 align:middle line:84%
The triangle pointing
upward representing fire,

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:07.390 align:middle line:84%
and the triangle pointing
downward representing water.

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:12.550 align:middle line:84%
These depicting triangles
through their own intersections

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:17.770 align:middle line:84%
can define all the lines and
the circles of Metatron's cube.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:21.340 align:middle line:84%
This enables us to construct
anything in the universe

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:24.770 align:middle line:84%
and to put it in three
dimensional perception.

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:29.320 align:middle line:10%
As you can see here, this
drawing of an icosidodecahedron

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.530 align:middle line:10%
embedded within this
cube of Metatron,

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:35.680 align:middle line:10%
where our eyes can
be shifted to see it

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.180 align:middle line:10%
either as a two dimensional
object or a three

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.040 align:middle line:10%
dimensional object.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.970 align:middle line:84%
What it requires is
your shift in mentality

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:48.690 align:middle line:84%
to perceive it as a three
dimensional object or a two

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:49.630 align:middle line:90%
dimensional object.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.500 align:middle line:90%
It becomes a choice point.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Metatron's cube is a
divine representation

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:02.970 align:middle line:84%
of the architecture of our
universal matrix of mind.

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:08.849 align:middle line:84%
If everything can be depicted
inside this one cubic form, then

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:15.569 align:middle line:84%
even our human bodies, our
forms of biology, our DNA

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:18.990 align:middle line:84%
itself can all be
geometrically depicted

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:21.420 align:middle line:84%
without any
measurements whatsoever

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:27.150 align:middle line:84%
in this divine framework
of the universe.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:31.980 align:middle line:84%
As we think through why
this geometry is so perfect

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:37.492 align:middle line:84%
and how it all relates back
as well to these keys, for

00:17:37.492 --> 00:17:40.950 align:middle line:84%
is not geometry simply
the music that we

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:43.380 align:middle line:90%
experience with our eyes?

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And isn't music the
geometry that we

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:49.200 align:middle line:90%
experience with our ears?

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.740 align:middle line:84%
We have to start looking
differently at geometry.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.500 align:middle line:84%
To expand our
perspective, geometry

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:59.220 align:middle line:84%
has this unique characteristic
that it operates

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:03.240 align:middle line:84%
like a QR code of our
subconscious mind,

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.050 align:middle line:84%
upgrading us without us
even being consciously aware

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:10.180 align:middle line:84%
of it, expanding
our perceptions.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Geometry has the
unique aspect that it

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.500 align:middle line:90%
expands our perspectives.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.930 align:middle line:84%
That's why I love
to draw it so much.

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:23.136 align:middle line:84%
It's a meditative practice
of consciousness expansion.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.510 align:middle line:84%
When we turn our
thoughts within and start

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:36.710 align:middle line:84%
to recognize the role that we
play in this simulation of mind,

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:40.580 align:middle line:84%
it's not only one
of an actor that

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.800 align:middle line:90%
has no choice in the script.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not only one
of a director who

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:50.120 align:middle line:90%
might define the actor's role.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:55.560 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually the
playwright, the producer,

00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:00.260 align:middle line:84%
the director, and the actor on
the stage, each and every one

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:05.870 align:middle line:84%
of us realizing why we
chose what we chose.

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And I believe this is the
message of Metatron's cube.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:16.620 align:middle line:84%
We are not trapped in this
cube, this matrix of mind,

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.860 align:middle line:84%
of illusion, of two

reality or virtual reality.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.940 align:middle line:84%
Rather, we are active
participants in it

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.150 align:middle line:84%
for our greatest
good and benefit.

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:33.160 align:middle line:84%
The universe is not
happening to us.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:37.360 align:middle line:84%
It's always happening
for us in this life.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Each of us experiences
the world not

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.460 align:middle line:90%
as it is but rather as we are.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:46.300 align:middle line:84%
As we start to perceive
in higher dimension,

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:49.930 align:middle line:84%
can we therefore start to
perceive different time

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:52.540 align:middle line:90%
dimensions as well?

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.850 align:middle line:84%
Is it true that the
only real obstacles

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:58.510 align:middle line:84%
that we face in this world
are the self-imposed obstacles

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:00.520 align:middle line:90%
that we believe in?

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:04.030 align:middle line:84%
That the only real obstacles
are the imaginary ones

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:08.650 align:middle line:84%
that we persistently cling
to and find attachment with.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:13.960 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what Metatron is
trying to teach us, by giving us

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:19.660 align:middle line:84%
all of this beautiful
information across all

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:24.370 align:middle line:84%
of those different areas of
disciplines and education

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:27.740 align:middle line:84%
that we perceive as separate
and disparate when actually,

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.760 align:middle line:90%
in fact, they're not at all.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:34.150 align:middle line:10%
For what we call applied
mathematics simply becomes

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:38.590 align:middle line:10%
geometry, and applied
geometry then becomes physics.

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And applied physics, well,
that's what we call chemistry.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And applied chemistry is
biology, and applied biology,

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.700 align:middle line:84%
then, transitions,
interestingly, to psychology.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And applied psychology
becomes sociology,

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:55.810 align:middle line:84%
and applied sociology
is back to philosophy.

00:20:55.810 --> 00:21:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And philosophy, in its applied
form, is mathematics again.

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:04.150 align:middle line:84%
It's an entire loop
of learning where

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:08.530 align:middle line:84%
we can perceive the one in
all of its differentiation.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:13.630 align:middle line:84%
There is no other,
but instead, all

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:18.100 align:middle line:84%
are part of the same
division of the number one.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And the one truth that
connects all of it

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:23.980 align:middle line:84%
is the love that
created all of it.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.430 align:middle line:90%
