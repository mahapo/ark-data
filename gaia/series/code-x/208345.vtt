00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.690 align:middle line:10%
In 2018, I published
a paper titled

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.440 align:middle line:10%
"The Accurate and Infinite
Prediction of Prime Numbers

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.760 align:middle line:10%
Using a Novel
Quasi-Prime Methodology."

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.530 align:middle line:10%
In this paper, I was
able to figure out

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.540 align:middle line:10%
how to predict prime
numbers, something

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.280 align:middle line:10%
that I had learned back in grade
school was an impossibility.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.160 align:middle line:10%
The way that I came to
it was by figuring out

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.240 align:middle line:10%
that numbers actually
operate in spirals of 24

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.330 align:middle line:10%
repeating over and
over and over again.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.120 align:middle line:84%
As I looked at numbers
in 24, I noticed also

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.060 align:middle line:84%
that the Fibonacci
pattern also repeats

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.730 align:middle line:84%
when you look at it in
digital route mathematics,

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.470 align:middle line:84%
collapsing every number
down to single digits.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.140 align:middle line:84%
For example, 27 would
be 2 plus 7 equals 9.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.450 align:middle line:84%
In looking at it
this way, I noticed

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.390 align:middle line:84%
that all the Fibonacci
numbers would repeat

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.970 align:middle line:90%
themselves every 24 cycles.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.100 align:middle line:84%
So I thought there must
actually be something

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.860 align:middle line:90%
that's very fundamental to 24.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.970 align:middle line:10%
So as I wondered what
that relationship to 24

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.330 align:middle line:10%
might actually be,
I couldn't also help

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.710 align:middle line:10%
but think about the famous words
of the late great physicist

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.680 align:middle line:10%
Stephen Hawking who posited
that in order for us

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.950 align:middle line:10%
to have a unified physics
model for the universe,

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.370 align:middle line:10%
that we would have to also
solve prior to that time

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.760 align:middle line:10%
the relationship between
mathematical constants

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.030 align:middle line:10%
like pi, and the golden
number phi, and many others.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.010 align:middle line:10%
As I thought about that,
I also couldn't help

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.160 align:middle line:10%
but think about the
relationship to music.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.870 align:middle line:84%
As mathematician
throughout history

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.260 align:middle line:84%
have very often
also been musicians,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.650 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras is probably the
first great example of that.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras taught us that math
and music are actually one.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.140 align:middle line:84%
What Pythagoras noticed
was that if he continued

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.230 align:middle line:84%
to play with strings and cut
a string down small enough,

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.480 align:middle line:84%
he could actually
see the relationship

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.430 align:middle line:84%
if you always did
it in halves that

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.420 align:middle line:84%
would cause doubling and
halving of octaves infinitely,

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.930 align:middle line:84%
all the way up until we could
no longer hear sound anymore.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.860 align:middle line:84%
At a certain stage at about
20,000 cycles per second,

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.010 align:middle line:84%
human beings can't hear anymore
the notes that go above that

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.460 align:middle line:84%
but they actually continue
to go all the way up.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.260 align:middle line:90%
This was fascinating to me.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.470 align:middle line:10%
This concept of music and
math being the same thing.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.440 align:middle line:10%
So I thought to
myself, wouldn't it

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.630 align:middle line:10%
be possible to relate musical
notes to prime numbers?

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And if I could relate musical
notes to prime numbers,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.960 align:middle line:84%
would I not then also be
able to relate musical notes

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.620 align:middle line:84%
to mathematical constants and
see what those relationships

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.360 align:middle line:90%
might actually yield for us?

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.830 align:middle line:84%
So through that process,
I did exactly that.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.930 align:middle line:84%
The seminal effort
was really tied

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.740 align:middle line:84%
to the simple concept of
what if I dropped two pebbles

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.990 align:middle line:90%
into a still pond?

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.020 align:middle line:84%
What happens with the waves
that overlap each other?

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And as they crash
into each other,

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.070 align:middle line:90%
they create these intersections.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And as these
intersections basically

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.800 align:middle line:84%
create wave interferences
within themselves,

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.110 align:middle line:84%
both constructive and
destructive interference

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.270 align:middle line:90%
patterns emerge.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.240 align:middle line:10%
I posited then also
that possibly where

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.000 align:middle line:10%
those waves are
intersecting is exactly

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.680 align:middle line:10%
relational to a modular
arithmetic or a view

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.070 align:middle line:10%
in spirituality
of the number 24.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.380 align:middle line:90%
And it turned out to be correct.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.590 align:middle line:84%
24 is a basic pattern
that represents

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.838 align:middle line:84%
both a sine and
cosine relationship.

00:03:58.838 --> 00:04:00.380 align:middle line:10%
And you might remember
back in school

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.340 align:middle line:10%
we all studied sine and cosine
relationships in both geometry

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.050 align:middle line:10%
and trigonometry.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.030 align:middle line:84%
I started thinking about this
a little bit more deeply.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And as I got deeper
and deeper into it,

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.800 align:middle line:84%
I realized that this is
just a beautiful language.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.790 align:middle line:84%
This language that we can
see in the form of geometry,

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.780 align:middle line:84%
and really that geometry
is nothing more than just

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.040 align:middle line:84%
the sound that we
enjoy with our eyes.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.770 align:middle line:84%
I learned more and more
about this relationship

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.440 align:middle line:84%
of these musical
notes and how what

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.590 align:middle line:84%
I have been seeing with my eyes
my entire life could actually

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.460 align:middle line:84%
even be represented as just
wave patterns of sound.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.440 align:middle line:90%


00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.970 align:middle line:10%
Now, 24, you could break it
into two pieces and both sides

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.890 align:middle line:10%
would be 12, and this is why we
have 12 notes in each octave.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.500 align:middle line:10%
And as we double an
octave then, of course,

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.640 align:middle line:10%
24 goes to 48 by doubling
it again, and so on.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So here again, the entire
prime number pattern

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.130 align:middle line:84%
repeats itself
infinitely through

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.630 align:middle line:84%
a musical representation
in such a beautiful way.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.760 align:middle line:84%
One other aspect
of this as well is

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.020 align:middle line:84%
that the sound that we listen to
and the musical notes we listen

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.620 align:middle line:84%
to are actually directly
related to the geometries.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.990 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the geometries
that underlie

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.790 align:middle line:84%
those sounds might actually help
us to understand more about how

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:37.742 align:middle line:84%
to precisely tune those sounds
to our greatest benefit.

00:05:37.742 --> 00:05:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the things that's

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.380 align:middle line:84%
been a long term dream
of mine, that one day I

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.440 align:middle line:84%
would be able to figure out
how to tune our DNA like keys

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.760 align:middle line:84%
on a piano keyboard with
very high precision.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe that
the healing mechanisms

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.710 align:middle line:84%
will not be pharmacologic in the
future but rather sound-based.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Because sound is able to
penetrate through our bodies,

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.660 align:middle line:90%
through all of our cells.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And if we could figure out
how to precisely tune it,

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.770 align:middle line:84%
might that not have a
big impact on our biology

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.740 align:middle line:84%
and our own wellness
and well-being?

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, Leonardo da Vinci
also faced a similar challenge.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Right in the Vitruvian
man, most people

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.970 align:middle line:84%
don't notice that there's
actually a page number written

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:33.310 align:middle line:84%
in the upper right-hand corner
of the Vitruvian man, which

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.570 align:middle line:84%
is kind of bizarre
because first of all,

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.800 align:middle line:84%
it's not written backwards
in mirrored text.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.950 align:middle line:84%
If you notice, you'll see in
the upper right-hand corner

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.700 align:middle line:84%
it looks to be right
adjacent to a fold line

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.250 align:middle line:90%
as if it's a page in a book.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.490 align:middle line:84%
There's also a backwards
mirrored text of the letter B

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:57.160 align:middle line:84%
that's tail is pointing
straight to a number.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:03.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, that number as we get
close up on it is actually 126.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was something that was
really sort of enigmatic for me

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.910 align:middle line:84%
when I first saw it
because first of all,

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.060 align:middle line:84%
was the Vitruvian
man part of a book?

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.500 align:middle line:90%
Not really.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.920 align:middle line:84%
It was a loose leaf
representation of one

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.330 align:middle line:90%
of his sketches.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.470 align:middle line:84%
But why would he write
the number 126 as

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.870 align:middle line:84%
if it's a page number
and then point to it

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.960 align:middle line:90%
with a backwards letter B?

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.160 align:middle line:10%
Well, I had to go even
further into understanding

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.020 align:middle line:10%
what da Vinci might
be referring to,

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.930 align:middle line:10%
and it takes you
all the way back

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:43.760 align:middle line:10%
to around the fourth century
BC where Plato is actually

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.840 align:middle line:10%
speaking to the Greek Senate
at a time of great unrest

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.520 align:middle line:10%
in his country of Greece.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The unrest was due to the
great plague of Athens that

00:07:54.710 --> 00:08:00.710 align:middle line:84%
swept through the city in 430
BC during the Peloponnesian War

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.940 align:middle line:84%
that claimed nearly
100,000 lives.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.390 align:middle line:84%
In an attempt to stop
the spread of the plague,

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:11.060 align:middle line:84%
leaders in Greece
sought the help

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.820 align:middle line:90%
of famed philosopher Plato.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.860 align:middle line:84%
After Plato failed
to find a solution,

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:21.590 align:middle line:84%
they consulted the Oracle
of Delphi who told them,

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:26.420 align:middle line:84%
"the simple solution is you must
double the size of the altar

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.930 align:middle line:84%
to the sun God Apollo,
and if you can perfectly

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.980 align:middle line:84%
double its volume, then
the plague will dissipate."

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.370 align:middle line:84%
In short, the ancient
Greeks had to solve

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:42.290 align:middle line:84%
the mathematical problem of
doubling the volume of a cube.

00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The answer turns out
to be the cubed root of 2,

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:52.690 align:middle line:90%
which is approximately 1.26.

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:56.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, this has a very, very
important relationship

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.430 align:middle line:90%
to music itself.

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:01.420 align:middle line:10%
Pythagoras had taught us that in
order to form a musical scale,

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.240 align:middle line:10%
we can do it with
a perfect fifth.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And the perfect fifth
relationship is 3/2.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:13.000 align:middle line:10%
So in terms of music,
if you know music well,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.150 align:middle line:10%
you could say that a perfect
fifth relationship for the note

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:20.080 align:middle line:10%
C at middle C would
become a G note.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.270 align:middle line:84%
From this, you
can figure out how

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.670 align:middle line:90%
to populate a lot of the scale.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.160 align:middle line:84%
But in order to complete
an entire scale,

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:31.780 align:middle line:84%
you must also include
something called a major third.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, the major third is
a mathematical interval

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:40.930 align:middle line:84%
relationship that was defined
by Pythagoras as being 5/4,

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.390 align:middle line:90%
or 1.25.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.820 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is,
though, is that if you

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:50.290 align:middle line:84%
start to populate a scale using
the interval that Pythagoras

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.110 align:middle line:84%
had actually outlined
in something called just

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:59.680 align:middle line:84%
tuning starting with 432
Hertz as your A note,

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.270 align:middle line:84%
after a while, when you start
taking those intervals of 3/2

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.220 align:middle line:84%
to populate the
next perfect fifth

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.550 align:middle line:84%
as well as the major
third relationship of 5/4,

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:12.790 align:middle line:90%
you find a discrepancy emerges.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:16.090 align:middle line:84%
It becomes impossible to
actually double the octave

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:18.790 align:middle line:90%
through the major third.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:22.060 align:middle line:90%
So this is a real challenge.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Musically, Pythagoras
taught us, well, we

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.880 align:middle line:84%
can make up for this
challenge by replacing

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.660 align:middle line:84%
this method of just tuning
with another approach that

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:35.500 align:middle line:84%
uses something called a
Pythagorean comma, which sort

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.600 align:middle line:84%
of makes up for this
slight difference that

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.750 align:middle line:84%
in octave doubling creates this
discrepancy that doesn't allow

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.130 align:middle line:90%
you to double the octave.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:45.550 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is no
different than the solution

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:49.060 align:middle line:84%
that had to be found during
the plague in ancient Greece.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:54.100 align:middle line:84%
I had the idea to replace
the 1.25 using just

00:10:54.100 --> 00:11:00.850 align:middle line:84%
tuning with 1.26 instead,
the cubed root of 2.

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, in this
context, we actually

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:06.430 align:middle line:84%
see the symmetry
that nature can apply

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:13.840 align:middle line:84%
of the perfect fifth which is
3/2 as well as a new approach

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:19.250 align:middle line:84%
to a major third using
the cubed root of 2.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.860 align:middle line:84%
So as we get deeper
into this, we

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.890 align:middle line:84%
can now see that
using this new tuning

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:30.020 align:middle line:84%
approach which I decided to name
"precise temperament tuning,"

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:34.520 align:middle line:84%
we can find that every note
in this context starting

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:40.070 align:middle line:84%
from 432 Hertz will also
have a digital sum of 9

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:41.600 align:middle line:90%
without exception.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.910 align:middle line:84%
But unlike most
tuning standards that

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:48.620 align:middle line:84%
end at an approach that would
kind of have a whole number

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:52.550 align:middle line:84%
value, this goes into
fractional representations.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:55.040 align:middle line:10%
Equal temperament
tuning does as well,

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.530 align:middle line:10%
but this is very
different because even

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:01.610 align:middle line:10%
the fractional decimal
extension, even every one

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:04.310 align:middle line:10%
of those numbers in
every three digits

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:06.740 align:middle line:10%
will sum to the number 9.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:11.210 align:middle line:84%
This happens naturally as a
consequence of simply replacing

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:18.260 align:middle line:84%
the cubed root of 2, 1.26,
for the prior 1.25 5/4

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.790 align:middle line:90%
major third relationship.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.720 align:middle line:84%
This is an extraordinarily
controversial topic

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.240 align:middle line:90%
amongst the musical community.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:30.670 align:middle line:84%
Prior to 1939, there
was no tuning standard.

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.610 align:middle line:84%
In 1939, an international
organization

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:35.950 align:middle line:84%
decided to put together
a global tuning

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:39.460 align:middle line:84%
standard it was headed
by John D Rockefeller

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.840 align:middle line:90%
and his organization.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.110 align:middle line:10%
At that time, they decided
that although many people

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:48.080 align:middle line:10%
around the globe were using
different tuning standards,

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:52.770 align:middle line:10%
they wanted to standardize
it to a simple for 440 Hertz.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, the challenge with
that was that if we add up 4

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.415 align:middle line:90%
plus 4 plus 0 doesn't equal 9.

00:12:59.415 --> 00:13:02.060 align:middle line:90%


00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.100 align:middle line:90%
It must answer at 9.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:07.160 align:middle line:84%
If not, it will not
have a perfect geometric

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.090 align:middle line:90%
correspondence.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, geometry
is simply the music

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.520 align:middle line:84%
that we listen to with
our eyes and our sight.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Maybe when music
has been written

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:23.900 align:middle line:84%
by the likes of Bach
and Verdi and Mozart,

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:26.150 align:middle line:84%
they intended to have
certain notes have

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:29.690 align:middle line:84%
certain emotional qualities
and texture and context

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:31.010 align:middle line:90%
come along with them.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:32.930 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain
quality that is

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:35.630 align:middle line:90%
intended to provide a contrast.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:39.170 align:middle line:84%
Does our current equal
temperament system provide us

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:42.660 align:middle line:84%
with that degree of
contrast reference?

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.324 align:middle line:90%
And I don't believe it does.

00:13:45.324 --> 00:13:47.814 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:47.814 --> 00:14:03.280 align:middle line:90%


00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.470 align:middle line:84%
So what happens if we
now change that process?

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's have a listen to see
what precise temperament

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.241 align:middle line:90%
tuning sounds like.

00:14:11.241 --> 00:14:13.696 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:13.696 --> 00:14:26.480 align:middle line:90%


00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.840 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that beautiful?

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, where else do we see music
coming in the form of matter?

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, we see it in even the
periodic table of elements.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, Mendeleev refers
to the periodic table

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:47.380 align:middle line:84%
on a linear table but nothing
in nature is on a linear table.

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.290 align:middle line:90%
Instead, it's a spiral.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:54.190 align:middle line:84%
We've renamed that the "periodic
wave of elements," where

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:58.240 align:middle line:84%
every single element
in the periodic wave

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:02.080 align:middle line:84%
is just another
musical representation

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.080 align:middle line:84%
from a family of notes
created from perfect fifths

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.760 align:middle line:90%
and major thirds.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.260 align:middle line:10%
Even isotope relationships
on this periodic wave

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.740 align:middle line:10%
are created from the musical
interval relationships

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.980 align:middle line:10%
that exist inherent to nature.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.350 align:middle line:10%
All of it operating off
the simple principle

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:25.020 align:middle line:10%
as well of a base 9 mathematics.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:30.510 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the polygons that
are all around us every day,

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:33.030 align:middle line:84%
an equilateral triangle
is a good place to start.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Equilateral meaning that
it has three angles that

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:39.720 align:middle line:84%
are interior angles
and each is 60 degrees.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.490 align:middle line:90%
They sum to 180 degrees.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Notice, 1 plus 8
plus 0 equals 9.

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Let's move on to a
square 360 degrees

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:55.590 align:middle line:84%
are the sum of angles of the
interior angles of a square.

00:15:55.590 --> 00:16:00.360 align:middle line:84%
360 degrees is 3 plus
6 plus 0 equals 9.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.560 align:middle line:84%
How about moving on
now to a pentagon?

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.040 align:middle line:84%
540 degrees is the sum
of its interior angles,

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:12.690 align:middle line:90%
5 plus 4 plus 0 equals 9.

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, what if we
made a conversion

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:21.520 align:middle line:84%
for those different geometric
forms that we call polygons

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:25.360 align:middle line:84%
and we converted simply
each of their values

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:31.030 align:middle line:84%
into Hertz frequencies using
the exact same conversion value?

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.020 align:middle line:90%
What do we get?

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:36.730 align:middle line:10%
Well, nothing other
than the most beautiful

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:42.180 align:middle line:10%
five-part harmony of
F sharp major chord.

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:45.690 align:middle line:10%
What we're seeing with
our eyes is really

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:51.570 align:middle line:10%
just the F sharp major
chord in five-part harmony,

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:57.050 align:middle line:10%
and we're looking at it as
polygonal geometric forms.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, you might ask, well, is
this true for three-dimensional

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.700 align:middle line:90%
geometry as well?

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And how about hyper
cubes and tesseracts?

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:11.210 align:middle line:10%
The answer is yes, you will
not find a geometric form that

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:14.990 align:middle line:10%
exists in the Archimedean
solids or Platonic solids

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:16.730 align:middle line:10%
or what's also
called and referred

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:20.369 align:middle line:10%
to as the Catalan
dual solids even that

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:23.349 align:middle line:10%
doesn't sum to the number 9.

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:25.000 align:middle line:84%
If this is the
case, shouldn't we

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.140 align:middle line:84%
be looking differently
at how and what

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:33.280 align:middle line:84%
we allow the music to
enter into our lives to be?

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Maybe also this is why we're so
attracted to geometric forms.

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Maybe at a subtle
level, our brains

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.740 align:middle line:84%
are nothing more
than QR code readers

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.960 align:middle line:84%
as we look at
geometry all around us

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.540 align:middle line:84%
every moment of
every day, always

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:54.520 align:middle line:84%
looking for the
signature of the source.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.190 align:middle line:10%
And often, we see
that represented

00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:00.100 align:middle line:10%
as mathematical
constants and one of them

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:06.130 align:middle line:10%
in particular the
golden ratio, 1.618.

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:10.450 align:middle line:10%
The golden ratio defines
what we look at and conceive

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:15.820 align:middle line:10%
as beautiful around us, just
as it does so in music as well.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:19.690 align:middle line:84%
The golden ratio is
based off of a number

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:24.380 align:middle line:84%
series called the Fibonacci
series of numbers.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.960 align:middle line:84%
So as we look at each
of these numbers,

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.470 align:middle line:84%
we notice that the
relationship between each

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:34.060 align:middle line:84%
of these successive numbers,
the larger the number becomes

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:38.560 align:middle line:84%
is 1.618 multiplied
by the prior number.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.320 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this relationship
is something so much more

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:45.190 align:middle line:84%
fundamental that we should all
be studying to understand it

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:50.860 align:middle line:84%
because it becomes the
signature of universal source.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that even the
geometry that we see around us

00:18:55.660 --> 00:19:00.430 align:middle line:84%
is formed simply by some
musical note that is either

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:05.770 align:middle line:84%
above our audible spectrum,
or below our audible spectrum?

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Sound emanating out
from the silence,

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:14.200 align:middle line:84%
is that also what is
separating light from darkness?

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.210 align:middle line:90%


00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:22.920 align:middle line:84%
As we look at a unification
theory of science,

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.520 align:middle line:84%
I can't help but think about
the famous words of Leonardo da

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Vinci, "learn the art of science
and study the science of art."

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:39.430 align:middle line:84%
Realize that everything
is connected.

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:42.430 align:middle line:90%
Learn how to see.

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:46.180 align:middle line:84%
I believe fundamentally that the
way for us to learn how to see

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.370 align:middle line:84%
is, first and
foremost, to notice

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:50.020 align:middle line:90%
that everything is connected.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.780 align:middle line:84%
There is no action that
we see in this world that

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:58.090 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have an underlying
relationship to another action.

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:02.020 align:middle line:84%
We're all connected through
that series of myriad

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:06.550 align:middle line:84%
of interactions that most of
which cannot even be perceived

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:10.960 align:middle line:90%
by us but they're always there.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.570 align:middle line:84%
A good way to look at
the universe around us

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:17.770 align:middle line:84%
is to notice that even
in things like cymatics

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:20.290 align:middle line:84%
we can see new
structure and new form

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:26.970 align:middle line:84%
and new organization and
new pattern in our universe.

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.580 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful thing.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:33.460 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the entire
universe is patterned.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:38.800 align:middle line:84%
What we refer to as random
is really only the parts

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.260 align:middle line:84%
of the universe that we haven't
figured out the encryptions

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:42.910 align:middle line:90%
for yet.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:46.300 align:middle line:84%
The encryption exists,
the pattern exists,

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:49.840 align:middle line:84%
it's just above
and beyond our zone

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.730 align:middle line:90%
of perception and intelligence.

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:55.360 align:middle line:90%


00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Let me talk a little
bit about dimensions.

00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:00.430 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with a simple line.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:02.650 align:middle line:90%
A line is the first dimension.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's place another
access point on that line,

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:10.300 align:middle line:84%
and now we can measure those
two points of intersection

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.400 align:middle line:84%
and finish them
out in mirror form,

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.580 align:middle line:84%
now we have a square
or any other form.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:18.700 align:middle line:90%
We measure that an area.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:22.840 align:middle line:84%
The next form would be to
pop that out with a z-axis

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:28.540 align:middle line:84%
so that we can see the third
dimension of that cube now.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:32.200 align:middle line:90%
So the square turns into a cube.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.050 align:middle line:84%
But the next form after
that would actually

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:39.340 align:middle line:90%
be a cube that would rotate.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, we think about a cube
as the third dimension

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.800 align:middle line:90%
but it's stationary.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.350 align:middle line:10%
In order for us to
experience life,

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:50.110 align:middle line:10%
all life is in
motion, therefore we

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:52.390 align:middle line:10%
have to accept and
understand that we

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:56.950 align:middle line:10%
live in the fourth dimension,
where the fourth dimension is

00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:00.250 align:middle line:10%
the axis of motion.

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:04.300 align:middle line:90%
We measure motion through time.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:09.880 align:middle line:84%
The next dimension is
simply an expansion of time.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.600 align:middle line:84%
We see time as a linear
one-way street function.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:18.010 align:middle line:84%
But the principles of music and
physics would point to the fact

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:23.360 align:middle line:84%
that all dimensions of
time exist simultaneously.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:27.250 align:middle line:10%
And if that is so, then
the next experience

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.620 align:middle line:10%
for us as a higher
dimension, as we

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:31.840 align:middle line:10%
push the boundary
of the persistence

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:36.610 align:middle line:10%
of our own perception
will be to experience

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:42.550 align:middle line:10%
different dimensions happening
simultaneously of time itself.

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:44.750 align:middle line:84%
We call that the
fifth dimension.

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And we can look at this as a
musical relationship as well.

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:51.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we can say that
the first dimension could

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.520 align:middle line:90%
be measured as the number 6.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:59.570 align:middle line:84%
6, then, of course, we could
take it to the next dimension

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:02.070 align:middle line:90%
that it would go 6-squared.

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:05.510 align:middle line:90%
So 6-squared would be 36.

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And we can also add
a simple 0 to that

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:10.160 align:middle line:84%
which makes it 360,
immediately, we think

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:13.740 align:middle line:90%
of the 360 degrees of a circle.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Then the next level
is going to be

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:18.440 align:middle line:90%
to take that to the next power.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:23.870 align:middle line:90%
6 to the 3rd power, equals 216.

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:26.270 align:middle line:84%
We can add a 0 to that
and interestingly,

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:28.790 align:middle line:84%
it turns out to be
the form of a cube

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:37.170 align:middle line:84%
because the sum of angles
of a cube is 2,160 degrees.

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:43.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, we take that to the
next level, we get 1,296.

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that number another number
that shows up somewhere else?

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:49.130 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it is.

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:51.710 align:middle line:90%
It shows up in the compass.

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:57.440 align:middle line:84%
A compass has one
1,296,000 seconds.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Does that then mean that a
compass is actually the best

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.680 align:middle line:90%
reference for measuring time?

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:09.070 align:middle line:90%
Time and space are inseparable.

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:12.865 align:middle line:84%
Maybe our experience
with time now

00:24:12.865 --> 00:24:16.150 align:middle line:84%
must also expand
to the next level

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:18.970 align:middle line:84%
because if we took
it to the next power

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:22.630 align:middle line:84%
again by adding
those zeros to it,

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:28.360 align:middle line:84%
it goes which 1, 2, 9, 6 which
was 6 to the 4th power, 6

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:35.620 align:middle line:90%
to the 5th power becomes 7,776.

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:40.060 align:middle line:10%
Does that mean now that we
have more volume with which

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:44.830 align:middle line:10%
to measure a hypercube
in motion that

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:53.330 align:middle line:10%
is no longer in one direction
but can go multiple directions?

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:56.540 align:middle line:84%
As we contemplate these
very deep questions,

00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:01.070 align:middle line:84%
we have to ask ourselves,
who is the conductor

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:04.940 align:middle line:84%
behind this beautiful
symphony that's

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:11.330 align:middle line:84%
happening all around us every
single day of our entire lives?

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:16.250 align:middle line:84%
Most times, we don't even notice
what's happening around us,

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:19.140 align:middle line:84%
and think about all the
things we miss out on.

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.310 align:middle line:10%
But as we learn the language of
universal consciousness, which

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:29.390 align:middle line:10%
is a language based on music
and light mixed with dark,

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:33.950 align:middle line:10%
we can actually see the
creation all around us

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:39.100 align:middle line:10%
in every single moment
of our experience.

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:44.970 align:middle line:84%
When we do that, we
start to feel at one.
