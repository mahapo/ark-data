[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.046 --> 00:00:22.040 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.370 align:middle line:84%
We started this season
with the knowledge

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.280 align:middle line:90%
of the pyramid of perception.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.410 align:middle line:10%
We then realized the
connection to music and scale

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.020 align:middle line:10%
and how the pyramids
on the Giza Plateau

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.530 align:middle line:10%
were representations,
very specifically,

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.270 align:middle line:10%
of musical intervals--

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.680 align:middle line:10%
representing, ostensibly,
all of the spectrum

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.330 align:middle line:10%
of both light and sound.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.740 align:middle line:84%
This can all be represented
back on the Giza Plateau.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And the throat chakra is
represented as the global throat

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.720 align:middle line:84%
chakra embedded underneath
the Great Pyramid for all

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.330 align:middle line:90%
of the planet Earth.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.180 align:middle line:84%
As we look at all
of these locations

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.470 align:middle line:84%
and the role they
play across the earth,

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.930 align:middle line:84%
we can't help but notice the
strategic placements as well of

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.470 align:middle line:90%
all the ancient complexes.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.200 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid complex
on the Giza Plateau

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.420 align:middle line:84%
represents the belt of
Orion, the star system that

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.490 align:middle line:84%
is basically embodied in all of
this work of the hero's journey.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.720 align:middle line:84%
This work is
referred to, in fact,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.480 align:middle line:84%
as the great work
or the magnum opus.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.640 align:middle line:84%
We also can find,
if we link together,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.220 align:middle line:84%
the Chinese pyramids, along
with the pyramids that

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.230 align:middle line:84%
are on the Giza
Plateau, and then

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.570 align:middle line:84%
link that with what we know
as the Teotihuacan pyramids

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.210 align:middle line:84%
in Mexico, just
outside of Mexico City.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.960 align:middle line:84%
This, again, forms an
almost perfect Orion's Belt

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.100 align:middle line:90%
constellation relationship.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.270 align:middle line:90%


00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.789 align:middle line:84%
This hero's journey
is all around us,

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.880 align:middle line:84%
inundating and filling
our consciousness

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.530 align:middle line:84%
because this is the knowledge
that our soul wants to remember.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.150 align:middle line:10%
As we look at the
Nile Valley as well,

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.140 align:middle line:10%
going from the South, which
is referred to as Upper Egypt,

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.830 align:middle line:10%
down into Lower Egypt,
where the Nile empties

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.380 align:middle line:10%
into the Mediterranean,
we could see

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.110 align:middle line:10%
as well that this story of the
Nile expressing as the Kundalini

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.320 align:middle line:10%
life force.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.860 align:middle line:84%
This chrism, emptying
into the Nile,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.820 align:middle line:84%
into the deltas and
tributaries that are eventually

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.040 align:middle line:84%
culminating in the crown chakra,
actually begins at Abu Simbel.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.640 align:middle line:10%
Abu Simbel, being the root
chakra and each of the temples

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.180 align:middle line:10%
that are all dedicated to Osiris
and Isis, his wife and consort,

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.810 align:middle line:10%
are all representing
different chakra points

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.420 align:middle line:10%
along the Nile River.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.200 align:middle line:10%
Kom Ombo temple-- the
crocodile god, Sobek--

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.890 align:middle line:10%
representing the
stored life force

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.530 align:middle line:10%
of the dragon in
the sacral chakra,

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.850 align:middle line:10%
or also referred to
as the vermilion.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.730 align:middle line:84%
This area is where
the life force

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.010 align:middle line:84%
is stored so that
it can ascend back

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.610 align:middle line:84%
up into, through the chakras,
all the way through the heart,

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.510 align:middle line:90%
through the throat--

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.230 align:middle line:84%
one of the great challenges--
and then eventually

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.320 align:middle line:84%
into the Cave of Brahma to form
the kalindra crystal of time.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.520 align:middle line:10%
As we look at each
of these locations,

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.650 align:middle line:10%
we can even see that on the left
and right sides, or the West

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.810 align:middle line:10%
and East sides,
of the Nile River

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.860 align:middle line:10%
can even form representations
of the masculine and feminine

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.350 align:middle line:10%
aspects of these
chakra center points.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.570 align:middle line:10%
For example, Dendera sits on
the east side of the Nile River,

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.530 align:middle line:10%
whereas the Osirion
temple in Abydos

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.310 align:middle line:10%
sits exactly on
the same longitude.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.459 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it is positioned
across the Nile

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.089 align:middle line:84%
to represent the separation of
the feminine from the masculine,

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:27.110 align:middle line:84%
the Dendera temple to Hathor
and the Osirion temple to Osiris

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.270 align:middle line:84%
in Abydos, representing
these two aspects.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.500 align:middle line:90%
And we see this along the Nile.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.180 align:middle line:84%
We also can go beyond
this to Hermopolis,

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.750 align:middle line:84%
the ancient location of
this followers of Hermes,

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.120 align:middle line:84%
and all the way through
up to the Giza Plateau.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.200 align:middle line:10%
As we go beyond the Giza
Plateau, through the layers

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.440 align:middle line:10%
of the Great Pyramid--

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.650 align:middle line:10%
which represents, just as the
Nile does, the chakra system--

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.400 align:middle line:10%
the Great Pyramid representing
the concept of self-awareness.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.710 align:middle line:10%
Khafre pyramid representing the
concept of self-actualization

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.750 align:middle line:10%
but still dependent on time.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.760 align:middle line:10%
And the Menkaure
Pyramid representing

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.030 align:middle line:10%
the self-transcendence layer
and the transcendence of time

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.420 align:middle line:10%
and entry into the
fifth-dimensional experience

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.910 align:middle line:10%
of Christ consciousness.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.150 align:middle line:10%
As we start to
look at and notice

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.300 align:middle line:10%
that the pyramid structures
within the Great Pyramid

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.360 align:middle line:10%
are representative of
Osiris and Orion himself--

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.840 align:middle line:10%
our hero-- the hero traveling
through the reincarnation cycle

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.580 align:middle line:10%
in the Duat, the
world of the Duat,

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.430 align:middle line:10%
to raise the djed, the
chrism oil, the Christ oil,

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.060 align:middle line:10%
to get back into the
crown chakra activation.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.180 align:middle line:84%
This raising of the
djed is a symbology

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.350 align:middle line:84%
that includes the Wadjet,
an ancient Egyptian symbol,

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.610 align:middle line:84%
as well as the
vertebrae of the spine,

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.550 align:middle line:84%
and is often depicted
within the eternal life

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.670 align:middle line:90%
symbology of the ankh.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.250 align:middle line:84%
As we ascend through this
magnum opus of experience,

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:11.970 align:middle line:84%
the great work, we will start to
realize new chakras activating

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:17.200 align:middle line:84%
within us as we move
from 7 chakras to 12

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.740 align:middle line:84%
and then the realization of the
polarity of the Ida and Pingala.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:29.100 align:middle line:84%
The Ida is 432, and
the Pingala is 528,

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.690 align:middle line:84%
and the representation then
of a 24-chakra matrix within

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:38.310 align:middle line:84%
our body, as well
as our auric field.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:43.480 align:middle line:84%
The 24 chakras being activated
relate to all the musical notes,

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.140 align:middle line:84%
culminating at the very
top in the Cave of Brahma,

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.910 align:middle line:84%
with the representation of the
philosopher's stone proportion

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.110 align:middle line:84%
that matches that
of the pineal gland,

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.440 align:middle line:84%
representing the
masculine principle

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.150 align:middle line:84%
and the winged serpent coming
up into the same location

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.910 align:middle line:84%
but through the pituitary
gland representing

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.070 align:middle line:90%
the divine feminine.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.880 align:middle line:84%
The beauty of this means
that we now transcend.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And as we do so, and as
we realize these chakras

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.150 align:middle line:84%
within ourselves,
we will realize them

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:19.590 align:middle line:84%
within the Great Pyramid
structure on its own.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.140 align:middle line:84%
The scan pyramid project
in the Great Pyramid

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.150 align:middle line:84%
has been conducted by
the Japanese delegation.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.960 align:middle line:84%
A number of French
researchers and Egyptologists,

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.940 align:middle line:84%
as well as the
Egyptian government,

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.900 align:middle line:84%
have been working together
with German delegates

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.120 align:middle line:84%
and several other researchers
from around the world

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.970 align:middle line:84%
and from Scandinavia with
advanced technologies

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.010 align:middle line:90%
called muon scan.

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And they've been
able to use this type

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:48.330 align:middle line:84%
of ground-penetrating radar to
identify several new structures

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:49.800 align:middle line:90%
within the Great Pyramid.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, during the
last scanning sessions,

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:58.220 align:middle line:84%
they were able to identify over
22 previously unknown structures

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.230 align:middle line:90%
within the Great Pyramid.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Is it a coincidence that this
is happening at the same time

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.530 align:middle line:84%
as the mass ascension
of humanity that's

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.090 align:middle line:90%
also taking place?

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe it is.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.020 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo da Vinci gave us
a map of the Great Pyramid

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.900 align:middle line:84%
with the 14 cuts of our
hero, Orion and Osiris,

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:23.540 align:middle line:84%
representing each of the
chambers of the Great Pyramid.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.270 align:middle line:10%
And yet, there are
many other lines

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:30.450 align:middle line:10%
that have not yet represented
for us chamber locations.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.830 align:middle line:84%
The next line that
da Vinci has given us

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.960 align:middle line:84%
that would suggest
another chamber

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.140 align:middle line:84%
is right at the
throat chakra line.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.990 align:middle line:84%
In March of 2023, the
Egyptian government

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:46.250 align:middle line:84%
made a major announcement of the
discovery of a corridor using

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.400 align:middle line:84%
an endoscopic camera to
go through the chevrons

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.840 align:middle line:84%
above the original entrance
of the Great Pyramid.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:57.130 align:middle line:84%
They inched the camera in and
were able to find a 27-foot-long

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:01.060 align:middle line:84%
corridor in the shape
of a diamond pentagon.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's an interesting
shape because that happened

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:08.080 align:middle line:84%
to match exactly the view with
an endoscope of the throat

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.220 align:middle line:84%
cavity right above
the vocal cords--

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.310 align:middle line:84%
the diamond-shaped
pentagon-- almost as

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:20.080 align:middle line:84%
if to say, this way to the
throat chakra chamber, the meta

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:25.060 align:middle line:90%
throne, the throne beyond.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And the throat chakra
chamber is a small cubic room

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:34.120 align:middle line:84%
that has, within it, only
one piece of furniture,

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.030 align:middle line:90%
and it is a rose granite throne.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:40.870 align:middle line:84%
As we go up through
the throat chakra,

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.240 align:middle line:84%
the next level of
realization then

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.300 align:middle line:84%
for us is to go to
the pineal gland,

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.720 align:middle line:84%
represented by the
djed satellite pyramid

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.110 align:middle line:90%
and the pituitary gland.

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:56.076 align:middle line:84%
And the two combined together
to create the crown chakra

00:09:56.076 --> 00:09:56.876 align:middle line:90%
activation.

00:09:56.876 --> 00:10:00.150 align:middle line:90%


00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.660 align:middle line:10%
I had the opportunity
recently to visit

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:09.330 align:middle line:10%
Abu Rawash, 8 kilometers north
and 300 feet higher elevation.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:13.630 align:middle line:84%
It looks down from that plateau
down to the Giza Plateau.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:17.100 align:middle line:84%
The corners of the
pyramids of Abu Rawash

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.010 align:middle line:84%
are matching perfectly to the
corners of the Great Pyramid,

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:24.420 align:middle line:90%
as well as Khafre and Menkaure.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:28.620 align:middle line:84%
The correlation of
geometry is perfection.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:33.215 align:middle line:84%
It represents for us the
activation of the crown chakra.

00:10:33.215 --> 00:10:36.930 align:middle line:90%


00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:42.610 align:middle line:10%
Carl Jung refers to
enlightenment as individuation,

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:44.400 align:middle line:10%
and he wrote about
it in a book that he

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.520 align:middle line:10%
called, interestingly, AION.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.950 align:middle line:84%
In this path of
individuation, it

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:53.310 align:middle line:84%
is not the relinquishing
of our individuality,

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:58.770 align:middle line:84%
but the celebration of
it, that our uniqueness

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:02.050 align:middle line:84%
is our great strength
and our reason for being.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:07.020 align:middle line:84%
In French, the term "raison
d'être" comes to mind--

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:10.320 align:middle line:90%
the reason for being.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.620 align:middle line:10%
The Abu Rawash Plateau
represents the crown chakra

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.180 align:middle line:10%
activation--

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:19.170 align:middle line:10%
the two pyramids there being
the exact representations

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:23.520 align:middle line:10%
of the triangle with
an inscribed square

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.830 align:middle line:10%
and an inscribed circle,
and in the third dimension,

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:29.850 align:middle line:10%
the pyramidal shape of
the equilateral triangle

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.300 align:middle line:10%
and the pyramidal shape of
the philosopher's stone, djed

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.010 align:middle line:10%
satellite pyramid--

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:38.460 align:middle line:10%
the personification
and full achievement

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:43.950 align:middle line:10%
of the raising of the djed,
the achievement of the kalindra

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:47.790 align:middle line:10%
and the transcendence of time.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Judgment is an artifact
and a necessary aspect

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:56.660 align:middle line:84%
of the duality experience
that we all must go through.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is personified
again in the mathematics

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.130 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Pyramid.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:04.850 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid has the
proportional reference

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:09.560 align:middle line:84%
that I've already
mentioned, of 2 over 1 pi.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.710 align:middle line:84%
2 is its height, and
1 pi is its base.

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:18.290 align:middle line:84%
This gives us 2 pi over 2
when we take its inverted

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:22.850 align:middle line:84%
relationship, which then can
also be referenced as 1/1

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and also be referenced as
the circle that extends from

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.950 align:middle line:84%
the base of the Great
Pyramid to its apex,

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:33.740 align:middle line:84%
being the exact same length as
the base of the Great Pyramid.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Now this also can be found
in other Sumerian texts

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:42.770 align:middle line:84%
as one of the keys that we
find throughout history,

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:44.940 align:middle line:90%
another key of Metatron.

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:48.370 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if we look at the
Metatron's cube and the circle

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:54.880 align:middle line:84%
reference that basically build
up Metatron's cube in totality,

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.390 align:middle line:84%
we can find exactly
those proportions within

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Metatron's cube that derive for
us the circle and the line--

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.310 align:middle line:90%
that is, the base--

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.390 align:middle line:84%
forming the foundation
of the Great Pyramid,

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:09.220 align:middle line:84%
and is also found in
the symbology of Shamash

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.970 align:middle line:90%
holding the rod and the circle.

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:16.370 align:middle line:84%
A symbology that we find
over and over again,

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:22.510 align:middle line:84%
also with the winged disk that
holds the same proportion.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.690 align:middle line:84%
The length of the AE line is
equal to the circumference

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:27.310 align:middle line:90%
of the circle.

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:31.940 align:middle line:84%
This is the ultimate
understanding of divine balance,

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:84%
allowing the squaring
of the circle,

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.270 align:middle line:84%
and is the key that
is fundamental for us

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.810 align:middle line:84%
to transcend and go
into the Age of Aquarius

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:43.640 align:middle line:84%
with higher wisdom
and higher knowledge

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:48.330 align:middle line:84%
and with the commitment
to love over judgment.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:54.750 align:middle line:84%
This hero's journey is depicted
also in the unison note

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.940 align:middle line:84%
that then we could
see the circle that

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.710 align:middle line:84%
extends from the
base of the pyramid

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:01.830 align:middle line:84%
to the apex of the pyramid,
and the base of the pyramid

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:04.920 align:middle line:84%
being the same length of
that circle's circumference.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.430 align:middle line:84%
When we inscribe within
that circle the square,

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.990 align:middle line:84%
that meets at the
apex and at the base

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:14.910 align:middle line:84%
and then at the sides of
the circle that perform

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.850 align:middle line:90%
that same aspect relationship.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:22.140 align:middle line:84%
We'll find the square root of 2,
giving us the diminished fifth

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.970 align:middle line:90%
and the augmented fourth.

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:28.830 align:middle line:84%
But also it's giving us the
path of the hero's journey.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.210 align:middle line:90%
We are born into separation.

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:33.840 align:middle line:84%
As we are born
into separation, we

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:38.280 align:middle line:84%
experience what we refer to
as the seven deadly sins.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And then we learn
the seven virtues,

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:47.710 align:middle line:84%
the 14 aspects of duality,
bringing us back to that missing

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:52.120 align:middle line:84%
1/14 at the very end that
represents the ascension

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:55.280 align:middle line:84%
of Orion as a true
constellation,

00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:01.690 align:middle line:84%
along with Ophiuchus,
its shadow consciousness.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:04.300 align:middle line:84%
The challenge of
the hero's journey

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:08.620 align:middle line:84%
is to learn to fully integrate
the shadow of awareness.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Ophiuchus is the serpent
bearer, and Ophiuchus

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:15.790 align:middle line:84%
is depicted in a
painting referred

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:21.130 align:middle line:84%
to as Bacchus by Leonardo
da Vinci, yet again.

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:23.840 align:middle line:84%
This painting is a
subject of great mystery,

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:29.050 align:middle line:84%
for the painting was actually
edited and changed in the 18th

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:30.190 align:middle line:90%
century.

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.580 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that was
painted over on this lap

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:39.340 align:middle line:84%
was the look of a leopard skin,
when actually the original very

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:42.250 align:middle line:84%
likely looked more
like a python skin,

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:48.540 align:middle line:84%
a snake on the lap of the
sitting god Dionysus or Bacchus,

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:49.800 align:middle line:90%
the god of wine.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:54.720 align:middle line:84%
What we also notice is a very
prominent staff next to him,

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.000 align:middle line:90%
to his left.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And the staff represents
the rod or staff

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:03.020 align:middle line:90%
of Hermes, the Rod of Asclepius.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:07.070 align:middle line:84%
This is a prominent symbology
in healing and centers

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:09.170 align:middle line:84%
of healing all
around the world--

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:13.520 align:middle line:84%
that somehow, the snake
intertwined around the staff

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.090 align:middle line:84%
or rod is a representation
to our Kundalini life force.

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Coming up, the chachuna,
the Ida and Pingala,

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:23.390 align:middle line:84%
sometimes represented
as a single snake

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:25.820 align:middle line:84%
in the Rod of Asclepius
and sometimes represented

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:29.340 align:middle line:84%
as two snakes in the staff
of Hermes, or the Caduceus,

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:30.740 align:middle line:90%
as it's also known.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:35.840 align:middle line:84%
We see a very light demeanor
on the face of Bacchus.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.310 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't seem to
be stressed at all.

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:41.130 align:middle line:84%
He, in fact, looks
somewhat happy-go-lucky.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:44.360 align:middle line:84%
But we'll notice that
in the vista behind him,

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.870 align:middle line:90%
there seems to be a river.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:49.210 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
river is the Nile.

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And we can find the head of a
crocodile prominently displayed

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:55.840 align:middle line:90%
towards his right.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.170 align:middle line:84%
This large head of crocodile
has a smaller crocodile

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:01.600 align:middle line:84%
in the snout of the
crocodile as well.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And directly behind this
tree that, in its leaves,

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.630 align:middle line:90%
the symbol of infinity--

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:09.890 align:middle line:90%
the number 8 on its side.

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:12.310 align:middle line:84%
As we go up the
river further, we

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:17.470 align:middle line:84%
find a symbology of a lion
laying down in the same format

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.480 align:middle line:90%
and stance as the Sphinx.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:25.210 align:middle line:84%
This is supposedly representing
the head of Khafre.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:27.550 align:middle line:84%
In addition to
this, we see, down

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:31.250 align:middle line:84%
towards the feet of Bacchus,
we can find a scorpion.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:34.090 align:middle line:84%
This is not something
that is very surprising.

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:39.320 align:middle line:10%
In the range in between
Scorpio and Sagittarius,

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.850 align:middle line:10%
we know that the scorpion
sits right directly

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:46.710 align:middle line:10%
at the feet of Ophiuchus,
which is also interesting

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:50.610 align:middle line:10%
because the story of Orion
being stung at the feet

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:54.390 align:middle line:10%
by the scorpion and then
experiencing the ego death

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:56.370 align:middle line:10%
is interesting because
he's completely

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:58.530 align:middle line:10%
on the opposite side of the sky.

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, it was
the shadow of Orion

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.110 align:middle line:90%
that was stung at the feet.

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:07.680 align:middle line:84%
In addition, we'll notice
that Ophiuchus is not

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.760 align:middle line:90%
sitting on a chair or a rock.

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.910 align:middle line:84%
It seems as though
he's sitting on top

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:15.560 align:middle line:84%
of the back of a demon, which
we could see the face of right

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.360 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.830 align:middle line:10%
Additionally, we can see the
lines of the scorpion's back.

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:24.820 align:middle line:10%
And right by the tail, we
notice the letters Aleph Tav,

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.480 align:middle line:10%
Alpha Tau.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.860 align:middle line:10%
Aleph Tav in Hebrew is
a representation again

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.360 align:middle line:10%
of the alpha and the omega.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.000 align:middle line:84%
If we look towards
the right, we'll

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.850 align:middle line:84%
notice another demon
standing over the shoulder

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:41.980 align:middle line:90%
of Ophiuchus, Asclepius.

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And from there, we can
notice that one of the demons

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:50.910 align:middle line:84%
even has his hand on the
shoulder of Ophiuchus.

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Immediately adjacent
to this demon

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:57.720 align:middle line:84%
is appearing to be the
head of an elephant.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.230 align:middle line:10%
Is this a representation
of something

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:03.840 align:middle line:10%
that's calling a reference
to ward the Hierophant

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.140 align:middle line:10%
card in Tarot?

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:09.450 align:middle line:10%
The elephant rhyming
with Hierophant.

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Further, if we go up directly
above the head of the Ophiuchus,

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.590 align:middle line:84%
we see the shape
of Corona Borealis,

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:20.010 align:middle line:84%
another prominent
constellation that

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:24.990 align:middle line:84%
represents the crown in the
form and shape of the beehive.

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Further, we also notice,
towards the upper right,

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:32.220 align:middle line:84%
we can see the remains
of the skull of a bull,

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:38.160 align:middle line:84%
seemingly representing the death
of the ego of the opposite sign

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:45.170 align:middle line:84%
of Ophiuchus, which is Orion,
the Taurus, the Apis bull.

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Does this represent the death
of the ego of the bull, where

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:55.110 align:middle line:84%
now Orion enters
into a new stage,

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:59.100 align:middle line:84%
no longer desiring to be
the womanizer and hunter?

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:04.400 align:middle line:84%
All of this pointing us to
this notion of the Ophiuchus--

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Asclepius, who
brought healing wisdom

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:11.390 align:middle line:84%
by igniting the Kundalini
life force and the feathered

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:14.360 align:middle line:84%
serpents to ascend
up the sushumna

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:20.570 align:middle line:84%
and form the wings of the staff
of Hermes, the angelic form.

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:25.910 align:middle line:84%
The moment that through the
wisdom of Thoth, Asclepius,

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Ophiuchus, Orion is ready to
now ascend into his angelic form

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:36.530 align:middle line:84%
in the angel Metatron,
the lesser Yahweh.

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.580 align:middle line:10%
