00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.510 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid is the most
studied structure on planet

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:33.800 align:middle line:84%
Earth, with over 6.5 million
tons of granite and limestone,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.340 align:middle line:90%
a 13-acre footprint.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.950 align:middle line:90%
It is missing its pyramidion.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.450 align:middle line:84%
It stands 455 feet high
without the pyramidion.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And with it, it would
stand 481.285 feet.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.550 align:middle line:84%
This structure has
been more studied

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.060 align:middle line:90%
than any other structure.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.320 align:middle line:90%
It has been measured.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.700 align:middle line:90%
It has been analyzed.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.900 align:middle line:84%
It has been viewed from
all kinds of oscilloscopes,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.780 align:middle line:84%
as well as every kind of
electromagnetic interference

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.790 align:middle line:90%
measurement known to man.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And yet, so much is still
yet hidden within its walls.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.550 align:middle line:84%
I decided to create an
entire game environment

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.510 align:middle line:84%
from virtual reality,
by taking LiDAR images

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and stitching them
together to make

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.290 align:middle line:84%
the inside of the Great Pyramid
in this new virtual environment.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.220 align:middle line:84%
Come along with me
in this journey,

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.280 align:middle line:84%
into this great simulation
that we constructed

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.275 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Pyramid.

00:01:35.275 --> 00:01:37.850 align:middle line:90%


00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Here we are, standing
in the Grand Gallery

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.020 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.700 align:middle line:84%
This chamber has a very
distinctive feeling

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.120 align:middle line:84%
and a concentration of
energy, particularly

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.570 align:middle line:84%
at the point I'm
standing at. right here.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Right in front of me
is the great step.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.430 align:middle line:84%
This exact spot, in
fact, is precisely

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.260 align:middle line:84%
under the apex of
the Great Pyramid,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.580 align:middle line:84%
above the millions
of tons of stone

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.550 align:middle line:84%
all the way up to this
apex, taking us to what

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.410 align:middle line:90%
would have been 481 feet high.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Imagine the energy
coming down to this spot,

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.380 align:middle line:84%
concentrating in this one place,
and representing this great

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.950 align:middle line:84%
alchemical journey,
a hero's journey,

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.710 align:middle line:84%
that brought us to this
point in time right now,

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.490 align:middle line:84%
just as it did Leonardo da
Vinci in the late 15th century.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.250 align:middle line:10%
Now, right here
around us, as we look

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.150 align:middle line:10%
at the structure of this very,
very large, elongated room,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.960 align:middle line:10%
we'll notice the
corbelled walls that

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.890 align:middle line:10%
converge right at the ceiling.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And as those corbels
connect up at the top,

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.260 align:middle line:84%
we recognize as well the
metaphor in relationship

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.730 align:middle line:84%
to our chakra system and the
notes, the white keys on a piano

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.720 align:middle line:84%
keyboard, that take
us through the octave,

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:13.300 align:middle line:84%
as we go from A, B, C, D, E,
F, G, and A, and all the way

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.610 align:middle line:90%
back down again.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, as we contemplate what's
behind us, the entrance

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.030 align:middle line:84%
to the King's Chamber, something
called the anti-chamber.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.960 align:middle line:84%
When Leonardo da
Vinci came here,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.010 align:middle line:84%
he described it as
being a place where

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.340 align:middle line:84%
he had to place his right
hand over his right knee

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.680 align:middle line:84%
and his left hand over his brow
as he wobbled back and forth

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.130 align:middle line:84%
because the height of this crawl
space is approximately 1 meter.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And he felt this
incredible feeling

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.240 align:middle line:84%
of both desire and
fear, desire to know

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.340 align:middle line:84%
what might be within this
dark cavern, this dark room

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:04.390 align:middle line:84%
and chamber, and fear of
also what might be within it.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And as we pass through
this crawl space,

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.855 align:middle line:84%
we enter into the
King's Chamber.

00:04:09.855 --> 00:04:12.430 align:middle line:90%


00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.279 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to the King's Chamber
of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:22.840 align:middle line:84%
This is the most studied room
in the most studied building

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.080 align:middle line:90%
on all of planet Earth.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.030 align:middle line:84%
The structure of this room is
enigmatic in and of itself.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:38.240 align:middle line:84%
The perimeter of the room
is exactly 31.415926 meters.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:45.370 align:middle line:84%
You might recognize that number
as being pi times 10 meters.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.950 align:middle line:84%
It also has a
length of 20 cubits.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.990 align:middle line:90%
Each cubit being 1.718 feet.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And its width is 10
cubits, so it's a 2 to 1

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.430 align:middle line:90%
ratio of a rectangle.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.460 align:middle line:84%
We'll also notice that there's
only one piece of furniture

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.170 align:middle line:90%
in the entire room.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And that one piece is the
rose granite sarcophagus,

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:17.920 align:middle line:84%
the composition of which
is 55% rose quartz.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.340 align:middle line:10%
It's basically a
crystal box, that

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:29.200 align:middle line:10%
is 89.62 inches long
and 38.5 inches wide.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.520 align:middle line:84%
We can also note that each
of the blocks of the King's

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Chamber, of which they
number 144, are irregular,

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.200 align:middle line:84%
they have different
x, y, and z-axes.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.140 align:middle line:84%
It's quite a mystery,
just to understand

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.200 align:middle line:84%
why the builders would
have taken such effort

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.270 align:middle line:84%
and care to make each block
entirely irregular in all three

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.290 align:middle line:90%
axes.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.900 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the mystery
of the air shafts

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.800 align:middle line:84%
that don't really connect
to the outside air.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.030 align:middle line:84%
One of the air shafts sits next
to the entrance by about 8 feet,

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.920 align:middle line:90%
along the northern wall.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:16.230 align:middle line:84%
The other is exactly opposite
it on the southern wall.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.970 align:middle line:84%
What is the purpose
of these air shafts

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.260 align:middle line:84%
if they don't connect
to the outer structure

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.040 align:middle line:84%
to bring fresh air into
the King's Chamber?

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.490 align:middle line:84%
The floor to ceiling
height is also enigmatic

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:35.100 align:middle line:84%
because it does not match a
perfect cube representation.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:43.560 align:middle line:84%
The floor to ceiling height
is 11.18 cubits, or 19.2 feet.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.050 align:middle line:84%
But the height of
the floor to ceiling

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.680 align:middle line:84%
does give it a
more grand feeling.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.120 align:middle line:84%
The resident of the
chamber is also enigmatic.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.830 align:middle line:84%
The sarcophagus will
resonate at 117 hertz that

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.440 align:middle line:84%
relates, we believe, to the
fine-structure constant,

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.500 align:middle line:84%
the veritable separation between
light and darkness of 137.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.890 align:middle line:90%
137 square root is 11.7.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:16.470 align:middle line:84%
117 Hz is the exact
resonance frequency

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.170 align:middle line:90%
of the sarcophagus itself.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.710 align:middle line:84%
137, it is the
foundational basis

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.460 align:middle line:84%
of the God particle,
the Higgs boson.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:32.500 align:middle line:84%
137 is the number that is known
as a mathematical constant,

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.560 align:middle line:90%
and in physics as alpha.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.750 align:middle line:90%
Alpha, as in alpha and omega.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:45.570 align:middle line:84%
137, which has a unique
relationship as well

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:49.630 align:middle line:84%
to the sarcophagus when
we lay it on its side,

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:56.100 align:middle line:84%
will stack 137 times against
the volume of the overall King's

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.960 align:middle line:90%
Chamber.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And the square root of
137 is 11.7, or 11.7,

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:10.270 align:middle line:84%
also matching the
Great Pyramid's base

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:18.080 align:middle line:84%
to height ratio, which is 7 over
11, height over the full base.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.120 align:middle line:84%
As we look throughout
the rest of this room,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.440 align:middle line:84%
we'll notice that one of the
more enigmatic features that was

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:30.400 align:middle line:84%
discovered in May of 2018 by
myself is that 33rd inch along

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.750 align:middle line:84%
the back side of
the sarcophagus,

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:36.520 align:middle line:84%
or what we would say
is the southwest side

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:41.080 align:middle line:84%
of the sarcophagus,
is the alpha-omega.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:45.760 align:middle line:10%
The alpha-omega, which
is 5.605 inches in width

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.250 align:middle line:10%
is, again, matching
this reference

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:53.380 align:middle line:10%
to the perimeter value in
meters because the square root

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:59.740 align:middle line:10%
of 10 times pi is 5.605.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:04.510 align:middle line:84%
As we look around the room,
one of the very first things

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:08.390 align:middle line:84%
that we might
notice is seemingly

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.960 align:middle line:84%
something etched
into the north wall.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.260 align:middle line:84%
The first discovery
that we made along

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.560 align:middle line:84%
the north wall of
the King's Chamber

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:23.180 align:middle line:84%
is the Apis bull, which
is exactly a reference

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:29.360 align:middle line:84%
to the alpha or aleph, as it's
referred to, which means bull.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.500 align:middle line:84%
The reference to the Apis
bull or great bull of the west

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.230 align:middle line:84%
is something that is
very prominent throughout

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:39.350 align:middle line:90%
Egyptian history and mythology.

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.230 align:middle line:84%
The great bull of the
west and bull mountain

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:46.640 align:middle line:84%
are referencing the
House of Osiris.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.650 align:middle line:84%
We know Osiris also as
the Orion constellation.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And as we look at
this bull, we can

00:09:54.950 --> 00:10:02.870 align:middle line:84%
recognize that the bull
has a diamond-shaped figure

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:09.380 align:middle line:84%
over its heart, and another that
seems to be inverted beneath it.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.110 align:middle line:84%
The bull also has
characteristics

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:14.300 align:middle line:84%
where we could see
its horns, and it

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.850 align:middle line:84%
seems to take on a look
that's similar to some

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:21.110 align:middle line:84%
of the cave paintings
that are found in France,

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:26.990 align:middle line:84%
that date all the way back to
many tens of thousands of years.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:30.470 align:middle line:84%
We'll also notice that
around the bull is a larger

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:35.880 align:middle line:84%
cow, possibly a reference to the
Hathor, the mother of the Apis

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.680 align:middle line:90%
bull.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.650 align:middle line:84%
In the mythology,
the Apis bull has

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:44.810 align:middle line:84%
to sacrifice himself to
subsume and be subsumed back

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:49.220 align:middle line:84%
into the mother Hathor
by and through the death

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:53.270 align:middle line:90%
of his egoic experience in mind.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.610 align:middle line:84%
As we look around
the room, we also

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:59.780 align:middle line:84%
notice that on the west
wall of the King's Chamber,

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:03.140 align:middle line:90%
we see the face of a lion.

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And also on the south
wall, immediately

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:11.910 align:middle line:84%
across from where we find
the Apis bull and the Hathor,

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:18.540 align:middle line:84%
we can also see a scorpion,
as well as a snake, and a man.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.880 align:middle line:10%
This man
representation, we find,

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:26.060 align:middle line:10%
is actually a representation
etched into the stone of what is

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:31.130 align:middle line:10%
often referred to as the 13th
Zodiac sign of Ophiuchus,

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:36.230 align:middle line:10%
Ophiuchus, Asclepion,
even Thoth.

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:42.230 align:middle line:84%
As we look at the east wall
across from the sarcophagus,

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:48.980 align:middle line:84%
we can see the outline of a
woman riding a winged horse.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:53.450 align:middle line:84%
The winged horse
is a representation

00:11:53.450 --> 00:12:00.680 align:middle line:84%
of Pegasus, the woman, the
representation of Delphinus.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And additionally, she's
shooting a bow and arrow.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And the bow and arrow
representing Sagitta.

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:12.380 align:middle line:84%
The arrow pointed directly
to with a prominent arrowhead

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:20.510 align:middle line:84%
being very visible, the akela,
a large eagle or thunderbird.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:26.870 align:middle line:84%
These, we might recognize are
all astronomical constellations

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:29.100 align:middle line:90%
representing Capricorn.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:34.460 align:middle line:84%
We can now see that all
of the 12 Zodiac signs

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:38.720 align:middle line:84%
are represented with all
of the walls in precisely

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.110 align:middle line:90%
the correct locations.

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:48.050 align:middle line:84%
The deacon of astrology are
36 different astronomical

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:52.070 align:middle line:84%
constellations that fit
within each Zodiac sign,

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:55.310 align:middle line:84%
including the Orion
constellation,

00:12:55.310 --> 00:13:01.640 align:middle line:84%
also become visible to us
and to our perspective.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.880 align:middle line:84%
How did these etchings
appear into these walls?

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Why are they
seemingly so damaged?

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.970 align:middle line:84%
Why is it so difficult
for us to perceive these,

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:19.690 align:middle line:84%
but now only now able to
see them with the naked eye?

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.660 align:middle line:84%
Why has this not been
discovered before?

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:26.050 align:middle line:84%
As we go around the
room and we notice

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:31.630 align:middle line:84%
that all of the 48 in total
constellations at the time

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:35.050 align:middle line:90%
of Ptolemy are represented.

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And that the deacon of
astrology are, in fact,

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:44.050 align:middle line:84%
the calendrical deacon that were
represented in the Atlantean

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:46.060 align:middle line:90%
calendar.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.970 align:middle line:84%
It starts to raise
significant questions

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:54.370 align:middle line:84%
as to what the purpose
of this room actually is.

00:13:54.370 --> 00:14:01.750 align:middle line:84%
Why also does it take on
this 2 to 1 rectangular form.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:06.130 align:middle line:84%
One of the possible answers
to this question might be that

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:10.180 align:middle line:84%
as we traverse through
our 24,000-year precession

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:16.990 align:middle line:84%
of equinox, our North Star
position changes from star

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:21.130 align:middle line:84%
to star every 6,000
years, approximately.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.380 align:middle line:90%
Currently, it's Polaris.

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Polaris is in the
constellation of Ursa Minor.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.480 align:middle line:84%
But 6,000 years ago
it was in Thuban.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.810 align:middle line:90%
And Thuban was our North Star.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:38.350 align:middle line:84%
Thuban is part of the
Draco's constellation.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:44.260 align:middle line:10%
We can find both Ursa Minor, as
well as the Draco constellation

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.770 align:middle line:10%
along the north wall.

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:52.720 align:middle line:84%
But 6,000 years before that, or
approximately 12,000 years ago,

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.240 align:middle line:84%
it was Vega, in the
Lyra constellation,

00:14:55.240 --> 00:15:01.910 align:middle line:84%
also found on the north wall,
above a face, which face,

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:05.500 align:middle line:84%
we believe to be that
of Orion himself.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, Cygnus
constellation housing within it

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:18.160 align:middle line:84%
the star Deneb, which would have
been our North Star 24,000 years

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.960 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.890 align:middle line:84%
Is this perhaps going to
become our North Star again?

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:25.810 align:middle line:84%
As we look into the
night sky, we'll

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:28.180 align:middle line:84%
notice that all
four of those stars

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:32.410 align:middle line:84%
together take the
orientation of a 2 to 1

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:36.490 align:middle line:84%
rectangle matching that
of the King's Chamber.

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:40.720 align:middle line:10%
We'll also note that
the original position

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:44.260 align:middle line:10%
of the sarcophagus,
we strongly believe

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.780 align:middle line:10%
to have been the center of
this room and structure,

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:51.370 align:middle line:10%
because even the
Orion constellation

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:57.250 align:middle line:10%
itself takes on the same 2 to
1 rectangular form and shape,

00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:00.610 align:middle line:10%
with the three belt
stars exactly being

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:06.310 align:middle line:10%
framed by the proportional
structure of the sarcophagus.

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:11.320 align:middle line:84%
What was in the sarcophagus
still remains a mystery.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Some believe that there may
have been a mummy inside it

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.550 align:middle line:84%
at one point, although
one was never found.

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Others believe that
this might actually

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:26.100 align:middle line:84%
be the place where the Ark
of the Covenant was held,

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.920 align:middle line:90%
before Moses took it out.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And the astronomical
symbols of the Zodiac

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:34.920 align:middle line:84%
all being prominent
flags and standards

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.320 align:middle line:84%
represented by the
children of Israel

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.640 align:middle line:84%
in the encampment
of the tabernacle,

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:44.100 align:middle line:84%
each representing the four
faces of the four walls--

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:51.090 align:middle line:84%
the face of a man, the face
of an ox, the face of a lion,

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:53.700 align:middle line:90%
and the face of an eagle.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.220 align:middle line:84%
These are the four
faces represented

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.680 align:middle line:84%
in the Book of Ezekiel,
for the children

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.050 align:middle line:90%
of Israel and their encampment.

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Are the airshafts,
one being exactly

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:08.490 align:middle line:84%
at the position of Aries,
and the other airshaft

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:12.839 align:middle line:84%
being immediately across
from it on the south wall

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:16.170 align:middle line:90%
in the position of Sagittarius.

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:20.190 align:middle line:84%
The beginning of the
Zodiac happens in Aries.

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:26.369 align:middle line:84%
Is this telling us that this
is the beginning of the clock?

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:31.770 align:middle line:84%
This zodiacal representation
along all of these walls

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:36.360 align:middle line:84%
is possibly pointing
us to another purpose

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:40.140 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid,
and in particular,

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:45.090 align:middle line:84%
what the King's Chamber might
have actually been used for.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:48.030 align:middle line:84%
Many people that have
spent time in this chamber

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:51.180 align:middle line:84%
have left it
irrevocably changed.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:55.050 align:middle line:84%
We know this with Julius
Caesar and the likes

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:59.850 align:middle line:84%
of Alexander the Great, as
well as Napoleon himself.

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:03.750 align:middle line:84%
What caused them to go through
this irrevocable change

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:08.070 align:middle line:84%
and shift, where they no longer
wanted to conquer anymore.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And in the case of Napoleon,
he turned into a mathematician

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.680 align:middle line:84%
who wanted to spend
the rest of his days

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.650 align:middle line:90%
in his scientific pursuits.

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:22.050 align:middle line:84%
Is the King's Chamber
telling us something more,

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:26.130 align:middle line:84%
that if the sarcophagus is in
the right position at its center

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:29.460 align:middle line:84%
point, covering the
three belt stars,

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:34.390 align:middle line:84%
and we look around the room with
each block having a different x,

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:40.050 align:middle line:84%
y, z-axis, and each having
a different constellation

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:45.480 align:middle line:84%
associated and tied to it,
the 144 blocks tying together

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.020 align:middle line:90%
to the 48 constellations.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.260 align:middle line:84%
We have to ask
ourselves the question,

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.340 align:middle line:84%
is the King's
Chamber a stargate?

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:59.490 align:middle line:90%


00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:05.580 align:middle line:84%
The King's Chamber has
represented for many people

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:12.390 align:middle line:84%
the notion of finding within
our own personal sovereignty,

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:17.220 align:middle line:84%
entering into a new
paradigm, being kinged

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.440 align:middle line:90%
by the King's Chamber.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.500 align:middle line:10%
In the last season, we
introduced the notion

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.530 align:middle line:10%
that Leonardo da Vinci had
encrypted the King's Chamber

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.290 align:middle line:10%
into the Last Supper.

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:32.880 align:middle line:10%
We found exactly
the same eye of Ra

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:37.210 align:middle line:10%
on the back wall of the Western
Wall of the King's Chamber,

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:40.380 align:middle line:10%
in precisely the same location.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:44.550 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the Last Supper
painting and the King's Chamber,

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:49.350 align:middle line:84%
another thing really stands out
as being so vitally important.

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:52.890 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned before that the
perimeter of the King's Chamber

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:57.300 align:middle line:90%
is precisely pi times 10 meters.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.240 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
about this is the 2 to 1

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:04.230 align:middle line:84%
relationship that we
find of length to width.

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:07.440 align:middle line:84%
As we look at the
Last Supper painting,

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.830 align:middle line:84%
one other thing
truly stands out.

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:15.740 align:middle line:84%
The position of the
observer is standing exactly

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:19.670 align:middle line:90%
within the Age of Aquarius.

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:22.940 align:middle line:84%
More than 500
years ago, Leonardo

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:28.320 align:middle line:84%
encrypted this perspective for
us as observers in the future,

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.450 align:middle line:84%
to be able to see and
recognize the next stage

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:35.060 align:middle line:90%
of our conscious evolution.

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:41.150 align:middle line:84%
But the great mystery still
stands within the Vitruvian Man.

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:44.870 align:middle line:84%
In the upper left hand
corner, the word Aon

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:48.110 align:middle line:84%
is the notable
anagram that we find.

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Aon represents finding
the divinity of the Aon

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:57.170 align:middle line:90%
avatar of the Aquarian age.

00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:59.420 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
we are going

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:05.000 align:middle line:84%
to show you the manifestation
of what this means for each

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.200 align:middle line:84%
and every one of us, and the
dramatic shift that is in store

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.530 align:middle line:90%
for humanity as a result.

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:16.000 align:middle line:90%
