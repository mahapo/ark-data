00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
Vitruvian Man again.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo da Vinci left us
this enigmatic encryption

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.350 align:middle line:84%
in which we've already
found very strong,

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.970 align:middle line:84%
pointing indications to
the Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.850 align:middle line:84%
We also found within it, in
the upper right-hand corner,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.750 align:middle line:84%
the number 126, which transforms
the major third in music

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.780 align:middle line:84%
and just tuning
into a viable tuning

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.700 align:middle line:84%
standard of absolute
perfection geometrically.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.010 align:middle line:84%
We call this precise
temperament tuning.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was directly related
to the Cube of Delos

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.580 align:middle line:84%
and doubling a cube,
because that's the ratio

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.890 align:middle line:84%
that you must expand the side of
a cube by to double its volume,

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.830 align:middle line:84%
allowing us to know
double octaves perfectly.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.950 align:middle line:84%
What else did we find
inside the Vitruvian Man?

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.340 align:middle line:10%
We also found that each
of the horizontal lines

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.340 align:middle line:10%
within the Vitruvian Man
that were left deliberately

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.360 align:middle line:10%
by Leonardo point us directly
to each chamber at the floor

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.200 align:middle line:10%
level that already exists
within the Great Pyramid,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.570 align:middle line:10%
both at the subterranean chamber
as well as at the ground level,

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.170 align:middle line:10%
all the way up to the
King's Chamber and inclusive

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.680 align:middle line:10%
of the Queen's Chamber, pointing
us also to other chambers

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.580 align:middle line:10%
that are yet to be
discovered but already known

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.420 align:middle line:10%
that the next one exists.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.990 align:middle line:10%
Due to the Scan Pyramid
Project that occurred in 2017,

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.169 align:middle line:10%
we know that right next
to the throat chakra line

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:13.930 align:middle line:10%
that da Vinci left us is a new
chamber yet to be discovered.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.960 align:middle line:84%
We, internally, amongst
our own research team,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.390 align:middle line:84%
have called that
particular chamber

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.100 align:middle line:84%
the Chamber of Theodoras
at the throat chakra.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.390 align:middle line:84%
It is preceded, we believe,
by an ascending passage

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.000 align:middle line:84%
that we've also lovingly
named the Magnum Opus Chamber

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.485 align:middle line:90%
or Magnum Opus Gallery.

00:02:36.485 --> 00:02:39.670 align:middle line:90%


00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.090 align:middle line:84%
We believe that we are now on
the precipice of a major shift

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.490 align:middle line:84%
in human awareness
and consciousness,

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.140 align:middle line:84%
that that shift
in human awareness

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.040 align:middle line:84%
is coming principally because
of our own realization

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.170 align:middle line:84%
and remembrance of who we are
as a species, as an individual,

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.290 align:middle line:90%
and collectively.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Science and spirituality are not
juxtaposed against each other

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.160 align:middle line:84%
in this new world but
rather, complementary.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.690 align:middle line:90%
One serves the other.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And in order to achieve higher
degrees of understanding

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.580 align:middle line:84%
and awareness in science
and mathematics, the queen

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.030 align:middle line:84%
of the sciences,
that the answers lie

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:26.520 align:middle line:84%
within through our own
spiritual conscious expansion.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.160 align:middle line:10%
One of the things that
is really powerful to me,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.170 align:middle line:10%
when I looked at
the Vitruvian Man,

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.750 align:middle line:10%
was to understand why Leonardo
left us the square that he

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.930 align:middle line:10%
did if we assume that the radius
is one unit of his circle.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Then the value for the
circle's area is pi r squared.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.180 align:middle line:84%
So 1 times 1, r
squared, times pi

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:03.690 align:middle line:84%
would yield a value in
the area of 3.1415926535.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it's
an infinite value

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.270 align:middle line:84%
called a transcendental
irrational number.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:16.470 align:middle line:84%
But if we look at the square
value area that he drew,

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:25.770 align:middle line:84%
the value actually comes
out to be 2.718281828, also

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.680 align:middle line:84%
a transcendental
irrational value.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.710 align:middle line:84%
You might recognize
that number as being

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.620 align:middle line:84%
the transcendental
mathematical constant

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.620 align:middle line:90%
called the Euler number.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Euler is the value that
determines all limitation

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.500 align:middle line:90%
on all wave propagation.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.800 align:middle line:84%
It determines compound
interest growth.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.750 align:middle line:10%
It determines all
exponential growth

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.110 align:middle line:10%
in the universe and
natural logarithms.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.860 align:middle line:10%
This is a very, very
important number that

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.070 align:middle line:10%
was discovered by Isaac Newton.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.330 align:middle line:10%
But wait.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.430 align:middle line:10%
Here for more than 200 years
inside one enigmatic piece

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.000 align:middle line:10%
of art, Leonardo
da Vinci left us

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.270 align:middle line:10%
the value of the
Euler number hidden

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:21.870 align:middle line:10%
inside of his disproportionate
square and circle.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Actually, you could
make an argument

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.510 align:middle line:84%
that his value
area for Euler is,

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.870 align:middle line:84%
in fact, the correct
value for the square,

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.430 align:middle line:84%
because both Euler and
pi combined together

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.290 align:middle line:84%
to form the number
3, the simplicity

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.680 align:middle line:90%
of the equilateral triangle.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.210 align:middle line:90%
Here's how.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:54.360 align:middle line:84%
Pi multiplied by 2/3 plus
Euler multiplied by 1/3

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.505 align:middle line:90%
equals the integer 3.

00:05:56.505 --> 00:05:59.060 align:middle line:90%


00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:05.600 align:middle line:10%
So Leonardo gave us a square
that has the value of Euler

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:12.290 align:middle line:10%
and also gave us a circle
that has the value of pi.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.860 align:middle line:10%
Is he pointing to
this triangle that's

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.810 align:middle line:10%
hidden between the
combination of the two,

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.230 align:middle line:10%
flanking the number
and integer 3?

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.880 align:middle line:10%
I believe that he is, and I
believe that triangle directly

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:33.780 align:middle line:10%
represents the introduction
of the hidden divine.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.840 align:middle line:84%
The integer 3 is a
very powerful number

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.020 align:middle line:84%
on so many levels
representing so many

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:45.830 align:middle line:84%
different esoteric, mystical,
and spiritual meanings,

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.980 align:middle line:84%
the most important
of which has to be

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.165 align:middle line:90%
the notion of the Trinity.

00:06:50.165 --> 00:06:53.060 align:middle line:90%


00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.730 align:middle line:84%
But what else is da Vinci
trying to tell us here?

00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:01.310 align:middle line:84%
For if we raise the square to
the center of the circle, well,

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.570 align:middle line:84%
we notice that the exact
location of a centered square

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:09.230 align:middle line:84%
over that circle
reveals the location

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:14.330 align:middle line:84%
of a pentagon inscribed within
the circle inscribed also

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.550 align:middle line:90%
within a hexagon.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:21.050 align:middle line:84%
For the centered square
over the same circle

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.400 align:middle line:84%
will also inform another
circle exoscribed around it

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.890 align:middle line:84%
that will be
identical in position

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:32.870 align:middle line:84%
to a hexagon inscribed
within that outer circle.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:38.650 align:middle line:84%
Where else can we see this
notion of 5 and 6 yet again?

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.970 align:middle line:84%
On the Great Pyramid
and its construction,

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:46.480 align:middle line:84%
including the use of the foot,
the cubit, and the meter.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And you'll recall that all three
of those units of measure sum

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.360 align:middle line:90%
to the number 6.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And when we subtract 1 foot from
it, we are at the value of 5.

00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:02.200 align:middle line:10%
And 6 feet minus the
Euler number of 2.718

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:08.860 align:middle line:10%
is magically yielding us an
exact value for the meter.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.530 align:middle line:10%
I thought the meter
was only something that

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.990 align:middle line:10%
was brought to us by
the French sometime

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.540 align:middle line:10%
in the late 18th century.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:21.400 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, it has been known
for much, much longer.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.690 align:middle line:10%
For, as we saw in the King's
Chamber, the perimeter

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:32.350 align:middle line:10%
of the King's Chamber itself is
precisely pi times 10 meters.

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And the entrance into the King's
Chamber is also 1 meter high.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.630 align:middle line:90%
Coincidence?

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:44.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in
coincidences anymore.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:45.980 align:middle line:84%
As we look more deeply
into this, however,

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.790 align:middle line:84%
we'll notice one other thing
sticks out dramatically.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And that is that the
association of the 5 and 6

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:59.030 align:middle line:84%
is most closely associated
with one Platonic geometry

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.870 align:middle line:90%
in particular.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Platonic geometries are the
following, the tetrahedron,

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:11.890 align:middle line:84%
which looks like a triangle
in third-dimensional form.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.650 align:middle line:10%
Then we move on to the cube.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:17.710 align:middle line:10%
The cube, of course,
is simply the cube

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:23.920 align:middle line:10%
with a sum of angles of 2,160
degrees, the tetrahedron having

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.800 align:middle line:10%
720 degrees.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Then we go on to the
next Platonic solid,

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.710 align:middle line:84%
which will be the
octahedron, having a sum

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:36.790 align:middle line:90%
of angles of 1,440 degrees.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:41.860 align:middle line:10%
And then on to the next, which
is the icosahedron, which

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.790 align:middle line:10%
has 20 sides of 180
degrees each, bringing

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:53.770 align:middle line:10%
the total of the angular
interior sum to 3,600 degrees,

00:09:53.770 --> 00:10:00.850 align:middle line:10%
a unification of the circle
at 10 times 360 degrees.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And then rounding out
the Platonic solids,

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:07.960 align:middle line:84%
we have the
dodecahedron which has

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:12.100 align:middle line:90%
12 sides, each being pentagons.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:20.810 align:middle line:10%
And the sum of angles of the
dodecahedron is 6,480 degrees.

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, the icosahedron
holds a very special place

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:29.110 align:middle line:84%
and a direct relationship to
this notion of the 5 and 6.

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:31.600 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it
is made exclusively

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:38.680 align:middle line:84%
of equilateral triangles, this
divine form of the number 3.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.640 align:middle line:10%
And yet when we look
at the icosahedron,

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:48.040 align:middle line:10%
we can see it very directly
as either a pentagonal form,

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:53.140 align:middle line:10%
or we will see it
as a hexagonal form.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:57.580 align:middle line:84%
In this one Platonic solid,
we can shift our perspectives

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:02.410 align:middle line:84%
simply and easily
transitioning from pentagon

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:06.070 align:middle line:84%
in three-dimensional
form to hexagon

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:08.600 align:middle line:90%
in three-dimensional form.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:13.580 align:middle line:84%
It's a fascinating structure
upon which so much in the world

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.130 align:middle line:90%
is predicated.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:20.510 align:middle line:10%
The world is mainly
covered in water,

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:25.850 align:middle line:10%
and our bodies are also mainly
water with more than 70%

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:30.710 align:middle line:10%
of our bodies comprised
of water, H2O,

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:35.090 align:middle line:10%
with a beautiful angle that
connects the two oxygen

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:41.210 align:middle line:10%
molecules onto the
hydrogen at 108 degrees.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Our world would not exist
as a life-sustaining planet

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:51.870 align:middle line:84%
without the advent
of the icosahedron.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:56.820 align:middle line:84%
The icosahedron is the
representation not only

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:02.220 align:middle line:84%
anciently, but today
of water clusters.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:05.220 align:middle line:10%
It was known and believed
back in the days of Plato

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:09.660 align:middle line:10%
that water was the form and
structure of icosahedron.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.800 align:middle line:90%


00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Not only is water that form
in shape, so is our DNA.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Our DNA is built up of pentagons
merging and abutting up

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.890 align:middle line:90%
against hexagon forms.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:32.300 align:middle line:84%
In fact, all nucleotide
pair relationships

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.950 align:middle line:90%
are the exact same thing.

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And nucleotide pairs are
the foundational basis

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:42.590 align:middle line:84%
of all of our biology which
is founded upon and predicated

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:47.950 align:middle line:84%
upon our own DNA
and RNA processes.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:54.630 align:middle line:10%
Adenine pairs with thymine,
guanine pairs with cytosine,

00:12:54.630 --> 00:13:00.500 align:middle line:10%
adenine will pair with uracil
in the transfer RNA process.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Each of these
nucleotide pairings

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:09.590 align:middle line:84%
which make up the construct of
all life on Earth and arguably,

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:15.590 align:middle line:84%
all potential of life
anywhere in the universe,

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:20.540 align:middle line:84%
is founded on the same
principle of the 5 and the 6.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:23.090 align:middle line:90%


00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:30.260 align:middle line:84%
But water has this dihedral
angle of 108 degrees.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.790 align:middle line:84%
That number seems to
ring a bell, doesn't it?

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, 108 times 2 is 216,
and 216 doubled again

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:44.050 align:middle line:90%
to its next octave is 432.

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And 432 doubled to its
next octave is 864.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.180 align:middle line:10%
The 4.32-inch circle that da
Vinci left us is representative

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:58.840 align:middle line:10%
of the sun itself, which
miraculously has a 432,000-mile

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.880 align:middle line:10%
radius.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.950 align:middle line:84%
Where are all these
numbers coming from?

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.260 align:middle line:84%
It seems that they
have some common root

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:11.690 align:middle line:84%
value that is always
relational to the number 27.

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:15.770 align:middle line:90%
27 is 3 to the third power.

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:20.420 align:middle line:90%
3 times 3 times 3 equals 27.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:27.620 align:middle line:84%
But 27 then multiplied by 2
to its differential powers

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.290 align:middle line:84%
and exponential
values is yielding

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:35.960 align:middle line:84%
this exactly consistent
harmonic thread that

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.050 align:middle line:84%
goes all throughout
the universe and yields

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:44.150 align:middle line:84%
an understanding for us of the
backing of the architecture

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.810 align:middle line:84%
behind mass, and
scale, and velocity,

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and everything
that we experience

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.580 align:middle line:84%
in this world around
us, as we can now

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:58.190 align:middle line:84%
start to see through the veil of
this incredible matrix of mind,

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.245 align:middle line:90%
and number, and geometry.

00:15:00.245 --> 00:15:02.800 align:middle line:90%


00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.680 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at
some other sizes.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.420 align:middle line:90%
What is the size of the moon?

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:10.230 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever considered
that the moon and the sun

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:13.410 align:middle line:84%
are very, very special in their
orientation to each other?

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:17.500 align:middle line:84%
One proof of this is
that we have an eclipse.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.980 align:middle line:84%
A complete solar eclipse is
possible here on this planet.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.020 align:middle line:84%
We're the only planet
in our solar system

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.760 align:middle line:90%
that has this solar eclipse.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And isn't it fascinating
that the scale of the moon

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:32.470 align:middle line:84%
is precisely the same size
as the scale of the sun

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:37.480 align:middle line:84%
as we are observing it in the
heavens from here on Earth?

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.090 align:middle line:84%
This is why it's
even possible for us

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:42.880 align:middle line:84%
to experience a
total solar eclipse.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.630 align:middle line:84%
In order for that to happen,
statistically, let's look

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:49.070 align:middle line:90%
at probabilities for a moment.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:51.400 align:middle line:84%
What would it
require for us to be

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.430 align:middle line:84%
able to see a perfect
solar eclipse?

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, based on
whatever distance the Earth

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:03.130 align:middle line:84%
is from the sun, it would
have to be an equal distance

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:08.020 align:middle line:84%
to the equal size differential
of the diameter of the two

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:08.960 align:middle line:90%
objects.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.350 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
the sun would have

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:17.020 align:middle line:84%
to be exactly 400 times
farther away from Earth

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.790 align:middle line:90%
than the moon is from Earth.

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:24.040 align:middle line:84%
The moon sits at roughly
240,000 miles in distance

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.510 align:middle line:90%
from the Earth.

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:29.680 align:middle line:84%
The sun, however,
is 93 million miles

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.270 align:middle line:90%
in its distance from the Earth.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, interestingly, if
we double that number

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:37.330 align:middle line:84%
of 93 million miles, we
end up at the same value

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:41.320 align:middle line:84%
again for 4.32 squared,
where the value

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:44.200 align:middle line:90%
moves to 186 billion miles.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And that, again, is telling
us the speed of light.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:50.500 align:middle line:90%


00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.360 align:middle line:10%
Just another
coincidence to consider

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.910 align:middle line:10%
is that the Earth's
traveling in its orbit

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:57.400 align:middle line:10%
around the sun at
a speed of just

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:02.600 align:middle line:10%
under 67,000 miles per hour.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.460 align:middle line:10%
Now that's fascinating because
that speed, if we convert it

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.760 align:middle line:10%
down into miles per
second, comes out

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:15.130 align:middle line:10%
to be precisely 18.6
miles per second

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:20.710 align:middle line:10%
or exactly 10,000 times slower
than the speed of light itself.

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Look at this incredible
harmony of the spheres

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:28.030 align:middle line:84%
that we experience day
in and day out if we but

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:31.360 align:middle line:84%
start to notice the encryption
and the pattern that

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.040 align:middle line:90%
underlies it.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.700 align:middle line:84%
So the sun must be 400
times larger than the moon

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.910 align:middle line:84%
to have this experience of a
solar eclipse here on Earth.

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:46.100 align:middle line:84%
The moon's diameter
is 2,160 miles.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.260 align:middle line:90%
There's that number again.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:56.270 align:middle line:10%
2,160 times 2 is 4,320 miles.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:18:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget that the radius
of the sun is 432,000 miles.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:07.820 align:middle line:84%
This makes the moon's diameter
exactly 400 times smaller

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.700 align:middle line:90%
than the sun's diameter.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:14.330 align:middle line:10%
And its distance is
exactly 400 times

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:19.545 align:middle line:10%
closer to Earth for the moon to
Earth versus the sun's distance

00:18:19.545 --> 00:18:20.345 align:middle line:10%
to the Earth.

00:18:20.345 --> 00:18:22.950 align:middle line:90%


00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:24.900 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty incredible.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:29.070 align:middle line:90%


00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Da Vinci left all of these
numbers hidden inside

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:36.660 align:middle line:84%
of his inch unit
value measurements

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:43.200 align:middle line:84%
of the Vitruvian Man, making the
sun or circle in his Vitruvian

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:49.380 align:middle line:84%
Man illustration a
diameter at 8.64 inches,

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:54.530 align:middle line:84%
making as well the
circumference of the circle

00:18:54.530 --> 00:19:00.030 align:middle line:84%
equal to the sun's, which is
approximately between 2.714

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:03.460 align:middle line:84%
million miles and
2.72 million miles,

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:07.450 align:middle line:84%
making it approximately
the Euler number.

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:10.200 align:middle line:10%
So this transcendental
irrational number

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.540 align:middle line:10%
that we call the
Euler number has

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.210 align:middle line:10%
been hidden inside
the circumference

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:19.110 align:middle line:10%
of the sun and its mile value?

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:21.090 align:middle line:10%
That's pretty incredible.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:24.450 align:middle line:10%
And just to take it one step
further, if I were creating

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.900 align:middle line:10%
a system of time, I would
probably want my time system

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.860 align:middle line:10%
somehow to associate
with my orbital position

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:36.870 align:middle line:10%
and entire orbital process
around that structure

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:39.330 align:middle line:10%
that we call the sun.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:41.100 align:middle line:84%
So is it just a
coincidence that we

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:47.610 align:middle line:90%
have 86,400 seconds in one day?

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:50.640 align:middle line:84%
These numbers are
harmonic relationships.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.820 align:middle line:84%
We find them over
and over again.

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.890 align:middle line:84%
We can even break
down the distances

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:59.490 align:middle line:84%
between the planets
and the sun and

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:01.680 align:middle line:84%
between each other
as always being

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.280 align:middle line:84%
relational to these
harmonic structures.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:09.360 align:middle line:10%
Even the planet Jupiter, which
approximately has just over

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:17.520 align:middle line:10%
4,320 days for its annual
cycle around the sun and also

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:23.610 align:middle line:10%
possesses a 43,200-mile radius
when we average the polar

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:28.470 align:middle line:10%
radius as well as the
equatorial radius.

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:middle line:84%
We also notice that
it, of course, then

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.770 align:middle line:84%
has a doubling of that for
its diameter of 86,400 miles.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:37.680 align:middle line:10%
All of these numbers
you will find showing up

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.220 align:middle line:10%
on the same chart
of two to its powers

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.920 align:middle line:10%
multiplied by 3 to
the third power.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.400 align:middle line:10%
They're always bringing us
back to a particular note.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And that note in hertz
frequency is A, alpha.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.890 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it beautiful?

00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:01.570 align:middle line:84%
If the moon has a
diameter of 2,160 miles,

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:06.100 align:middle line:84%
then wouldn't it also have
a radius of 1,080 miles?

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it
does, the same 108

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:14.560 align:middle line:84%
that relates back to
water and its angle that

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:21.660 align:middle line:84%
connects the oxygen to
the hydrogen to form H2O.

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Is it any wonder,
then, that we've long

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:32.200 align:middle line:84%
associated water in relationship
to the moon and the feminine?

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:37.390 align:middle line:84%
The icosahedron is
the form and structure

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:40.890 align:middle line:90%
of the Age of Aquarius.

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:44.640 align:middle line:10%
The understanding that the
Vitruvian Man is actually

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:50.910 align:middle line:10%
encapsulated within the
structure of the water molecule

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:56.910 align:middle line:10%
and the cluster of water
is an astounding revelation

00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:03.480 align:middle line:10%
foretelling of this new Age
of Aquarius, the Water Bearer.

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.870 align:middle line:10%
If we look at the legs that
are spread out by the Vitruvian

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:13.620 align:middle line:10%
Man, it looks very similar to
the same structure and form

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:18.420 align:middle line:10%
of the Water Bearer as we
look at it in the night sky,

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:21.960 align:middle line:10%
the constellation of Aquarius.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.390 align:middle line:84%
In the Bible, at
the Last Supper,

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Jesus speaks of this
coming age and tells

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:31.200 align:middle line:90%
the apostles to seek after.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.170 align:middle line:84%
They will know that this
time has come when they

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:38.880 align:middle line:90%
can find a man bearing water.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:42.690 align:middle line:84%
It was very uncommon for a
man to be carrying and bearing

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:47.160 align:middle line:84%
water in the days
of ancient Israel,

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.340 align:middle line:84%
and yet Jesus
points out the need

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:56.790 align:middle line:84%
to look for such a character
as a revelation of the new age

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:58.750 align:middle line:90%
being upon us.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that we did
is, I took this analysis

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:03.330 align:middle line:90%
even another step further.

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:06.510 align:middle line:10%
Beyond the three-dimensional
form of icosahedron,

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.940 align:middle line:10%
I also wanted to see what
the relationships would

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:13.350 align:middle line:10%
be between a cube and
a sphere, and then

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.020 align:middle line:10%
taking that to a
fourth-dimensional form

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:19.800 align:middle line:10%
of a tesseract to a
hypersphere, and then

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:24.210 align:middle line:10%
an even more complex form
of polytope and tesseract

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:26.730 align:middle line:10%
in the fifth-dimensional form.

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:30.990 align:middle line:10%
And I compared the volumes
of each of those structures,

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:33.720 align:middle line:10%
replacing the
squaring of the circle

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:38.720 align:middle line:10%
with the concepts of
cubing of the sphere.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:42.750 align:middle line:10%
And some very astounding
things came out.

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:47.120 align:middle line:84%
One of the values, as I looked
at this in the third dimension,

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.940 align:middle line:84%
was the relationship
between the two

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:55.560 align:middle line:84%
was yielding exactly the
royal Egyptian cubit.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.690 align:middle line:10%
And even possibly
more importantly,

00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:00.210 align:middle line:10%
in the fifth
dimensional analysis

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:03.900 align:middle line:10%
of volume of the tesseract
versus a very complex

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:09.660 align:middle line:10%
hypersphere, the relationship
was none other than 7,920,

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:13.550 align:middle line:10%
another number you'll
find on the same matrix.

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:18.080 align:middle line:10%
This number, however,
represents the Earth.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:23.180 align:middle line:10%
7,920 miles is the
diameter of our Earth.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:29.510 align:middle line:10%
That makes the radius of
the Earth 3,960 miles.

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:32.030 align:middle line:10%
396?

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:35.450 align:middle line:10%
Didn't Nikola Tesla tell us
that the secrets of the universe

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:39.230 align:middle line:10%
were in the numbers 3, 6, and 9?

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And here we are,
sitting on planet Earth,

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.730 align:middle line:90%
and it's right beneath our feet?

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:52.520 align:middle line:84%
3,960 miles is precisely
our radius value.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Have we been living in a world
with all these secrets hidden

00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:03.260 align:middle line:84%
in plain sight, hidden so they
could be found by each of us,

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:07.530 align:middle line:84%
not by the work of
others but on our own?

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:10.520 align:middle line:84%
We would never want to be
robbed of the opportunity

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:13.070 align:middle line:84%
to find these
profound realizations

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:16.070 align:middle line:90%
through our own efforts.

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:20.390 align:middle line:84%
They're not hidden because
someone's conspired against us.

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:25.190 align:middle line:84%
They're hidden because
we wanted to find them.

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And when we do, it leads
to a greater realization

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:31.945 align:middle line:84%
and remembrance of
who we actually are.

00:25:31.945 --> 00:25:36.220 align:middle line:90%


00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And as we continue to
decrypt the messages

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:41.020 align:middle line:84%
from the Renaissance
scholars and polymaths,

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:45.280 align:middle line:84%
we find hidden gems
like the nature of music

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:49.510 align:middle line:84%
and mathematical constants in
the relationship with geometry.

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:54.430 align:middle line:84%
We also now know the importance
of doubling the size and volume

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:59.470 align:middle line:84%
of a cube is really just
a metaphor for us doubling

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:02.320 align:middle line:90%
our own octave of experience.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:05.890 align:middle line:84%
But in so doing, we discovered
a new type of musical tuning

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:09.760 align:middle line:84%
called precise temperament
tuning, all pointing back

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:14.020 align:middle line:84%
to a simple, and beautiful, and
yet majestic and sophisticated

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:18.280 align:middle line:84%
universal language of
geometry and mathematics.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:23.650 align:middle line:84%
The geometry is simply the
nexus between math and music.

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:26.770 align:middle line:84%
When we understand this, we
see that the universe around us

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:29.890 align:middle line:84%
is actually a true
harmony of spheres.

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:32.620 align:middle line:84%
By combining these
understandings

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:36.070 align:middle line:84%
with our own evolutionary
process towards higher

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:40.360 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, we can realize
changes in our own biology

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:46.180 align:middle line:84%
and recognize psychologically
our own gaps and blind spots,

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.520 align:middle line:84%
that those things that we
believe that we're projecting

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:52.120 align:middle line:84%
to the outside world are,
in fact, just another part

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.328 align:middle line:90%
of our duality experience.

00:26:54.328 --> 00:26:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Experiencing oneness
within ourselves

00:26:57.310 --> 00:27:02.110 align:middle line:84%
is the answer to experience
oneness outside of ourselves.

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:04.870 align:middle line:10%
The Rosecrucian polymaths,
including Shakespeare

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:08.980 align:middle line:10%
and many others that represented
Shakespeare through his pen

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:12.220 align:middle line:10%
name have all
pushed us and taught

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:16.540 align:middle line:10%
us the same philosophies
and key learnings,

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:19.060 align:middle line:10%
that the balance
of the heart-mind

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:23.270 align:middle line:10%
is where we will get
our greatest benefit.

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:26.500 align:middle line:10%
We also found that even
those things that we believed

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.960 align:middle line:10%
are arbitrary measurements
like the foot,

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.320 align:middle line:10%
the meter, the second, all
of the things that we believe

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:35.980 align:middle line:10%
have just been chosen by
mankind throughout history

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:39.070 align:middle line:10%
from an arbitrary
perspective are not in fact

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:41.290 align:middle line:10%
arbitrary at all.

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:43.570 align:middle line:84%
They are mathematical
constants that

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:49.990 align:middle line:84%
are embedded as ratios within
this ratio-based universe.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:55.330 align:middle line:84%
The divine is represented by
this merger of the 5 and the 6,

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:59.530 align:middle line:84%
and the separation between the
two is what makes it divine,

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:02.200 align:middle line:90%
the return to one.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.720 align:middle line:84%
We also learned about
the alchemical marriage

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:08.020 align:middle line:84%
and what it means for us to go
through the process of alchemy

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:13.810 align:middle line:84%
through the steps of nigredo,
albedo, citrinidas, rubedo, as

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:16.090 align:middle line:90%
well as the phoenix stage.

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:19.600 align:middle line:84%
The rubedo stage includes
the alchemical marriage,

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:23.200 align:middle line:84%
the union of the
left and right brains

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:27.830 align:middle line:84%
and the emergence
of heart awareness.

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:31.660 align:middle line:84%
This has also been personified
in the incredible discoveries

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:34.060 align:middle line:84%
that have been made
very recently related

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.610 align:middle line:84%
to the "Salvator
Mundi," pointing us

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:39.850 align:middle line:84%
yet again to the alpha
and omega and answering

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:44.020 align:middle line:84%
the questions irrevocably of
the authorship of the "Salvator

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:46.060 align:middle line:90%
Mundi."

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:49.660 align:middle line:84%
It also has led us to great
and deep questions related

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:52.150 align:middle line:84%
to the Sphinx and
in particular, what

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:53.965 align:middle line:90%
might be under its left paw.

00:28:53.965 --> 00:28:56.800 align:middle line:90%


00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:01.270 align:middle line:10%
Additionally, we found that four
paintings have now pushed us

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:05.140 align:middle line:10%
to look into greater connections
between those paintings

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:09.520 align:middle line:10%
by Leonardo into Egypt and
the Great Pyramids with both

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.790 align:middle line:10%
the Vitruvian Man,
"The Last Supper,"

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:16.420 align:middle line:10%
as well as the "La
Belle Ferronniere,"

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:20.560 align:middle line:10%
and including the
"Salvator Mundi" paintings,

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.670 align:middle line:10%
all driving us in the direction
of Egypt through ancient

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:28.600 align:middle line:10%
symbology and pointing very
irrevocably and directly

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:33.730 align:middle line:10%
to a 51.843-degree angle,
which is the representation

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.990 align:middle line:10%
of the Great Pyramid.

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:38.990 align:middle line:10%
We also learned about
the philosopher's stone

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:44.480 align:middle line:10%
and why this highly sought after
philosopher's stone is actually

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:47.510 align:middle line:10%
just found within the
ring cell crystals that

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:51.860 align:middle line:10%
are formed over time,
relative to our own purity,

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:55.190 align:middle line:10%
that these rings cell
stones grow within us as we

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:57.980 align:middle line:10%
become philosophers,
that philosophy

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:01.380 align:middle line:10%
is a result of our efforts.

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.140 align:middle line:10%
We also talked
about the importance

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:06.890 align:middle line:10%
of learning to draw geometry
by hand, that as we move

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:08.720 align:middle line:10%
into heart-brain
awareness, we'll

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:12.080 align:middle line:10%
notice that all of our
creations are equally balanced

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.810 align:middle line:10%
between science and art.

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:18.980 align:middle line:10%
We also can see the true
method of being able to square

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:23.600 align:middle line:10%
the circle in all ways, without
having to use the aid of any

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:28.580 align:middle line:10%
measurement, and thus, achieve
an ancient 3,000-plus-year-old

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:32.300 align:middle line:10%
conundrum by Greek
mathematicians of squaring

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:36.410 align:middle line:10%
the circle, each and every
one of us has the opportunity

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:39.020 align:middle line:10%
to learn who we.

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:41.210 align:middle line:84%
We hope that you
continue to join us

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:44.180 align:middle line:84%
for this journey in your
own personal mission

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:47.080 align:middle line:90%
of self-discovery.

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.800 align:middle line:90%
This is the "Code X."
