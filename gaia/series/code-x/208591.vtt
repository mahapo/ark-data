00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.290 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.070 align:middle line:84%
The "Salvator Mundi" is a
crowning achievement work,

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.230 align:middle line:84%
considered by many to
be one of the greatest

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.090 align:middle line:90%
works of Leonardo da Vinci.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.080 align:middle line:10%
In fact, only a few years
ago it sold at auction

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.180 align:middle line:10%
and is now considered the most
valuable painting in the world,

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.900 align:middle line:10%
having sold at a total price,
including commissions and fees,

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.150 align:middle line:10%
of $450 million, a
stunning value that

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.910 align:middle line:10%
was unprecedented
at any such auction

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.180 align:middle line:10%
for any such valuable
work of art ever before.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Despite all of
that, there's still

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.020 align:middle line:84%
a lot of questions about
the true authenticity of

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.110 align:middle line:84%
whether or not the
"Salvator Mundi" is actually

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.700 align:middle line:84%
a work of art made solely by
the hand of Leonardo da Vinci.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Some believe that
it was really more

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.100 align:middle line:84%
a work of art done by one of
his students or followers.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.600 align:middle line:84%
It is not clear until today
who actually made the "Salvator

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.800 align:middle line:90%
Mundi."

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.190 align:middle line:84%
I decided to look at it from
a different perspective.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.240 align:middle line:10%
The perspective I saw
it from was actually

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.460 align:middle line:10%
that I now know that inside
of the "Vitruvian Man,"

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.240 align:middle line:10%
the "Last Supper," and
"La Belle Ferronniere"

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.900 align:middle line:10%
are hidden encryptions,
the likes of which

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.640 align:middle line:10%
are all pointing back
to the same place,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.410 align:middle line:10%
the Rostau pyramids
in Giza, Egypt.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:57.020 align:middle line:10%
Maybe if Leonardo was truly
the architect and truly

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.880 align:middle line:10%
the artist behind
the masterpiece

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.290 align:middle line:10%
we call the "Salvator Mundi,"
we would find the same types

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.810 align:middle line:10%
of encryptions that we found in
the other paintings containing

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.350 align:middle line:10%
direct references not only
to the pyramid slope angle

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:10%
but also maybe even
potentially to the notion

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.500 align:middle line:10%
of alpha and omega, which we
saw in the "Last Supper," hidden

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.230 align:middle line:10%
in the tapestry
on the wall, also

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.650 align:middle line:10%
in Jesus and his
A-shaped representation

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.320 align:middle line:10%
sitting at the Last
Supper immediately

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.290 align:middle line:10%
adjacent to Mary
Magdalene, the only

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.210 align:middle line:10%
separating space
between them being

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:42.710 align:middle line:10%
an inverted pyramid of the
same slope of 51.843 degrees.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.160 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a closer look
at the "Salvator Mundi."

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.890 align:middle line:84%
When we look at this
particular painting,

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.580 align:middle line:84%
the first thing that
seems to stick out to me

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.970 align:middle line:84%
is the difference in
coloration between the left

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.450 align:middle line:84%
and the right sides
of this painting.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.840 align:middle line:84%
The left side, when viewed from
the observer's perspective,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.150 align:middle line:84%
seems to have a lot
more light in it,

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.020 align:middle line:84%
as if a shadow is cast
on the right side,

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.900 align:middle line:84%
from the viewer's perspective--
actually the left side

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.160 align:middle line:90%
of the face--

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.890 align:middle line:84%
from the actual
character of Jesus

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.220 align:middle line:90%
that is in this depiction.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.170 align:middle line:84%
If we then take
that a step further

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.540 align:middle line:84%
and try to analyze
what would happen

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.310 align:middle line:84%
if we turn this painting
into a left/left image

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.050 align:middle line:84%
and then subsequently a
right/right image variation

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.100 align:middle line:84%
of the painting, might
we find hidden clues

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.740 align:middle line:84%
to a deeper encryption,
the likes of which we've

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.470 align:middle line:84%
found in several of
the other paintings

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.580 align:middle line:84%
by Leonardo from the time
that he returned from Egypt

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.800 align:middle line:84%
working with and for the
sultan of Cairo-Babylon?

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.320 align:middle line:84%
As we look deeper
in this, we notice

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.310 align:middle line:84%
that if we perform
a left/left analysis

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.620 align:middle line:84%
on this particular painting, we
see a very light-filled figure

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.580 align:middle line:84%
that has a wide neck,
a wide face, and in

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.880 align:middle line:84%
particular a jawline
that is exceedingly wide.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.450 align:middle line:84%
We also notice that
the clothing doesn't

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.959 align:middle line:84%
look terribly dissimilar
from clothing of the day that

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.940 align:middle line:84%
may have been worn by
clergymen in some way, shape,

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.230 align:middle line:84%
or form, albeit
slightly more ornate

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.030 align:middle line:84%
and with a conspicuous X going
straight across the chest.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.100 align:middle line:84%
We also notice
the upraised hand,

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.840 align:middle line:84%
which is the right
hand of Jesus,

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.950 align:middle line:90%
and both hands now coming up.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.870 align:middle line:84%
The face very heavily
illumined and a wide jaw

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.580 align:middle line:84%
gives the feeling of a
very masculine viewpoint.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Again, the alchemical
reference is the sun

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.050 align:middle line:84%
versus the moon, which would be
a darker reference and a darker

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.230 align:middle line:90%
overall stature and view.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.280 align:middle line:84%
So now let's have a look at
a right/right representation

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.900 align:middle line:90%
of the same painting.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Here's a depiction of the
right/right reflected version

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.600 align:middle line:90%
of the "Salvator Mundi."

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.610 align:middle line:84%
The first thing that
sticks out to us

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.140 align:middle line:84%
is that the face is
marginally less wide.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.120 align:middle line:90%
It becomes more narrow.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.760 align:middle line:84%
You'll see that there's
still light on the forehead,

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.930 align:middle line:84%
but it's going more to
a point at the hairline.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.620 align:middle line:84%
In addition, the nose looks
markedly different and quite

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.300 align:middle line:90%
a bit softer in its angularity.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Additionally, the face is
much darker on both sides.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Now some might say that even
the neck is very, very dark.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.400 align:middle line:84%
If we look to see
how wide the neck is,

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.190 align:middle line:84%
the neck becomes
markedly less wide,

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and the jawline is
much narrower also.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.260 align:middle line:84%
The dress looks more
like a period dress

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.270 align:middle line:84%
at the time that a
woman would wear,

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.360 align:middle line:84%
with large sort of
billowing sleeves

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.940 align:middle line:90%
coming off of both sides.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And of course the telltale
sign by Leonardo himself

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:13.210 align:middle line:84%
of holding two crystal balls
right in front of the breasts

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.190 align:middle line:84%
or bosom of this
painting's character,

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.220 align:middle line:84%
seeming to point to a
more feminine stature--

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.180 align:middle line:84%
the narrower profile and
face, the narrower neck,

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:31.270 align:middle line:84%
the darker colors representing
consistent themes of the moon

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.250 align:middle line:90%
and the Eye of Horus.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Now let's take
this a step further

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.480 align:middle line:84%
and see what else we can
find inside the "Salvator

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Mundi" that might be hidden
from our cursory view.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Is there a reference to
the Great Pyramid embedded

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.410 align:middle line:90%
in the "Salvator Mundi"?

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And if there is, is it pointing
us to the same enigmatic slope

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.890 align:middle line:90%
angle of 51.843 degrees?

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.320 align:middle line:84%
Well one of the first
things I noticed

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:04.450 align:middle line:84%
is the X. If we look at the
X in a different viewpoint,

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.000 align:middle line:84%
we start to note
a different angle.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:17.630 align:middle line:84%
The angle that we see on the X
turns out to be 41.843 degrees.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Now most would not recognize
that is also related to 51.84.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.740 align:middle line:84%
If we were to try to
climb the pyramid,

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.880 align:middle line:84%
the people that have actually
attempted that task--

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.800 align:middle line:84%
which now today it's no
longer allowed to do so,

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.250 align:middle line:84%
but in the past
it was possible--

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:39.070 align:middle line:84%
would know that the only way
that you can successfully

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:43.090 align:middle line:84%
and quickly climb the pyramid
without a lot of consternation

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.360 align:middle line:84%
and huffing and hawing
and being out of breath

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.640 align:middle line:90%
is to climb along the corners.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.200 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Clearly the slope angle at the
center of each of the sides

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:58.750 align:middle line:90%
is 51.843 degrees.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:02.130 align:middle line:84%
But if you know to climb
at each of the corners,

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:09.670 align:middle line:84%
the angle of ascent reduces by
10 degrees to 41.843 degrees.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:13.050 align:middle line:90%
This is known as the arris edge.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly the X depicted
on the clothing of Jesus

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:23.100 align:middle line:84%
in the "Salvator Mundi"
is exactly representing

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:30.530 align:middle line:90%
that angle of 41.843 degrees.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Additionally let's go a little
bit deeper into this "Salvator

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.419 align:middle line:90%
Mundi" analysis.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:38.720 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at the orb.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.490 align:middle line:84%
The orb has within
it three dots.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:47.540 align:middle line:84%
These three dots look as
though they have some sort

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.760 align:middle line:90%
of relationship one to another.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:55.790 align:middle line:84%
It is widely believed that the
three dots in this orb, first

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:59.600 align:middle line:84%
of all, might represent
a positioning of stars

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.690 align:middle line:84%
inside a very
prominent constellation

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:07.010 align:middle line:84%
that we know as the
constellation of Leo.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:10.490 align:middle line:10%
I took it unto myself
to analyze this further

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:15.170 align:middle line:10%
to see if this right triangular
shape could be found inside

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:18.760 align:middle line:10%
of the constellation of Leo.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.330 align:middle line:84%
So I worked to try to
match this relationship

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.270 align:middle line:84%
with the constellation
of Leo and found

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:29.680 align:middle line:84%
that, in fact, the Leo
constellation is a very rare

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.840 align:middle line:90%
constellation indeed.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:38.110 align:middle line:84%
It has as its center star a star
that is known also as Regulus.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Regulus is also known as
alpha Leonis, the alpha lion.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:49.840 align:middle line:10%
It is also the Coeur du
Lion, the heart of the lion.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.820 align:middle line:84%
Now interestingly
there are stars

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:55.510 align:middle line:84%
that are not far away
from that that have also

00:09:55.510 --> 00:10:01.610 align:middle line:84%
different names, mu, epsilon,
and, of course, omega.

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:07.510 align:middle line:84%
So now we actually have
within this Leo constellation

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:15.190 align:middle line:84%
an alpha Leonis and an omega
Leonis, alpha and omega.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And what we notice is that
if we place these three

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:24.040 align:middle line:84%
stars over the mouth
and neck of the lion,

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.400 align:middle line:90%
we also notice a perfect match.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.240 align:middle line:10%
Not only is there a match
related to the constellation

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:37.240 align:middle line:10%
of Leo, but if we place it
on top of the Great Sphinx,

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:42.370 align:middle line:10%
we note that the positioning
of epsilon, of mu,

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:46.090 align:middle line:10%
as well as the other stars
of alpha Leonis and omega

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:52.000 align:middle line:10%
Leonis, all position
perfectly at key locations

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.020 align:middle line:10%
on the Great Sphinx
in the Giza Plateau.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:59.630 align:middle line:84%
It is widely believed that
the original Sphinx, much,

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:02.860 align:middle line:84%
much older than the current
version of the Sphinx

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:09.280 align:middle line:84%
today, which contains
the face of Khafre, who

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.730 align:middle line:84%
was the son of Khufu
and also credited

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:14.620 align:middle line:84%
with the building of
the second pyramid

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:19.730 align:middle line:84%
on the Giza Plateau,
the Khafre pyramid.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:25.280 align:middle line:84%
But it is widely known that the
original Sphinx was actually

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.620 align:middle line:90%
the perfect form of a lion.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.260 align:middle line:84%
But what else is
it that Leonardo

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.050 align:middle line:84%
could be trying to tell
us about the Great Sphinx

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:38.090 align:middle line:84%
and the constellation
of Leo in particular?

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And what we also notice that
seems to be somehow missing

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:50.090 align:middle line:84%
is the X in between the alpha
Leonis and the omega Leonis.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.900 align:middle line:84%
X marks the spot in
most treasure hunts.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:12:00.560 align:middle line:84%
The X in this context would
lay beneath exactly the stele,

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:05.360 align:middle line:84%
just in front of the Coeur du
Lion, the heart of the lion.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Is this pointing us somehow
to some mystery or something

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:15.380 align:middle line:84%
underneath the Sphinx itself,
and in particular, left paw

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.390 align:middle line:90%
of the Sphinx?

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:21.620 align:middle line:10%
Edgar Cayce around the
turn of the century,

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.960 align:middle line:10%
known also as The
Sleeping Prophet,

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:30.200 align:middle line:10%
gave many, many prophetic
words in many sessions

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.230 align:middle line:10%
while he was quote
unquote "sleeping."

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:36.620 align:middle line:84%
These were recorded
in abject detail.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And in the context of
these different channelings

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.450 align:middle line:84%
that Edgar Cayce was very well
known for even at the time,

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:47.630 align:middle line:84%
he spoke at length
about the chambers

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:50.960 align:middle line:84%
underneath the Great
Sphinx, and in particular,

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:56.600 align:middle line:84%
mentioning the hall of records
underneath the left paw

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.710 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Sphinx.

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:01.720 align:middle line:90%


00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:05.080 align:middle line:10%
Is it possible that Leonardo
da Vinci has encrypted

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:11.260 align:middle line:10%
some greater, more interesting
and more profound information

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.780 align:middle line:10%
about the Great
Sphinx and what might

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:17.530 align:middle line:10%
be underneath the left
paw of the Sphinx,

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:22.270 align:middle line:10%
in between the alpha
and the omega, signified

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:25.940 align:middle line:10%
by X marking the spot?

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Let's now look at
fourfold symmetry

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.970 align:middle line:90%
of these stars in this orb.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:35.900 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that we see
all the time in Cartesian plane

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.140 align:middle line:84%
analysis, where we have
three planes mathematically

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:42.510 align:middle line:84%
of imaginary numbers in
the negative number space,

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:48.170 align:middle line:84%
and then we have one plane
in the real number space,

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:52.400 align:middle line:84%
we can now mirror image this
in fourfold mirror symmetry,

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.940 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes also referred
to as quaternian symmetry.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Looking at this from a
quaternity perspective,

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.860 align:middle line:84%
we can see that Jesus
is holding an orb which

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:07.850 align:middle line:84%
is going in four different
mirror reflections, as you

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:10.950 align:middle line:90%
see here depicted.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.170 align:middle line:84%
As we merge those
images together

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:17.790 align:middle line:84%
into one form, what
we notice seems

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:22.630 align:middle line:84%
to be very, very important
information indeed.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:27.310 align:middle line:84%
It's pointing us
to a Templar cross.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:31.420 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that this
Templar cross shape

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:36.550 align:middle line:84%
is embedding within it
another reference to the Great

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Pyramid's slope angle
of 51.84 degrees,

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:44.050 align:middle line:84%
matching exactly
the "Last Supper"

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:48.010 align:middle line:84%
and as well the
"Vitruvian Man," each

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:50.590 align:middle line:84%
containing those
exact same angles

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:55.780 align:middle line:84%
in prominent, unmistakable
locations in those masterpiece

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.870 align:middle line:90%
works of art?

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.960 align:middle line:90%
The answer is yes.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:05.310 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid fits exactly
into the same proportions

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:09.930 align:middle line:84%
as the reflected fourfold
mirror symmetry of the three

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:14.590 align:middle line:84%
stars embedded within the
orb depicted in the "Salvator

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:15.390 align:middle line:90%
Mundi."

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:23.550 align:middle line:10%
That, in combination with the
arris edge angle of 41.843

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:28.830 align:middle line:10%
degrees, as well as
the understanding

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:33.270 align:middle line:10%
that the "Salvator Mundi"'s
Jesus figure is actually

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:38.220 align:middle line:10%
holding in his hands
an alpha and omega

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.340 align:middle line:10%
to represent the
importance of the merger

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.950 align:middle line:10%
of the masculine
and feminine, lead

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:47.190 align:middle line:10%
me to conclude that
this is undoubtedly

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:51.540 align:middle line:10%
a work by the master
Leonardo himself

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:54.690 align:middle line:10%
that could only be
known through decryption

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:57.540 align:middle line:10%
of these profound
level encryptions that

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.660 align:middle line:10%
were so adeptly
and adroitly hidden

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:04.950 align:middle line:10%
inside this beautiful
work of art.

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:08.850 align:middle line:84%
The "Salvator Mundi"
is clearly the work

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:11.430 align:middle line:90%
of the master Leonardo.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:15.600 align:middle line:84%
He has encrypted within it
not only the Great Pyramid,

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.900 align:middle line:84%
its arris edge angle,
but also its slope angle,

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:22.380 align:middle line:84%
just as he has encrypted it
similarly in the "Last Supper"

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.900 align:middle line:90%
and in the "Vitruvian Man."

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Additionally we also notice
that along his garment

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:35.670 align:middle line:84%
is an X in between an alpha
and omega representation.

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:39.330 align:middle line:84%
As we looked at mirrored images
of left/left and right/right,

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:45.180 align:middle line:84%
we noted this symbolism
again about alpha and omega,

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:52.830 align:middle line:84%
this time adding in the chi
with the X across his garment.

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:56.700 align:middle line:84%
Additionally it all
begs the question why

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:59.610 align:middle line:84%
the stars not only
are encrypting

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:03.210 align:middle line:84%
within it the angle of the Great
Pyramid and the Templar cross,

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:07.170 align:middle line:84%
but additionally
why is it pointing

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:11.030 align:middle line:90%
to the constellation of Leo?

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And Leo being a representation
of the Great Sphinx, which

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:23.160 align:middle line:84%
has been a long mystery since
well before the time of Edgar

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.609 align:middle line:84%
Cayce but including that
time through to today,

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:30.150 align:middle line:84%
many around the world
believe that there

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:33.870 align:middle line:84%
is a hall of records that has
been kept through antiquity

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:38.340 align:middle line:84%
to today that is
found potentially

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:41.895 align:middle line:84%
underneath the left paw
of the Great Sphinx.

00:17:41.895 --> 00:17:47.640 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Having made several
groundbreaking discoveries

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:54.870 align:middle line:84%
of numerous enigmatic
encryptions within the works

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:59.490 align:middle line:84%
of Leonardo da Vinci, Robert
Grant is keen to also share

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:03.450 align:middle line:84%
what he believes are the greater
esoteric implications of these

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.670 align:middle line:84%
discoveries, especially in
relation to the alchemical

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:07.470 align:middle line:90%
path.

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:11.120 align:middle line:90%


00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>> We've all been taught
throughout our lives that there

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:20.540 align:middle line:84%
is a stark separation between
learning and spirituality,

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.860 align:middle line:84%
unless, of course, we're
studying spirituality.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.350 align:middle line:84%
But we don't necessarily
believe that there

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:29.860 align:middle line:84%
is a direct connection between
the study of mathematics

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.910 align:middle line:90%
and spirituality.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.570 align:middle line:84%
We also don't believe that
science and physics will lead

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:38.080 align:middle line:90%
to higher spiritual awareness.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.530 align:middle line:10%
And vice versa, we don't believe
that higher spiritual awareness

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:45.070 align:middle line:10%
will lead to higher
understanding of mathematics

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:48.760 align:middle line:10%
and physics, for example,
or that somehow music

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:52.240 align:middle line:10%
is relational to
physics and chemistry.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.690 align:middle line:10%
And yet we now know
that the geometric

00:18:55.690 --> 00:19:00.760 align:middle line:10%
forms that we see resident
within all of the elements that

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.340 align:middle line:10%
represent the universe
around us are actually

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:07.480 align:middle line:10%
just musical representations
that we experience

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.850 align:middle line:10%
through the sense of
our eyes and sometimes

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:12.400 align:middle line:10%
to the sense of touch.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:17.720 align:middle line:84%
But what if all of it was
really truly connected

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:21.500 align:middle line:84%
into one whole and
holistic experience?

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.430 align:middle line:90%
Would that not be holy?

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:26.240 align:middle line:90%


00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.810 align:middle line:84%
As we look at the alchemical
process and what these ancient

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:33.770 align:middle line:84%
cryptographers left behind for
us to learn and glean through

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:39.140 align:middle line:84%
all their many teachings and
wisdom lectures that emanated

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:43.700 align:middle line:84%
first from the Egyptian
mystery schools along the banks

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:48.770 align:middle line:84%
of the Nile River in Egypt,
back as well to the Library

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:55.490 align:middle line:84%
of Alexandria, as we start to
understand what is the teaching

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:59.780 align:middle line:84%
of alchemy and what is hermetic
wisdom, we realize that,

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:04.340 align:middle line:84%
in fact, we cannot separate
learning and education from

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:05.690 align:middle line:90%
spirituality.

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:09.380 align:middle line:84%
It is only us that has
created an artificial boundary

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.880 align:middle line:90%
of perception.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Once we get to
the stage where we

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:15.350 align:middle line:84%
can see the higher wisdom
and the higher knowledge,

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:20.390 align:middle line:84%
we no longer want to take
sides in this game of polarity

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:22.910 align:middle line:90%
and right and wrong.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a transcendence
moving away from the need

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:31.160 align:middle line:84%
to be and feel right
to the acceptance

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.800 align:middle line:84%
that the only thing
that we really desire

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.190 align:middle line:90%
is to come to the right answers.

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:42.380 align:middle line:84%
The ego is stripped from us, and
we've integrated our own shadow

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.750 align:middle line:90%
perspectives.

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:48.020 align:middle line:84%
The alchemical path and
journey is an inward one.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:51.470 align:middle line:90%
It requires no one else.

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:54.170 align:middle line:84%
It leads us to have to ask
more fundamental questions

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:55.295 align:middle line:90%
about our own reality.

00:20:55.295 --> 00:20:58.370 align:middle line:90%


00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:02.270 align:middle line:84%
Maybe in this mind matrix
that we experience on a day

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:05.510 align:middle line:84%
to day basis, the
answers are really found

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:11.040 align:middle line:84%
within, and that the
real aim of being here

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:14.220 align:middle line:84%
is to learn to fall in
love with this place

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:18.060 align:middle line:84%
as it is, again,
always remembering

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:23.690 align:middle line:84%
that the universe is happening
for me and never against.

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Achieving this
level of awareness

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.650 align:middle line:84%
is personified in
something that we

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:31.520 align:middle line:84%
call the heart-brain
consciousness, balancing

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.220 align:middle line:90%
the heart with the mind.

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:39.000 align:middle line:84%
The logos must merge with
the pathos, and as a result,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.850 align:middle line:84%
we can experience a higher
order thought and divinity.

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:47.790 align:middle line:84%
This is also personified
by the alchemical path,

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:52.920 align:middle line:84%
another symbolism that
goes back to alchemy.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.990 align:middle line:84%
Now the alchemists
often were known

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:58.920 align:middle line:84%
for attempting to
turn lead into gold.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.430 align:middle line:84%
This was often confused by
many because this was also

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:04.080 align:middle line:84%
part of their
encryption as being

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.630 align:middle line:84%
a sole reference to
turning lead into gold

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:08.940 align:middle line:90%
and the art of transmutation.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:13.040 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of some
sort of elixir.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.950 align:middle line:10%
This work was called the
"great work" in alchemy,

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:19.650 align:middle line:10%
or the magnum opus.

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:22.950 align:middle line:84%
The alchemical bath
represents the union

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:26.670 align:middle line:84%
of this marriage between
the left and right sides

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:28.200 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.780 align:middle line:84%
It will also be represented
by a real person

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:35.700 align:middle line:84%
that you will meet in this
life, in your experience, that

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:39.250 align:middle line:84%
will represent all the things
that until that moment in time

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:41.880 align:middle line:84%
you would have thought you would
never be attracted or drawn

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.710 align:middle line:90%
to whatsoever.

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And somehow you find yourself
drawn almost magnetically

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:53.550 align:middle line:84%
to this other person who
represents the personification

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:56.490 align:middle line:84%
or projection from your
own subconscious of all

00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:01.710 align:middle line:84%
those things, and usually
in an opposite gender form,

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:06.750 align:middle line:84%
and will appear and become a
prominent figure in your life.

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:09.900 align:middle line:10%
This alchemical marriage
is a necessary step

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:14.490 align:middle line:10%
to learn to fully integrate
the feminine principle,

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:19.620 align:middle line:10%
or, as the case may be, the
masculine principle to gain

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:25.570 align:middle line:10%
the rebalance necessary prior to
a resurrection, which is often

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:29.590 align:middle line:10%
personified by not only the
phoenix but the butterfly

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:34.870 align:middle line:10%
and also an alchemical
reference to the dragonfly.

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:39.820 align:middle line:84%
All of this is intended to
bring us to the shen, or xin.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.820 align:middle line:90%
The xin represents the spirit.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:46.570 align:middle line:84%
In Chinese characters
the xin is represented

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:49.480 align:middle line:84%
by a Chinese character
that references

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:54.280 align:middle line:84%
the notion of spirituality
and God returning to the Earth

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:57.370 align:middle line:90%
plane, the horizontal line.

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:01.600 align:middle line:84%
Achievement is made through
this 90-degree angle

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:05.920 align:middle line:84%
at the altar of each of
our hearts and minds,

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:10.140 align:middle line:84%
as we sacrifice, just
as the Apis Bull did,

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:14.760 align:middle line:84%
to merge back in to this higher
awareness and consciousness.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.310 align:middle line:84%
These were the
foundational teachings

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:20.260 align:middle line:90%
of the mystery schools.

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:23.950 align:middle line:10%
Rubedo, which is also
sometimes referred

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:28.600 align:middle line:10%
to as the marriage of the red
king with the white queen,

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:32.560 align:middle line:10%
represents this merger
of thought process

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.270 align:middle line:10%
and consciousness.

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:36.820 align:middle line:10%
Often it is always
accompanied as well

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:45.640 align:middle line:10%
by a group or a fiery mound
that is beneath a fiery phoenix.

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.730 align:middle line:84%
The Scorpio symbol is
one that in astrology

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:53.020 align:middle line:84%
has multiple meanings and is
the only astrological sign that

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:57.460 align:middle line:84%
goes through several
different transmutation steps.

00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:01.180 align:middle line:84%
It starts with the scorpion that
crawls the Earth or the desert

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:05.170 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes is referred to in
the beginning also as a snake.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Then as it goes
through life it starts

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:11.890 align:middle line:84%
to transcend these concepts
and connotations and biases

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:14.110 align:middle line:84%
that we all assign
to it to become

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:17.430 align:middle line:90%
an eagle with clear vision.

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:22.220 align:middle line:84%
The eagle's final culmination
is that of the phoenix.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:26.440 align:middle line:84%
This is the spirit,
or the xin, reborn.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.170 align:middle line:84%
The phoenix represents
the resurrection,

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:33.100 align:middle line:84%
the death of the
old, the persona,

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:37.780 align:middle line:84%
into the transmutation
of the newly formed

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:41.270 align:middle line:84%
super-conscious
mind, the mind that

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:47.330 align:middle line:84%
is balanced across the mind
centers and no longer seeks

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:50.750 align:middle line:84%
judgment and polarity
of perception

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:55.870 align:middle line:84%
and instead experiences
love for fellow man,

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:59.710 align:middle line:84%
as well as sentient beings
all across the planet

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:03.040 align:middle line:90%
and for the Earth itself.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.980 align:middle line:10%
This change is something that
can only happen as a fire

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:09.930 align:middle line:10%
within, and it is the
preparatory process

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:15.600 align:middle line:10%
that is required to achieve
the culminating magnum opus,

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.530 align:middle line:10%
which is the achievement
of the philosopher's stone,

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:24.060 align:middle line:10%
and how this story is relevant
to each and every one of us

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:27.000 align:middle line:10%
as we go through this
transformative process

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.370 align:middle line:10%
to understand and remember the
greatest encryption of all,

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:34.380 align:middle line:10%
who we actually are.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.730 align:middle line:10%
