00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.640 align:middle line:84%
In the last episode, we talked
about the pyramids of perception

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.460 align:middle line:84%
and the role of Metatron's cube
in our perception of reality.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.770 align:middle line:84%
We realized that
what we experience

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.720 align:middle line:84%
is not actually
what we perceive,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.823 align:middle line:84%
but rather what we
believed we perceived.

[INTRIGUING MUSIC]

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.450 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we're going
to learn the relationship

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.090 align:middle line:90%
between music and geometry.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.720 align:middle line:84%
It's been said that geometry
is the music we experience

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.510 align:middle line:84%
with our eyes, and likewise,
music is therefore the geometry

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.530 align:middle line:84%
that we experience
with our ears.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.560 align:middle line:84%
But what is that
relationship and why

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.500 align:middle line:84%
is it important to our
experience here in this matrix

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.040 align:middle line:90%
of mind simulation?

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And what does the framework
of Metatron's cube

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.850 align:middle line:84%
have anything to do with
that experiential awareness?

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.410 align:middle line:84%
What we find is that our
emotional states are directly

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.580 align:middle line:90%
derived by our input stimulus.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.950 align:middle line:10%
The input stimulus is based
on a mathematical ratio

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.440 align:middle line:10%
that can be depicted in the form
of a cross section of a pyramid.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.540 align:middle line:10%
And if you wanted to
leave that information

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.940 align:middle line:10%
to future generations to
realize at the right time,

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.870 align:middle line:10%
you could depict
it in living stone

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.780 align:middle line:10%
and call it the Giza Plateau.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.770 align:middle line:10%
Metatron's cube is the
foundational architectural

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.970 align:middle line:10%
design of the
entire Giza Plateau.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.160 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.919 align:middle line:84%
Now, the great pyramid is unique
because it has, in its pyramid

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:15.380 align:middle line:84%
of perception, a slope angle
that is not found anywhere else.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.080 align:middle line:84%
This slope angle happens to
be precisely 51.8539 degrees,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.440 align:middle line:84%
as measured by explorer and
archeologist Flinders Petrie.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.630 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at that
angle in isolation,

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.060 align:middle line:84%
we don't even know
necessarily what it means,

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.090 align:middle line:90%
why it's significant at all.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, few have
ever even analyzed

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.490 align:middle line:90%
why 51.8539 degrees was used.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, in order to
understand this,

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.090 align:middle line:84%
we have to do a little
bit more research.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we need to start
to learn the relationship

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.490 align:middle line:90%
between music and geometry.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.590 align:middle line:84%
So if we looked at it from
a brain anatomy perspective,

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.770 align:middle line:84%
the left temporal lobe,
if you're right-handed,

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.830 align:middle line:84%
is the seat of
rational thought, and

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.920 align:middle line:84%
in particular mathematical
rational thought.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the site of our
brains that tell us, no.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.390 align:middle line:84%
It's the side that says,
hey, that's dangerous.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.410 align:middle line:90%
Don't jump off of that cliff.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.530 align:middle line:84%
But the other side of our
brain, the right temporal lobe,

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.410 align:middle line:90%
is the seat of music.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.400 align:middle line:84%
At the center between these
two hemispheres of our brain

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.360 align:middle line:84%
is something called
the corpus callosum.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And in that center point
we find the pituitary gland

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.640 align:middle line:84%
and of course, the
pineal gland behind it.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we start to see
where the seat of geometry is,

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.180 align:middle line:84%
we recognize that it
is in that place that

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.350 align:middle line:84%
is called the cave of Brahma,
and adjacent to that place,

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.440 align:middle line:90%
that we process geometric form.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.290 align:middle line:84%
So then we could say that the
left brain, the mathematics,

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.460 align:middle line:84%
the rational thought and
ratio relationships of number,

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.450 align:middle line:84%
inform the right brain,
right temporal lobe of music,

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.490 align:middle line:84%
and in between, the nexus
point of those two sides

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.890 align:middle line:84%
and hemispheres of the brain
experience is geometry.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.320 align:middle line:84%
With this thought
in mind, let's dive

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.550 align:middle line:84%
more deeply to understand
how music relates

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.339 align:middle line:90%
to geometry very directly.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:24.110 align:middle line:84%
If we start off with a
scale, and in this case,

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:30.370 align:middle line:84%
we're going to use 432 hertz,
each of the relationships

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.070 align:middle line:84%
that are coming
off of this would

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.690 align:middle line:84%
start from what is referred
to as the diminished fifth.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:45.400 align:middle line:84%
The diminished fifth is known
as the square root of two, which

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.070 align:middle line:90%
is equal to a ratio of 1.4142.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.040 align:middle line:84%
Then we have the
augmented fourth.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And the augmented
fourth in music theory

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.960 align:middle line:90%
is the same square root of two.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Now we can go beyond this to
look at the perfect fourth.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:10.540 align:middle line:84%
The perfect fourth is
defined as a ratio of 4/3.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.900 align:middle line:84%
It has an inverted
relationship, so that

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.960 align:middle line:90%
becomes the perfect fifth.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.960 align:middle line:84%
The next note that we
can derive from this

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.230 align:middle line:90%
is called the major third.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:28.150 align:middle line:84%
The major third
has a ratio of 5/4,

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:34.540 align:middle line:84%
and its opposite
becomes the minor sixth.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, from this
point forward, all

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.940 align:middle line:84%
of the other
intervals that appear

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.780 align:middle line:84%
show up as major or
minor relationships.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:51.730 align:middle line:84%
So that means that the next
one would be the minor third,

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:57.040 align:middle line:84%
and then that would make
this the major sixth.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Then we have the major
second, and then its pair

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.270 align:middle line:90%
must be the minor seventh.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And then the minor
second, and its pairing

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.310 align:middle line:90%
would be the major seventh.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.050 align:middle line:84%
The octave doubles, so
that becomes the eighth.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.990 align:middle line:90%


00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:28.000 align:middle line:84%
The great pyramid, Khufu, embeds
within its architectural design

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.500 align:middle line:90%
2/1 and 1/1, as I just showed.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:40.450 align:middle line:84%
So 51.8539 degrees is
giving us this relationship

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.230 align:middle line:84%
to the unison and the
octave, and it's also

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.960 align:middle line:84%
giving us the relationship
to the augmented fourth

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.210 align:middle line:90%
and the diminished fifth.

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:54.950 align:middle line:10%
So the great pyramid represents
already four, one, two, three,

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.660 align:middle line:10%
four, of the musical intervals
that define our musical note

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.850 align:middle line:10%
system in a scale.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:06.580 align:middle line:10%
And that relationship forms
exactly the 51.8539 degree

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.620 align:middle line:10%
angle.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, one would
expect, if there's

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.810 align:middle line:84%
a relationship that maybe
we could see a pattern here.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, the next pyramid, Khafre,
is exactly 4/3 relationship.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:26.990 align:middle line:84%
The height of Khafre
pyramid is 144 meters,

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.500 align:middle line:84%
and it's one half
base is 108 meters,

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.680 align:middle line:84%
which is exactly a
4/3 relationship.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:39.850 align:middle line:84%
This is why the measured
value is 53.13 degrees.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.710 align:middle line:84%
So we have the perfect
fourth and the perfect fifth,

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.750 align:middle line:90%
which must be 53.13 degrees.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Then we get to the major third,
which is Menkaure pyramid.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And Menkaure is a
5/4 relationship,

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:59.950 align:middle line:84%
which gives us a
51.34 degree angle.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And then that informs the
minor sixth, which is 8/5,

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:08.200 align:middle line:90%
and that is also 51.34 degrees.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.510 align:middle line:90%
So wait.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Of the 13 musical intervals, the
Giza Plateau in three pyramids

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:23.590 align:middle line:84%
has already defined eight of
the 13 intervals to perfection.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:30.370 align:middle line:10%
The music of the Giza Plateau
is evident in its slope angles.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:35.240 align:middle line:10%
What it is forming
is a unison chord.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.490 align:middle line:90%
You can think of that as da.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Then the major third,
which would be da.

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:49.000 align:middle line:90%
The perfect fifth, da.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.980 align:middle line:90%
Then the doubled octave, da.

The A major chord
in 432 hertz is

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.570 align:middle line:90%
the sound of the Giza Plateau.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:07.660 align:middle line:84%
The diminished fifth is
representing the duality

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.390 align:middle line:84%
that separates
music into what we

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.760 align:middle line:90%
would call light and darkness.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.100 align:middle line:84%
What we are looking
at and experiencing

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.690 align:middle line:84%
when we look at the Giza
Plateau is a rainbow spectrum

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:22.330 align:middle line:90%
of light and sound.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:26.810 align:middle line:10%
Now, it does not fill the
other five missing intervals,

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.960 align:middle line:10%
but as you'll see in
subsequent episodes,

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.990 align:middle line:10%
we find those missing
intervals, along with the notes

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:38.350 align:middle line:10%
of a 24-note scale that
the egyptians used,

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:43.750 align:middle line:10%
in all of the slope
angles, in Egypt.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:48.280 align:middle line:10%
We finally can understand
the musical relationship

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.100 align:middle line:10%
of the three pyramids
on the Giza Plateau

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.120 align:middle line:10%
and the musical
keys of Metatron.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.340 align:middle line:90%


00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:02.230 align:middle line:84%
If we take the separation of the
scale as the square root of 8,

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.000 align:middle line:90%
and then cut that in half.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.860 align:middle line:84%
The square root of 2, we have
the diminished fifth chord.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.790 align:middle line:84%
This is the chord in
music, this is the interval

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:13.460 align:middle line:84%
that we listen to when
we're watching movies,

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.120 align:middle line:84%
and usually the villain
enters the room.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.880 align:middle line:84%
It's diminished fifth
and augmented fourths

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:23.770 align:middle line:84%
that give us the sound when
Darth Vader enters in Star Wars.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Recent studies have been shown
that dogs recognize Darth Vader

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.660 align:middle line:90%
when he walks in the room.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:35.630 align:middle line:84%
Is it really that they recognize
the black outfit of Darth Vader?

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Or possibly, is it
that they recognize

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:40.150 align:middle line:84%
the sound of the
diminished fifth

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:44.540 align:middle line:84%
and augmented fourth in that
famous chorus of [HUMMING]?

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:48.820 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.700 align:middle line:84%
As we think about
this, we could start

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.310 align:middle line:84%
to derive that our
entire scale in music

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:57.910 align:middle line:84%
starts with that separation
at the midpoint of the scale.

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:01.540 align:middle line:84%
From there, the diminished
fifth and augmented fourth,

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:06.460 align:middle line:84%
both being 1.4142, can be
multiplied against the unison

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:07.550 align:middle line:90%
value that is chosen.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And in this case we're
going to use 432 hertz,

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:15.040 align:middle line:90%
the pythagorean note A.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:18.320 align:middle line:84%
When we multiply 432 times
the square root of 2,

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.820 align:middle line:90%
it comes out to 610.9.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:26.050 align:middle line:84%
In hertz, that then
also converts into feet.

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:33.700 align:middle line:84%
The slope of the great pyramid
of Giza is 610.9 feet exactly.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.720 align:middle line:84%
As we think this
through further,

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.020 align:middle line:84%
we could start to think
as we go beyond this,

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:42.660 align:middle line:84%
that we go to the next note from
the center point of the scale

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.600 align:middle line:84%
to the perfect fifth
and the perfect fourth,

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:50.250 align:middle line:84%
the perfect fourth
being derived as 4/3.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:56.310 align:middle line:84%
4/3 creating the angle
of 53.13 degrees.

00:11:56.310 --> 00:12:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Its inverted
pairing becomes 6/4,

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:04.410 align:middle line:84%
which is reduced down to 3/2,
because they share the common

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:07.110 align:middle line:90%
denominator of two.

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Both of these musical intervals
will share the same slope

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:15.750 align:middle line:90%
angle of 53.13 degrees.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:19.500 align:middle line:84%
The next musical notes
that extend from this

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.070 align:middle line:84%
become the major third
and the minor sixth.

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:26.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, we use the
term major and minor

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.980 align:middle line:84%
really as synonymous
with polarity.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:33.250 align:middle line:84%
A major interval is
a positive polarity.

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:34.120 align:middle line:90%
You could switch it.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.590 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't really matter.

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:38.790 align:middle line:84%
It's like saying that
masculine is positive

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:41.070 align:middle line:84%
and feminine is negative
or feminine is positive

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:42.430 align:middle line:90%
and masculine is negative.

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.550 align:middle line:84%
It's just an opposite
condition of each other,

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:48.240 align:middle line:84%
adhering to the
hermetic principle

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.630 align:middle line:90%
of polarity and gender.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:54.130 align:middle line:84%
In each case of
musical interval,

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:57.180 align:middle line:84%
as we extend from the
center of a scale,

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.010 align:middle line:90%
the numbers must add to 9.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:05.760 align:middle line:84%
So a diminished fifth will add
to an augmented fourth to equal

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.080 align:middle line:90%
9.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:11.340 align:middle line:84%
A perfect fifth will add
to the perfect fourth,

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.920 align:middle line:90%
and that will also equal 9.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.750 align:middle line:84%
The perfect fourth
and the perfect fifth

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:17.910 align:middle line:84%
have this relationship
like the diminished fifth

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:20.820 align:middle line:84%
and the augmented
fourth, that they do not

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:22.510 align:middle line:90%
have a shift in polarity.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.840 align:middle line:84%
When we get to the major
third and the minor sixth,

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.680 align:middle line:84%
we have this polarity
shift happening.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.450 align:middle line:84%
Then the next
extended from there

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:33.330 align:middle line:84%
would be the minor third
and the major sixth,

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.360 align:middle line:90%
again adding to 9 always.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.070 align:middle line:10%
Then the next notes
from there would

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:41.670 align:middle line:10%
be the major second
and the minor seventh,

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:46.350 align:middle line:10%
and beyond that would
be the minor second

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:49.470 align:middle line:10%
and the major seventh.

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:53.520 align:middle line:84%
Each having very specific
numerical relationships

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:58.950 align:middle line:84%
of intervals of ratio of
height over one half base.

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:04.320 align:middle line:84%
The great pyramid
embodies 2/1pi.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:15.600 align:middle line:10%
Khafre embodies 4/3 and 3/2, and
Menkaure embodies and embeds 5/4

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.540 align:middle line:10%
and 8/5.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:23.490 align:middle line:10%
Because the great pyramid
is also 2/1 and its inverted

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:29.340 align:middle line:10%
relationship becomes 2pi/2,
we then find the unison

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.610 align:middle line:10%
and the octave notes.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:37.020 align:middle line:10%
So out of the 13 musical
intervals that exist within

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:42.000 align:middle line:10%
a scale, in a 11-note
Western based scale,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.800 align:middle line:10%
we find that eight of the
precise musical intervals,

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:52.860 align:middle line:10%
and their resulting slope angles
are identical to that that is

00:14:52.860 --> 00:15:00.900 align:middle line:10%
found on the Giza Plateau with
Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:05.250 align:middle line:10%
All three pyramids
representing different aspects

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:13.440 align:middle line:10%
of Metatron's cube, the
musical keys of Metatron.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:18.930 align:middle line:84%
What we find is that the entire
spectrum of sound and light

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:24.700 align:middle line:84%
can be represented with the
pyramids that are from Saqqara,

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.330 align:middle line:84%
all the way north
to another place

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.410 align:middle line:84%
that we'll be
introducing to you later,

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:33.030 align:middle line:84%
called Abu Rawash,
eight kilometers north

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:34.145 align:middle line:90%
of the Giza Plateau.

00:15:34.145 --> 00:15:36.660 align:middle line:90%


00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.940 align:middle line:84%
As we look at this
musical relationship,

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:45.960 align:middle line:84%
we can't help but wonder what
is this relationship deriving

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.780 align:middle line:84%
from a musical
expression perspective?

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And what we find is that it's an
A major chord that sounds just

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:59.880 align:middle line:90%
like this [HUMMING]

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Through the great pyramid,
we go on a hero's journey

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:07.980 align:middle line:84%
through the separation of the
square root of 2, all the way

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:13.230 align:middle line:84%
back up to doubling the octave
and expanding our perception

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:15.420 align:middle line:90%
and experience.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:22.530 align:middle line:84%
The Giza Plateau represents
the musical keys of Metatron.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Another important aspect of
this is emotional states.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.840 align:middle line:84%
I was recently asked by a
cognitive neuroscientist

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:36.310 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Donald Hoffman
to relate to him a way

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:40.090 align:middle line:84%
to derive mathematical
equation for human emotion.

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, that's
not a very easy task.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:49.900 align:middle line:84%
My mind was drawn to the notion
that music has the ability

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.240 align:middle line:84%
to entrain certain
emotional states in each

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.560 align:middle line:90%
and every one of us.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And when we watch film,
this is used so adeptly

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:00.580 align:middle line:90%
by movie makers, filmographers.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Low frequency sounds can
elicit fear and anxiety.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:09.530 align:middle line:84%
Higher frequency sounds can
be used in like fashion,

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.520 align:middle line:90%
but in the opposite sense.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was then drawn
to think about research

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:18.700 align:middle line:84%
that had been conducted
on the relationship

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.829 align:middle line:84%
between musical interval
and emotional states.

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:26.319 align:middle line:84%
What I found is that each
of the musical intervals

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:30.030 align:middle line:84%
are accompanied by a
different emotional state.

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Those emotional states
can be derived as follows.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:38.580 align:middle line:84%
The diminished fifth
elicits fear, instability.

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.010 align:middle line:84%
The perfect fourth
and the perfect fifth

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:46.680 align:middle line:84%
brings in this higher
degree of stability.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Bringing those notes
clear into view,

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:54.030 align:middle line:84%
loyalty comes with
the perfect fourth.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And the major third
is accompanied

00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.210 align:middle line:84%
by a feeling of
romantic or divine love

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:03.750 align:middle line:84%
and its inverted
pairing, the minor sixth,

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:09.990 align:middle line:84%
is accompanied by heartbreak,
by viewers and listeners alike.

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Each of the different
musical intervals

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:17.070 align:middle line:84%
entrains a different
emotional state

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:23.670 align:middle line:84%
whose inverted pairing elicits
the opposite emotional state.

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.430 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at
the Giza Plateau

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:30.330 align:middle line:84%
and we look at Menkaure pyramid,
the smallest of the three

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:37.050 align:middle line:84%
pyramids, in one viewpoint, we
could see it as romantic love,

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:40.300 align:middle line:84%
and looking at it from its
height over its one half base,

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.360 align:middle line:90%
that is what we would perceive.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.840 align:middle line:84%
But if we looked at it
instead from the full base

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:50.580 align:middle line:84%
over the height, then we would
experience heartbreak instead.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.770 align:middle line:84%
This raises
fundamental questions

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:57.210 align:middle line:84%
about our experience
in this universe.

00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:04.170 align:middle line:84%
A fundamental question is,
in the experience of love,

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:09.120 align:middle line:84%
is simultaneously the
seed of heartbreak?

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:13.590 align:middle line:84%
Is this not true with all
experiences that we have?

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:17.040 align:middle line:84%
We've all experienced moments
where we look back on our lives

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.810 align:middle line:84%
and we say, oh,
that was the worst

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:20.170 align:middle line:90%
thing that ever happened to me.

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:22.800 align:middle line:84%
But with the benefit
of time, somehow

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.510 align:middle line:84%
the polarity of
that experience can

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:29.340 align:middle line:84%
flip to become the best thing
that ever happened to me.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:32.250 align:middle line:10%
As we analyze our
experience and start

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:34.720 align:middle line:10%
to review the
patterns of our lives,

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:38.670 align:middle line:10%
then we start to recognize
these synchronicities that

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:42.480 align:middle line:10%
connect dots for us so that
we can remember who we are

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.300 align:middle line:10%
and why we are here.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:50.310 align:middle line:10%
That all of it is interconnected
in a sublime symphony

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:54.060 align:middle line:10%
of music and geometry.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:57.600 align:middle line:84%
The notes of the major
third are the same notes

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.140 align:middle line:90%
of the minor sixth.

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.600 align:middle line:84%
They're just played
in differing orders,

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.950 align:middle line:84%
and the second note is
played in the higher octave.

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And yet, our emotional
condition, from researchers,

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.830 align:middle line:84%
shows that we have an
entirely different experience

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:19.680 align:middle line:84%
by listening to the same notes
played in backwards order.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.590 align:middle line:10%
The experience of
love, romantic love,

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:25.700 align:middle line:10%
therefore, will
always have the seed

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.600 align:middle line:10%
of some degree of heartbreak.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:34.190 align:middle line:84%
The feeling of stability
in the perfect fifth

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:37.010 align:middle line:84%
will always have a
relationship to loyalty

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.980 align:middle line:84%
because there is
no polarity flip.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:44.450 align:middle line:84%
The minor second and the major
second relationships of winning

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:51.770 align:middle line:84%
will always be accompanied by
the feeling of loss and despair.

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:55.010 align:middle line:84%
These relationships
are part of the matrix

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:58.910 align:middle line:84%

universal experience

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:02.970 align:middle line:84%
here that is impacted by
our own conditioning bias,

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.350 align:middle line:90%
whether we can see it or not.

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:10.790 align:middle line:84%
It points also to the notion
that maybe what we consider

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:14.960 align:middle line:84%
to be random is not
really random at all,

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:18.800 align:middle line:90%
and simply beyond our awareness.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:23.720 align:middle line:84%
If I were an omnipotent,
omniscient, omnipresent being,

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:28.290 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to play a game
where I could learn more wisdom,

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:31.850 align:middle line:84%
expand my awareness
and consciousness,

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:33.920 align:middle line:84%
would it make sense
for me to make a game

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:37.760 align:middle line:84%
where I had access to all
my powers and faculties?

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Or does it make
more sense for me

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.260 align:middle line:84%
to limit access to those
powers and faculties

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:46.640 align:middle line:84%
and make the game itself be
the realization and refinding

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:50.960 align:middle line:90%
of those powers and faculties?

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:55.190 align:middle line:84%
I would suggest to you
that it is the latter.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:22:00.870 align:middle line:84%
We are here to find ourselves,
find our own god realization,

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:05.180 align:middle line:84%
and remember that we are all
divisions of the number 1.

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And in addition, there
is no separation.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.360 align:middle line:84%
What we perceive outside of us
is not really separate from us

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.240 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.540 align:middle line:84%
It's just a
reflection of what is

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:17.240 align:middle line:84%
emanating from the inside
of us and projecting

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.140 align:middle line:90%
to the outside world.

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:21.490 align:middle line:10%
