00:00:08.712 --> 00:00:22.310 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm Robert Grant,
and this is Code X.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.480 align:middle line:84%
What was Leonardo trying
to tell us about the power

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.510 align:middle line:90%
and the nature of time itself?

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.220 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that what
we consider time is not

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.160 align:middle line:90%
what it actually is?

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.030 align:middle line:84%
We started off by looking at
the pyramid of perception,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.890 align:middle line:84%
and how each of us experiences
the world around us,

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.270 align:middle line:84%
not as it truly is,
but rather as we are.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.930 align:middle line:84%
As we look more
deeply into this,

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.690 align:middle line:84%
we have to ask
ourselves the question,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.880 align:middle line:84%
is what we consider the
future actually also

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.930 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously our past?

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.960 align:middle line:84%
As we proceed through
the equinox, we are also,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.370 align:middle line:84%
at the same time,
simultaneously precessing,

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.170 align:middle line:84%
going backwards on the
precessional cycle of 24,000

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.730 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:19.030 align:middle line:84%
That 24,000-year cycle means
that Pisces goes backward

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.120 align:middle line:90%
to Aquarius, where we are now.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, as we look
at The Last Supper painting,

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.310 align:middle line:84%
the perspective
that we're viewing

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.340 align:middle line:84%
the entire room of The
Last Supper painting

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.910 align:middle line:84%
is from the vantage point
of the age of Aquarius.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.610 align:middle line:84%
This in a painting that was
done over 500 years ago.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.040 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.870 align:middle line:84%
We also have to start
asking ourselves

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.320 align:middle line:84%
this question about
the angel Metatron.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.280 align:middle line:84%
As Orion processes and
precesses through the equinox

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.600 align:middle line:84%
and learns through
struggle and challenge,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.400 align:middle line:84%
through all the labors that
he has had to experience,

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.610 align:middle line:84%
along his hero's
journey, we start

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.230 align:middle line:84%
to notice as well that certain
aspects of this journey

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.840 align:middle line:84%
seem to still be
somewhat missing.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Particularly, one thing that
stands out in The Last Supper

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.030 align:middle line:84%
painting is the giant void
space in between Jesus and Mary

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.590 align:middle line:90%
Magdalene.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.470 align:middle line:84%
We analyzed this and we found
two notable facts about it.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Number one, the angle
of this exact void space

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.690 align:middle line:84%
which has this triangular shape
is not an equilateral triangle.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.750 align:middle line:84%
It happens to be
precisely the slope

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.650 align:middle line:84%
angle of the Great
Pyramid, 51.85397 degrees,

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.600 align:middle line:90%
yet again showing up.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.400 align:middle line:84%
We know that that relates
to both unison note,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.660 align:middle line:84%
as well as in the
note of A in 432

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.660 align:middle line:84%
hertz tuning, as well as
the doubled octave of 864.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.110 align:middle line:84%
But as well, it
also relates back

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.850 align:middle line:84%
to the diminished
fifth, which is related

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.680 align:middle line:90%
to the square root of 2.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.970 align:middle line:84%
So through the experience
of suffering and difficulty

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.030 align:middle line:84%
within the duat
of duality, we can

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.150 align:middle line:84%
double our octave of experience
to find our divine self.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.140 align:middle line:10%
But we have to realize the
philosopher's stone, which

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.680 align:middle line:10%
is that each of the challenges
and difficulties we face

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.120 align:middle line:10%
are actually the things that
bring us the most gold, where

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.040 align:middle line:10%
lead of experience turns
into gold of divinity.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.440 align:middle line:84%
All of this needing
simply the context

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.870 align:middle line:84%
of the trinity and
the divine aspect

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.720 align:middle line:90%
that we talked about earlier.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, we also asked
the question, though,

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.400 align:middle line:84%
what is it about
this crack that is

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.160 align:middle line:84%
in between the two,
both Jesus and Mary

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Magdalene, that also matches
something else in the King's

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.490 align:middle line:90%
Chamber?

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.920 align:middle line:84%
One of the notable aspects
of the King's Chamber

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.440 align:middle line:84%
is the crack on the
corner that has a Y-shape.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.020 align:middle line:84%
We overlaid this on top of
this gap between Jesus and Mary

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Magdalene, and again, found
it to be a perfect match,

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.385 align:middle line:84%
matching exactly the contours
of this crack in the sarcophagus

00:04:00.385 --> 00:04:01.185 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:04:01.185 --> 00:04:04.100 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, there's
something very, very

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.610 align:middle line:84%
important about
this missing aspect.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.960 align:middle line:84%
As we look at the Zodiac, what
we notice is that there are 12

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.420 align:middle line:84%
apostles with a
13th being Jesus.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.589 align:middle line:84%
And we could apply this to
the same type of concept

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:25.790 align:middle line:84%
of the flower of life, where
we will have 12 outer circles

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.940 align:middle line:84%
to construct the flower of life,
and the center circle would be

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.500 align:middle line:90%
the 13th.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.290 align:middle line:84%
But is there something
else missing?

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we go back in
the story of Osiris,

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Osiris was killed by his brother
Set, and cut into 14 parts.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.510 align:middle line:90%
And there was a missing 1/14.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.310 align:middle line:84%
In the Vitruvian
Man illustration,

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.130 align:middle line:84%
we find that he has cut
his man into 14 parts,

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.530 align:middle line:84%
and he references the missing
1/14 in the paragraph above

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.390 align:middle line:90%
the Vitruvian Man as well.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.160 align:middle line:84%
As we look at this void space,
is there a missing 1/14 that we

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.040 align:middle line:90%
should be thinking about?

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.630 align:middle line:84%
I spoke earlier about when
Osiris, or Orion, in this case,

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.050 align:middle line:84%
was stung by a
scorpion in the foot.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.630 align:middle line:10%
And it caused him to experience
a death of sorts, possibly

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.520 align:middle line:10%
an ego death.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.400 align:middle line:10%
He was saved by Asclepius.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.490 align:middle line:10%
Now, if we actually look at
the constellation, also known

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:30.740 align:middle line:10%
as Ophiuchus, the bearer of the
staff or the staff of Hermes,

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.140 align:middle line:10%
or the rod of Asclepius,
always accompanied by snakes,

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.620 align:middle line:10%
we see it in medical facilities
and health centers alike

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.920 align:middle line:10%
around the globe.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.720 align:middle line:84%
The symbol of the Caduceus
and the rod of Asclepius

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.220 align:middle line:84%
has been, throughout
time immemorial,

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.100 align:middle line:84%
a symbology associated
directly with healing.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, Asclepius was
able to heal Orion.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was simply
an ego death,

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.950 align:middle line:84%
and maybe Asclepius was
simply the shadow of Orion.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Is the missing 1/14 represented
here in The Last Supper painting

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:17.090 align:middle line:84%
showing this relationship
between Orion and Ophiuchus?

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.590 align:middle line:84%
When Orion finally
merges with his shadow

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.790 align:middle line:84%
and understands how to tame
his kundalini life force

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.540 align:middle line:90%
and become Christed?

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:35.720 align:middle line:84%
The missing 1/14, the
finding of the divine within.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And is actually what Orion is
experiencing as he makes his

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.870 align:middle line:84%
ascension into an
angelic form of Metatron,

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:51.170 align:middle line:84%
is this really just the cycle
of karmic reincarnation over

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and over again, experiencing the
same types of patterns until he

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.850 align:middle line:84%
finally becomes aware of it,
living out this grand play

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.120 align:middle line:84%
of experience throughout the
precession of equinox across

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.900 align:middle line:90%
24,000 years.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And we just happened
to be observing it

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.960 align:middle line:84%
at a certain point in
time, that happens to also

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.750 align:middle line:84%
be the transition
from the age of Pisces

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.170 align:middle line:90%
to the age of Aquarius.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.920 align:middle line:84%
As we look at that
transition occurring

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.070 align:middle line:84%
right in front of our eyes as we
peer into the vanishing point,

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.400 align:middle line:90%
that is The Last Supper.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.800 align:middle line:90%


00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we think about
this, that really

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.260 align:middle line:84%
starts to raise major questions
about what is a matrix.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And let's remember,
that The Last Supper

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:38.470 align:middle line:84%
painting was built entirely
off of Metatron's cube.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Just as Metatron's
cube is able to create

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:45.060 align:middle line:84%
all of the different geometric
structures and forms that we can

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.050 align:middle line:84%
see and perceive
in the universe.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Is this merely a
construction box

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.790 align:middle line:90%
of our own perception and mind?

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Is this just some
sort of new-age way

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:59.490 align:middle line:84%
of looking at the world
that nothing is real?

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Or is there foundational
factual science

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.900 align:middle line:90%
that backs up this claim?

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, in 2022, the
Nobel prize was

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.680 align:middle line:90%
given for quantum entanglement.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And the actual title of the
scientific American article that

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.830 align:middle line:84%
came out about it was The
Universe is not Locally Real,

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.640 align:middle line:84%
and the Nobel Prize
Winners Have Proved It.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:30.030 align:middle line:84%
The Nobel prize winners were
Aspect, Clauser, and Zeilinger.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:32.990 align:middle line:10%
And these three scientists
were able to prove quantum

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:37.700 align:middle line:10%
entanglement and proved namely,
that what you are not observing

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.460 align:middle line:10%
does not, in fact, exist.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:45.360 align:middle line:84%
I'll repeat that what we do
not observe or is not observed,

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.500 align:middle line:84%
does not, in fact, hold a
position in quantum physics.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.190 align:middle line:84%
That means it virtually
does not exist.

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:55.410 align:middle line:84%
If the table in front
of me is not observed.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.280 align:middle line:90%
It does not actually exist.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, you might also ask, well,
how is this even possible?

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:05.740 align:middle line:84%
How could consciousness create
a matrix mind simulation

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.550 align:middle line:90%
from nothingness?

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the concept of the 1 being
divided into each one of us

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.470 align:middle line:84%
is something that we could kind
of conceptualize and grasp.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.930 align:middle line:84%
The 1 divides itself
into the many,

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:21.040 align:middle line:84%
in order that it will simply
be able to perceive itself

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.350 align:middle line:84%
through all of our eyes
of unique perception

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:25.240 align:middle line:90%
and perspective.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:29.090 align:middle line:84%
But then we might also
then ask the question, OK,

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.510 align:middle line:90%
but what preceded the number 1?

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:34.580 align:middle line:10%
How could you come and
start with the number 1?

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.060 align:middle line:84%
I can understand the concept of
the 1 can be divided infinitely.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.020 align:middle line:90%


00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, this brings us
to a mathematical proof

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.560 align:middle line:90%
that is extremely powerful.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:53.920 align:middle line:84%
Most people believe that 0 to
the power of 0 should equal 0.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.620 align:middle line:84%
That nothingness to the
power of nothingness

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.740 align:middle line:84%
would, of course,
equal nothingness.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:04.580 align:middle line:84%
But would you be surprised to
know that 0 to the power of 0,

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:09.680 align:middle line:84%
in fact, equals 1, the
mathematical proof of which

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.920 align:middle line:84%
can be described
exactly as follows.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:21.860 align:middle line:84%
If I take 0.5 to the power of
0.5, the answer to that question

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.190 align:middle line:90%
equals 0.707.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:27.270 align:middle line:84%
So now let's go with
smaller numbers.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:32.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's do 0.05 to
the power of 0.05.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And let's see what
the calculator yields

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.200 align:middle line:90%
for us is the proper answer.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:41.510 align:middle line:84%
The answer that the calculator
gives us back is 0.861.

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:42.390 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:44.790 align:middle line:84%
We've just started with
two smaller numbers.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.670 align:middle line:84%
We went from 0.5 to
the power of 0.5,

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:49.050 align:middle line:90%
which are two larger numbers.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to 0.05
to the power of 0.05,

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and we're getting
a result that's

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:55.940 align:middle line:90%
bigger than the former number?

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.720 align:middle line:90%
Let's keep going with this.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's try putting 10 zeros
to make it really small.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:13.540 align:middle line:84%
0.00000000005, 10 zeroes, to
the power of 10 zeros and 5.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is 0.9999999999,
10 nines and then 8.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:27.040 align:middle line:84%
As we get smaller and smaller
and converge towards 0,

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.930 align:middle line:84%
the answer mathematically
converges toward the number 1.

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
mathematical proofs written

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:42.760 align:middle line:84%
that show that 0.99999
repeating is in fact 1.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.630 align:middle line:84%
9 has the property that
it acts both as a 0

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:52.030 align:middle line:84%
and can also, in this context
with repeating iteration,

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.430 align:middle line:90%
act as the number 1.

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.260 align:middle line:84%
For if we add any
number to the number 9,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:02.960 align:middle line:84%
we find that the result is as
if the number 9 never existed.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.900 align:middle line:84%
As an example, 9
plus 4 equals 13.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:11.760 align:middle line:84%
But 1 plus 3, to derive
a digital root, equals 4.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.860 align:middle line:84%
The 9 seems as though
it never existed.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:19.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is true with any number
that we add to the number 9.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And 9 repeating, also
as we've just seen,

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:26.160 align:middle line:90%
converges and becomes 1.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:31.150 align:middle line:84%
So nothing to the power of
nothing derives everything.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And from that number 1, we can
create infinite separations.

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Infinite eyes of
perception and perspective.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.540 align:middle line:84%
But then what about
higher dimensions?

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:47.310 align:middle line:84%
How can we look more
significantly at how dimensions

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.920 align:middle line:90%
can be created from this?

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.740 align:middle line:84%
I've said earlier that
randomness is simply

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:57.840 align:middle line:84%
our inability to perceive
god's encrypted pattern.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.740 align:middle line:84%
The pattern exists, we just
haven't yet perceived it.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Within the numerical
system itself

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.240 align:middle line:84%
is already all the
information required

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:11.380 align:middle line:84%
to find all higher
dimensions of perspective.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.560 align:middle line:84%
This can be found in something
as simple as this proof

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.290 align:middle line:84%
that I'm about to
present to you.

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:20.830 align:middle line:84%
If we start with a circle
with a radius of 2,

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:23.770 align:middle line:84%
that circle will carry
a particular property

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:25.750 align:middle line:90%
that no other circle has.

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:29.720 align:middle line:84%
It will be a circle that
is referred to as perfect.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.950 align:middle line:90%
How is it perfect?

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.910 align:middle line:10%
Well, the circumference
of a circle with radius 2

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:37.120 align:middle line:10%
will be equal to the
area of the same circle.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.720 align:middle line:84%
In both cases, the
answer is 4 pi.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's also unique
about this property is

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:48.350 align:middle line:84%
that any polygon that I will
exerscribe around that or nest

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:51.920 align:middle line:84%
the circle within, will
have the same property,

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.980 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a
square or a pentagon.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.880 align:middle line:84%
So in the case of the
square, a radius of 2

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.370 align:middle line:90%
would derive a side length of 4.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:05.530 align:middle line:10%
And the square that is around
that circle, the perfect circle,

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:08.030 align:middle line:10%
will also likewise
become a perfect square

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:15.620 align:middle line:10%
because its area will be 16 and
its perimeter is likewise 16.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:19.050 align:middle line:10%
The perimeter and the
area are matching.

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:22.230 align:middle line:84%
This is also true for a
pentagon that we do this with.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:26.040 align:middle line:10%
It's true for a hexagon, for
a nonagon, for a hendecagon,

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:30.630 align:middle line:10%
for every type of polygon that
we ascribe around this circle.

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:31.590 align:middle line:90%
That's perfect.

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:36.440 align:middle line:84%
We will have this property that
will operate like a portal.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.810 align:middle line:90%
But what about higher dimension?

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's expand
that radius value

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000 align:middle line:84%
from 2 for the second dimension
to 3 for the third dimension.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.450 align:middle line:90%
Does the same property exist?

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:51.380 align:middle line:84%
If we expand that
radius from 2 to 3,

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:56.120 align:middle line:84%
then the same property exists,
but now for the Platonic

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.910 align:middle line:90%
and Catalan dual solids.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:00.510 align:middle line:90%
So what do I mean by this?

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:04.100 align:middle line:84%
So if I take a sphere
with a radius of 3,

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:08.260 align:middle line:84%
it will have a property that
is unique among all spheres.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:12.070 align:middle line:84%
That sphere will have
a volume that will

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:14.770 align:middle line:90%
be equal to its surface area.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:16.570 align:middle line:84%
So in the last
example of the circle,

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:19.960 align:middle line:84%
we said area equaled
circumference.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:24.260 align:middle line:84%
But now, looking at the
third dimension of a sphere,

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.070 align:middle line:84%
we're now going to
transition the term of area

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:30.640 align:middle line:84%
and turn it into
surface area, and then

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.880 align:middle line:84%
introduce a new concept of
volumetric measurement, which

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.650 align:middle line:90%
we call volume.

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:40.150 align:middle line:84%
So the area of a sphere
becomes its surface area,

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:43.420 align:middle line:84%
and its volume will
match perfectly

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:48.400 align:middle line:84%
its surface area when the
radius is 3 because that's

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.670 align:middle line:90%
dividing the third dimension.

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And if we take any
platonic solid,

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:55.810 align:middle line:84%
any regular Catalan
dual relationship

00:15:55.810 --> 00:16:00.050 align:middle line:84%
as well around that, which will
be the solids that go around it,

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.750 align:middle line:84%
and even also the
archimedean solids,

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.600 align:middle line:84%
we can find the
direct connection back

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:09.080 align:middle line:84%
where the surface area is
equal to the volume of each

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.820 align:middle line:90%
of those polytopes.

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Each polytope that goes
around in the third dimension

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.780 align:middle line:90%
will have the same property.

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, but what if
we take it further?

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Could this possibly
work for tesseracts

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.030 align:middle line:90%
in the fourth dimension?

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Now we move the radius from 3 to
4, and the same thing happens.

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:28.070 align:middle line:84%
What we were calling
before volume

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:31.040 align:middle line:84%
now becomes surface
volume, and now

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.410 align:middle line:84%
we introduce another
type of measurement

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.330 align:middle line:84%
that represents the
fourth dimension, which

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.660 align:middle line:90%
is called hyper volume.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is true
for all polytopes

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:45.860 align:middle line:84%
that will extend around that
sphere with a radius of 4.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:48.350 align:middle line:84%
We can extend this
analysis infinitely

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:49.830 align:middle line:90%
to include all dimension.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:51.920 align:middle line:84%
So now within the
numbering system

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:56.810 align:middle line:84%
itself, a foundational property
is all higher dimension

00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:01.580 align:middle line:84%
can be compressed
into the number 0

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.920 align:middle line:90%
for all can emanate from 0.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Thus, we can have
a matrix of mind

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:10.589 align:middle line:84%
that literally is
self-generating

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:12.670 align:middle line:90%
from our own consciousness.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:15.839 align:middle line:84%
Just as we have with dreams
that are self-generating

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:18.329 align:middle line:84%
from our own
subconscious minds, we

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:21.060 align:middle line:84%
are experiencing a
U-inverse around us

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:24.900 align:middle line:84%
that is a veritable matrix
of our own conditioning bias

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.400 align:middle line:90%
and perception.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.580 align:middle line:84%
For if we think about
the void of nothingness,

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:32.010 align:middle line:90%
it has no Hertz frequency.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And yet, with 0
to the power of 0,

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:41.040 align:middle line:84%
we can now create the first 1
Hertz sound, the primordial ohm

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.890 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:48.840 align:middle line:84%
As we now enter into the fifth
chakra, awareness, the throat

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:54.180 align:middle line:84%
chakra, this is accompanied
by several new upgrades.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Increase in the
number of senses,

00:17:56.140 --> 00:18:00.120 align:middle line:84%
our sensory perception is now
going through a dramatic shift.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.530 align:middle line:90%
We start noticing more colors.

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're now
transitioning to an avatar

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:11.690 align:middle line:84%
that's able to perceive 16.8
million and more colors.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.570 align:middle line:84%
These subtle differences
between the colors

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:16.530 align:middle line:84%
allow us to read
between the lines.

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Music is also proliferating
more and more as we move from

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:22.550 align:middle line:90%
a 12-based octave.

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:27.350 align:middle line:84%
A 12-note semitone octave to
a 24-note quarter tone octave,

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:30.950 align:middle line:84%
they represents our time
differentiation also.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly,
we are now in the realm

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:35.750 align:middle line:90%
of instant manifestation.

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:38.580 align:middle line:84%
If you think a thought,
be careful what you think,

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:42.020 align:middle line:84%
because it might actually
come into your reality

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.150 align:middle line:90%
because you have called it in.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:48.380 align:middle line:84%
We now realize with the
fifth dimensional experience

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.390 align:middle line:84%
that the things we
chase will continue

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:52.610 align:middle line:84%
to be chased and the things
that we no longer feel

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:55.820 align:middle line:84%
we need to chase and already
feel that we have will attract

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.740 align:middle line:90%
to us magnetically.

00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:00.680 align:middle line:90%
This is the new paradigm.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.530 align:middle line:84%
We'll start to also
fully grasp the notion

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:05.990 align:middle line:84%
that the only real obstacles
in life are the ones

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.360 align:middle line:90%
that we persistently believe in.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Those things that we cling to
and believe that we deserve.

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Maybe all we have to do is
realize that we already are.

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:22.760 align:middle line:90%
I am that I am.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.770 align:middle line:90%
From the primordial sound.

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And just as the Great
Pyramid is a reflection

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:32.450 align:middle line:84%
of all that is within us,
as we find this chakra

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:36.560 align:middle line:84%
center within us, the
throat chakra chamber

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:37.813 align:middle line:90%
will also manifest.

00:19:37.813 --> 00:19:41.360 align:middle line:90%


00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Enoch, Osiris,
Orion, all precursors

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:53.780 align:middle line:84%
to an angelic god-man character
that we know as Metatron.

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:58.820 align:middle line:84%
How Metatron became
a god personage

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.850 align:middle line:84%
is the process of
the hero's journey.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:05.660 align:middle line:84%
The story that we have
heard over millennia

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.240 align:middle line:90%
is now becoming realized.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.690 align:middle line:84%
The realization of
Metatron as a Seraphim,

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:18.080 align:middle line:84%
an angelic being that does
not require one Christ figure,

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.480 align:middle line:84%
but rather represents
a consciousness,

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:26.360 align:middle line:84%
a vibration, a frequency
achieved by humanity.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:31.070 align:middle line:84%
An era that marks the end of
human doing and the beginning

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:33.680 align:middle line:90%
of human being.

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Homo Luminous Sanctus,
the sacred light human.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.470 align:middle line:84%
This is embodied in the
painting that was left

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:50.300 align:middle line:84%
and became the most valuable
painting the world over--

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:54.800 align:middle line:84%
the Salvator Mundi, the
Savior of the World.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.830 align:middle line:84%
The transition of
Orion and Osiris

00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:01.670 align:middle line:84%
and Enoch into this
god-man character,

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:05.390 align:middle line:84%
representing the emergence
of Christ consciousness.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:12.610 align:middle line:84%
The decision by humanity to
value mankind and mankind's

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:16.580 align:middle line:84%
benefit over self-interest
and self-gain.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:20.710 align:middle line:84%
Realizing that the hurt of one
man becomes the hurt of all,

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:23.920 align:middle line:84%
the hurt of one woman
becomes the hurt of all.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:28.610 align:middle line:84%
That we can leave behind us the
notions of power and conquering.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Representing the transition of
the world when the power of love

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:39.340 align:middle line:84%
finally supersedes
the love of power.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:44.710 align:middle line:84%
This transition in our world
is marked by the Christos,

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:46.810 align:middle line:90%
the Christ consciousness.

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:51.070 align:middle line:84%
When love supersedes
being right,

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:55.180 align:middle line:84%
we live in a future that is
extremely bright as mankind

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:59.200 align:middle line:84%
realizes its own divinity
to become the eon

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.650 align:middle line:90%
avatar of the Aquarian age.

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:06.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm Robert Grant,
and this is Code X.
