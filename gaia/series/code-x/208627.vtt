00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.820 align:middle line:84%
What is the philosopher's
stone of alchemy?

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.520 align:middle line:84%
For centuries, the
philosopher's stone,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.910 align:middle line:84%
which according to legend
and myth can work wonders,

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.240 align:middle line:84%
was sought after by
ancient alchemists.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of works
have been written,

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.640 align:middle line:84%
but it still remains
unclear to so many,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.390 align:middle line:84%
what exactly is the
philosopher's stone?

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.130 align:middle line:84%
In their writings,
the alchemists

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.690 align:middle line:84%
used a multitude of allegories,
metaphors, and symbols

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.555 align:middle line:84%
that only the initiated
could correctly decode.

00:00:56.555 --> 00:00:59.870 align:middle line:90%


00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.380 align:middle line:10%
Using its power, people
can become creators,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.600 align:middle line:10%
such as Jesus Christ, the
legendary Count of St. Germain,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.950 align:middle line:10%
and the world-famous Helena
Blavatsky, who could literally

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.220 align:middle line:10%
materialize objects
out of thin air

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.400 align:middle line:10%
or transform one
thing into another.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.800 align:middle line:84%
The secret of all
of these abilities

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.070 align:middle line:84%
lies within our
hearts, where there

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.700 align:middle line:84%
is a crystal that represents
the crystallized fiery

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.220 align:middle line:84%
energy accumulated through the
ages and through our lifetimes.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.220 align:middle line:84%
In Tibet, these stones
are called the ringsel.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.210 align:middle line:84%
When a high Lama
dies, he is cremated.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And then his closest
disciples begin

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.460 align:middle line:84%
to look for the
ringsel stones, which

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.990 align:middle line:84%
is the only thing that
remains of his pile of ashes

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.000 align:middle line:90%
after his cremation.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.820 align:middle line:84%
In Bhutan, Buddhists
believe that the presence

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.730 align:middle line:84%
of ringsel stones proves
the teacher achieved

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.360 align:middle line:84%
spiritual purity and that
those who view the ringsel

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.080 align:middle line:84%
can actually themselves be
spiritually transformed.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Ringsel often come from past
Buddhas and bodhisattvas

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.500 align:middle line:90%
of the 10th level.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.580 align:middle line:84%
If one has strong faith and
devotion, thousands of relics

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.830 align:middle line:90%
often manifest from just one.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.570 align:middle line:84%
It is essential to keep it in
a very pure and a clean place

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.540 align:middle line:90%
and cared for very well.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Prayers and offerings are very
often done in their presence.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.050 align:middle line:84%
These relics could be considered
being a precipitation of bliss

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.680 align:middle line:84%
arising from the central nervous
system of highly realized

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.580 align:middle line:84%
masters and the activity
of bodhisattvas.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.080 align:middle line:90%


00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.840 align:middle line:10%
Is there anywhere else that
we can find a reference

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.900 align:middle line:10%
to this ringsel
stone and crystal

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.360 align:middle line:10%
phenomenon of a
crystal that grows

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.840 align:middle line:10%
within the heart of an
initiated, pure teacher who's

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.500 align:middle line:10%
actually learned to combine
the heart-brain consciousness

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.570 align:middle line:10%
successfully?

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns
out that there is.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back for a moment
to the Salvator Mundi

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.850 align:middle line:90%
by Leonardo da Vinci.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.280 align:middle line:84%
If we look closely at
the Salvator Mundi,

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.820 align:middle line:84%
there is an aspect of
it that we have not yet

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.940 align:middle line:84%
touched upon that is quite
enigmatic in and of itself.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.740 align:middle line:84%
What is that large amber-colored
stone immediately at the center

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.630 align:middle line:90%
of the letter x?

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.950 align:middle line:84%
We already know it was telling
us the exact arris angle

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.490 align:middle line:90%
edge of the Great Pyramid.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.400 align:middle line:10%
The center of the x,
or as it's pronounced

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:55.990 align:middle line:10%
in Greek, the Chi, as in
Alpha Chi Omega, at its center

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.770 align:middle line:10%
sits a large stone.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.400 align:middle line:90%
The amber color is very telling.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Is this representative
of a large amber ringsel?

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.300 align:middle line:90%
I believe that it is.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.420 align:middle line:84%
If we also look at
the x, we'll notice

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.540 align:middle line:84%
that the numbers
eight, eight, eight

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.970 align:middle line:84%
show up in multiple
locations in the embroidery.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.112 align:middle line:84%
And what is the meaning
of eight, eight, eight?

00:04:29.112 --> 00:04:35.740 align:middle line:84%
8 times 3 or 8 plus
8 plus 8 equals 24,

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.370 align:middle line:84%
bringing back Divinity
onto this Earth.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.510 align:middle line:84%
The notion of Christ
consciousness relating back

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:50.960 align:middle line:84%
to the number 24 as separated
as an equilateral triangle

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:57.670 align:middle line:84%
is exactly what we're being
told here by Leonardo da Vinci.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Eight is also a
reference to light.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.910 align:middle line:84%
The number eight
in particle physics

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.390 align:middle line:90%
is represented by the photon--

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.705 align:middle line:90%
light, light, light.

00:05:09.705 --> 00:05:12.260 align:middle line:90%


00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.110 align:middle line:84%
When we achieve this stage
of Christ consciousness,

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.650 align:middle line:84%
our entire life experience
will be transformed.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And in the process
we ourselves will

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.640 align:middle line:84%
start to grow our
own ringsel stone

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.610 align:middle line:90%
in the center of our hearts.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.550 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
old terminology

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.820 align:middle line:90%
is from of weighing the heart.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:43.680 align:middle line:84%
The heart is something that
is above and beyond the logos.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.090 align:middle line:84%
The pathos is able to bring
us closer to our own divinity

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and realization of who
we are and who we always

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.070 align:middle line:84%
have been, but allowed
ourselves to forget

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:02.750 align:middle line:84%
as we have gotten into the world
of day in and day out duality.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:08.000 align:middle line:84%
As we finally learn to transcend
this stage of our existence,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.790 align:middle line:90%
a new world awaits us.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.410 align:middle line:84%
This is what Leonardo is trying
to tell us, as the Salvator

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Mundi is motioning the Alpha
Chi Omega, the Chi being

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.850 align:middle line:84%
the cross that connects
heaven to Earth.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:31.520 align:middle line:90%


00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.520 align:middle line:84%
The triangle,
circle, and square--

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.110 align:middle line:84%
in these three very
simple geometric forms,

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.240 align:middle line:84%
we can find the answers to all
things, the square representing

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:50.140 align:middle line:84%
the masculine, the circle
representing the feminine,

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:54.880 align:middle line:84%
and the triangle
representing the divine.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.220 align:middle line:84%
As we understand that life
is not what we had thought

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:06.160 align:middle line:84%
it always was, but rather
could be so much more,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.220 align:middle line:84%
that we ourselves through
this process become

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:14.930 align:middle line:84%
as a result philosophers,
lovers of wisdom,

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.080 align:middle line:84%
perceiving our world around us
very differently than we ever

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.760 align:middle line:84%
have in the past, and waking
up to our own destiny that

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.130 align:middle line:84%
was always there and
by our own choosing.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.460 align:middle line:84%
We have learned that the
philosopher's stone is not

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.610 align:middle line:84%
simply this notion of
changing lead into gold,

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.920 align:middle line:84%
but rather changing
the lead of a lower

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:45.340 align:middle line:84%
form of our own consciousness
into the gold of the pure heart

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.450 align:middle line:84%
that is achieved and culminated
in the formation of the crystal

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:51.070 align:middle line:90%
that grows within that heart.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.650 align:middle line:90%


00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:56.680 align:middle line:84%
This is a rare
invitation for each of us

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.390 align:middle line:84%
at this very early stage to
embrace the notion and concept

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:05.980 align:middle line:84%
of the magnum opus, by
integrating a heart brain

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.285 align:middle line:90%
philosophy into our lives.

00:08:07.285 --> 00:08:11.230 align:middle line:90%


00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>> While Robert Grant believes
the alchemical path to be

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:17.770 align:middle line:84%
a vital path which accelerates
the spiritual evolution

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:22.540 align:middle line:84%
of humanity, Robert also sees
the act of physically creating

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.470 align:middle line:84%
geometric forms as another
vital tool for expanding

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.300 align:middle line:90%
your consciousness.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.960 align:middle line:10%
>> If you go through history
and notice that one of the great

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:38.600 align:middle line:10%
aspects of hermeticism is
the notion of the simplicity

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.559 align:middle line:10%
relational to the
compass and the square.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:47.660 align:middle line:10%
Somehow drawing geometry seems
to open our minds in new ways

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:52.100 align:middle line:10%
that we didn't consider prior
to us commencing that effort.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.890 align:middle line:84%
It's as if we
ourselves are sitting

00:08:54.890 --> 00:09:00.170 align:middle line:84%
in the role of the architect,
architecting and consciously

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:03.620 align:middle line:84%
delivering on the
ideas and concepts

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.550 align:middle line:84%
to create the reality around
us that we now experience.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Somehow when we tap
into that space,

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:14.310 align:middle line:84%
it's not dissimilar
from meditation.

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:17.250 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
has also come out of this

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.040 align:middle line:84%
is that in drawing
Metatron's cube,

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.290 align:middle line:84%
I was able to
discover more than 30

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:26.160 align:middle line:84%
entirely new geometric
forms that I now

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:31.890 align:middle line:84%
call collectively the
granthahedron family of solids.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.860 align:middle line:84%
These solids are very
interesting because they've not

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.180 align:middle line:90%
been seen before.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:41.640 align:middle line:10%
You will not find them inside
of mathematical different forms

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.320 align:middle line:10%
of geometry that
are either called

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.290 align:middle line:10%
Catalan solids or
Platonic solids

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:50.340 align:middle line:10%
or Archimedean solids
or duals of any

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.360 align:middle line:10%
of those solid structures.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.960 align:middle line:84%
These are entirely
new geometric forms

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.430 align:middle line:84%
that have a unique simplicity
in that in particular, I

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:04.350 align:middle line:84%
saw them amidst a complex
structure of lines.

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:08.130 align:middle line:84%
As I work through these
lines, every time I do it,

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:13.380 align:middle line:84%
somehow my perspective shifts
on the world around me.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.800 align:middle line:10%
It almost forces me as
I'm drawing geometry

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.410 align:middle line:10%
in a more and more
three-dimensional form

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:24.790 align:middle line:10%
or in a fashion that would look
as if it's actually in motion.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:29.700 align:middle line:84%
This is a very specific
form of geometric drawing.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.250 align:middle line:10%
During the Renaissance,
this accompanied

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:36.150 align:middle line:10%
the actual Renaissance
itself, as Leonardo da Vinci

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:39.000 align:middle line:10%
in particular and several
others during the time

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.570 align:middle line:10%
started to use depth of
perception and perspective

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:46.200 align:middle line:10%
drawing in ways that had
never been used before,

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:51.450 align:middle line:10%
moving their artistic world away
from a flat, Euclidean plane

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.840 align:middle line:10%
to three-dimensional
and seemingly

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:59.200 align:middle line:10%
four-dimensional in
motion geometric forms.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.340 align:middle line:84%
Some of the more famous
examples of this you

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.560 align:middle line:90%
can see by Leonardo.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.960 align:middle line:10%
But also you can
see some of them

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.320 align:middle line:10%
in the famous paintings that
have been performed and done

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.430 align:middle line:10%
where we'll see both Plato
and Pythagoras walking down

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:18.300 align:middle line:10%
large vistas and hallways
that seem to go on

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:22.440 align:middle line:10%
as far as the eye can
see, lending perspective

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.700 align:middle line:10%
and depth to a painting that
otherwise would be absolutely

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:31.140 align:middle line:10%
flat and motionless.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
as we expand our minds

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:39.000 align:middle line:84%
and start to create
new synaptic junctions

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.280 align:middle line:84%
and connect different
parts of our brain

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.110 align:middle line:84%
that somehow it
will have an even

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:49.460 align:middle line:84%
more profound effect on how
we perceive reality itself?

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Some believe that as we move
through higher dimensions

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:57.080 align:middle line:84%
that everything that is
possible in higher dimensions

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.250 align:middle line:90%
is actually around us today.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:03.590 align:middle line:84%
It's simply that we are
unable to perceive it.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:07.760 align:middle line:84%
I believe that drawing
by hand geometry

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.980 align:middle line:84%
changes dramatically
your ability

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.800 align:middle line:90%
to perceive higher dimensions.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:18.170 align:middle line:84%
It is precisely the training
that our brain radio requires

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:22.580 align:middle line:84%
to be able that unlock the
power of the pineal gland

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:26.120 align:middle line:84%
and the pituitary glands
to enlighten and awaken

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:31.870 align:middle line:84%
fully the third eye
and the crown chakras.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.480 align:middle line:84%
This is what
fundamentally changes

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.730 align:middle line:84%
how you perceive the
world and your ability

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:43.090 align:middle line:84%
to answer very complex problems
with simplistic, relatable,

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:47.030 align:middle line:84%
and consistent, and
most importantly,

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:52.160 align:middle line:84%
very, very
understandable answers.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.950 align:middle line:84%
In the process of
drawing geometry,

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:58.680 align:middle line:84%
I took on one of the great
challenges that, of course,

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.330 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo da Vinci also took on
in leaving us the illustration

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.300 align:middle line:90%
of the Vitruvian Man.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.270 align:middle line:84%
The Vitruvian Man
as an illustration

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.510 align:middle line:84%
puts forward this notion
that had already been around

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.600 align:middle line:84%
for several thousand years
of the importance of squaring

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.490 align:middle line:90%
the circle.

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:20.970 align:middle line:84%
The challenge from ancient
times until now has always been,

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:25.100 align:middle line:84%
how do you square a circle to
be able to draw what is referred

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.980 align:middle line:84%
to as unconstructed
numbers because

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.730 align:middle line:84%
of their transcendent
irrationality?

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And without measurement,
it's simply an impossibility.

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:38.900 align:middle line:84%
It is possible to be
able to square a circle

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:42.200 align:middle line:84%
and match the areas of
the square and the circle

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.390 align:middle line:90%
using computer technology.

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:46.130 align:middle line:90%
That's obvious.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:49.940 align:middle line:84%
But doing so without the aid
of any measurement whatsoever

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.790 align:middle line:84%
and to do so in
drawing it by hand?

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.910 align:middle line:84%
Now that is a different
challenge altogether,

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:59.600 align:middle line:84%
and the subject of the challenge
that has been put forward

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.410 align:middle line:84%
since the time of ancient Greek
mathematicians and philosophers

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:04.940 align:middle line:90%
took it on.

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:07.220 align:middle line:84%
It was believed from
that time until now

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:11.660 align:middle line:84%
that somehow if we'd be able to
tackle this task that we would

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.480 align:middle line:84%
be able to achieve a higher
level of understanding

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.060 align:middle line:84%
and awareness and
enlightenment to finally

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.180 align:middle line:84%
bring into balance the
energies of the masculine

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.505 align:middle line:84%
and the feminine
together into one.

00:14:22.505 --> 00:14:25.240 align:middle line:90%


00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.720 align:middle line:10%
In cracking the code that
was left to us by Leonardo da

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.890 align:middle line:10%
Vinci, it also
gave us a blueprint

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:39.970 align:middle line:10%
for how to square the circle
correctly three different ways,

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:45.310 align:middle line:10%
simply following a cipher
key that Leonardo left us

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:49.480 align:middle line:10%
in his square having
an area value compared

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:53.170 align:middle line:10%
to the circle that had
an area value of pi.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:59.250 align:middle line:10%
That relationship was
simply Euler over pi.

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.470 align:middle line:10%
The form of squaring
the circle that he

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:04.470 align:middle line:10%
left us may not have been
the correct form that

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:08.490 align:middle line:10%
mathematicians in the day or
for thousands of years would say

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.920 align:middle line:10%
is actually the correct form.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.310 align:middle line:84%
I believe it is undoubtedly
one of the correct forms,

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:18.660 align:middle line:84%
as we measure scalar waves
that are compressioned,

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:22.860 align:middle line:84%
longitudinal waves of sound,
versus the measurement

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.290 align:middle line:84%
of transverse waves
of light, which

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:30.810 align:middle line:84%
are spiraling all around us
every single day of our lives.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:35.430 align:middle line:84%
When we understand the nature
and relationship of scalar

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:42.390 align:middle line:84%
versus transverse, we note that
the commanding and governing

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.670 align:middle line:84%
bodies and mathematical
constants that

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:49.770 align:middle line:84%
create these associations in the
first place require adjustment.

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:53.100 align:middle line:10%
That adjustment is
found within the ratio

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:57.220 align:middle line:10%
of Euler divided by pi.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:00.130 align:middle line:84%
This irrevocably
comes back to a number

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:02.590 align:middle line:84%
that we all associate
very closely

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:06.100 align:middle line:84%
with that relates to
light, for Euler divided

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:11.590 align:middle line:84%
by pi divided by 2
gives us the square root

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:16.750 align:middle line:84%
of the speed of light, bringing
us back again to approximately

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:20.860 align:middle line:90%
432.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:25.230 align:middle line:84%
432 is a very interesting
number that we find originally

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:29.820 align:middle line:84%
in the form of the tetractys
left to us by Pythagoras

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:37.150 align:middle line:84%
himself, four different
lines of a pyramid.

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:41.440 align:middle line:84%
It starts with four positional
points, goes to three,

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:49.460 align:middle line:84%
then goes to two, then
goes to one, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.310 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned that
eight, eight, eight

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:57.620 align:middle line:84%
is representative of light,
light, light and Christ

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.750 align:middle line:90%
consciousness in particular.

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:03.440 align:middle line:90%
8 plus 8 plus 8 equals 24.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Very interestingly, 4 times 3
times 2 times 1 also equals 24.

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And now we find ourselves
irrevocably back,

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.970 align:middle line:84%
looking at and observing
the 24-hour clock that

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:25.880 align:middle line:84%
is the prime number pattern and
the repetition of all Fibonacci

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.630 align:middle line:90%
numbers infinitely.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:35.880 align:middle line:84%
24 brings with it a certain
degree of access to the divine.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:41.130 align:middle line:84%
24 and its reciprocal value,
42, are very special numbers

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.140 align:middle line:90%
indeed.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:47.940 align:middle line:90%
1 over 24 rounds to 42.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And also we also note that it
is not only its reciprocal,

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.220 align:middle line:90%
but it's also its palindrome.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.310 align:middle line:84%
Palindrome is a fancy
name in mathematics

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:04.200 align:middle line:84%
for describing a number that
when we invert or reverse

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.170 align:middle line:90%
the number has the same digits.

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And so we know that there's some
form of a relationship there.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:15.150 align:middle line:90%
24 backwards would be 42.

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:20.300 align:middle line:10%
So there must be some
universal form that's important

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.780 align:middle line:10%
when constructing the world and
constructing the universe that

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:28.640 align:middle line:10%
says that a number whose inverse
value reciprocal inverse value

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:33.080 align:middle line:10%
is equivalent to its palindrome
has very unique mirroring

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.000 align:middle line:10%
characteristics.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.350 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the reasons
why 24 is so special.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Another reason we
know 24 is so special

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:50.490 align:middle line:84%
is because the square root
of 10, which is 3.16227766,

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:59.080 align:middle line:84%
divided by 10, now taking
that number to 0.316227766,

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:06.400 align:middle line:84%
and then adding 1 to that
value, now 1.316227766,

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:12.790 align:middle line:84%
raised to the exponential
power of 1 over 0.24

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:16.420 align:middle line:84%
is a very, very
close approximation,

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:23.150 align:middle line:84%
much closer than even 22
over 7, for the value of pi.

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:29.130 align:middle line:84%
But how can we take this
knowledge and apply it to art?

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:32.480 align:middle line:84%
How can we take the golden
number and golden ratio

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:37.350 align:middle line:84%
and golden angle and apply
it to artistic expression?

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:40.290 align:middle line:10%
All of my work over
the past many years

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:46.440 align:middle line:10%
now has been a direct result
of this convergence of science

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:51.360 align:middle line:10%
and art into one form,
no longer separated

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.300 align:middle line:10%
between these different,
disparate disciplines,

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.570 align:middle line:10%
but rather convergent
and beautiful

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:06.180 align:middle line:10%
because of its convergence,
not despite its convergence.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.190 align:middle line:84%
As we look at
squaring the circle

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:11.160 align:middle line:84%
and how to actually do this
and draw it out by hand,

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:17.910 align:middle line:84%
we must look at the Euler area
value of the da Vinci square.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, you'll notice that
the da Vinci square barely

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:27.630 align:middle line:84%
crests the lines of the circle
that intersect the square.

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:29.790 align:middle line:10%
This is a unique
characteristic and one

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:32.310 align:middle line:10%
that has been the
subject of some ridicule

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:35.340 align:middle line:10%
from the mathematics community
for several hundred years

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:39.120 align:middle line:10%
now, because what da
Vinci did was nowhere

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:43.680 align:middle line:10%
close to a true squaring of the
circle without the knowledge

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:48.930 align:middle line:10%
that the scalar value
is the equivalent value

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:52.890 align:middle line:10%
to compare against a
transverse value of light.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Effectively, we're looking
at darkness versus light.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.590 align:middle line:10%
Another aspect of this
that we can look at,

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:05.920 align:middle line:10%
though, is that maybe we can
use the da Vinci square in order

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.430 align:middle line:10%
to solve this
age-old riddle of how

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:11.980 align:middle line:10%
to draw by hand
without any measurement

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:15.670 align:middle line:10%
whatsoever a perfect
squaring of the circle,

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:22.140 align:middle line:10%
and not only do so to perfectly
square the circle in area,

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:24.860 align:middle line:10%
but has da Vinci
given us the ability

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:30.980 align:middle line:10%
now through his cipher key
and 500-year-old plus drawing

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:34.940 align:middle line:10%
the ability also to
square the perimeter so

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.520 align:middle line:10%
that it is equivalent
to the circumference

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.760 align:middle line:10%
of the same circle?

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.250 align:middle line:84%
Three ways to
square the circle--

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:47.600 align:middle line:84%
the da Vinci method, the
area squaring method,

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:51.380 align:middle line:84%
and the perimeter
circumference squaring method.

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that
they're all hidden

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:58.820 align:middle line:84%
within the simplistic and
elegant form of da Vinci

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:05.300 align:middle line:84%
square, the Euler value versus
the pi value of the circle?

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:10.400 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo was famous for
saying that simplicity

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.090 align:middle line:90%
is the ultimate sophistication.

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:19.280 align:middle line:84%
I believe he has 100%
embodied that core principle

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:24.180 align:middle line:84%
in his masterpiece
work, the Vitruvian Man.

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:28.170 align:middle line:84%
I encourage you to try
drawing it for yourself.

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:31.320 align:middle line:10%
There's something, again,
that is very powerful

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:35.130 align:middle line:10%
that relates to consciousness
and our own meditation

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:40.260 align:middle line:10%
and conscious awareness when we
take the effort to draw using

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.915 align:middle line:10%
only a compass and a square.

00:22:42.915 --> 00:22:47.030 align:middle line:90%


00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Art is something that emerges
from the heart, the heart

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.660 align:middle line:90%
center.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:56.530 align:middle line:10%
Science is something that
connects the dots for us

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:59.620 align:middle line:10%
in our logical mind.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:04.660 align:middle line:84%
As we draw geometry, we
learn and we teach our mind

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:10.450 align:middle line:84%
how to contextualize and bring
perspective, new ways of seeing

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:14.170 align:middle line:90%
the world to our consciousness.

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:16.840 align:middle line:84%
I believe that fundamentally
changes our ability

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.150 align:middle line:90%
to perceive higher dimensions.

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And pattern recognition becomes
a fundamental way for us

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:30.260 align:middle line:84%
to be able to look at our own
level of conscious progression.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:34.960 align:middle line:84%
This is not learning nameless,
faceless mathematics.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:40.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about making an
expression from the heart.

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:43.120 align:middle line:84%
As you make that
expression from the heart,

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:48.080 align:middle line:84%
that effort starts to
meld with the mind,

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:54.540 align:middle line:84%
again, bringing together
logos and pathos into one.

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:58.530 align:middle line:84%
This will change how
you perceive the world.

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:02.970 align:middle line:10%
And by taking the effort
even to hand draw out

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:06.390 align:middle line:10%
the geometry of squaring
the circle, given

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:10.500 align:middle line:10%
to us as a gift from
Leonardo da Vinci himself

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:14.580 align:middle line:10%
over 500 years ago,
I fundamentally

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.790 align:middle line:10%
believe we will
start to embody what

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:21.090 align:middle line:10%
it means to be
the change that we

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:24.060 align:middle line:10%
would like to see in the world.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:28.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm Robert Grant and
this is the "Code X."
