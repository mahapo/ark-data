00:00:08.946 --> 00:00:12.425 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.425 --> 00:00:23.860 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.660 align:middle line:10%
>> We choose community
as a way to enlight,

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.810 align:middle line:10%
to metamorphosize ourself.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.793 align:middle line:10%
So Damanhur, it's
literally, or at least,

00:00:34.793 --> 00:00:36.960 align:middle line:10%
coming to Damanhur, because
Damanhur is many things.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.680 align:middle line:84%
It's obviously
intentional community.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.350 align:middle line:84%
It's art, it's education,
it is the protection

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.690 align:middle line:90%
of the environment.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.120 align:middle line:84%
It's actually almost
every single side of life.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Damanhur is most of all,
a spiritual mission.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Is the mission, is the project
related to the creation

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.100 align:middle line:90%
of this new timeline?

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.520 align:middle line:84%
So the different technology--
if we want to talk about that--

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.010 align:middle line:84%
the technology that you
can find in the temple.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.050 align:middle line:84%
The technology that
you can find when

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.130 align:middle line:84%
we are talking about
Selficas for example,

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.990 align:middle line:84%
or the cabins or all
these different things

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.850 align:middle line:84%
that they look, really,
a piece of future.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:29.390 align:middle line:10%
They are all being recalled here
to support all this project.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.080 align:middle line:84%
The temple of humankind, the
underground temple, you know,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.670 align:middle line:84%
is the largest
underground temple

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.950 align:middle line:90%
that existed in the world.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.990 align:middle line:84%
It's more than
6,000 square meters

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.930 align:middle line:84%
that we actually build
by hands, by all of us,

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.230 align:middle line:84%
all Damanhurians, at least
my generation, the generation

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.680 align:middle line:90%
of the builder of the temple.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And then, obviously, all the
other generation that has been,

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.100 align:middle line:84%
you know, keeping the temple
more and more alive, more

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.430 align:middle line:84%
and more in reach of
meanings and significance.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.810 align:middle line:10%
So some of these technology
are technology that they

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.880 align:middle line:10%
can arrive from a future.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.880 align:middle line:90%
Or if you want, from the past.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.227 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's interesting to see
how in time, more you go back,

00:02:13.227 --> 00:02:14.810 align:middle line:84%
and more we looks
to go to the future.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.010 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.340 align:middle line:10%
Part of the knowledge
that Falco brought back,

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.340 align:middle line:10%
it's really related to
what we call Selfica.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.940 align:middle line:84%
There is a book that
is the last book

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.520 align:middle line:84%
that Falco wrote
before he's past,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.110 align:middle line:90%
that is called "The Alchemist."

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.970 align:middle line:84%
In this book,
there is a chapter,

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.940 align:middle line:84%
a tale that is very
interesting, because he's is

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.060 align:middle line:90%
talking about a sphere.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, probably this name
doesn't make any sense for you.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.570 align:middle line:84%
But in that tale, Falco is
talking about the reconnection

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.900 align:middle line:90%
with the world of the spirals.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Or, if you want, the
world of the Selficas.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.170 align:middle line:10%
The same name self, in ancient
language, means spiral.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.590 align:middle line:84%
This is why I talk about
the world of the spirals.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, we can give
many different interpretation

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.040 align:middle line:90%
of the Selfica.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.870 align:middle line:84%
But I would love with you
to go from the simple one,

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.680 align:middle line:84%
to something that is getting
probably even more interesting.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.020 align:middle line:10%
The Selfica are all
these tools, instrument--

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.270 align:middle line:10%
mostly done with copper--

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.870 align:middle line:10%
with a lot of shape, of geometry
that are following spirals,

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.360 align:middle line:10%
but not only.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.990 align:middle line:10%
Materials that they can
use copper-- but, again,

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.860 align:middle line:10%
also other metals, even more
precious, like gold or silver--

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.570 align:middle line:10%
that are using also
stones, liquids, crystals,

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.050 align:middle line:10%
and many, many different
kind of materials.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And the Selfica are literally
in the first interpretation,

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.730 align:middle line:90%
instruments that are doing what?

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, thanks to the sacred
geometry, the symbols

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.520 align:middle line:84%
that naturally they
are attracting energy,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.750 align:middle line:84%
or they are giving
energy like the spiral.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.710 align:middle line:84%
Because the spiral, you know,
is one of the most important

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.640 align:middle line:90%
sacred geometry.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.590 align:middle line:84%
That can concentrate as
can the spirit energy,

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.060 align:middle line:84%
could be a channel of
connection between energy

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.730 align:middle line:84%
that are going deep inside,
or very high outside.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Because the spiral is not only
the flat one that we may see,

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.520 align:middle line:84%
but is literally
like a double spiral,

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.040 align:middle line:84%
one that is spinning up, and
one that is spinning down.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Creating like, you know,
a channel, a portal,

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.670 align:middle line:84%
that connect energy in
many different sense.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.820 align:middle line:10%
So the Selficas
are not just tools

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.550 align:middle line:10%
that using the sacred
geometry, and the property

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.280 align:middle line:10%
of the materials,
are doing what?

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Literally again, catalyzing
the vital energy,

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.720 align:middle line:84%
transform it, and then give it
back for many different purpose

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.770 align:middle line:90%
or helps.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.990 align:middle line:10%
Well, this is at least the easy
interpretation of the Selfica.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.340 align:middle line:84%
Knowing that there's
nothing invented by Falco.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.920 align:middle line:84%
But this is, again,
an ancient knowledge.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.770 align:middle line:84%
If you go in many
museums of the world--

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.490 align:middle line:84%
I can mention the museum
in North of Europe,

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.650 align:middle line:90%
about a pre-Viking civilization.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.780 align:middle line:84%
But I can definitely also
invite you to go and visit

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.600 align:middle line:84%
some museum about
the Native Americans

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.430 align:middle line:90%
here in the United States.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.500 align:middle line:10%
Or in many museum in
Egypt, or in Mexico,

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.810 align:middle line:10%
you're going to see that
older civilization--

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.000 align:middle line:10%
even if they are so far away--

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.980 align:middle line:10%
they have pieces, bracelets,
rings, and other instruments

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.740 align:middle line:10%
that are perfect Selficas.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.800 align:middle line:10%
Following precisely measure
turns, symbols and element

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.510 align:middle line:10%
that are literally recalling
energy, recalling vital energy.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.920 align:middle line:84%
But as I promised, this is
just the first interpretation

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.210 align:middle line:90%
of Selfica.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And talking about
Falco, very young,

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.220 align:middle line:84%
having these first
connection with sphere,

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.190 align:middle line:84%
it's probably make you
understand that these,

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.890 align:middle line:90%
it's just the first part.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.870 align:middle line:90%


00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.320 align:middle line:10%
Sphere, literally, it's
like an intelligence.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:20.860 align:middle line:10%
It's an energy, an intelligent
energy that is coming back.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:26.230 align:middle line:10%
As many of these beings
connecting to this planet,

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.260 align:middle line:10%
connecting to the
reawakening of this planet,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.270 align:middle line:10%
connecting to the
spiritualization

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.800 align:middle line:10%
of the matter, at least in this
part of the universe of form.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.830 align:middle line:84%
Probably part of
an alliance that

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.180 align:middle line:84%
is being part of the human
kind a long time ago.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe we lost this
alliance, we lost them,

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.410 align:middle line:90%
or the connection with them.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And now that we are in such
a crucial, important moment,

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.960 align:middle line:90%
they might be back with us.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Back in a moment where finally,
things, they might change.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:00.520 align:middle line:84%
They may give a new opportunity
for the planet earth.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.000 align:middle line:10%
So this first
connection with sphere,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.300 align:middle line:10%
it's really the connection
with the world of the Selficas.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And in other hands,
what they are?

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Yes, intelligence, energies
that they cannot manifest,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.300 align:middle line:84%
as we are manifesting
with this body.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's like,
imagine that they

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.090 align:middle line:84%
are coming from another universe
that is vibrating differently.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.310 align:middle line:84%
So like an energy that
vibrate differently need

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.520 align:middle line:84%
a different body that
probably is not like ours.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.250 align:middle line:84%
But in this case,
could be a metal body.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:35.950 align:middle line:10%
Another interpretation, in
ancient language, of Selfica,

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:41.050 align:middle line:10%
is also the inhabitants
of the metals.

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:45.340 align:middle line:10%
So all that spirals, all
that perfect measure,

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.430 align:middle line:10%
all that angles,
triangles, materials,

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.870 align:middle line:10%
are like a perfect body
to welcome these energies,

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:56.860 align:middle line:10%
to welcome this intelligence
inside of that bracelet,

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.090 align:middle line:10%
of the ring.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:59.740 align:middle line:10%
Or that outer
structure that we call

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.010 align:middle line:10%
Selfica, or sphere Selfica.

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:05.020 align:middle line:84%
So not only something
that has got alliance

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.210 align:middle line:84%
in energy, but
actually is containing

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:08.860 align:middle line:90%
an intelligent energy.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:13.150 align:middle line:84%
That at this point, it's
here, at our service,

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.470 align:middle line:84%
at our disposal,
to support what?

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, to support our
spiritual achievement.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.290 align:middle line:84%
To support our action,
to support our free

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:26.140 align:middle line:84%
will, even if sometimes
we might do mistakes,

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.720 align:middle line:84%
as we already discovered
talking about free will.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.510 align:middle line:10%
But they are there
for us completely,

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.760 align:middle line:10%
totally at our service.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the service could
be then interpreted

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:40.390 align:middle line:84%
as the function of the spiral,
the function of the Selfica.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.610 align:middle line:10%
But to tell you the
truth, it's much more.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a truly support for
our life and for our evolution.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.983 align:middle line:84%
So the world of the spirals
and the world of the Selfica,

00:08:50.983 --> 00:08:52.650 align:middle line:84%
they've been playing,
and they are still

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:59.830 align:middle line:84%
playing a very important role
in these spiritual battle,

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.550 align:middle line:84%
if you will want to say
that, that in this case

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:06.030 align:middle line:84%
is very much connected to the
separation of the timeline.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.630 align:middle line:84%
What people don't know is
that the largest Selfica

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.400 align:middle line:90%
in the planet is the temple.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.840 align:middle line:84%
So if you've been lucky
to visit the temple--

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.140 align:middle line:84%
and I can just hope
that you will come soon

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.740 align:middle line:84%
to have a real spiritual
experience in a place that

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.350 align:middle line:84%
is talking through
the sacred geometry,

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.240 align:middle line:90%
directly to your soul.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.070 align:middle line:84%
That is a place
where you can find

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.350 align:middle line:90%
whatever you're looking for.

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, the temple, inside of
these walls, floors, ceiling--

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.600 align:middle line:84%
well, inside of them,
everywhere, it's

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:47.100 align:middle line:84%
full of tons and tons
of Selfica circles.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Miles and miles
or Selfica circles

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:52.840 align:middle line:84%
that are connecting the
entire temple, chamber

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.710 align:middle line:84%
after the chambers,
piece after piece.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you might see a
little piece of copper coming

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:02.100 align:middle line:90%
out from the wall randomly.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.020 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's not randomly.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:08.220 align:middle line:84%
These are the connector
to the entire Selfica

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.370 align:middle line:84%
net that is all
around the temple,

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:15.580 align:middle line:84%
connecting every single
part of the temple.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.700 align:middle line:10%
So you can imagine
that the temple is not

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.900 align:middle line:10%
only these other place that is
following the sacred geometry,

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:27.150 align:middle line:10%
that are perfectly plugged into
these huge source of energy

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.490 align:middle line:10%
that we call synchronic lines.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Four of them are passing in that
era, are passing underground,

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.870 align:middle line:84%
are literally
entering in connection

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.150 align:middle line:84%
with the different
chambers of the temple.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:44.200 align:middle line:10%
But the temple is also
the largest Selfica.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.390 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that this
Selfica is becoming

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:49.660 align:middle line:84%
like an antenna, an
antenna that is able

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.350 align:middle line:84%
then to connect with a Selfica
net that is being created

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.210 align:middle line:90%
all over the planet.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:58.240 align:middle line:84%
These are Selficas
that they are being

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.090 align:middle line:84%
located in different points
of the on the planet Earth.

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And they are host
by other individual

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:08.080 align:middle line:84%
all over the planet,
creating a sort of light net

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.240 align:middle line:84%
that refer, obviously,
to the temple,

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.810 align:middle line:84%
and to connection with
the synchronic lines.

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:17.460 align:middle line:84%
So this is obviously
another interpretation

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:18.940 align:middle line:90%
of what is Selfica.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And this can also help
us, then, to understand

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.120 align:middle line:90%
the evolution of the Selfica.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.790 align:middle line:84%
I've been mention, for
example, the name sphere cell.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:30.400 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that
these circles, they

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.580 align:middle line:84%
could be connected, for
example, with spheres.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.400 align:middle line:10%
Spheres full filled
with liquids,

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.450 align:middle line:10%
alchemy liquids
that are performing

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.520 align:middle line:10%
more function at the same time.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.190 align:middle line:10%
But I can talk
also about Selfica,

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:49.120 align:middle line:10%
that is very similar to the
idea of the microprocessor

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.730 align:middle line:10%
of our computers or smartphones.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:56.350 align:middle line:10%
So circles of Selfica that
are being literally created

00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:01.480 align:middle line:10%
in a very small space, able to
catalyze an enormous quantity

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.190 align:middle line:10%
of information.

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.220 align:middle line:84%
In layers on top of other
layers, on top of other layers

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:10.960 align:middle line:84%
are creating Selfica that we
can mention as personal self.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.350 align:middle line:84%
So something that has been
designed exactly on your karma,

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:16.540 align:middle line:84%
on your soul journey,
in supporting what

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.750 align:middle line:84%
you individually, and you
synchronicity in your everyday

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:24.340 align:middle line:84%
life, need to guide you to
the direction of the mission.

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.910 align:middle line:84%
We can also talk about probably
the most complex expression

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:31.780 align:middle line:84%
of Selfic, that are
the Selfic paintings.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.910 align:middle line:84%
You might know or not, but
Falco's been known also

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:36.250 align:middle line:90%
like a very talented artist.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:39.820 align:middle line:84%
But again, well, not just
because he was a painter,

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:44.590 align:middle line:84%
but because his
painting are Selfic.

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:48.390 align:middle line:84%
It means that every single
color, alchemy speaking,

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:54.620 align:middle line:84%
is been transform first to
have the same values of metals.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.650 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, on
the canvas, you

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.260 align:middle line:90%
can create much complex Selfica.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.390 align:middle line:84%
Putting, again,
layers and layers

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:04.600 align:middle line:84%
of these paintings in
one, creating something

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.800 align:middle line:84%
that is going to interact
not only with the owner

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.530 align:middle line:84%
of the painting or the Selfica,
but also with the environment,

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:16.840 align:middle line:84%
or with who is going to
observe the painting.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:22.660 align:middle line:84%
So a very complex technique
that make possible to create,

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.780 align:middle line:84%
to attract intelligence
that otherwise they will not

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:29.660 align:middle line:90%
be able to be connected with.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.320 align:middle line:84%
So as you see, there is an
evolution of the Selfica,

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.190 align:middle line:84%
and this evolution
is directly connected

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.560 align:middle line:84%
to the different possibility
and different function

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:43.610 align:middle line:84%
that we have in Damanhur,
mostly to the temple.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:48.110 align:middle line:10%
To mention another one, I
can talk about the cabin.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:49.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, I know the
idea of the cabin,

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.370 align:middle line:84%
or the name cabin doesn't
sound very charming,

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:54.360 align:middle line:90%
or we can really confuse you.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.550 align:middle line:84%
We are trying to translate
terms in Italian in English.

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And even if you can
understand the meaning,

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:03.980 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it's really
hard to name something

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:07.010 align:middle line:84%
that, it doesn't exist,
or was not existent

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:08.810 align:middle line:90%
until it has been created.

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:10.760 align:middle line:84%
But I want just now
to talk very briefly

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.370 align:middle line:84%
about the cabins that
are literally, again,

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:15.260 align:middle line:90%
another piece of the future.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.330 align:middle line:10%
Cabins that are in
the temple but also

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.700 align:middle line:10%
in other places in
Damanhur, with all

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:24.060 align:middle line:10%
these different long bars
in different materials.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.920 align:middle line:10%
Copper, for sure, but not only.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.450 align:middle line:84%
With sphere cell that are
connected with these bars,

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:34.860 align:middle line:90%
with different energy sources.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example,
magnetic field.

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:40.680 align:middle line:84%
Also the use of different
kind of frequencies of sound,

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:44.370 align:middle line:84%
different kind of vibration
that literally are making,

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:49.620 align:middle line:84%
vibrating the bars and the
entire structure of the cabin.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Cabin that is
creating an isolate,

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:57.240 align:middle line:84%
a very specific
energetic fielding sight.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.840 align:middle line:84%
But also, for example, use of
laser, of different frequencies

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.150 align:middle line:84%
of light, that
they can literally

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:06.870 align:middle line:84%
activate the different liquids
inside of this sphere cell.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I'm just
brushing very quickly

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:13.140 align:middle line:84%
everything, because
obviously there

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.240 align:middle line:90%
is much more technical element.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.490 align:middle line:84%
But what is possible, for
example, to do with a cabin?

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:19.710 align:middle line:10%
Well, in the cabin,
you can really

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:25.140 align:middle line:10%
transform inside of them,
time, space, and dimension.

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:29.610 align:middle line:84%
We talk about the cabin
as the time machine,

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:34.080 align:middle line:84%
or one of the instrument to
make the time travel possible.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.420 align:middle line:84%
But they are incredible
instruments also

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.340 align:middle line:90%
for many other reasons.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.500 align:middle line:84%
Also reason that I'm more
connected to the person,

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.300 align:middle line:90%
and to the need of the person.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Or connecting to transfer
a memory, or experience,

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:47.940 align:middle line:90%
and many other things.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.360 align:middle line:84%
But coming back to the magical
function of the temple,

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.410 align:middle line:84%
well, we can really imagine
that every single chambers

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:58.830 align:middle line:84%
inside of the temple
is using and performing

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:00.970 align:middle line:90%
different element.

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:02.640 align:middle line:84%
We also talk about
element that we

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.630 align:middle line:84%
are sharing with people,
with everyone, with guests.

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:09.360 align:middle line:84%
I have to remind you that
also some of the experience

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.430 align:middle line:84%
that we are proposing
in the mystery school,

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.340 align:middle line:84%
or in this seminar that we
are teaching in Damanhur,

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.570 align:middle line:90%
they are done in the temple.

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes also spending an
entire night in the temple.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.380 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:25.560 align:middle line:84%
Because in some special occasion
we can definitely open function

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:29.490 align:middle line:84%
that otherwise that
would be reserved only

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.280 align:middle line:90%
for the Damanhurians.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.910 align:middle line:84%
In particular, I could
talk about the function

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:38.677 align:middle line:90%
of the hall of the mirror.

00:16:38.677 --> 00:16:41.010 align:middle line:84%
The hall of the mirror is the
largest room that we have,

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:42.870 align:middle line:84%
the largest chambers
in the temple,

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:46.330 align:middle line:84%
is the one covered
by all these mirrors.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And the hall of
mirror, for example,

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:53.850 align:middle line:84%
it's one of the chambers that
we use for communication.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Let me frame it a little bit
better, what is communication.

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:58.810 align:middle line:10%
Well, I told you that
temple is an antenna,

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:03.160 align:middle line:10%
but it's not only an antenna
for the planet earth.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.099 align:middle line:84%
It's an antenna through
the synchronic lines

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:06.940 align:middle line:90%
from everywhere.

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:10.050 align:middle line:84%
The synchronic lines, you maybe
remember from other episode,

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:11.400 align:middle line:90%
they are a 18--

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.180 align:middle line:84%
nine moving vertically,
nine moving horizontally.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.369 align:middle line:84%
And the vertical one
close to the pole,

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:19.200 align:middle line:84%
they are creating a
double spiral that

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:23.190 align:middle line:84%
are standing themselves an
entire solar system, connecting

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:26.160 align:middle line:84%
with the outer synchronic lines
coming from the other planet,

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.590 align:middle line:84%
and then from the sun,
they are all coming out,

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:middle line:90%
connecting to the rest.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:35.610 align:middle line:84%
Outside of the planet, we
call them the star lines.

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:39.970 align:middle line:10%
Or we also call them the,
life lines, because you might

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.810 align:middle line:10%
remember, it's from
the synchronic lines

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:45.660 align:middle line:10%
that the souls are
moving from one

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.610 align:middle line:10%
incarnation to
another incarnation,

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:49.850 align:middle line:10%
to one planet to
one other planet.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:54.250 align:middle line:84%
To one place of evolution, to
another place of evolution.

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:57.090 align:middle line:84%
So the synchronic lines,
or this star lies,

00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:00.280 align:middle line:84%
they are the real
connection with everything.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:03.630 align:middle line:84%
So for example, during the
equinox and the solstice,

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:06.660 align:middle line:84%
as you know, are the
most important rhythm

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.640 align:middle line:84%
of the planet, rhythm
connecting to the nature.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:13.110 align:middle line:84%
But literally connecting
also to the opening

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:14.790 align:middle line:84%
and closing of the
synchronic lines.

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Or, if you want, the pulsation
of the synchronic lines.

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we are opening
the experience to contact.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.350 align:middle line:84%
We call this seminar the
contact with the cosmos.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.770 align:middle line:84%
Literally it's an opportunity--
one day and one night

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.030 align:middle line:90%
in the temple--

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:33.330 align:middle line:84%
to use the chambers, and
also some other instrument

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:34.580 align:middle line:90%
like the spheres.

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.920 align:middle line:84%
You remember, we talk about
them, for example, talking

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.080 align:middle line:90%
about the perspective of time.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.060 align:middle line:84%
We talk about them
also connecting

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:44.550 align:middle line:84%
to the synchronic lines
to receive and to give

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:48.870 align:middle line:84%
again information, or dreams,
or inspiration, or other things.

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Well in that specific night,
in this specific moment

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:56.940 align:middle line:84%
of the year, temple is
becoming like a radio, a radio

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:58.116 align:middle line:90%
transmitter.

00:18:58.116 --> 00:19:01.330 align:middle line:84%
So you can send messages,
you can receive messages.

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:03.100 align:middle line:90%
From where?

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.910 align:middle line:90%
Everywhere.

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And messages in
this case, they can

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:09.640 align:middle line:84%
arrive in many different
way, telepathically.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Through the vision
inside of the spheres,

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:16.030 align:middle line:84%
through an energetic
connection, through whatever

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:18.700 align:middle line:84%
your fantasy can give you
limitation about that.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And we are inviting
whoever wants to be

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:23.710 align:middle line:90%
in this experience, even guest.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:25.570 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely open.

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:29.210 align:middle line:84%
To live this experience of
connecting with something,

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:32.320 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is, that
is a line, obviously,

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:36.440 align:middle line:84%
to our spiritual path, and to
the project that I told you.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:40.840 align:middle line:10%
To, well, increase
our consciousness,

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.930 align:middle line:10%
to understand even
better we are not alone,

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:47.240 align:middle line:10%
and that we are part
of a bigger game.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:51.910 align:middle line:84%
To make it an extraordinary
experience that will,

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:54.820 align:middle line:84%
let's say, support
your transformation,

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.340 align:middle line:90%
and your choices in life.

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously we can give
many different meanings.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.250 align:middle line:10%
But is one of the
possibilities that the temple

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:08.290 align:middle line:10%
and that specific function of
that hall mirror is giving us.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Another experience, even
if it's a different kind

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:15.940 align:middle line:84%
of communication or connection,
is also the experience

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.370 align:middle line:84%
that we can do in a
sort of third level

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:21.640 align:middle line:90%
of the astral traveling.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, we might brief talk about
this incredible possibility

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.140 align:middle line:84%
that every human
being is containing.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just for a few
people, or for the chooses one.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:37.090 align:middle line:84%
No, everyone is the choose one,
in the true sense that we all

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:40.030 align:middle line:84%
have this potential,
all the potential.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:42.190 align:middle line:10%
And then we can
recognize this potential,

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:45.620 align:middle line:10%
nourish, train,
and use it correct.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.730 align:middle line:84%
So for example, another
function that we use in

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:53.080 align:middle line:84%
that chamber is to literally
help people to increase

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.860 align:middle line:84%
their capacity, temporary,
to leave your physical body,

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.720 align:middle line:84%
and to then travel
with the astral body.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.140 align:middle line:90%
And then do what?

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, travel, discover,
explore that enormous place

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.730 align:middle line:84%
of information that
is the threshold.

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:13.540 align:middle line:84%
I've been some time describing
the threshold like the aura

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.280 align:middle line:90%
of the universe of form.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.160 align:middle line:10%
Or in a more, let's
say, modern terms,

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.520 align:middle line:10%
it's like an enormous iCloud.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.160 align:middle line:10%
Yes, in a true
sense of the cloud

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:27.130 align:middle line:10%
that is hosting all our
information, all our pictures,

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.200 align:middle line:10%
all our music, and all
these kind of things

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.450 align:middle line:10%
that for us are very precious.

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:34.180 align:middle line:10%
Well, let's imagine that there
is a sort of a iCloud over

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.780 align:middle line:10%
the entire universe of
form that is containing all

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:40.360 align:middle line:10%
the experience, all
the information,

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.510 align:middle line:10%
all the knowledge of the
humankind all along the entire

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:46.970 align:middle line:10%
history, even the history
that we cannot even imagine.

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:50.530 align:middle line:10%
So in these enormous
library, we are experience

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:54.820 align:middle line:10%
an out of body experience, well,
we are literally traveling,

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:58.210 align:middle line:10%
we are literally exploring, we
are literally entering contact

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:00.040 align:middle line:10%
with this information.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:03.520 align:middle line:84%
As it permeates
every chambers, it's

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:07.840 align:middle line:84%
connecting to different
to different function.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to mention
also the hall of the water.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Not only because it's
one of my favorites,

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.310 align:middle line:84%
not only because the
hall of the water

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:25.570 align:middle line:84%
is in the wall, the first Selfic
painting that Falco created.

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Probably you can
recognize this chamber

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:31.720 align:middle line:84%
because there is all
these very interesting,

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:37.240 align:middle line:84%
intriguing symbols, and
signs, in and languages,

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.030 align:middle line:84%
and ancestral
archetype languages

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:45.040 align:middle line:84%
that Falco literally paints
all around the chamber.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.560 align:middle line:84%
It's literally a
book of knowledge.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:51.220 align:middle line:84%
It's literally the
place of the memory.

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.410 align:middle line:84%
To be more specific,
the hall of water

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:58.090 align:middle line:84%
was one of the first chambers
that we create, because this

00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:00.760 align:middle line:90%
is the place of the birth.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.610 align:middle line:84%
But also the place
of the reincarnation.

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:06.910 align:middle line:84%
To be more specific-- but this
could be a completely other

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:08.690 align:middle line:90%
topic--

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:11.650 align:middle line:84%
this is where it's
possible, literally,

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:15.220 align:middle line:84%
to guide the future
reincarnation.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Yes, like many
civilizations in the past--

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:22.690 align:middle line:84%
I can mention again
Egyptian, Mayas, Incas--

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:28.390 align:middle line:84%
and all of them, they bond
to these incredible refine

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:31.360 align:middle line:90%
elements regarding the death.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:36.010 align:middle line:10%
But of the death, is not just
the mummification, or the tomb,

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:38.230 align:middle line:10%
and all these different
object an element

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:42.370 align:middle line:10%
that there was in
keeping with the person

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:44.660 align:middle line:10%
that he was just passed.

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.290 align:middle line:10%
But for them, the
death was representing

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:51.040 align:middle line:10%
most of all the journey
after the death.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.720 align:middle line:90%
That is the specific element.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:57.700 align:middle line:84%
This is really the goal of all
these incredible investment

00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:58.920 align:middle line:90%
that they did.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:03.200 align:middle line:84%
So was about the capacity of
the soul to travel from where?

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:08.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, in spiritual physic,
we talk about the soul

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.630 align:middle line:84%
that from the form,
the universe of form

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:14.980 align:middle line:84%
is crossing the threshold, and
then coming back to the real,

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:16.930 align:middle line:90%
from where we all arrive.

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And then when we
are able, when it's

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:21.880 align:middle line:84%
time to be reincarnated from
the real, to the threshold,

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.290 align:middle line:90%
to the form again.

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:27.520 align:middle line:84%
But what could be a
very interesting element

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:28.890 align:middle line:90%
of this journey?

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Being able to
guide this journey,

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.770 align:middle line:90%
to program this journey.

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:35.380 align:middle line:84%
So to program our
incarnation, to do what?

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:36.290 align:middle line:90%
To come back?

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:38.200 align:middle line:84%
In the right time,
in the right place,

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.150 align:middle line:90%
to continue what we left.

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:44.080 align:middle line:10%
So the hall of
water, for us, it's

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.380 align:middle line:10%
a chamber that is all
connecting to that.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.870 align:middle line:10%
So connecting to the
possibility to give us

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:52.390 align:middle line:10%
the right, as
Damanhurians, to come back.

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And at least being able
to accomplish the mission

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:57.610 align:middle line:84%
that, as you remember,
is a mission that will be

00:24:57.610 --> 00:25:01.480 align:middle line:84%
probably accomplished only
in a future of 600 years,

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:07.870 align:middle line:84%
when the new timeline will
substitute the old timeline.

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:10.140 align:middle line:84%
To talk about the
chamber as well,

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:14.740 align:middle line:84%
we can also talk about
the hall of the metals.

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.900 align:middle line:84%
So the hall of
metals, it's very much

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:20.860 align:middle line:84%
connecting to the
eight age of a life.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:25.340 align:middle line:10%
Yes, there are eight principal
age that we are crossing--

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.190 align:middle line:10%
with different meanings,
with different significant--

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:31.310 align:middle line:10%
that are really the process
into an entire life,

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:36.860 align:middle line:10%
from our childhood to one we
get definitely much mature.

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.140 align:middle line:84%
But what is interesting,
also, of these chambers

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:42.950 align:middle line:84%
is that this is directly
connecting to the beyond.

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes, to the threshold.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:50.150 align:middle line:10%
In the true sense that we are
opening a sort of connection

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:52.100 align:middle line:10%
with the beyond.

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Connection that is also
connected to our initiate,

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.890 align:middle line:84%
the initiate that had
been already passed,

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:00.770 align:middle line:84%
and that we believe they are
going in a specific place

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:02.090 align:middle line:90%
of this threshold.

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:05.990 align:middle line:84%
To support, to help, to give us,
still, and to interact with us,

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:middle line:84%
still, you know,
in a way that could

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.690 align:middle line:84%
be useful for the
spiritual project.

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And that is all related to
the function of this chamber.

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:21.770 align:middle line:84%
So for us, for me,
Damanhur, the temple

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:23.540 align:middle line:84%
is a place of
pilgrimage, a place

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:27.060 align:middle line:84%
that at least once in your
life, you have to be there.

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.060 align:middle line:84%
You have to be in
contact with that energy.

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Beside that you may agree
or disagree with Damanhur,

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:33.470 align:middle line:90%
beside the Damanhurians.

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, the temple is represent
one of these places--

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.440 align:middle line:84%
not the only one,
but one of them--

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.260 align:middle line:84%
one of these place where you can
find what you're looking for,

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:45.020 align:middle line:84%
in a moment of life,
maybe, that is not so easy.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Or even a moment in life
where you are really looking

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:49.670 align:middle line:90%
to new meanings in your life.

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Just be there, just
meditate there.

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Just being silent there,
just walking there,

00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:00.000 align:middle line:84%
it will really
talk to your soul.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.390 align:middle line:84%
It will really talk to
the deepest part of you.

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:03.770 align:middle line:84%
It will really
give you something

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:05.420 align:middle line:90%
that probably is not rational.

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not just the
message that you're

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.920 align:middle line:84%
going to feel in your
mind or in your head.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.490 align:middle line:84%
No, it's something that
is working much deeper.

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:14.990 align:middle line:84%
It's working in your dreams,
it's working in your intuition,

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:18.470 align:middle line:84%
is working in your inspiration,
it's working in your thoughts.

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
you realize that you

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.960 align:middle line:84%
have all the energy, all
the strength, and all

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.080 align:middle line:84%
the synchronicity
to change your life.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is the hope that
I really give to everyone.
