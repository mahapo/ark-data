00:00:12.818 --> 00:00:24.160 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Future-- why not to talk
about a little bit about

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.730 align:middle line:10%
the future?

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.280 align:middle line:10%
And I'm very excited to talk
about that, because this

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.070 align:middle line:10%
is directly connected
to the reason

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.110 align:middle line:10%
why Damanhur is existing.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.960 align:middle line:10%
And it's in this
context that I love

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.120 align:middle line:10%
to go, more or less, 600
years into the future.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.810 align:middle line:84%
It's another point of
the time territory.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's a point
where, let's say,

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.050 align:middle line:84%
in a council of these light
beings of this intelligence

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.870 align:middle line:84%
of these people that
are literally, you know,

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.520 align:middle line:90%
radiant light.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And a message arrived talking
about our planet, the planet

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.850 align:middle line:90%
Earth.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's a message
that can give us

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.670 align:middle line:84%
the sense that something will
happen soon to the planet

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.460 align:middle line:90%
Earth, a sort of end.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.820 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if the end is
a destruction of the planet

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.450 align:middle line:84%
because there's going
to be nuclear explosion.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.720 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if it's going
to be a physical event

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.530 align:middle line:84%
or maybe also to
lose the divine spark

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.690 align:middle line:84%
that is the level of
containing the soul.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.610 align:middle line:90%
So we have many theories.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And obviously this
is a tale that

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.930 align:middle line:84%
will help us to
understand something that

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.030 align:middle line:90%
goes beyond our human logic.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.280 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that this
council is now sitting,

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.690 align:middle line:84%
discussing to see what
could be the possible future

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:50.530 align:middle line:90%
of this planet.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.730 align:middle line:90%
Let this planet go?

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a planet
where they've been repeating

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.170 align:middle line:90%
many times the same situation.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.610 align:middle line:84%
So why to give another
chance where, you know,

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.070 align:middle line:84%
fear the people of this planet
are not learning from the past?

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.590 align:middle line:84%
They are keeping
repeating the same things.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Instead of saying, well not, we
cannot let go our planet that

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.750 align:middle line:84%
actually was so important
because it is a planet that has

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.180 align:middle line:84%
been hosting a long
time ago one capital,

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.670 align:middle line:84%
a capital of one of these
human time empires or galactic

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.610 align:middle line:90%
empires a long time ago.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know that that moment
was the moment of Atlantis.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.580 align:middle line:84%
So Atlantis was not only
an important civilization,

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.590 align:middle line:84%
but Atlantis was really
the capital of something

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.320 align:middle line:84%
that was extended in the
galaxy, in the stars.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.350 align:middle line:10%
Then Atlantis is
with a good phase

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.200 align:middle line:10%
and also with a phase that
probably brought Atlantis

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.070 align:middle line:10%
to fall and then to
disappear, probably

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.880 align:middle line:10%
thanks to this asteroid
that is shooting, destroying

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.607 align:middle line:10%
everything and putting the
world end to this civilization.

00:03:07.607 --> 00:03:09.440 align:middle line:10%
So some of them, they
don't want to give up.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.960 align:middle line:10%
They don't want to
let go of planet

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.120 align:middle line:10%
that was so important,
that was hosting

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.990 align:middle line:10%
such an important capital.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.330 align:middle line:84%
But it is a risk because
there's not so many possibility.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.580 align:middle line:84%
Actually there is
only one possibility

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.760 align:middle line:84%
to give another chance
to the planet Earth.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.660 align:middle line:84%
The possibility, it's
all related to time.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's all related to
the structure of time

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.006 align:middle line:90%
that we talk about it.

00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:38.010 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of this tree with
the trunk and the branches

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.720 align:middle line:84%
and the different time trial,
the different timelines that

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.490 align:middle line:84%
are constantly created,
and then after a little

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.110 align:middle line:84%
while they collapse
in the main one.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.550 align:middle line:84%
The idea, more or
less, is this one--

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.400 align:middle line:90%
come back in time.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.150 align:middle line:84%
In a moment of time that is,
let's say, pretty unique, rich

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.060 align:middle line:84%
of events that are going
to be very important

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.720 align:middle line:90%
for an operation like this one.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And take one of these branches
and keep giving energies

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.560 align:middle line:84%
to these branches, keep
growing this branch

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.870 align:middle line:84%
to make the branch so strong,
so big, that at a certain point,

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.950 align:middle line:90%
we'll substitute the trunk.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And the branch will
be the new trunk.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's literally the
operation for the creation

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.910 align:middle line:84%
of a new timeline, a
new future timeline.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.060 align:middle line:90%


00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.440 align:middle line:84%
But this, it costs a
lot in terms of energy.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.530 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult.
And in any case,

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.710 align:middle line:84%
we have to imagine
that this needs

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.960 align:middle line:84%
to last for a very long period
of time, at least 600 years.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.770 align:middle line:84%
So not all of them they are
really agree in this operation.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.300 align:middle line:84%
But also thanks to one of them
that probably insists more,

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.060 align:middle line:84%
and it was also the one that
has been receiving that message,

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.310 align:middle line:90%
they agree.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.900 align:middle line:84%
They accept the idea of
starting all the operation

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.420 align:middle line:90%
of the new timeline.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.250 align:middle line:10%
That person is Falco.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.510 align:middle line:90%
It's Oberto Airaudi.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.910 align:middle line:90%
It's the founder of Damanhur.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.390 align:middle line:84%
It's that individual
that has been sended back

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.730 align:middle line:84%
to create the base and the
beginning of the starting

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.480 align:middle line:90%
of the new timeline.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.730 align:middle line:84%
As you remember, there are
several different possible time

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.280 align:middle line:84%
travel, because we are
talking about time travel.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.790 align:middle line:10%
So he's been sent back in
time to create the base that

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.280 align:middle line:10%
will make the
beginning of the time

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.450 align:middle line:10%
separation and the
instrument to keep

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.870 align:middle line:10%
all of this working
for at least 600 years.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.520 align:middle line:84%
So when you have to
do a lot of work,

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.700 align:middle line:84%
and there is a lot of things
that needs to be done,

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.770 align:middle line:84%
so which is the cheapest
version of the time travel?

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.440 align:middle line:90%
You remember, reincarnation.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Because this task will
take a lot of time

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.450 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of effort.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:22.080 align:middle line:10%
So it is exactly 1950 that
Falco, when he arrived.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.940 align:middle line:10%
And all his childhood is
all connected to a book

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.920 align:middle line:10%
that I definitely
going to recommend that

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.240 align:middle line:10%
is "The Alchemist."

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.820 align:middle line:84%
It is the last book
that Falco wrote.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.390 align:middle line:84%
He passed unfortunately
in June 2013.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:40.470 align:middle line:84%
But it's really about
a book of reawakening.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Because in his
early age everything

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.520 align:middle line:84%
it's really about
helping him to remember.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.810 align:middle line:84%
But every time that we come
back, we have a little problem.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:52.870 align:middle line:90%
We don't remember.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:53.670 align:middle line:90%
We lost the memory.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.510 align:middle line:84%
So we have to remember why we're
here, which is our mission.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.570 align:middle line:84%
I have to remind you
that other element that

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:04.240 align:middle line:84%
is very challenging in
the process of evolution

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.040 align:middle line:90%
is the enemy.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.630 align:middle line:90%
You remember?

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:11.350 align:middle line:84%
So the enemy is the element that
is against everything that is

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:12.880 align:middle line:90%
spiritualization of the matter.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.340 align:middle line:84%
An enemy is the same concept
of nothingness, something

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:22.640 align:middle line:84%
that we find already inside
of us when we are incarnated,

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.440 align:middle line:84%
and is also expressed
by the concept

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.630 align:middle line:90%
of the agents of the enemy.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.790 align:middle line:84%
So civilization,
individuals, they

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.120 align:middle line:84%
choose to serve the distractions
instead of the creation.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.293 align:middle line:84%
So this planet, it's
a little bit lost.

00:07:36.293 --> 00:07:37.710 align:middle line:84%
That means that
it's a planet that

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:44.850 align:middle line:84%
is, let's say, with strong
influences of the enemy forces.

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:49.710 align:middle line:84%
One of the main expressions
of this strong imprint

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:53.070 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that the
planet, it's not, let's say,

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.900 align:middle line:90%
a free planet.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.480 align:middle line:84%
What it means to have a free
planet, an occupied planet?

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Let me try to
explain you better.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.140 align:middle line:84%
You remember the
synchronic lines.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.720 align:middle line:90%
We talked about that.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.470 align:middle line:84%
We know that they are
extending themselves

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.870 align:middle line:84%
in the rest of the
galaxy, of the universe.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And through this synchronic
lines many things are passing.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:13.200 align:middle line:84%
But one thing is
very important--

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.055 align:middle line:90%
our souls.

00:08:14.055 --> 00:08:17.650 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:21.150 align:middle line:84%
That means that every source
that can travel everywhere

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.280 align:middle line:84%
in the universe to
go in the planet

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.010 align:middle line:84%
and do the experience
that they need.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:29.790 align:middle line:84%
But what about, for example,
if the synchronic lines

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:32.010 align:middle line:90%
are closed?

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:35.880 align:middle line:84%
If nothing can enter
and nothing can leave?

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.720 align:middle line:90%
Hmm, not a nice situation.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.270 align:middle line:90%
Something very similar to what?

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.310 align:middle line:84%
It's like to imagine
we are living

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:47.070 align:middle line:90%
our life closed in one room.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.120 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.230 align:middle line:90%
Of course, I can live.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:53.190 align:middle line:84%
But how many experiences
I can live in one room?

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:54.400 align:middle line:90%
Very few of them.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.670 align:middle line:84%
So my possibility to change
or evolve is very limited.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:02.580 align:middle line:84%
Instead of saying, well, I
can move wherever I want,

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:08.460 align:middle line:84%
I can go out of his room and
travel and visit everything.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:14.970 align:middle line:84%
So it feels like to slow
down incredibly the evolution

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.790 align:middle line:84%
of a planet because it means
that the same souls are always

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.670 align:middle line:90%
the same to be incarnated.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, to arrive, as I
told you, it's not easy.

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:27.300 align:middle line:84%
He need to, let's
say, use passages

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.170 align:middle line:84%
that have been left a long time
ago just for a few selected

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.620 align:middle line:84%
people from that star
master that we also

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:39.750 align:middle line:84%
mentioned in another episode
that are these enlight people.

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:43.020 align:middle line:84%
It's all these others that
they came to bring knowledge

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.310 align:middle line:90%
to the planet--

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:47.160 align:middle line:90%
to teach, to give example.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.920 align:middle line:84%
It is a combination
of possibilities

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.870 align:middle line:84%
that we can literally start to
talk about the future timeline

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:58.050 align:middle line:90%
starting in March 1967.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:03.450 align:middle line:84%
From this point going on now,
we have a duality at least.

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:06.840 align:middle line:84%
So the duality of
a timeline that

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.720 align:middle line:84%
is the old one that we know
that is not the good one

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.960 align:middle line:84%
is the one that is
going to end very badly.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And we don't even want
to think about it.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.090 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to nourish or to
give energy to that timeline.

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:22.600 align:middle line:10%
And the new one, the
one where we are here,

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.730 align:middle line:10%
the one where there is
Damanhur, the one where

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:29.260 align:middle line:10%
many other events that was
not planning, they appeared.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:34.150 align:middle line:10%
Like some that I can mention
are the student movements,

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:39.910 align:middle line:10%
the university movement
of 1966, '67, '68.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Or the creation of internet
just to give an example.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Or the not invasion of
Russia at the end of 1990.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.750 align:middle line:90%
Or also some shadows effect--

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:56.408 align:middle line:84%
shadows effect are the result
of something that on the other

00:10:56.408 --> 00:10:58.450 align:middle line:84%
side-- and when I'm talking
about the other side,

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
the old timeline--

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.240 align:middle line:84%
are so terrible,
so nasty, so strong

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.820 align:middle line:84%
that are still having
shadows effect.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.970 align:middle line:84%
Like for example, the
explosion of the nuclear

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:13.160 align:middle line:90%
center in Chernobyl in 1986.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.430 align:middle line:10%
But I can also talk
about Fukushima

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:18.940 align:middle line:10%
more recently in 2011, 2012.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Obviously the separation of
the timeline is not enough.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:27.770 align:middle line:84%
We need to create more and
more new events, more and more

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:33.150 align:middle line:84%
transformation to keep
this timeline separated

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.790 align:middle line:90%
to the other one.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:35.600 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Because which is the
tendency of every trial

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:43.970 align:middle line:84%
timeline after a
little way to collapse,

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:45.670 align:middle line:90%
to collapse in the old one.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And when it's going to collapse,
everything that is done before,

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:52.300 align:middle line:90%
it's gone.

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.900 align:middle line:90%
You don't save anything.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.650 align:middle line:84%
So you need to keep them
separated for at least

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:57.970 align:middle line:90%
600 years.

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Before I told you about
very special events,

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:03.760 align:middle line:90%
very special moments.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, this time territory
is being already announced

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.410 align:middle line:84%
as the reawakening
of the spirituality.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:11.530 align:middle line:84%
So probably the coming
back of the spirituality

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:15.850 align:middle line:84%
with old meaning that we can
connect to that is the New Age,

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:18.410 align:middle line:84%
is the Aquarius Age that
in the '70s was, you know,

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:19.210 align:middle line:90%
very popular.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:20.740 align:middle line:90%
But now, nobody talk about it.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.710 align:middle line:84%
But we talk about a period
of time that takes probably

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.150 align:middle line:90%
the next 2,000 years.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:30.850 align:middle line:84%
So from now, these
first 50 years probably

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:34.090 align:middle line:84%
are just the beginning of
the beginning of something

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:37.150 align:middle line:84%
that is going to bring a
completely new paradigm

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.290 align:middle line:90%
in the life of everyone.

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.930 align:middle line:84%
This is a change that
will not be stopped.

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And it will really
bring, you know,

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.240 align:middle line:84%
all of us to enter in a
different way of living

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.730 align:middle line:90%
our lives.

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:53.230 align:middle line:84%
But this is also a period of
time of reawakening of forces.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, we just briefly talk about
the concept of the divinity

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.550 align:middle line:84%
and, in this case, the relation
between human and divinity--

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:03.940 align:middle line:84%
obviously, not about
the primeval one from we

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.920 align:middle line:84%
are all come from,
but the divinity that

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.770 align:middle line:84%
are connecting to us, to our
religion, to our beliefs,

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:10.480 align:middle line:90%
to our cultures.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.920 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.050 align:middle line:84%
We can play around
divinity, you know, talking

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:16.360 align:middle line:90%
about the eggs and the chicken.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.850 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the
chicken or the eggs.

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:19.860 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.780 align:middle line:84%
What was coming before--
the divinity or the human?

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:27.080 align:middle line:84%
For sure, there is a
connection with something

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.510 align:middle line:90%
that we can call divine.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And there are
also, in the rhythm

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.600 align:middle line:84%
of these super
incredible forces.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.640 align:middle line:84%
As before, we talk
about the blink--

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:41.720 align:middle line:84%
remember, time of points
of divine attention.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.250 align:middle line:84%
But as we blink, sometimes we
also take a rest, take a nap.

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:49.730 align:middle line:84%
So let's imagine that there is
moment where these divinity are

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:53.350 align:middle line:84%
fully active, a moment where
they are not fully active.

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:57.620 align:middle line:84%
When the divinity
it's not fully active,

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.620 align:middle line:84%
it's not creating a
very important function

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.840 align:middle line:90%
linked to the neutral event.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:06.410 align:middle line:84%
There is also another
element of the neutral event

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:09.800 align:middle line:84%
that is what we call the
coloring of the neutral event.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.730 align:middle line:84%
The coloring is what is
done by divine forces.

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:16.470 align:middle line:90%
It is located in that territory.

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:20.450 align:middle line:84%
So the divine forces, when
the neutral events are coming,

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:22.160 align:middle line:90%
it's coloring these events.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.150 align:middle line:90%
What it means?

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:27.500 align:middle line:84%
It's giving a direction
connecting to that divinity.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.530 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, it's always our free
will that makes a difference.

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:33.080 align:middle line:84%
But if an event is
already in a direction,

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.870 align:middle line:84%
well maybe easily I can
follow that direction

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:38.120 align:middle line:90%
instead of another one.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.350 align:middle line:84%
This is when the
divinity is fully active.

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:43.700 align:middle line:84%
But what about when
it's falling asleep

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.610 align:middle line:90%
or is resting, is not active?

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:49.010 align:middle line:84%
In that case, the
divinity doesn't

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:50.780 align:middle line:90%
color the neutral event.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:55.420 align:middle line:84%
But the divinity is taking
a little bit of this event

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.750 align:middle line:90%
with her or with him.

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:02.650 align:middle line:84%
What happens when then the
divinity is totally, fully

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:04.120 align:middle line:90%
active?

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.250 align:middle line:84%
An enormous quantity
of new events,

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:10.090 align:middle line:84%
they are going to be
available, at disposal

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:11.950 align:middle line:84%
in that specific
time territory that

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.490 align:middle line:90%
is linked to that divinity.

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:18.840 align:middle line:84%
What makes possible the
separation of the timeline?

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.720 align:middle line:84%
Exactly the reawakening
of this divinity-- of one

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.660 align:middle line:84%
of this divinity-- this
is not the only one

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:29.640 align:middle line:84%
that is going to be the
beginning of the separation

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.600 align:middle line:90%
of the timeline.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is the beginning, but
Falco needs something else.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, he
needs also the helps

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.810 align:middle line:84%
of the others that
he was looking for,

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:46.390 align:middle line:84%
for creating this
instrument, this machine,

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:48.600 align:middle line:84%
this something that
is going to support

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.360 align:middle line:84%
this separation of the
timeline for the future.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.630 align:middle line:84%
So he starts the
project of the cork.

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:58.590 align:middle line:84%
The cork-- well, the metaphor
of cork is the cork, you know,

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.490 align:middle line:90%
of the bottle of wine.

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:04.700 align:middle line:84%
But the cork, what they're doing
on the sea, they are floating.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.380 align:middle line:84%
So the metaphor was
to say him looking

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:12.510 align:middle line:84%
at the sea of everything
that was around him to find

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:16.020 align:middle line:84%
the right souls, the right
corks, the corks the souls

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.390 align:middle line:90%
connect into this project.

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:20.730 align:middle line:84%
Because even all
these corks, they

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:25.360 align:middle line:84%
need to reawake their memory as
he was reawakening his memory.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.890 align:middle line:84%
So in the middle of the
'70s, he's very young.

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:28.890 align:middle line:90%
He's 25 years old.

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:33.930 align:middle line:84%
He's opening a center dedicated
to this divinity called Horus.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:37.830 align:middle line:84%
That is not anymore only
the Horus the Egyptian.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:40.830 align:middle line:84%
But Horus, it's also
an important divinity

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:43.770 align:middle line:84%
connecting to the period
of time of Atlantis

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:46.630 align:middle line:84%
and a period of
time pre-Atlantis,

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:50.170 align:middle line:84%
so before the
creation of Atlantis.

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:52.495 align:middle line:84%
And with the name
of this divinity,

00:16:52.495 --> 00:16:54.650 align:middle line:84%
it probably is the
one that is being

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:58.610 align:middle line:84%
reawakened at that period of
time, he's starting to teach.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.270 align:middle line:84%
He's starting to bring
topics like the one

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:04.160 align:middle line:84%
that we are touching these
days, collecting people that

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.967 align:middle line:84%
are joining his
courses, and it is

00:17:06.967 --> 00:17:09.300 align:middle line:84%
becoming more and more famous,
and more and more people.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.329 align:middle line:84%
And as always
happen, you know, you

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:13.640 align:middle line:84%
have a large group of people
and then some of them,

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.060 align:middle line:84%
they are becoming followers,
they are becoming more close,

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.359 align:middle line:84%
they feel something inside
that there is something really

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:22.040 align:middle line:90%
that goes beyond.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And is in that
context that Falco

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:32.150 align:middle line:84%
start a very special course that
is for Damanhur our initiate

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.690 align:middle line:84%
path or, if you want,
our mystery school.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:39.440 align:middle line:84%
So the path of the
knowledge, the path

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.080 align:middle line:84%
that is followed
by all these souls

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:46.040 align:middle line:84%
and may different moment
of this time territory--

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.560 align:middle line:84%
a path that when
is choose is choose

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.670 align:middle line:84%
not only for one incarnation
but until the alignment will now

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:55.370 align:middle line:84%
be achieved, until the
spiritualization of the method

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:57.080 align:middle line:90%
will not be end.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.550 align:middle line:90%
So it's a promise.

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:02.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a swear that
you're going to continue

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.190 align:middle line:90%
in every incarnation.

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Even if you can't always
say no because, as you know,

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:08.780 align:middle line:90%
the matter is full of illusions.

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:10.920 align:middle line:90%
So it's easy to get lost.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.670 align:middle line:84%
So little by little,
collecting these corks,

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:15.980 align:middle line:84%
collecting these
people, these souls

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.710 align:middle line:84%
sended back for this
project, he starting

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:21.230 align:middle line:90%
to talk about Damanhur.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:23.360 align:middle line:90%
But this was not the beginning.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.510 align:middle line:84%
The beginning was really
to create a place for them

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:29.840 align:middle line:84%
to research in the
spirituality and to reconnect

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.500 align:middle line:84%
with these energy lines of the
planet, the synchronic lines

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:37.100 align:middle line:84%
that, at the time, it
was not completely known.

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:40.460 align:middle line:84%
So first, they went
traveling all over the world

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.250 align:middle line:90%
to recreate the perfect map.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And they know where to create
the right place for what they

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:49.378 align:middle line:84%
have in their mind-- or at
least what they're supposed

00:18:49.378 --> 00:18:51.920 align:middle line:84%
to have in their mind, because
Falco was the only one to have

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:55.520 align:middle line:90%
the entire project inside.

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:59.990 align:middle line:84%
When the map is complete and
they are ready to go and create

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:02.330 align:middle line:84%
Damanhur wherever-- you
know, wherever there was

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:04.970 align:middle line:84%
the synchronic lines, far
away in South America,

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:06.510 align:middle line:90%
or who knows where--

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:09.410 align:middle line:84%
well, they realized
that as we are always

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:12.320 align:middle line:84%
looking for the most
important things so far away,

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.910 align:middle line:84%
actually the most important
things is just here.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:15.710 align:middle line:90%
It's inside.

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:16.510 align:middle line:90%
It's the soul.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.040 align:middle line:84%
So they discovered
that the point where

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.650 align:middle line:84%
four synchronic lines
and the crossing points

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:25.010 align:middle line:84%
are literally like
meridians, like bubbles

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.440 align:middle line:84%
or incredible
energy that they've

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:32.360 align:middle line:84%
been established in that place,
was just 10 miles from where

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Falco was born.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.465 align:middle line:84%
Falco was born in
Balangero Canavese.

00:19:35.465 --> 00:19:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Damanhur is in
Baldissero Canavese.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:40.280 align:middle line:84%
So this is all the
beginning of Damanhur.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:44.840 align:middle line:84%
But Damanhur is still very
far away from what is now.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.880 align:middle line:10%
It is not even the
idea of the temple,

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:51.890 align:middle line:10%
is the idea to bring this group
of people to living together,

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:56.620 align:middle line:10%
but with their own places,
and continue the research.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:01.400 align:middle line:10%
It's only years after that
the element of the community

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.480 align:middle line:10%
is coming out.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's another
step of the project.

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's the step of the
creation of the station.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's one night in this
territory around the fire

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.905 align:middle line:84%
and Falco start to talk
about a temple, our temple,

00:20:16.905 --> 00:20:18.780 align:middle line:84%
but it needed it to be
in secret, because who

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.300 align:middle line:84%
will give you as the
permission to build underground

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.340 align:middle line:84%
in this way and
something that can

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:27.610 align:middle line:84%
connect the synchronic lines
that are passing in this place?

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:33.270 align:middle line:84%
So the first chamber that is
being created months later that

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:37.710 align:middle line:84%
is really for them an
amazing place, the temple.

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So from that moment, the
project never stopped.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:45.630 align:middle line:84%
But Falco never really
shared the entire idea.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:49.460 align:middle line:84%
OK, now we need to go deep and
in a bigger space because we

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.460 align:middle line:90%
need to connect to this.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:52.128 align:middle line:84%
No, now we have to
go in that direction

00:20:52.128 --> 00:20:53.670 align:middle line:84%
and creating this
other architecture.

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:58.210 align:middle line:84%
So little by little
is the hall of water,

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:02.620 align:middle line:84%
is the hall of the Earth,
is the hall of mirror,

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:05.730 align:middle line:84%
is the hall of the metal,
and little by little

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:11.010 align:middle line:84%
this amazing station,
it's been complete.

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Finally, the anchor between
time, space, and dimension--

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:21.120 align:middle line:84%
something that
could be the place

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:25.410 align:middle line:84%
that could be the connection,
not only for us, but also

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:28.960 align:middle line:84%
for who else it's
connecting to this project.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm saying
who else, well, it's

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:37.410 align:middle line:84%
connected to intelligence,
like selfica, for example.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:41.640 align:middle line:84%
There is this very
important connection

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.680 align:middle line:90%
with what we called spear.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Spear is definitely the
connection with the spiral.

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:51.450 align:middle line:84%
It's a connection that Falco
is doing when he's very young.

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Spear is an intelligence that
is still present in Damanhur

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:59.910 align:middle line:84%
and is really the reconnection
with this enormous field

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:02.000 align:middle line:84%
that we call
selfica, if you want

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.030 align:middle line:84%
a technology, but definitely
an enormous support for many

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:08.110 align:middle line:84%
of the operation that
we're going to do,

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:12.690 align:middle line:84%
including the time
travel experience.

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:14.730 align:middle line:84%
But not only, because
we're not alone,

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:17.490 align:middle line:84%
and we're not alone
in terms of time.

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:21.270 align:middle line:84%
We're not alone also in terms
of what there is out there,

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:23.290 align:middle line:84%
because life is not
going on only here.

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And there is an
attention towards us

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.270 align:middle line:84%
that is strongly
connected to this mission,

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:36.150 align:middle line:84%
the mission of accomplish the
succeed of this new timeline.

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And in all of this,
why to create Damanhur?

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.130 align:middle line:90%
Why then to create a community?

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Why then to create something
that is not only spiritual?

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Even at the core, you can
understand the mission

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:48.810 align:middle line:90%
is a spiritual mission.

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:50.310 align:middle line:84%
Then everything
need to be expressed

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:54.030 align:middle line:84%
on the practical level, because
spirituality is in everything.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:56.880 align:middle line:84%
It's not just we do
something special.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.270 align:middle line:84%
It's in every single
moment of our life.

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it's
something that sometimes

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.070 align:middle line:90%
is on and off and on and off.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:07.620 align:middle line:84%
So we need to be able to
demonstrate that this is

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.420 align:middle line:90%
affecting every side of life--

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:16.760 align:middle line:84%
education, art, ecology,
expression of new ideas,

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.830 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:18.900 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Which is the goal of Damanhur
and what we have to do.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we have to keep
the timeline separated,

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:30.600 align:middle line:84%
we know we need to create
a lot of new events,

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.346 align:middle line:90%
a lot of transformation.

00:23:32.346 --> 00:23:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And which is the best way
to create transformation?

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Helping and supporting people
to transform their life.

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:42.500 align:middle line:84%
If we going to help people to
find their way, their mission,

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.760 align:middle line:84%
their spiritual expression--
whatever it is--

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.620 align:middle line:84%
what you find inside
of yourself are you

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.200 align:middle line:84%
beliefs that, if
you're spiritual,

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.000 align:middle line:84%
probably is going to be in the
respect of the other beliefs.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.530 align:middle line:84%
So you are going to generate
so many new events, so

00:23:55.530 --> 00:24:00.780 align:middle line:84%
many new opportunities, that is
going to support all of this.

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.480 align:middle line:84%
So individually, we are
carrying on a project that

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.260 align:middle line:84%
is not anymore about a
person, but is about everyone.

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.770 align:middle line:84%
It's not about a leader,
but it's about a group.

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:13.320 align:middle line:10%
It's not about a messiah,
but with the new prophecy,

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.770 align:middle line:10%
the messiah is not going to
be an individual anymore.

00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:17.610 align:middle line:10%
It's going to be a community.

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:19.230 align:middle line:10%
So the idea that
a conscience could

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:23.310 align:middle line:10%
be shared only by many of
us, not just one of us--

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:25.330 align:middle line:10%
so this is the new paradigm.

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's the paradigm the
needs to last for at least

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:32.050 align:middle line:90%
the next 600 years.

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:35.640 align:middle line:84%
In all of this,
Damanhur never stopped

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:38.580 align:middle line:84%
to not only research,
but to continue

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:42.980 align:middle line:84%
to work in all the
different fields of magic

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.660 align:middle line:84%
that we need to
continue to work,

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:49.200 align:middle line:84%
into the synchronic lines,
into the different connection

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:53.070 align:middle line:84%
with a different source of
energy, but also into time--

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:56.160 align:middle line:84%
creating the base
because on time

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.490 align:middle line:84%
we are keeping separated
in the timeline.

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:01.590 align:middle line:10%
One of the reasons
why, for example,

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:05.430 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of the '90s, we
had to accelerate many time

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:10.200 align:middle line:10%
traveling is because
the effect that we

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.620 align:middle line:10%
was creating in the
past was to support what

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:15.720 align:middle line:10%
the separation of the timeline.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:20.940 align:middle line:84%
So not for us, but again to give
a hope for this project that,

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:25.960 align:middle line:84%
until this 600 years in the
future, will not be complete.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.740 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason why
in a certain way, when

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:32.760 align:middle line:84%
you are dedicating your life to
the mystery, to the initiation,

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.470 align:middle line:84%
you also get the
right to come back.

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:38.160 align:middle line:84%
So you get the
right to come back

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:42.510 align:middle line:84%
and to continue whatever you
left until the final work will

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:44.230 align:middle line:90%
not be finished.

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:47.130 align:middle line:84%
So all the time traveling
and all the time exploration

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:49.920 align:middle line:84%
and know the things
that are still going on

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:53.760 align:middle line:84%
are done for that purpose, for
the purpose of the creation

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.170 align:middle line:90%
of a new future.

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:59.220 align:middle line:84%
So we work in the past to create
the base of what is going on

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:03.060 align:middle line:84%
now or in what we call
future because, as we've

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.890 align:middle line:84%
been describing
since the beginning,

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:08.760 align:middle line:84%
it's all happening at
the same exactly moment.

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:11.040 align:middle line:84%
It's all happening in
these time spheres,

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:14.370 align:middle line:84%
in this time territory
that we are crossing now,

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:17.410 align:middle line:90%
at least in this planet.

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, someone is asking me if the
temple is just for us or not.

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:26.640 align:middle line:84%
No, it's called
Temple of Humankind.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise we're going to call
it the Temple of Damanhur.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.130 align:middle line:84%
What it means that this
is one of the place

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:37.590 align:middle line:84%
is being used by everyone that
is connected to this project--

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:41.385 align:middle line:90%
time, space, or dimensions.

00:26:41.385 --> 00:26:42.510 align:middle line:90%
It's one of these stations.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:45.130 align:middle line:84%
It's one of these castles,
one of these time castles.

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:49.440 align:middle line:84%
In one of the places where, you
know, it's available for that.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.990 align:middle line:84%
As we are using other
space, other castles,

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:56.690 align:middle line:90%
the temple is done for that.

00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:59.520 align:middle line:84%
In a period of time, in
a time territory where

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:03.000 align:middle line:84%
it was supposed to do
anything, because it was not

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.652 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be Damanhur.

00:27:04.652 --> 00:27:07.110 align:middle line:84%
It was not supposed to have
this temple on underground that

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:12.540 align:middle line:84%
is actually the largest that
is existing in the planet.

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.990 align:middle line:84%
It's existing because
there is this new timeline.

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:20.910 align:middle line:84%
There is this new version
of what could be the future.

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:24.450 align:middle line:84%
That's also the reason why
some other prophecy are not

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:26.760 align:middle line:90%
working anymore.

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:27.750 align:middle line:90%
You know why?

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, the prophecy are
connecting to the old timeline,

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:33.230 align:middle line:90%
not to this one.

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.810 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason why some
prophecies are not fitting

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:36.610 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is also the reason why
there is such an acceleration

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:45.170 align:middle line:84%
in research in the
new element, in people

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:48.735 align:middle line:84%
that are talking about
topics that before nobody

00:27:48.735 --> 00:27:49.535 align:middle line:90%
was talking about.

00:27:49.535 --> 00:27:51.470 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
time travel, and Gaia

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:54.740 align:middle line:84%
is a perfect example
of how this could

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.020 align:middle line:90%
be spread all over the world.

00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's more and
more interest of people.

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:00.550 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:02.100 align:middle line:90%
Who is here?

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Who is being incarnated
in this time territory

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:08.610 align:middle line:84%
is the right souls
at the right place.

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:11.990 align:middle line:84%
Because if we have to
incarnate the transformation,

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:13.050 align:middle line:90%
here we are, my friends.

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:14.120 align:middle line:90%
We are the one.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.910 align:middle line:84%
We are the one that had
been sended back in time--

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:19.130 align:middle line:84%
or back or who
knows from where--

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:22.100 align:middle line:84%
to be able to make
this transformation.

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.297 align:middle line:90%
We are the choose one.

00:28:24.297 --> 00:28:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Not because someone is choosing
one, because we are here

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:27.740 align:middle line:90%
in this moment.

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:29.900 align:middle line:84%
So that if we
believe it or not, we

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:33.910 align:middle line:84%
are the people that are going
to transform this planet,

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:37.400 align:middle line:84%
that are going to create these
new paradigms, that are going

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.460 align:middle line:90%
to affect many new generation.

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:44.330 align:middle line:84%
But this is the generation,
or the generations,

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:46.790 align:middle line:84%
that are going to
stop everything--

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:49.320 align:middle line:84%
if we want, obviously, because
it's all based on the free

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.120 align:middle line:90%
will.

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.340 align:middle line:90%
So we can do it or not do it.

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:55.190 align:middle line:84%
We can act-- as
spirituality is action,

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:57.200 align:middle line:90%
experience doing things--

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:01.100 align:middle line:84%
or just simply sit and wait
because the destiny one

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:02.460 align:middle line:90%
day will arrive.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:05.270 align:middle line:90%
No, we say stand and act.

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And it is better to make
mistakes then don't act--

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:11.960 align:middle line:84%
to do and then correct
than not doing.

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.710 align:middle line:90%
Because time is not unlimited.

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Or let's say, the time to
spiritualize the matter is not

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:20.210 align:middle line:90%
going to be unlimited.

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:21.380 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there is a deadline.

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:28.070 align:middle line:84%
So it is time to run, and it's
time to make things happen.

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:31.120 align:middle line:90%
