00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>> We have a past, we have a
present, and we have a future.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.570 align:middle line:10%
Or at least, it's what we
believe we are moving with.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.730 align:middle line:84%
We did something,
so this is the past.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.830 align:middle line:84%
We are in the moment,
in the present,

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.420 align:middle line:84%
that looks the most
important things.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And then we are always
thinking about what is going

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.700 align:middle line:90%
to happen next, the future.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is the
classical idea of time,

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.430 align:middle line:84%
but obviously, we are here to
change completely this idea,

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.750 align:middle line:84%
or at least to offer
you a different approach

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.060 align:middle line:84%
to what is time, approach
that, actually, even science is

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.230 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.950 align:middle line:84%
But the ancient spiritual
tradition, well, they all

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.170 align:middle line:84%
have a different
idea about time.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.650 align:middle line:10%
If we go to the Egyptian,
if we go to the pre-Mayas,

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.460 align:middle line:10%
we go to the Incas, we go
to the ancient civilization,

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.180 align:middle line:10%
well, there is a completely
different approach to time.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.030 align:middle line:84%
They have very refined
calendar, like they

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.490 align:middle line:84%
are able to prevent events
or to program events

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.200 align:middle line:90%
that are going to happen.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Also, time is being described
in many different cultures

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.910 align:middle line:84%
like a wheel, a
wheel that is moving.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And in these movements, it
brings back some opportunity,

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.520 align:middle line:84%
some, again, occasion that how
that was happening in the past,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.670 align:middle line:84%
they can happen
here in the present

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.120 align:middle line:90%
or in the possible future.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.830 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
time, well, we

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.480 align:middle line:84%
talk definitely about what could
be the evolution of ourself,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.390 align:middle line:90%
but also of the humankind.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, since the
beginning, we refer

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.590 align:middle line:90%
to very ancient knowledge.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.290 align:middle line:84%
Nothing that we
invented, but something

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.270 align:middle line:84%
that, as it's called
knowledge, is always

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.979 align:middle line:84%
the same all over the time
and all over the world.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.720 align:middle line:90%
So there's nothing new.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.870 align:middle line:84%
We are just simply
remembering something

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.510 align:middle line:84%
that probably we
forget or maybe we

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.780 align:middle line:84%
lost in many moments
of what we call time.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.510 align:middle line:90%


00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.540 align:middle line:84%
We are talking about
the universe of form.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, what is the
universe of form?

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.100 align:middle line:84%
To be very simple,
the universe of form

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.170 align:middle line:84%
is where we are in this
moment is where we move.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.095 align:middle line:84%
It's everything that is
touched by what we call forms.

00:02:37.095 --> 00:02:39.220 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason why it's
called universe of forms.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.440 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not talking only
about the planet Earth,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.900 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not even talking
about the solar system.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
everything that

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.590 align:middle line:90%
is in a different universe.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.810 align:middle line:10%
Well, this is the
field, the field

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.730 align:middle line:10%
where the laws, eight
of them, are playing

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.250 align:middle line:10%
this game altogether with us.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.850 align:middle line:10%
And it's here that the
laws are managing something

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.960 align:middle line:10%
that we call time.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.530 align:middle line:84%
So we can imagine,
really, like three circle.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, the largest
one is the real,

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.050 align:middle line:84%
the second one is the
threshold, and then

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.650 align:middle line:84%
in the middle, in the center,
there is the universe of form.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.060 align:middle line:84%
The real is from
where we came from,

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.940 align:middle line:84%
from all the souls, the human
souls, are coming, like a rain,

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.150 align:middle line:84%
penetrating deep threshold,
bringing information

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.430 align:middle line:84%
that they need, then, to
enter in the universe of form

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.070 align:middle line:84%
and then living the
life that we are living.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, it looks very
simple, but let's say

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.660 align:middle line:84%
there is much more that we're
going to discover together.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.270 align:middle line:90%
Number one, why we're here.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.440 align:middle line:90%
What we have to do.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.480 align:middle line:90%
Why we are immersed into time.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, everything, it's
driven by something

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.830 align:middle line:90%
that we call complexity.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, I don't want
to make things complex.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.930 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about the element
that is called evolution.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.300 align:middle line:90%
The reason why we're here.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.770 align:middle line:84%
The reason why we
might perceive a past

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.400 align:middle line:84%
and then a future,
why we are moving

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.210 align:middle line:84%
so much, we are celebrating
so much in our existence,

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.090 align:middle line:84%
to live experience, the
experience that life

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.180 align:middle line:84%
is proposing to us, is
because there is something

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.950 align:middle line:90%
that we have to achieve.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.510 align:middle line:84%
This is, generally
speaking, the evolution.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.649 align:middle line:84%
Yes, my friend, we are
here to, in a certain way,

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:22.630 align:middle line:84%
transfer the matter into
light, transfer the matter

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.130 align:middle line:90%
into energy.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.110 align:middle line:84%
It is the process
of the alignment

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.500 align:middle line:84%
that we do individually,
but we do also as humankind.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.500 align:middle line:90%
And how we do that?

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.960 align:middle line:90%
We need to do experience.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.310 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, the experience
that, for us, is more important

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.650 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that are directly
connected to transformation.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.670 align:middle line:10%
So we are living several lives,
many lives, many past lives

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.630 align:middle line:10%
to pass through every kind
of possible experience thanks

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.290 align:middle line:10%
to an element that, for
us, is fundamental--

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.680 align:middle line:10%
the free will.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.790 align:middle line:10%
So it's through the free
will, so our personal choice,

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.400 align:middle line:10%
that we can do experience.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And thanks to these experience,
we can transform ourselves.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Also, not, because
obviously, we are also

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.350 align:middle line:84%
talking about something
that is challenging,

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.840 align:middle line:84%
something that is
touching the part of us

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.830 align:middle line:84%
that they need the
transformation.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the hard part, the
fears, the insecurity.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.400 align:middle line:84%
Hell, probably this
is exactly what

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.250 align:middle line:90%
we need to do in this life.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.580 align:middle line:84%
So free will is the
master of everything.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.240 align:middle line:84%
The free will it's something
that nobody can change,

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.620 align:middle line:90%
because it's ours.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.950 align:middle line:84%
It's our, let's say,
last divine power.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Definitely, the free
will is the last memory,

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.570 align:middle line:84%
the last possibility, the last
chance to do all this process,

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.450 align:middle line:90%
and nobody can change it.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.510 align:middle line:84%
It is what our senses,
they probably give us,

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.640 align:middle line:84%
is the idea that there is a
past and there is a future.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.840 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe not.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.200 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there is more.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there is not only the
time that I'm perceiving.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.910 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there are many
different times.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Maybe time is not even
something that is moving.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.220 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it is something that's
simply becoming a perspective.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's try to imagine
something like that.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And as before, I talk
about time as a wheel.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, why not like to
imagine like into a sphere.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.380 align:middle line:90%


00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.345 align:middle line:10%
The sphere that represent time.

00:06:26.345 --> 00:06:31.210 align:middle line:90%


00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.800 align:middle line:84%
A sphere, a territory,
one big territory

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.430 align:middle line:84%
where every time, it's
there, contemporary,

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.710 align:middle line:90%
at the same exactly moment.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is changing
completely our perspective,

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.430 align:middle line:90%
because we're in a moment.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.690 align:middle line:84%
So if time is a territory and
if this sphere is containing

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:55.230 align:middle line:84%
every single time, well, then,
also my past life, for example,

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.030 align:middle line:90%
are not existing.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Or wait a moment, more
than not existing,

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.060 align:middle line:84%
are there, contemporary,
at the same exactly moment.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.790 align:middle line:84%
But then what is
what I'm perceiving?

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.840 align:middle line:84%
It's really a past and a future,
or it's just a limitation,

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.530 align:middle line:84%
maybe, that my senses
are giving to me?

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.250 align:middle line:90%
I talk about a territory.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.650 align:middle line:90%
I talk about a big sphere.

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.570 align:middle line:90%
Wow, that looks really strange.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.650 align:middle line:84%
But no, it's something
that is changing.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.430 align:middle line:84%
It has different
characters inside.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.400 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
important characters

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:33.670 align:middle line:84%
that I'd love to introduce
now is the idea that time,

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.920 align:middle line:90%
it's like a tree.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a tree, a big
tree, with a main trunk.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.010 align:middle line:90%
Strong.

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:42.500 align:middle line:90%
It's powerful.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.480 align:middle line:84%
But then, it's a tree also
with many different branches.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And then, obviously, some of
them, they might be stronger.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, they could
be weaker, and so on.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:55.330 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm trying to tell you
is that, actually, in this time

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:00.970 align:middle line:84%
territory, there is
not only one timeline,

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:04.510 align:middle line:84%
but several timeline
that constantly we can

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:08.410 align:middle line:90%
take in every single moment.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Let me try to explain
a little bit better.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.040 align:middle line:90%
What is a moment?

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.380 align:middle line:84%
A moment, in our
spiritual physic,

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:18.280 align:middle line:84%
it's something that
lasts four seconds.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.940 align:middle line:84%
What happened in
these four second?

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, in these four second,
we can express our free will.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:29.980 align:middle line:84%
But what we have in front,
it's multiple possibilities.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.730 align:middle line:84%
In particular, we can
imagine that in every moment,

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.669 align:middle line:84%
every four seconds,
there are at least

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:39.909 align:middle line:90%
six different possibilities.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:43.600 align:middle line:84%
But they are technically
time branches,

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.480 align:middle line:90%
or as we said time trials.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.640 align:middle line:84%
It means that I'm not
moving in one line.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm moving in multiple lines.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.220 align:middle line:84%
I am seeing, or I
can rise the tree,

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:01.290 align:middle line:84%
but then I can take many of
these different branches.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not doing it just
in some special occasion.

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:08.830 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm constantly
moving between them.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:10.930 align:middle line:84%
It is an approach
that probably can

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:15.460 align:middle line:84%
link to what many areas
spiritual research

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:19.705 align:middle line:84%
are telling us, that we are
not living only one reality,

00:09:19.705 --> 00:09:21.520 align:middle line:90%
but multiple realities.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.210 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:26.840 align:middle line:84%
Our soul that we call
the divine spark is

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:31.990 align:middle line:84%
the region from a divine source
is the beginning of everything.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:37.120 align:middle line:84%
We are, let's say, containing
this divine source.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:43.660 align:middle line:84%
So the soul can live multiple
experience at the same moment.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:44.460 align:middle line:90%
What it means?

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.960 align:middle line:84%
That we can be here
in this physical body,

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.590 align:middle line:84%
but we can be, for
example, in a plant.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.290 align:middle line:84%
We can be, for
example, in a bacteria.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:54.480 align:middle line:90%
We can be in an animal.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.090 align:middle line:84%
We can become, temporarily,
many different life forms.

00:09:58.090 --> 00:09:58.890 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
going to accelerate

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:04.140 align:middle line:84%
our process of
spiritualization of the matter.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.300 align:middle line:84%
I enrich myself with
more experience,

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:10.360 align:middle line:84%
so I bring more information
or experience inside of me.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Let's bring this
concept on time.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:17.380 align:middle line:84%
So we are not,
let's say, creature

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:21.460 align:middle line:84%
that are living only in
one time, but multiple time

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:25.730 align:middle line:84%
contemporary, multiply,
at the same moment.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.120 align:middle line:90%
So I'm moving.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.040 align:middle line:10%
I like to imagine
to be in a river.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And then, in this
river, I can sometimes

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.930 align:middle line:84%
take some little piece of the
river that are going somewhere

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.240 align:middle line:84%
else and then come
back in the main one

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.360 align:middle line:90%
and then take some others.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.450 align:middle line:90%
How this happened?

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Because for me, it's
always the same thing.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:45.100 align:middle line:90%
It's always the same time.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm in the same place.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:47.510 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not true.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:51.520 align:middle line:84%
I've been really
changing many time trial.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.580 align:middle line:84%
But let me give you a
more practical example.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.530 align:middle line:84%
What about when you come
back home in the evening,

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:02.710 align:middle line:84%
you know, and you put the
keys of the car on the table.

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And then you say, OK,
so I forgot something.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:06.700 align:middle line:84%
I have to take the
car, and I have

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.440 align:middle line:90%
to go and buy that something.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.320 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.230 align:middle line:90%
I come back on the table.

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:12.800 align:middle line:90%
The keys are not there.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.660 align:middle line:90%
They're gone.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.170 align:middle line:84%
I just left it a few minutes
ago, and who took it?

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:19.375 align:middle line:84%
So you go to your wife
or to your partner

00:11:19.375 --> 00:11:23.380 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, darling, where did
you put the keys of the car?

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.820 align:middle line:90%
And she said, what?

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.610 align:middle line:90%
I didn't touch it, darling.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And you start to
be really pissed,

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.640 align:middle line:84%
and you're starting to
look around, and et cetera.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot
find the car keys.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.900 align:middle line:90%
So what happened?

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you go to the closet
and say, OK, forget about it.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to buy
this stuff anymore.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Let me put, you know, a jacket
and I'm going for a walk.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:46.890 align:middle line:84%
You put your hands in the
pocket and, oh my goodness,

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:49.750 align:middle line:90%
the car keys are in the jacket.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.140 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:56.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure, I was absolutely sure,
that I left the keys of the car

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.680 align:middle line:84%
on the table, and then I
found it in the jacket.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.290 align:middle line:84%
How many times we
have the feeling

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.300 align:middle line:84%
that we are doing
something and then,

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.450 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden, the
something is not the same?

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:09.070 align:middle line:90%
The situation is not the same.

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.330 align:middle line:90%
The feelings are not the same.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.110 align:middle line:84%
But also, the object sometimes
are not in the same place.

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Or something has been changed,
but physically, nothing

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:18.780 align:middle line:90%
changed.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a perception.

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:23.190 align:middle line:84%
It's an intuition sometimes,
or it's just a quick thought.

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And because we don't want
to consider ourselves

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.370 align:middle line:84%
mad or crazy, so we
just consider that, oh,

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:29.350 align:middle line:90%
it's something strange.

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Or I maybe just
felt differently,

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.440 align:middle line:90%
or it's just one of these days.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:39.390 align:middle line:84%
No, actually, one of these
days, it's every day.

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:45.300 align:middle line:84%
Every day, we are jumping,
moving from one possibility

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:49.180 align:middle line:84%
to another possibility, to one
timeline to another timeline.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:56.110 align:middle line:84%
But our perception doesn't allow
us to feel what is going on.

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:57.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes, this is a mind trick.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.140 align:middle line:90%
It's all rational.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.480 align:middle line:90%
It's all a cause-effect.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.120 align:middle line:84%
It's not that there is a
past and there is a future,

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.160 align:middle line:84%
so past and future is
linear because there

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.060 align:middle line:90%
is a cause-effect.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Everything is linked
to the fact that if I

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:14.090 align:middle line:84%
have something in my hands and
I open my hands, this will fall.

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:14.890 align:middle line:90%
It's natural.

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:15.880 align:middle line:90%
It's rational.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.080 align:middle line:90%
It's cause-effect.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:17.980 align:middle line:90%
Is it not like this?

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.190 align:middle line:84%
We're not all living
stick to these ideas,

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:24.130 align:middle line:84%
and all our educations
are stick to these ideas?

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And if something strange is
happening, no, no, no, no, no,

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:28.479 align:middle line:84%
there's something
wrong with you.

00:13:28.479 --> 00:13:29.770 align:middle line:90%
Or there's something dangerous.

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Or there's something negative,
so don't even think about it.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.010 align:middle line:84%
In the past, it
was very different.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:38.680 align:middle line:84%
When in this ancient
civilization, where

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.596 align:middle line:84%
time was one of these important
elements of their life,

00:13:42.596 --> 00:13:43.470 align:middle line:90%
it was not like that.

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.460 align:middle line:84%
Spirituality and
spiritual research.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.310 align:middle line:84%
The path of the
spiritualization of the method,

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:51.430 align:middle line:84%
the path of the
enlightenment was at the core

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.350 align:middle line:90%
of the civilization.

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:57.220 align:middle line:84%
Everything was based on
support, the individual process

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.464 align:middle line:90%
of transformation.

00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:00.880 align:middle line:84%
Yes, obviously on
different level,

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.020 align:middle line:90%
because we are not the same.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.070 align:middle line:84%
We are not achieving
the same goal.

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.760 align:middle line:90%
But there is a common goal--

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.810 align:middle line:84%
a goal that is individual
and a goal that

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.150 align:middle line:90%
is for the entire humankind.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:17.010 align:middle line:84%
So in this society, feeling,
sensation, emotion, everything

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:20.430 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't appear
but we can feel--

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.530 align:middle line:90%
the invisible, the threshold.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:24.030 align:middle line:90%
What is on the other side?

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.130 align:middle line:90%
What is the other side?

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.640 align:middle line:84%
The place where there
are all the information,

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:28.800 align:middle line:90%
all the knowledge.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, all of this was totally
part of their existence.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.670 align:middle line:84%
So what now we can
call paranormal,

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:38.640 align:middle line:84%
at the time was
absolutely normal.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Also, a different
approach about time.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.720 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some of the
civilization, they actually

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:50.010 align:middle line:84%
decided to disappear,
to jump out

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:53.160 align:middle line:84%
from another
parallel time, maybe

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:58.380 align:middle line:84%
because they felt that what is
going on here in this planet

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:03.280 align:middle line:84%
was not at the level to give
a hope for the planet Earth.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.980 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that
we are educated,

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:09.300 align:middle line:84%
that we are so stick to the
idea of the cause-effect,

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.060 align:middle line:84%
that all is rational, that
there is a past and there

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:17.850 align:middle line:84%
is a future, that hasn't allowed
our senses, our perception

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.160 align:middle line:90%
to perceive time.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that we are
not moving only one time,

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.750 align:middle line:90%
but in several times.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:26.760 align:middle line:90%
That is our limitation.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:30.000 align:middle line:84%
But in some moment,
well, we can have proof.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.230 align:middle line:84%
We can have really example that
we are not only here and now.

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:38.250 align:middle line:84%
We are actually really
moving in many here and nows,

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:42.780 align:middle line:84%
these branches that we
call the time trial.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.730 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to come
back to the perception.

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:48.000 align:middle line:84%
We're going to come
back to our senses.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Because unfortunately,
the senses, at least

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:54.240 align:middle line:84%
our five senses, are a
limitation of what we perceive.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.010 align:middle line:90%
Don't forget that.

00:15:56.010 --> 00:16:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Everything, it's being
perceived as just a little piece

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:03.240 align:middle line:90%
of what we can perceive.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.600 align:middle line:84%
We're not perceiving all the
different vibration of sound,

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.080 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.660 align:middle line:90%
So what happened constantly?

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:13.470 align:middle line:84%
It happened that time,
it is really like a tree,

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.860 align:middle line:84%
with so many different
possibilities.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:20.250 align:middle line:90%
Time trial, led by what?

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:23.100 align:middle line:84%
We have to come back to the
beginning, to why we're here,

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.800 align:middle line:90%
to evolve.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:25.600 align:middle line:90%
Evolution.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.580 align:middle line:90%
Complexity.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:32.670 align:middle line:84%
So all of these time trials are
based on possible complexity

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:34.260 align:middle line:90%
that they could be expressed.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:38.110 align:middle line:84%
If is a higher complexity, well,
this time trial can continue.

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:41.490 align:middle line:84%
If this complexity will
not stay at the same

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:46.270 align:middle line:84%
of the main timeline of the
branch, it will do what?

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:47.710 align:middle line:90%
Collapse.

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:50.010 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason why
in one time trial,

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:53.440 align:middle line:90%
I left the keys on the table.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.160 align:middle line:84%
But in another one, I can find
it in the pocket of my jacket.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:01.240 align:middle line:84%
So the reality, in some
point, they come back in one.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:05.619 align:middle line:84%
They are back in the same one,
even if I took two of them.

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:07.780 align:middle line:84%
First the one with
the key in the table.

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Second, the one that has the
key in the pocket of the jacket.

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:16.589 align:middle line:84%
Now, normally, this is
happening constantly,

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:20.810 align:middle line:84%
contemporary, many,
many, many times.

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:23.400 align:middle line:84%
All four second,
every moment, that we

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:28.830 align:middle line:84%
can take one of these different
six branches, every four

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:32.010 align:middle line:90%
seconds, constantly.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.880 align:middle line:84%
But our perception doesn't
allow us, or at the moment,

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.190 align:middle line:84%
to feel that we
are moving so much.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Probably also because we may
confuse our rational side.

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:46.320 align:middle line:84%
So what happened, that this
tree is creating so many

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.180 align:middle line:90%
different branches constantly.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And some of them, they
could be also stronger.

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:53.770 align:middle line:90%
They could be bigger.

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:58.050 align:middle line:90%
They could be really big branch.

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Actually, in the creation
of different timeline,

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:03.750 align:middle line:84%
this is going to
be an element that

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:07.110 align:middle line:84%
is going to be extremely
significant and important

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.160 align:middle line:90%
for us--

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.490 align:middle line:84%
creating a new timeline,
creating a new possible future.

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't want
to anticipate,

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:middle line:84%
but this is going to
be probably something

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.920 align:middle line:84%
that is going to intrigue
us a lot, at least

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.270 align:middle line:84%
to give a better understanding
of why so many things are going

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.430 align:middle line:90%
on in this actual time.

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Many other branches, no,
they don't have, let's say,

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:32.400 align:middle line:90%
enough complexity to last.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.070 align:middle line:84%
So they just simply
collapse in the main one.

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:38.950 align:middle line:90%


00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:43.210 align:middle line:84%
I talked before
about parallel times.

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:46.420 align:middle line:10%
Well, a parallel
timeline is actually

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:50.000 align:middle line:10%
the event, the possibility,
of one of these branches

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.120 align:middle line:10%
to create, let's
say, complexity that

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.690 align:middle line:10%
is even higher from
the complexity that

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:00.670 align:middle line:10%
is being created from the tree.

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:04.960 align:middle line:84%
That means that if the tree, in
the direction of the movement,

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:09.700 align:middle line:84%
is creating more possibility
to evolution, well, some

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.430 align:middle line:84%
of these branches, they
can create even more.

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:16.510 align:middle line:84%
So they create some parallel
times that I existed

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:18.100 align:middle line:90%
at the same exactly moment.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.840 align:middle line:84%
So they have their
process of evolution.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.840 align:middle line:84%
They have their complexity,
and they are keeping

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.790 align:middle line:90%
going in that direction.

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:27.220 align:middle line:84%
But let me just frame
maybe a little bit

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:31.030 align:middle line:84%
better what is evolution and
how this has been brought

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.960 align:middle line:90%
all over the universe of form.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.220 align:middle line:10%
So in this case, we have
really to separate for a moment

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.770 align:middle line:10%
the idea of evolution from
what is the form or the body

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:45.940 align:middle line:10%
and what is, let's say, the
driver of the body, what

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.040 align:middle line:10%
is contained by the body.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Before I talk about the
real, the threshold, and then

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.290 align:middle line:84%
the matter, the
universe of form,

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:58.840 align:middle line:84%
I've been talking about
this divine essence

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.660 align:middle line:90%
that we call divine spark.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:04.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, like literally
an element of something

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:07.460 align:middle line:84%
that we call divinity,
whatever it means now for us.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's a divinity
that is not linked

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.610 align:middle line:84%
to the gods and the goddess
that we know on this planet.

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:14.680 align:middle line:90%
So it's something even superior.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.790 align:middle line:84%
But let's imagine that
we are this little piece

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:22.960 align:middle line:84%
of this divinity,
a divine spark that

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.480 align:middle line:84%
is entering through the
threshold into the matter

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.200 align:middle line:84%
and then is doing experience
thanks to the free will.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:34.150 align:middle line:84%
But is this experience, is
this evolution, then, only here

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:35.620 align:middle line:90%
on the planet Earth?

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.240 align:middle line:90%
Well, obviously not.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.670 align:middle line:90%
Evolution is done everywhere.

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:40.470 align:middle line:90%
Everywhere.

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:43.540 align:middle line:84%
That means, you know,
in many different places

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:48.850 align:middle line:84%
of our galaxies, of our
planets, of our system, done

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.420 align:middle line:90%
on a different level.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:53.520 align:middle line:84%
So what we are achieving in the
planet Earth is just one level,

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.890 align:middle line:84%
but we can imagine that it might
be even better or even lower.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:58.690 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:02.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's part of a big game,
the game of evolution.

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:09.610 align:middle line:84%
So now, what is what we call
human, the body or the soul,

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:12.100 align:middle line:90%
so what is being contained?

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, in this
interpretation, in this vision,

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:18.890 align:middle line:84%
well, the body is, yes,
it's like a machine.

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:22.200 align:middle line:90%


00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've been
teaching many classes,

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.540 align:middle line:84%
and one of my fields of
research is astral traveling,

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:28.940 align:middle line:90%
so the out-of-body experience.

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that people are really

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:35.060 align:middle line:84%
realizing when they have
their out-of-body experience

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:40.520 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that this is a
wonderful, fantastic, beautiful

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:41.540 align:middle line:90%
machine.

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:42.600 align:middle line:90%
It's like a dress.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:46.060 align:middle line:84%
It's the clothes that we are
putting every single day.

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.305 align:middle line:84%
And for how beautiful
and fantastic it is,

00:21:48.305 --> 00:21:49.890 align:middle line:90%
it's just a dress.

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:52.100 align:middle line:90%
We are not the body.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:57.150 align:middle line:84%
We are what is driving the
body, what is moving the body.

00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:00.080 align:middle line:84%
So let's say that
this body, this form,

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.990 align:middle line:84%
is the one adept in this
place, this planet Earth,

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:08.120 align:middle line:84%
in this time to do experience,
but it's not the only one.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Actually, even on
this planet Earth,

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:14.840 align:middle line:84%
we are not talking only about
us, as like with this form,

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:18.530 align:middle line:84%
with this physical body,
containing a divine spark.

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:22.010 align:middle line:84%
So we can imagine that in all
these different system, galaxy,

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:28.340 align:middle line:84%
planet, and et cetera, well,
we are using the bodies that

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:31.790 align:middle line:84%
will allow us to
have experience,

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:35.330 align:middle line:84%
to live a life that
can refine ourself,

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:38.480 align:middle line:84%
that can transform ourself,
that can spiritualize

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.580 align:middle line:90%
more the matter.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.320 align:middle line:90%
Not the body, but the soul.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.240 align:middle line:90%


00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.430 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about
evolution and when

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:51.180 align:middle line:84%
we talk about everything
in the universe of form,

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.720 align:middle line:84%
we have to detach a
little bit from the idea

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.610 align:middle line:90%
of this physical body.

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:59.220 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, my friend,
when we're going to pass,

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:02.010 align:middle line:84%
when we're going to die, the
only thing that we are sure

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:05.630 align:middle line:84%
is that we are not
taking this body with us.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:09.420 align:middle line:84%
That is a big relief, because
it means that, one more time,

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:13.410 align:middle line:84%
we are realizing the highest
point of transformation

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:17.040 align:middle line:84%
where also the body will
transform into something else.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.410 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, life will be
boring, wouldn't you think?

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:24.150 align:middle line:84%
So it's much, much more
interesting and intriguing

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:28.320 align:middle line:84%
to imagine us jumping
from different bodies

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.420 align:middle line:84%
in different places
in different times.

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:33.660 align:middle line:84%
So this is very
important to frame

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:36.440 align:middle line:90%
what we talk about evolution.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.800 align:middle line:84%
But let's come back
about time and about all

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:41.980 align:middle line:90%
these possibilities.

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Because if time is the
largest container that

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:49.710 align:middle line:84%
is containing every
single possibility and all

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:53.370 align:middle line:84%
these possibilities are
linked to every individual,

00:23:53.370 --> 00:24:00.210 align:middle line:84%
well, we can imagine how complex
all of this is being based.

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:04.910 align:middle line:84%
So imagine how many billions
of different possible events

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:06.900 align:middle line:90%
that can happen constantly.

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.940 align:middle line:90%


00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:14.590 align:middle line:10%
And which is the
bond, the energy, that

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:17.110 align:middle line:10%
is connecting all these events?

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Because we talk so many
times about cause and effect

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:25.150 align:middle line:84%
and the idea that our mind
is perceiving everything

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:27.490 align:middle line:90%
like a consequence.

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:30.310 align:middle line:84%
I told you before,
I'm open my hands,

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:32.140 align:middle line:84%
and if I have
something in my hands,

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.960 align:middle line:90%
this will drop off or fall down.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.540 align:middle line:90%
Maybe, or maybe not.

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.440 align:middle line:90%
What I'm talking about?

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the
law that is really

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:45.070 align:middle line:90%
bond all these events.

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:49.351 align:middle line:90%
This is the synchronicity.

00:24:49.351 --> 00:24:50.840 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever heard about it?

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously, this might
be different interpretation

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:57.470 align:middle line:90%
of what is called synchronicity.

00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:59.960 align:middle line:84%
But let's try together
to give a better

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.520 align:middle line:84%
sense of these enormous
streams of events

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.470 align:middle line:84%
that the time is
offering for us.

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:11.290 align:middle line:84%
The synchronicity is what
makes everything one.

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:15.290 align:middle line:10%
Yes, everything is
linked to the others.

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:16.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not just about us.

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we are also
bond and connect

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:21.080 align:middle line:90%
to everything and everyone.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:24.600 align:middle line:84%
But here, we are talking
about the energy that

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:28.010 align:middle line:84%
makes everything in
a huge field, where

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:31.850 align:middle line:84%
every single element it's
connected with the others.

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:35.810 align:middle line:84%
So we might imagine that
everything is cause-effect.

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:38.690 align:middle line:90%
No, everything is synchronicity.

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Everything is this
invisible energy

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.480 align:middle line:90%
that connects everything.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, if synchronicity is
existing, what is magic?

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, all of this,
it looks magic.

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:56.889 align:middle line:84%
It looks really connecting
to the idea of the magician.

00:25:56.889 --> 00:25:58.180 align:middle line:90%
And what is doing the magician?

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:01.400 align:middle line:84%
A magician is the one that is
able to create, to make happen,

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.060 align:middle line:84%
things that that
looks impossible.

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.490 align:middle line:90%
Is it not true?

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, where the magician
is moving, is working?

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.450 align:middle line:90%
He's walking into time.

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:18.100 align:middle line:84%
He's working into all these
different possible time and all

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:22.070 align:middle line:84%
these time trial and
the branch of the time.

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:23.680 align:middle line:90%
And what is using?

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, he's using
the synchronicity.

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:26.620 align:middle line:90%
To do what?

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:31.510 align:middle line:84%
To attract exactly the event
that the magician wants

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:34.630 align:middle line:84%
to make appear, makes
to make it happen.

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Even if he's completely
out of the cause-effect.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.090 align:middle line:84%
But the cause-effect
is just simply

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:43.060 align:middle line:84%
our interpretation, our
mind interpretation,

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.500 align:middle line:90%
our senses interpretation.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:49.150 align:middle line:84%
So all of the
sudden, the magician

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:54.430 align:middle line:84%
is able to make things
happen, and things are real.

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:55.600 align:middle line:90%
They are tangible.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Like you know, you can manifest.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.440 align:middle line:84%
You can maybe create an
object all of a sudden

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.630 align:middle line:90%
from your hands.

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:03.550 align:middle line:90%
You materialize things.

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:04.780 align:middle line:90%
How is possible?

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Because in that case,
who has the knowledge?

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.410 align:middle line:90%
The magician.

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:11.620 align:middle line:84%
It's working, in this
structure of time,

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:14.890 align:middle line:84%
to attract exactly
the events that,

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:17.470 align:middle line:84%
thanks to the synchronicity,
is going to happen.

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Because if everything is there
and everything is possible,

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:23.470 align:middle line:84%
so that event for
sure will be manifest.

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:26.630 align:middle line:84%
But not now, but
in another time.

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:32.670 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to pull this
time right here where I need.

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:36.020 align:middle line:90%

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:38.816 align:middle line:90%
