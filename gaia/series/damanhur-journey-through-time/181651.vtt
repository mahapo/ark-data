00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:23.610 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.760 align:middle line:10%
>> So before and in our
philosophy in our spiritual

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.560 align:middle line:10%
physic--

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.130 align:middle line:10%
it's very much connecting
to the different stage

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.220 align:middle line:10%
of the transformation
of the matter in light.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.760 align:middle line:10%
We can define it in
four states and as we

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.310 align:middle line:10%
call the absence of life--

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.690 align:middle line:10%
life, thoughts, and divinity.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.230 align:middle line:84%
All of these elements are
pretty interesting to add, also

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.320 align:middle line:84%
an element that we
never touch that is also

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.270 align:middle line:84%
influencing the evolution and
is part of the challenging

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.440 align:middle line:90%
of evolution.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.610 align:middle line:84%
Evolution, as you know,
is what has been driven--

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.739 align:middle line:90%
all events of time.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.320 align:middle line:84%
This is an element that we
find only into the matter

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.640 align:middle line:84%
and is the element
that we call the enemy,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.400 align:middle line:84%
as the name doesn't
really sound so charming.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.980 align:middle line:10%
And it could be
also not pretty easy

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.560 align:middle line:10%
to understand as in
a first approach.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Because here we're
not talking only about

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.340 align:middle line:84%
something that is negative, so
the positive and the negatives.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we need the
both sides for it-- evolve.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.484 align:middle line:84%
It's everything that is
against the evolution.

00:01:34.484 --> 00:01:36.650 align:middle line:84%
It's everything that is
against the spiritualization

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:37.910 align:middle line:90%
of the matter.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.040 align:middle line:84%
It means that also
for the enemy there

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.770 align:middle line:84%
is at least three
different element

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.760 align:middle line:84%
or three different definition
that can help us to understand.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.230 align:middle line:10%
Well, for the enemy we can also
talk about the nothingness, so

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.220 align:middle line:10%
the truly concept that we can
find the enemy everywhere.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.940 align:middle line:10%
We can talk about the
enemy also inside of us.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.070 align:middle line:10%
That is one of the
deal that we have

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.400 align:middle line:10%
to manage in every
moment of our lives,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.800 align:middle line:10%
so the fact that
we are containing

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.060 align:middle line:10%
the element of the enemy.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Very similar if you went
to the regional scene

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.220 align:middle line:90%
of the [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.200 align:middle line:84%
But in this case,
it's really the part

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.710 align:middle line:84%
of who's trying to boycott
us, is the part-- it is really

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.760 align:middle line:84%
trying to make us do the wrong
things, is where there is

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.830 align:middle line:84%
the fears, is where
there is the insecurity,

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.410 align:middle line:90%
is where there is the limits.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.430 align:middle line:84%
So that is the
place of the enemy.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And then we can also talk
about the agents of the enemy.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.630 align:middle line:84%
So civilization, people-- that
they choose to serve the enemy.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.100 align:middle line:84%
So they choose to
serve destruction

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.030 align:middle line:90%
instead of their creation.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.200 align:middle line:90%
The age of the other enemy--

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.810 align:middle line:84%
they are coming back
with a lot of intensity.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.540 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
the structure of time,

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.690 align:middle line:84%
we can really talk
about the movement

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.180 align:middle line:90%
of the events inside of time.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.550 align:middle line:10%
As in this case, to
imagine the movement

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.270 align:middle line:10%
of the water inside of a river.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.810 align:middle line:10%
And we can really talk
about loops of time,

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.270 align:middle line:10%
or we can talk
about time vortex,

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.460 align:middle line:10%
or we can talk, for example,
about time islands, or fracture

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.310 align:middle line:10%
of time, or time weight.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.030 align:middle line:84%
So let's try to see how this
water in the river is moving.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.090 align:middle line:84%
Because for example, when
we talk about time loops,

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.310 align:middle line:84%
well, this could be part
of some of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.850 align:middle line:84%
of events that are
constantly repeating

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.210 align:middle line:84%
or something that is
always coming back

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.280 align:middle line:90%
as they could never change.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.870 align:middle line:84%
So part of, if you want,
of the border of the river

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.230 align:middle line:84%
where the water is starting
to create a movement that

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.470 align:middle line:90%
doesn't let the water come out.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.740 align:middle line:84%
So this-- for example,
we talk about time loops

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.100 align:middle line:84%
or also vortex of
time, where we have

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.222 align:middle line:84%
moments where the energy of
time can really accelerate.

00:04:03.222 --> 00:04:04.430 align:middle line:90%
And this is very interesting.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Because for example,
we have a lot

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.420 align:middle line:84%
of acceleration in what
is going on in our life,

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.490 align:middle line:84%
like we are crossing
moment where

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.399 align:middle line:84%
time is getting more
intense, and time

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:17.810 align:middle line:90%
is getting less intense.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, no doubt this is one
of these intense moments.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.830 align:middle line:90%
But what about also places?

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.690 align:middle line:10%
There are places
that are helping us

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.090 align:middle line:10%
a lot to really fuel
time like, for example,

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.690 align:middle line:10%
when you go to Egypt.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.500 align:middle line:84%
So then time-- it looks
completely different,

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.300 align:middle line:84%
not only because
we are fascinated

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.830 align:middle line:84%
by this incredible element,
and structures, and pyramid,

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.120 align:middle line:84%
and temple, but we feel a
different movement of time,

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.710 align:middle line:90%
or Rome.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Rome is another place where,
for example, we can really

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.640 align:middle line:84%
feel layers of
time, like to enter

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.720 align:middle line:84%
in different moment of
time in that direction.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.590 align:middle line:84%
So what are all of
these differences?

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.440 align:middle line:84%
This is really the fact
that in some places,

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.230 align:middle line:84%
time is moving in
a different way.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.980 align:middle line:84%
What is affecting
the movement of time?

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, different element.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.680 align:middle line:84%
But there is another
element that I

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.680 align:middle line:84%
would love to bring
that is about the energy

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.520 align:middle line:84%
lines of the planet, what we
call the Synchronic Lines.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.970 align:middle line:84%
This is a concept that
many people-- they are also

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.580 align:middle line:84%
touching when they talk
about the ley lines and is

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.400 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient tradition,
everything that is connecting

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.740 align:middle line:84%
to the idea that the planet is
surrounded by a net of energy

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.470 align:middle line:90%
lines, like rivers of lines.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.970 align:middle line:84%
We talk about the
Synchronic Lines

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.780 align:middle line:84%
like the main one, 18 line
that are moving horizontally,

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.480 align:middle line:84%
9 that are moving, in
this case, vertically.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.600 align:middle line:84%
The one vertical are
very interesting.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Because close to the poles, they
are creating a double spiral,

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.280 align:middle line:84%
a double spiral that are
extending the Synchronic Lines

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.065 align:middle line:84%
outside of the
planet, so connecting

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:58.940 align:middle line:84%
the lines that are coming
from another planet

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.040 align:middle line:90%
and creating a net.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.920 align:middle line:90%
That is, we call the star line.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.160 align:middle line:84%
So I am talking now about
the Synchronic Lines,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.060 align:middle line:90%
and we link that to time.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Because the Synchronic Lines
that obviously we cannot

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.010 align:middle line:84%
perceive with our
eyes, with our senses.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.300 align:middle line:84%
But again, using
our kind of senses

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.170 align:middle line:84%
are not only the highway
of the universe, at least

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.530 align:middle line:84%
the highway for
our souls from when

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.960 align:middle line:84%
we are moving from
one reincarnation

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.500 align:middle line:90%
to another reincarnation.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.620 align:middle line:84%
It's from the
Synchronic Lines that we

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.930 align:middle line:84%
are arriving in a
planet to be incarnated

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and is from the
Synchronic Lines that we

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.390 align:middle line:84%
are leaving from a planet
then for the next planet.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.900 align:middle line:90%


00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.380 align:middle line:84%
A very interesting effect
of the Synchronic Lines

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.120 align:middle line:84%
regarding time and the movement
of the events into time

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.810 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that where
there is Synchronic Lines,

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.800 align:middle line:84%
the events, the time is moving
differently, is accelerating.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.800 align:middle line:90%
So it's interesting to say that.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:05.340 align:middle line:10%
Because we see, for example, how
in some place of this planet--

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.240 align:middle line:10%
let's just think
about Silicon Valley.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Imagine how in a small territory
compared to the entire planet

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:18.130 align:middle line:84%
there are so many invention, so
many possibility to influence

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:22.850 align:middle line:84%
the entire planet
and how all of this--

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.120 align:middle line:84%
it looks a volcanoes
of idea, but also

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.640 align:middle line:84%
volcano of opportunity, like
an acceleration of time.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is thanks to the fact
that, for example, in this area

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.270 align:middle line:84%
there is an important Synchronic
Lines that is passing through.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.520 align:middle line:10%
But I can also
make other example

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.130 align:middle line:10%
in the planet Earth that
without-- not talking

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.780 align:middle line:10%
about Damanhur that definitely
in a short period of time

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.290 align:middle line:10%
has become more and
more, let's say,

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.810 align:middle line:10%
a center for the planet for
ideas, for way of thinking,

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.400 align:middle line:10%
and living, and et cetera.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.700 align:middle line:84%
There are many of these
points on the planet

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Earth that are able to make
this sort of acceleration.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.680 align:middle line:84%
But this is also
very much connected

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.650 align:middle line:90%
to what we talk before.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:12.640 align:middle line:84%
So remember, the tree with
the branches and et cetera.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there are all these
big different branches.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And we can take one
of them in any moment.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:24.680 align:middle line:84%
But what happened when I'm
choosing one of these branches?

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.880 align:middle line:84%
Or what happened to all
the oddest branches?

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.830 align:middle line:84%
So naturally, they are going
to collapse and throw back

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:36.549 align:middle line:84%
in the main flow in
the trunk of the tree.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:37.720 align:middle line:90%
So nothing is waste.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.010 align:middle line:84%
It's always based
on the complexity.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:43.720 align:middle line:84%
So we are giving
energy into the one

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.830 align:middle line:90%
that is being given complexity.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.330 align:middle line:84%
So my action, what I'm
choosing, what my free will

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.230 align:middle line:90%
did to make it happen.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.320 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time
in exactly moment where

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm choosing something out
of multiple possibilities,

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.810 align:middle line:90%
they have been opening.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:02.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that you had
some of these experience

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:07.720 align:middle line:84%
where all of the sudden, you had
memories of what was going on.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Or you remembered that you
was dreaming on the moment

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.400 align:middle line:84%
where you was with your
friends drinking in displays

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.830 align:middle line:90%
that you never been before.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:21.130 align:middle line:84%
This could be good
explanation of what we call,

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:25.660 align:middle line:84%
for example, deja
vu or precognition.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:29.820 align:middle line:84%
So you've been anticipating
part of the future.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And now, the future is arriving,
so you are exactly what

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.030 align:middle line:90%
you already felt before.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:39.670 align:middle line:84%
So these kinds of
phenomenons are literally

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:43.540 align:middle line:84%
connecting to the movement
of time and the fact

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:48.250 align:middle line:84%
that we are floating
in trial timelines

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:52.010 align:middle line:84%
where sometimes we go
in trial timelines that

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:52.820 align:middle line:90%
are accelerating.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And then we go back
to something that

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.830 align:middle line:90%
is going slower or vice versa.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:01.840 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, we are picking
something of a possible future.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And then it's going
to happen, but only

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:10.460 align:middle line:84%
when then the events slowly will
arrive to that specific point.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.930 align:middle line:90%
It's another vision, obviously.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:12.730 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.960 align:middle line:10%
So we also have deja vu, for
example, of our past life.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:20.240 align:middle line:84%
But what it means again is
a point of this territory

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.087 align:middle line:84%
that probably it's
making a connection

00:10:23.087 --> 00:10:24.170 align:middle line:90%
with this other territory.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, we
have clear pictures, images,

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.200 align:middle line:84%
ideas, feelings,
vision of what it was--

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.090 align:middle line:84%
one of these contemporary
moments where we are living.

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:40.660 align:middle line:90%


00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.110 align:middle line:90%
There is something else.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, I
would love to talk also

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:49.070 align:middle line:90%
about fractures of time.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously, in a territory
here in the United States,

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.930 align:middle line:84%
you have the Grand Canyon
that is an amazing place,

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.010 align:middle line:90%
and it's a fracture.

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:01.390 align:middle line:84%
It's literally a huge
fracture into the Earth

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:05.660 align:middle line:84%
that created a very interesting
landscape and everything.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.190 align:middle line:90%
But let's come back to time.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And instead of imagine a
beautiful Grand Canyon in time,

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:18.880 align:middle line:84%
we can actually,
really bring our ideas

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.760 align:middle line:84%
to something that
maybe can separate one

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.950 align:middle line:90%
timeline from another timeline.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.520 align:middle line:90%
I can talk again about Atlantis.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Beside the reason why Atlantis
has been falling down,

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:36.380 align:middle line:84%
beside the fact that
these events, probably

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.740 align:middle line:84%
an asteroid that was shooting
the planet and make them--

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.640 align:middle line:84%
these enormous disaster
all over the planet Earth.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.690 align:middle line:84%
It makes, literally, the island
to disappear under the Atlantic

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Ocean and then
creating a redesign

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.330 align:middle line:84%
in literally the face
of the planet Earth.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:59.700 align:middle line:84%
What we have in an event that is
so catastrophic like this one--

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:05.040 align:middle line:84%
it's also not only a loss
in terms of complexity, so

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.060 align:middle line:90%
in terms of evolution.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we talk
about that when

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.520 align:middle line:90%
we talk about past and future.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.940 align:middle line:84%
So, oh, the future is
always more evolved.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.260 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not true.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.940 align:middle line:84%
Also, because we know that
time doesn't move linearly,

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.240 align:middle line:84%
but can move in many
different direction.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.850 align:middle line:90%
So we cannot say that.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:25.610 align:middle line:84%
But example of Atlantis--
higher level of evolution.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And then right after, when it
disappeared, almost nothing.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.940 align:middle line:10%
A level that is really,
really, really low.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:37.380 align:middle line:84%
But what happened,
also time wise in terms

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.090 align:middle line:90%
of the time territory.

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:42.240 align:middle line:84%
So there is a continuity
in that evolution,

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.100 align:middle line:90%
in that expression of evolution.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.110 align:middle line:90%
And what happened?

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:46.970 align:middle line:90%
It fell down.

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:48.930 align:middle line:90%
It collapsed literally.

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:53.230 align:middle line:84%
So this is an example of a
fracture in the time territory.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:55.290 align:middle line:90%
So it's literally a fracture.

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:56.340 align:middle line:90%
So there is a point.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And then this point
collapse completely.

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:02.220 align:middle line:90%
And there's no continuity.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.200 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible because
Atlantis doesn't exist anymore.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.410 align:middle line:90%
It's lost.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:11.100 align:middle line:84%
That civilization, that
technology, that possibilities,

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.530 align:middle line:84%
that everything is
not there anymore.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And who knows when
eventually we can reach again

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:19.090 align:middle line:90%
that level of complexity?

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.340 align:middle line:90%
So there is a fracture.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.990 align:middle line:84%
So we know, for example,
in the time territory

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:30.030 align:middle line:84%
that we are exploring that more
or less 10, 12,000 years ago.

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:32.850 align:middle line:84%
So the time of the falling
of Atlantis-- there

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.080 align:middle line:90%
is this fracture.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.990 align:middle line:90%
So actually, our time.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm talking about our
time, I'm talking about now.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.680 align:middle line:90%
So the time of now--

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.600 align:middle line:84%
it's not connecting with
the time of Atlantis.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.010 align:middle line:90%
Because there is a separation.

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:48.000 align:middle line:90%
There is a hole.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.270 align:middle line:84%
There is a canyon
between that territory

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.850 align:middle line:90%
and the territory of Atlantis.

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And there is also another
physical explanation.

00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:00.360 align:middle line:90%
Atlantis doesn't exist now.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.380 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it true?

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously, for us,
Atlantis is existing.

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:05.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm not joking.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.290 align:middle line:84%
It's something that we
all felt that is there.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:14.220 align:middle line:84%
But if we have to approach
in a very rational way,

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.720 align:middle line:90%
there are a lot of theories.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.580 align:middle line:90%
There are a lot of hypotheses.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:21.870 align:middle line:84%
But until now, no one
never found something

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.750 align:middle line:84%
that can tell us that
Atlantis was existing,

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:26.670 align:middle line:84%
it was located in
the place, there

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:28.560 align:middle line:84%
was that kind of a
civilization, and it

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.900 align:middle line:90%
was doing the kind of things.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:31.760 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.420 align:middle line:90%
Let's not think about that.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Only theory-- very
good theory, of course.

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:41.640 align:middle line:10%
But nothing that can
absolutely with no doubt

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.830 align:middle line:10%
confirm that Atlantis existed.

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's doubting that
Egyptian are existing, OK?

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Because the Egyptian--
they left something

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:53.620 align:middle line:84%
that clearly tell us that
this is a great civilization.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.980 align:middle line:90%
Not about Atlantis.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:58.350 align:middle line:84%
So this is example that
there is this fracture.

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:03.800 align:middle line:84%
So that time here is still
not united with this one.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:08.280 align:middle line:84%
So also on the physical
level, the events

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:12.630 align:middle line:84%
are manifesting the fact
that Atlantis is non-existent

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:14.520 align:middle line:90%
or at least not yet.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:15.635 align:middle line:90%
Because who knows?

00:15:15.635 --> 00:15:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Probably this is one
of the other chapter

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:21.820 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to
touch in the future,

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:25.200 align:middle line:84%
connecting maybe to
the return of Atlantis.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Maybe exactly because
a series of elements

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:31.890 align:middle line:84%
are playing very
well at the moment

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:36.690 align:middle line:84%
that we might have the
possibility, hopefully,

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:39.660 align:middle line:84%
in a close future to bring
back-- well, if it's not

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.700 align:middle line:90%
the island of Atlantis.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.540 align:middle line:10%
Because that one is going
to stay under the ocean,

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:50.130 align:middle line:10%
maybe to save, to bring back
part of that level of evolution

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:54.800 align:middle line:10%
that has been lost
a long time ago.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.200 align:middle line:84%
So we talk about
also the fracture.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.530 align:middle line:90%
Definitely very fascinated.

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Because we can also
see many example

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:03.902 align:middle line:90%
in the most recent history.

00:16:03.902 --> 00:16:05.860 align:middle line:84%
When I'm talking about
the most recent history,

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:12.180 align:middle line:84%
is obviously the history of
this last 2,000, 2,500 years.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.640 align:middle line:84%
So we can use all
of this information

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.600 align:middle line:84%
like a filter to see
how time is affecting

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.900 align:middle line:84%
our life, but also the
life of the humankind

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.430 align:middle line:90%
here on the planet Earth.

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Again, talking about
the movement of time,

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.650 align:middle line:84%
talk about something
very interesting

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:31.425 align:middle line:90%
that we call the time castle.

00:16:31.425 --> 00:16:34.120 align:middle line:90%


00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.920 align:middle line:90%
What are time castle?

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And what are we
going to use them?

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, the concept
of the time castle

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:43.720 align:middle line:84%
is very important
for two reason.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Number one, we already touch
the fact that if complexity

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:53.890 align:middle line:84%
is going this direction,
well, something more complex

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:55.730 align:middle line:84%
can stay in something
less complex.

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:56.530 align:middle line:90%
Remember?

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.240 align:middle line:90%
OK, time package.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.310 align:middle line:90%
Less complex, big pieces.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:01.690 align:middle line:90%
More complex, little pieces.

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:03.850 align:middle line:84%
So little pieces can
stay in the big pieces.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Big pieces cannot stay
in the little one.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.980 align:middle line:84%
That means generally
speaking, time travel

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:15.609 align:middle line:90%
is only in what we call--

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:17.530 align:middle line:90%
well, it's hard to say past.

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Because as you know, it's
all in the same moment,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.990 align:middle line:84%
but only where there
is less complexity.

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:25.450 align:middle line:90%
So probably the past.

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:26.560 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.359 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, very hard from the
past to go to the future,

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:32.800 align:middle line:90%
because this is bigger.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:37.390 align:middle line:84%
I cannot bring anything in
something that doesn't have

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:38.440 align:middle line:90%
the same space.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.400 align:middle line:90%
It's more, OK?

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.470 align:middle line:90%
I cannot fit anything there.

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:50.230 align:middle line:84%
So what about if I have to
travel very far time wise?

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:56.340 align:middle line:84%
So I have to travel many, many
thousand of years far away.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:00.270 align:middle line:84%
Not very different from when,
for example, we take the flight

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:01.735 align:middle line:90%
and we go to Australia.

00:18:01.735 --> 00:18:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, coming from Europe,
obviously, it's even longer.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:05.980 align:middle line:90%
But what you do?

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.200 align:middle line:90%
You always do.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.350 align:middle line:90%
I step over.

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:11.190 align:middle line:84%
So here is the same
concept or the same--

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.890 align:middle line:84%
one of the first function
of the time castle.

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:21.240 align:middle line:10%
There are physical places that
are being prepared, protected,

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.790 align:middle line:10%
keep it to be one of
these-- step over.

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:25.590 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:26.250 align:middle line:90%
[WHISTLE]

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:27.095 align:middle line:90%
--I'm going there.

00:18:27.095 --> 00:18:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And I take a little break to
recharge myself and eventually,

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:35.010 align:middle line:84%
also bring something
with me to then arrive

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.270 align:middle line:90%
to the final destination.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:40.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, we can
understand that is--

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:45.600 align:middle line:84%
there is an enormous use of
energy to do a time travel.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:51.420 align:middle line:10%
But also, we have to imagine
that there is something

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.960 align:middle line:10%
that sometimes we
need to bring with us

00:18:54.960 --> 00:19:01.030 align:middle line:10%
to modify something in the
past like neutral events.

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:04.380 align:middle line:84%
If I have to go in a place
that is completely full,

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:05.940 align:middle line:90%
how I can modify something?

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:06.750 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:07.550 align:middle line:90%
It's all full.

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:09.060 align:middle line:90%
It's all done.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.290 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:14.260 align:middle line:10%
What about if I
carry on with me some

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:19.700 align:middle line:10%
of these neutral events that
allow me to create some change?

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.280 align:middle line:84%
So from where I can bring
these new sort-- events?

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.410 align:middle line:90%
Well, from these castles.

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:27.050 align:middle line:84%
So one of the other function
of the castle that is not just

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:29.120 align:middle line:84%
to protect and
recharge and give you

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:34.850 align:middle line:84%
another possibility to the
traveler to regain whatever

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:36.120 align:middle line:90%
is needed.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, there is also
a specific function

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:42.310 align:middle line:84%
related to the neutral
event, so two new events

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:45.260 align:middle line:84%
that I can literally
import to then modify

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:49.790 align:middle line:84%
whatever I have to modify,
which are just to give you

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:50.840 align:middle line:90%
a practical example.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Again, these places,
these castles--

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:59.110 align:middle line:84%
well, sometimes are
not really huge places.

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:00.860 align:middle line:90%
They might be caves.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:04.190 align:middle line:84%
They might be
small stone sample.

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:08.870 align:middle line:84%
They might be places in
some second world hidden.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:10.910 align:middle line:90%
Who knows where?

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:12.830 align:middle line:84%
The places that in
the tradition that

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:15.200 align:middle line:84%
have been-- describe
it with guardians

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.510 align:middle line:90%
for generation of generation.

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:19.730 align:middle line:84%
They are there to
protect the place.

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And if something happened
or someone arrive,

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:25.370 align:middle line:90%
they have to do specific things.

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Even if maybe for an entire
life, no one will show up

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.720 align:middle line:84%
or nothing will
happen, for tradition

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.560 align:middle line:90%
they're going to do that.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.630 align:middle line:84%
They are obviously
part, again, of

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:37.460 align:middle line:90%
spiritual esoteric tradition.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:42.110 align:middle line:84%
But we have known
about people and places

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:43.585 align:middle line:90%
like this for a long time.

00:20:43.585 --> 00:20:46.700 align:middle line:10%
So this is exactly
about this castle,

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:50.450 align:middle line:10%
that if you want in
the time territory,

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:53.540 align:middle line:10%
they have these very unique
position that give them

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:57.380 align:middle line:10%
the possibility to be
in the time territory,

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.080 align:middle line:10%
but at the same
time a little bit

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:03.200 align:middle line:10%
apart, like a part of
territory in the river that

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.200 align:middle line:10%
is entering inside of the
river to then coming back.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.740 align:middle line:84%
So you might have a
different perspective

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:13.340 align:middle line:84%
of how the water into
the river is moving.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:15.950 align:middle line:84%
Or at least you have
a privileged position

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:19.760 align:middle line:84%
that you can reach
to be observing

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.780 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time still
operating inside of time.

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.630 align:middle line:90%


00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Neutral events-- and it's
actually one of these eight low

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:35.830 align:middle line:84%
that are managing
the universe of four.

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:37.870 align:middle line:84%
So the falling of
the neutral event--

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:41.770 align:middle line:84%
it's something that happened
constantly and is directly

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:45.970 align:middle line:84%
connecting to the
interaction that we

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:48.900 align:middle line:84%
have between these
different state--

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:53.969 align:middle line:84%
the real, the threshold,
and the universe of four.

00:21:53.969 --> 00:21:55.510 align:middle line:84%
The four involve
the neutral events--

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:59.610 align:middle line:84%
it's like to imagine
a sort of rain, a rain

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:03.820 align:middle line:84%
that as you can imagine,
it's not constantly the same.

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that it's
raining the same everywhere.

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the rain
is more intense.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.750 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's less intense.

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:12.640 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's really strong.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.830 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's just soft.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:18.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we talk about the
falling of neutral event,

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:23.590 align:middle line:84%
we talk about in the time
territory and numbers

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:30.580 align:middle line:84%
of possibilities that are
being created for us, for us

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:34.180 align:middle line:84%
not only human
with divine spark,

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:40.030 align:middle line:84%
but us as everyone-- life forms
that in the universal form

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:41.950 align:middle line:90%
are doing evolution.

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:46.060 align:middle line:84%
This divine principle
that I mention--

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:50.050 align:middle line:84%
it's something that is touching
everything-- stone, animals,

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:54.280 align:middle line:84%
plants, also what we call
human, even if for, say, human,

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.720 align:middle line:90%
it's a little bit of confusion.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Because we know that for human,
we are not mentioning the body.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:04.990 align:middle line:84%
But let's say a four that
is evolved enough to contain

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:06.940 align:middle line:90%
what we call a divine spark.

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.260 align:middle line:90%
That is what we call humans.

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.900 align:middle line:84%
We already separate
the idea of the body

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.880 align:middle line:84%
from the idea of what
we contain as soul.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.060 align:middle line:10%
So this falling of
the neutral events

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:23.650 align:middle line:10%
are all the possibilities that
we can use during a lifetime.

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:25.360 align:middle line:84%
Possibility that
we are expressing

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:31.210 align:middle line:84%
in a time territory in this form
of these different trial times

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:35.840 align:middle line:84%
that when we choose, we
are excluding the others.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:40.900 align:middle line:84%
So let them collapse into
the main one, following

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.150 align:middle line:84%
the direction of
evolution, following

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:45.670 align:middle line:90%
the direction of complexity.

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:48.670 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
neutral or saturated,

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:51.790 align:middle line:84%
it's again the fact
that in this moment,

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:55.600 align:middle line:84%
for example, I can
stand, or I can stay sit,

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.920 align:middle line:84%
or I can go and drink a
tea, or I can just simply--

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.830 align:middle line:84%
staying silent for
two minutes, or I can

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:05.870 align:middle line:90%
do any other possible events.

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:10.090 align:middle line:84%
So all these possibilities are
what we called a neutral event.

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And we call saturated
events when they

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:17.530 align:middle line:90%
are being used for an action.

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:22.020 align:middle line:84%
It is always the use of the free
will that makes the saturation

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:25.250 align:middle line:90%
or not of the events.

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:30.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, as I'm talking about
the fact that this falling,

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:34.230 align:middle line:84%
this rain could be
more or less intense,

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:36.590 align:middle line:84%
so we can also imagine
that in a time package,

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:39.170 align:middle line:84%
there might be more or
less neutral events.

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:43.880 align:middle line:84%
They can contain a different
quantity of possibilities.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.450 align:middle line:10%
And beside the quantity
of possibilities,

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:51.110 align:middle line:10%
there are the free
will of the individual

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:53.980 align:middle line:10%
of the souls that are
living in that time package,

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:58.190 align:middle line:10%
that they can use or not
these events that makes then

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:03.230 align:middle line:10%
the saturation of a time package
full, complete, or a time

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:06.590 align:middle line:10%
package that has become with
many different possibilities

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:11.840 align:middle line:10%
that they can still be in
use, because they are left.

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:15.320 align:middle line:84%
This is part, again, of an
expression of evolution.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:18.170 align:middle line:10%
And we don't have to forget that
this expression of evolution

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:21.380 align:middle line:10%
is always linking to us, OK?

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.510 align:middle line:90%
The time is the field.

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:25.580 align:middle line:84%
The universal form
is the bigger field

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:27.670 align:middle line:84%
where the time is
included, where

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:32.450 align:middle line:84%
we are playing this game if
we want to say like this.

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:35.600 align:middle line:84%
But we are the one
that are playing.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.000 align:middle line:84%
All the rest are the
instrument that we

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.420 align:middle line:84%
have at our disposal or
the border of the field.

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Or we know that the field is
in cement instead of grass

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:46.150 align:middle line:90%
or in other material.

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And then we can do one thing
instead of another one.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:55.700 align:middle line:84%
But we are the one that can use
our last power, the free will

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:59.690 align:middle line:84%
to make an event possible or
to make an event not possible,

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:04.210 align:middle line:84%
simply because I'm not
going to choose that one.

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Could be interesting to see
in the vision of the neutral

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:12.600 align:middle line:84%
or the falling of the neutral
event, how in some moment

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:18.210 align:middle line:84%
there might be a lack of them
or a mind or stream in how these

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:20.760 align:middle line:84%
could affect, for
example, evolution.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:27.030 align:middle line:84%
But I think that at the moment,
we have enough information

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:29.520 align:middle line:90%
to go for the next step.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.700 align:middle line:90%


00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:36.250 align:middle line:84%
I talk about physical
places, very well-protected

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:40.510 align:middle line:84%
secret places, places that have
been hidden for a long time.

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's very good that
they have been hidden.

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And these are places that are
on the time territory located

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.510 align:middle line:90%
differently.

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:57.780 align:middle line:84%
That means located in different
moments of the time territory,

00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:01.520 align:middle line:84%
so obviously is depending from
where you start your journey,

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.320 align:middle line:84%
so from where you started
your time traveled.

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:09.810 align:middle line:84%
So you can find on your
way that correct castle

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:14.760 align:middle line:84%
to take, recharge, and
do whatever you need.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:19.170 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about an
experience like this one,

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:24.360 align:middle line:84%
we have also to imagine
that these are places

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:30.070 align:middle line:90%
that are used not only by us.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:31.210 align:middle line:90%
What I mean?

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:33.370 align:middle line:84%
It's the concept that
we touched already.

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:36.735 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that
this life form--

00:27:36.735 --> 00:27:40.630 align:middle line:84%
it might be one compatible
to do this kind of experience

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:45.320 align:middle line:84%
in this planet in this time
territory where we are.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:51.550 align:middle line:84%
But these castles are
available also for other forms,

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:54.340 align:middle line:90%
for other life forms.

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:59.360 align:middle line:84%
None necessary coming only
from this place, this planet,

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:03.370 align:middle line:84%
but also from other
places, other planets.

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, they
need to have a life

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:11.480 align:middle line:84%
form that is compatible with
the element of the planet Earth.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:15.900 align:middle line:84%
But they might be
very different.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:22.640 align:middle line:84%
You might imagine, for example,
that one of these time castle

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:26.060 align:middle line:84%
is the temple of
humankind, is the temple--

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:29.120 align:middle line:84%
the eloquent temple that
we built in Damanhur.

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the many
function of this place

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:36.530 align:middle line:84%
is also to be a sort of
station, a sort of place

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:39.800 align:middle line:84%
that is connecting to something
that we want to change.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And we know one that is going
to happen as something that we

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.260 align:middle line:84%
will love to reconnect,
like [INAUDIBLE],,

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:49.310 align:middle line:84%
for example, Atlantis, or
the good part of Atlantis.

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Because not everything in
Atlantis went really very well.

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:57.890 align:middle line:84%
But in this regards, well, the
temple is one of these places,

00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:01.280 align:middle line:84%
but build and created as
many other places also

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:06.350 align:middle line:84%
for different physical body,
different physical form.

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:09.210 align:middle line:90%
Because we are not the only one.

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And again, we are
not the only one

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:17.030 align:middle line:84%
also imagine ourself,
only with this dimension,

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:22.940 align:middle line:84%
with this physical body, or
with this different [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:25.790 align:middle line:90%
that the body is giving to us.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:33.500 align:middle line:10%
The time castles are places
sometimes also challenging

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:34.740 align:middle line:10%
for a time traveler.

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:36.800 align:middle line:84%
That means sometimes
they are really

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:41.250 align:middle line:84%
located in place that
they could be also

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:43.910 align:middle line:84%
pretty challenging
for the physical body.

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, we didn't talk
about the different kind

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.570 align:middle line:90%
of time traveling.

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:51.950 align:middle line:84%
So for example, when we talk
about physical time travel,

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:56.120 align:middle line:84%
we also might imagine something
that is intense for the body.

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:59.090 align:middle line:84%
So you also have to be
prepared for something

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:03.950 align:middle line:84%
that is going to make your
body relearn the limits

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:06.320 align:middle line:90%
in every single possible sense.

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:09.670 align:middle line:90%
