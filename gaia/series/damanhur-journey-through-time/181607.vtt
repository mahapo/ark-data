[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.451 --> 00:00:24.190 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>> We talk about the
time as a sphere.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.920 align:middle line:10%
We talk about time
as a territory.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.320 align:middle line:10%
We talk about time also with the
idea of multiple times, trial

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.800 align:middle line:10%
times, time as a tree with
many different branches.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.340 align:middle line:84%
But let's try now to
observe with more attention

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.100 align:middle line:90%
the element that are--

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.090 align:middle line:84%
distinguish one time
for another time.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, we can imagine
that what we are living

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.020 align:middle line:84%
is where our
conscious is focusing.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.970 align:middle line:90%
So we may imagine that is one.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.130 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
moment, we already

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.650 align:middle line:84%
discovered that there
are many different times,

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:08.110 align:middle line:84%
many different realities,
that we can dive into it.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's try to describe
the complexity of time.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.380 align:middle line:90%
We imagine the trunk.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.940 align:middle line:90%
We imagine the tree.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.260 align:middle line:84%
But let's try now to
imagine different package.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Package after another package,
after another package.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.730 align:middle line:84%
So let's try to divide
these different time

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.810 align:middle line:90%
territory in different package.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And we can talk also
about a specific duration

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.470 align:middle line:90%
about this time package.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.940 align:middle line:10%
Normally, we talk
about 66 years.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.680 align:middle line:84%
But they could be also for a
very special situation, maybe

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.990 align:middle line:90%
shorter than this 66 years.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.210 align:middle line:90%
So what are these package?

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.420 align:middle line:90%
And what they are containing?

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, they are
containing events.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.700 align:middle line:84%
They are containing
possible times.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.220 align:middle line:84%
So possible things that
they can happen or not.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.770 align:middle line:90%
So something can happen.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.460 align:middle line:84%
I can use one of these
events through my free will.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.380 align:middle line:90%
And this is creating what?

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.235 align:middle line:90%
It's creating complexity.

00:02:12.235 --> 00:02:14.150 align:middle line:90%
It is creating evolution.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.770 align:middle line:84%
But it's always, for example,
the future more evolved

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.270 align:middle line:90%
than the past.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.260 align:middle line:84%
This is the classical
interpretation of history.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.770 align:middle line:84%
So we've been in a
process of evolution

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.670 align:middle line:84%
where now we are expressing
the best of the best in terms

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.280 align:middle line:84%
of technology, in terms
of use of resources,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.260 align:middle line:84%
in terms of
organization and so on.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.690 align:middle line:84%
But we don't believe
that probably this

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.520 align:middle line:90%
is the only version of history.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.830 align:middle line:90%
We talk about many civilization.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.050 align:middle line:84%
For example, we can
talk about Atlantis.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And Atlantis was
much before, what

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.560 align:middle line:84%
we imagine is the
evolution of our societies.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And Atlantis probably
was a civilization

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.580 align:middle line:90%
that was much more evolved.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Again, and when I'm
talking about evolution,

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about possibilities.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.470 align:middle line:90%
Possibility to create.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.700 align:middle line:10%
So if Atlantis was
existing and we

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.270 align:middle line:10%
talk about civilization,
the start more or less 30,

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.160 align:middle line:10%
32,000 years ago and then
probably disappeared 10,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.000 align:middle line:10%
12,000 years ago,
well, wait a moment.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.540 align:middle line:84%
It means that maybe it's not
true that future is always

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.550 align:middle line:90%
more evolved and past--

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.775 align:middle line:90%
it's less evolved.

00:03:26.775 --> 00:03:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is something
that doesn't fit.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Because even if it's
back into the past,

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis was much more
evolved than the evolution

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.150 align:middle line:90%
that we are expressing now.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go back
to these packages.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.410 align:middle line:84%
So what they are containing--
different events.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Really, quantity of
events, like to imagine

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.820 align:middle line:84%
a reign of neutral
events we call them,

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.400 align:middle line:84%
that they are opening more or
less possibilities, possibility

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.250 align:middle line:84%
that if we use free
will, we saturate.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.360 align:middle line:84%
If we don't use, we just
simply keep neutral.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.200 align:middle line:84%
So they are still
there available.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.650 align:middle line:90%
What it means?

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, it means that
look at the history.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.560 align:middle line:84%
There are a moment of time
where, wow, so many things

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.710 align:middle line:84%
are happening, so many
events, so many change, so

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:16.850 align:middle line:90%
many transformation.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.370 align:middle line:90%
And what?

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.100 align:middle line:84%
At a moment of time where
almost nothing changed.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.700 align:middle line:90%
Things are always the same.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.980 align:middle line:90%
So it's almost boring, OK?

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.200 align:middle line:90%
So what is about--

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.960 align:middle line:84%
this is really
about the density--

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.710 align:middle line:90%
is the density of time.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.900 align:middle line:84%
So the capacity to have more or
less complexity, more or less

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.080 align:middle line:90%
evolution.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.430 align:middle line:84%
That is then matched on the
fact that more things that

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.040 align:middle line:84%
can happen or less
things-- they will happen.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.670 align:middle line:84%
More transformation is going to
happen or less transformation

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.740 align:middle line:90%
is going to happen.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, if everything
is moving correctly,

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.200 align:middle line:84%
yes, we move from less
complexity to more complexity.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.330 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it true?

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.970 align:middle line:84%
It's like to imagine
squares inside

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.790 align:middle line:84%
of this package, squares
that are beginning.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:06.830 align:middle line:90%
They are bigger.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And there they're becoming
smaller, and smaller,

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.000 align:middle line:84%
and smaller, and
smaller, and smaller.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:84%
This element is extremely
important to understand

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.520 align:middle line:84%
the possibility of what we can
call time travel, for example.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.630 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, if past and
future doesn't exist,

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.440 align:middle line:84%
but there is a direction
of complexities

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.840 align:middle line:84%
or a direction of
evolution, we might

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.770 align:middle line:84%
imagine that something can
move from a place that is more

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.240 align:middle line:84%
evolved to a place that is
less evolved, from a place that

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.760 align:middle line:84%
is more complex with more
complexity with a place

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.470 align:middle line:90%
with less complexity.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.030 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it true?

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.010 align:middle line:84%
So this is actually
the base of what

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.490 align:middle line:84%
we call the possibility
of time traveling.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:56.160 align:middle line:84%
I can imagine that I can travel
from the future to the past

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.440 align:middle line:84%
or as far I'm going
into the past.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.280 align:middle line:84%
So as far I'm going
from the complexity

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.850 align:middle line:84%
that I'm expressing in
this moment as more--

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.080 align:middle line:84%
I can reach places in
what we call the past.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.860 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.580 align:middle line:84%
Let's try to describe
the rhythm of time.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.280 align:middle line:90%


00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.040 align:middle line:84%
To express the rhythm
of a time package,

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.240 align:middle line:84%
we bring the example
of when in the '60s,

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.370 align:middle line:90%
you are going to dance.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And there are the
music of the '60s, OK?

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:32.860 align:middle line:90%
And everybody is dancing--

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:33.810 align:middle line:90%
the music.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:34.980 align:middle line:90%
And then you go to the '80s.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And the '80s-- there
is other music.

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.380 align:middle line:84%
So the dance are similar,
but completely different

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.040 align:middle line:90%
from what could be now.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Go to a disco and
then listening--

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.130 align:middle line:84%
modern music, or techno,
or whatever it is,

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.310 align:middle line:84%
and then dance with
that rhythm of music.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.310 align:middle line:90%


00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's imagine something
pretty similar, also,

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.720 align:middle line:84%
when we talk about the future
and past in different time

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.620 align:middle line:90%
package.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.390 align:middle line:84%
So every time package is
also defined by a rhythm.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:10.740 align:middle line:84%
It can also maybe help us to
understand why, for example, we

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.290 align:middle line:90%
might come back--

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.830 align:middle line:84%
reincarnation in
one moment of time,

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.210 align:middle line:84%
instead of another
moment of time.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.930 align:middle line:84%
This could also
connect into my rhythm,

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.480 align:middle line:84%
to the rhythm of, let's
say, the music that

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.980 align:middle line:84%
is played in that moment,
so the kind of events,

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.490 align:middle line:84%
that they might be created
exactly in that time

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.590 align:middle line:90%
package instead of another one.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:37.920 align:middle line:84%
Or one of the reason why we
are being incarnated in one

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.545 align:middle line:90%
time instead of another time.

00:07:39.545 --> 00:07:41.850 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing wrong
with the others, OK?

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.470 align:middle line:90%
But why I'm being--

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:47.730 align:middle line:84%
doing an experience
alive in the 1200

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:51.160 align:middle line:84%
and then in the 600
instead of another time.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:51.960 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Because there is a rhythm
that is compatible with what

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm achieving, what
I'm doing in my process

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.700 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritualization of
the matter with my soul.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.900 align:middle line:84%
So I'm compatible
with the rhythm.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm not compatible
with another rhythm.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be
incarnated in one time

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:10.530 align:middle line:90%
and not in another one.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.920 align:middle line:84%
But I will be back exactly
in this other moment.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.070 align:middle line:84%
So there are going to
be time travelers that,

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:20.760 align:middle line:84%
for example, are compatible
with the time package,

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.270 align:middle line:84%
because their rhythm are
compatible with the rhythm

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.790 align:middle line:90%
of that time package.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.410 align:middle line:84%
Another time traveler that--
they will not be compatible,

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:31.320 align:middle line:84%
because they are simply
having another rhythm,

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.260 align:middle line:84%
so they need to
go somewhere else.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they cannot literally
enter in that specific area

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.580 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:48.720 align:middle line:10%
Now, I have to introduce the
idea of what is divinity.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.930 align:middle line:10%
We are talking now
about our divinities.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:56.250 align:middle line:84%
We talk about hundred thousand
of different divinities.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Yes, now we might have
the most recent idea

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.910 align:middle line:84%
of the religion that brought
everything to one god, OK?

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.580 align:middle line:90%
So only one and that's it.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:11.490 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that humans-- they
have been praying, connecting,

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:15.510 align:middle line:90%
wishing two different gods.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:19.890 align:middle line:84%
It probably sounds like
a need of our evolution

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.560 align:middle line:84%
or an instrument
for our evolution

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.100 align:middle line:84%
to accelerate of this
process of transformation

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.200 align:middle line:84%
that we called
the enlightenment.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:33.920 align:middle line:84%
It's an element that is so neat,
not only when we are into time.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because in
this time territory,

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.950 align:middle line:84%
probably all these
different divinity--

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.250 align:middle line:90%
they are located here and there.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Is it not true that we
talk about the Catholicism?

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, we can really, literally
talk about the specific area

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.700 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And if we're talking
about the Muslim people,

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.790 align:middle line:84%
so we can definitely talk
about a divinity that

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.600 align:middle line:84%
is located in another
part of the world

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.420 align:middle line:90%
and so on for all of them.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:01.140 align:middle line:84%
But I would love to try to bring
more the idea for the relation

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:05.460 align:middle line:84%
that we have as human, here
into time with divinities

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:10.470 align:middle line:84%
that are super powerful
forces that are not into time.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Time is an element
that we are dealing

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:15.960 align:middle line:90%
when we are in the matter.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.364 align:middle line:90%
Don't forget that.

00:10:17.364 --> 00:10:18.780 align:middle line:84%
When we are outside
of the matter,

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.440 align:middle line:90%
time doesn't exist anymore.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.200 align:middle line:90%
We are outside of time.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:26.160 align:middle line:84%
When we die and we start
to travel from the matter

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.940 align:middle line:84%
to the threshold, to the real,
we are not into time anymore.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.110 align:middle line:90%
We are outside of time.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.040 align:middle line:84%
So imagine all these divinity
that in any case is--

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.710 align:middle line:84%
even if they are
not inside of time,

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:40.730 align:middle line:84%
they can really
support us a lot.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.030 align:middle line:90%
In which way?

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.200 align:middle line:90%
Well, in several different way.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.870 align:middle line:84%
But what could be
very interesting

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.530 align:middle line:84%
for us is to settle
down whatever action

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:54.720 align:middle line:84%
has been done by humans in
what is a truly transformation

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.830 align:middle line:90%
of ourself.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:57.540 align:middle line:90%
How this happen?

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is
happening every time

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:03.300 align:middle line:84%
that they are bringing their
attention to what is going

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.464 align:middle line:90%
on here on the planet Earth.

00:11:05.464 --> 00:11:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I'm talking
about the planet Earth,

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.500 align:middle line:84%
but this is the system
that is working everywhere.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:14.070 align:middle line:84%
It's what we call the
point of divine attention.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:15.960 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:21.090 align:middle line:84%
When we are observing
something as I'm now

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:24.720 align:middle line:84%
observing the camera,
I'm blinking my eyes.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.640 align:middle line:90%
But wait a moment.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Are you aware that
you're blinking now?

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.270 align:middle line:90%
There is a fraction--

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:35.820 align:middle line:84%
just a little fraction of second
where I am not seeing anything,

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.430 align:middle line:90%
but I don't perceive that.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Let's try to bring the
same concept to a divinity.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.590 align:middle line:84%
So imagine in the blink that
we are doing with our eyes.

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:51.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's also-- blinking
of the eyes of a divinity

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.185 align:middle line:90%
is actually a time package.

00:11:53.185 --> 00:11:56.210 align:middle line:90%


00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:58.320 align:middle line:84%
So what happened
in the time package

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.780 align:middle line:84%
is the time where the
divinities with the eyes closed.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.530 align:middle line:90%
So everything is possible.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Everything is these
multiple possible times.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:07.510 align:middle line:90%
With what?

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.540 align:middle line:90%
With all the possibilities, OK?

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.440 align:middle line:90%
And this is our perspective.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.740 align:middle line:84%
All of this is still
not completely settled

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:21.190 align:middle line:84%
until the divinity is going to
open the eyes for the moment.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:23.740 align:middle line:84%
That is the moment
between a time package

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.660 align:middle line:90%
to an out-of-time package.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Normally, a time that could
be between four years,

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:30.610 align:middle line:90%
more or less.

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And then a new time package
is going to happen again.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.500 align:middle line:90%
But, oh, my goodness.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.630 align:middle line:90%
Sorry to say, oh, my goodness.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:40.030 align:middle line:84%
It means that-- I
mean, 66 years--

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:42.370 align:middle line:84%
it looks like an
entire existence.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.710 align:middle line:84%
So for us, it makes
a big difference.

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:50.080 align:middle line:84%
I might be lucky to live
alive where I'm jumping

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.250 align:middle line:90%
from different time package.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:53.740 align:middle line:90%
Two of them maybe.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Or rarely, when something very
super important is happening

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.700 align:middle line:84%
or something really
extraordinary is happening,

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:03.370 align:middle line:84%
I can maybe jump
even more than two.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.050 align:middle line:84%
What I'm talking
is the fact that

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:10.810 align:middle line:84%
in this moment, what I'm doing
is not affecting only me now,

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:15.550 align:middle line:84%
but is affecting the all
"me" everywhere in this time

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:16.720 align:middle line:90%
territory.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.320 align:middle line:84%
My "me" are the one that
are living in this moment,

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:28.210 align:middle line:84%
also in the 1700s, in the
1200s, in the time of Atlantis,

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:31.450 align:middle line:84%
in the time where I was a
Maya, in the time where I was

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:35.050 align:middle line:84%
a Viking, in the
time where I'm doing

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:40.330 align:middle line:84%
my multiple experience
that I can call past life,

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.480 align:middle line:84%
but actually is
incorrect to talk past.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:47.030 align:middle line:90%
I could talk about lives.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:51.280 align:middle line:84%
So in this sphere, in
this time territory,

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm living contemporary
multiple existence.

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And all these existence
and all these experiences

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:01.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm living in this
moment are making

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.470 align:middle line:90%
an inference in all the rest.

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:06.950 align:middle line:84%
So my Viking's life
is affecting the life

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:09.810 align:middle line:84%
that I'm doing here,
as my life here

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:13.590 align:middle line:84%
is affecting the life that
I have in England or the one

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:18.780 align:middle line:84%
that I have as a monk in Italy,
all at the same exactly moment.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:23.340 align:middle line:84%
All because we are
contemporary living

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:28.810 align:middle line:84%
this same moment, the moment
that they call the time sphere.

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:32.350 align:middle line:90%
OK, take a deep breath.

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.740 align:middle line:84%
Try to imagine
how this can work.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.800 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sure the inside of you--

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.800 align:middle line:84%
this works very well and is
the reason why you are so

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.760 align:middle line:84%
fascinated to research your
past life and not for curiosity.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, OK, probably there is
also a little bit of curiosity

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.600 align:middle line:84%
in that, but because you know
that knowing who you was,

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.010 align:middle line:90%
what you did--

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:55.060 align:middle line:90%
it's helping you to do what?

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.260 align:middle line:84%
To live this life, to
understand why time is bringing

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.590 align:middle line:84%
some come of events, why
the law of complexity

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:03.630 align:middle line:84%
that is the evolution
is bringing you

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.730 align:middle line:84%
then to live some
kind of experience,

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:08.280 align:middle line:84%
why you're struggling so
much with your parents,

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.240 align:middle line:90%
or why you have--

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.280 align:middle line:84%
you're suffering to
fight for love, or why

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:15.510 align:middle line:84%
you are so good and so
talented to do that skill.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:19.510 align:middle line:84%
Because this is coming
from what you are doing,

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:20.550 align:middle line:90%
not you was doing.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:23.760 align:middle line:84%
What you are doing
and is so fascinating

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.570 align:middle line:84%
and means this
unlimited possibility

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.850 align:middle line:90%
that life is offering us.

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, we want
to limit it ourself.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.830 align:middle line:84%
We want to see
things just like one.

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:36.810 align:middle line:84%
We want to rationalize
everything.

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:39.290 align:middle line:84%
We want that there
is only cause-effect.

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:40.210 align:middle line:90%
That is not true.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:43.760 align:middle line:84%
It's all here at the
same exactly moment.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And that brings perspective
before, probably.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.290 align:middle line:84%
We could not even imagine
and is the perspective

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:51.570 align:middle line:84%
that brought you here
now to listen-- me

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:53.760 align:middle line:90%
and to listen to this moment.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Because it's going to open
even more other opportunities

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:58.350 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:01.140 align:middle line:90%


00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.810 align:middle line:84%
All these concept,
all these element

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:08.480 align:middle line:84%
are connected to the
concept of numbers.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.100 align:middle line:10%
There is a specific field
of this beautiful visit

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:14.770 align:middle line:10%
that is based on what we
call the rhythm numbers.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.730 align:middle line:84%
But in general,
numbers are-- if you

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:22.050 align:middle line:84%
want a way to give
interpretation and meanings

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:25.350 align:middle line:84%
to everything, yes,
everything is a number.

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.420 align:middle line:90%
Every single event is a number.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Everything could be
summarized and characterized

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.550 align:middle line:90%
by the sequence of numbers.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.960 align:middle line:84%
That is the reason why in
magic or in esoteric path,

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.640 align:middle line:84%
we are talking about
precise numbers.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.454 align:middle line:84%
We also talk, for
example, of angles.

00:16:43.454 --> 00:16:45.120 align:middle line:84%
There is an angle
that is very important

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.740 align:middle line:90%
that is the 51.51 degrees.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.450 align:middle line:84%
That is directly connecting
to the possibility

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:55.230 align:middle line:84%
to enter into the
different timeline.

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:58.170 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about
esoteric tradition, when

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:00.600 align:middle line:84%
we talk about this
knowledge and from where

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.520 align:middle line:90%
this knowledge has come from--

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.790 align:middle line:84%
so I would love to frame
all of this in something

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:09.170 align:middle line:84%
that is not something
the Damanhur invents

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:10.220 align:middle line:90%
or that Falco--

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Oberto Airaudi, our
founders invent.

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.730 align:middle line:84%
This is part, really,
of the ancient knowledge

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:18.869 align:middle line:90%
of the humankind.

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And where is this
ancient knowledge?

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:25.829 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are multiple ways
to bring back this knowledge.

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, one is what has
been left all over time

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:32.520 align:middle line:84%
by us-- by humans
with knowledge.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
the stone language.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.080 align:middle line:84%
The stone language
is the one that all

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.120 align:middle line:84%
the ancient
civilization-- they used

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:44.850 align:middle line:84%
to create in their architecture
the sacred geometry that

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:49.964 align:middle line:84%
are still telling us-- page
of this book of knowledge.

00:17:49.964 --> 00:17:51.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the
pyramids in Egypt.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the
temples in Mexico.

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:55.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about Machu Picchu.

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:56.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about Stonehenge.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
all these places

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.940 align:middle line:90%
that are being done with stones.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Why stones?

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, because stones
are the materials

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.140 align:middle line:84%
that can resist more into
time, into this time territory.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Also, stone will be
transformed, obviously,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.110 align:middle line:84%
but at least for
a period of time.

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.600 align:middle line:84%
For a piece of
this time territory

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.060 align:middle line:90%
can last enough to do what?

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:21.660 align:middle line:84%
To help us to
remember, to help us

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.900 align:middle line:84%
to reawake the memories
of why we're here

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.325 align:middle line:84%
or to get back the
information that we need.

00:18:28.325 --> 00:18:31.890 align:middle line:84%
So one of the reason why we
are also doing-- many people

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:34.410 align:middle line:84%
journey all over the
planet in some specific

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:38.400 align:middle line:84%
places to bring back through
this stone language what

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.720 align:middle line:90%
is needed.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, another way to
bring back this knowledge

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:46.680 align:middle line:90%
is to bring it just from above.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the
aura of the matter.

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:51.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about the threshold.

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:53.460 align:middle line:90%
We describe it very briefly.

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.100 align:middle line:84%
But a threshold is really
the place of information,

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.950 align:middle line:84%
where everything has
been housed there.

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Every single existence, every
memory, every experience,

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:07.800 align:middle line:84%
every experience of every
life forms, even not human.

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:12.450 align:middle line:84%
In all of this, there are
the logic of the numbers.

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:14.970 align:middle line:84%
So the numbers are
directly connecting

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:16.800 align:middle line:90%
to the sacred geometry.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.540 align:middle line:84%
The sacred geometry,
if you want,

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:22.170 align:middle line:84%
are the languages that
are directly-- make us

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:25.480 align:middle line:90%
in connection with the forces.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.630 align:middle line:84%
So I can talk
about the Kabbalah.

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:29.610 align:middle line:10%
I can talk about many
different tradition that

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:34.830 align:middle line:10%
are taking the numbers to
bring the meanings into life

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:36.970 align:middle line:10%
and into our existence.

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:40.080 align:middle line:84%
So all the numbers that we are
now talking about-- the 66,

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.170 align:middle line:84%
for example, the
time package like

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:46.620 align:middle line:84%
the four connecting to the
four second to the moments.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Or other numbers that
I'm going to give you

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:51.960 align:middle line:84%
are all coming from these
different tradition.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So they are all
coming to give us

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.030 align:middle line:84%
an understanding and
a translation of what

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:58.115 align:middle line:90%
is possible.

00:19:58.115 --> 00:20:00.910 align:middle line:84%
For example, when we talk
about the six possibility,

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:03.990 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't means that we
have only six different time

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:09.000 align:middle line:84%
travel in front of us, but at
least we can take one of six.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.136 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, this is not so
much about, oh, my goodness,

00:20:12.136 --> 00:20:14.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take number
one or number three.

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Or is it going to
be number five?

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.590 align:middle line:84%
Or is it going to
be number four?

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:19.740 align:middle line:84%
No, it's to give
us the opportunity

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:24.150 align:middle line:84%
to know that we have an
unlimited possibilities.

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:28.230 align:middle line:84%
I can mention also things
like the Akashic Records.

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:30.959 align:middle line:84%
Or I can talk about the
libraries of knowledge,

00:20:30.959 --> 00:20:33.000 align:middle line:84%
because that knowledge is
also the knowledge that

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.030 align:middle line:90%
give me the power.

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:34.830 align:middle line:90%
About what?

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:37.890 align:middle line:10%
Well, the power of
doing, of creating.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important
that these knowledge is not

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:43.720 align:middle line:90%
going in the wrong hands.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:47.070 align:middle line:84%
So going there by
mystical journey,

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:50.250 align:middle line:84%
by astral traveling, by
out-of-body experience

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:55.770 align:middle line:84%
is allowing me then to
bring back this element.

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Number 3-- well,
sometimes we are

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:01.425 align:middle line:84%
lucky to have one of
these star masters.

00:21:01.425 --> 00:21:04.510 align:middle line:90%


00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:06.850 align:middle line:84%
For some masters, we
talk about the avatars.

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:08.450 align:middle line:84%
We talk about the
enlight beings,

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:10.420 align:middle line:84%
so people like us
that they already

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:14.000 align:middle line:84%
did their piece of the
spiritualization of the matter.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.320 align:middle line:90%
So these are beings that are--

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.420 align:middle line:84%
well, they don't
need to reincarnate.

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.250 align:middle line:84%
If they going to
do it, it's simply

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:26.510 align:middle line:84%
because they know that the
big work is not finished.

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:29.470 align:middle line:84%
So if the entire goal
is to spiritualize

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.570 align:middle line:90%
the entire universe of form--

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:34.420 align:middle line:84%
so the little piece
that I did individually

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.890 align:middle line:84%
with my enlightenment
is not enough.

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:38.570 align:middle line:84%
So I needed at least
a sort of numbers.

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:41.180 align:middle line:84%
A sort of percentage of
these pieces will do it,

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.950 align:middle line:90%
otherwise will not be enough.

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:46.190 align:middle line:84%
So they decide to come
back and to be incarnated

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:48.460 align:middle line:84%
in the different planets
in a different place

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:52.390 align:middle line:84%
where there is evolution
to help and support others

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:55.330 align:middle line:84%
to do the same, to
teach, to reassemble,

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:57.470 align:middle line:90%
to do things like that.

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:00.610 align:middle line:84%
So when-- as people
master, it's life.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:03.640 align:middle line:84%
When you are so lucky to
have one of them here,

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.260 align:middle line:84%
well, they have many
incredible possibilities.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And one of these
possibilities is the fact

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.820 align:middle line:90%
that they are lucid medium.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.110 align:middle line:90%
Who is a lucid medium?

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:17.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, talking about a
medium or a channeler.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Someone-- again, the channel
in the threshold information

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:25.570 align:middle line:90%
are also different forces.

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this case, the medium,
I mean, is losing many time

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:32.080 align:middle line:84%
the conscious of
what is going on, OK?

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Because it's becoming
an instrument.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:34.530 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:36.940 align:middle line:84%
For a spiritual master,
this is different.

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:38.890 align:middle line:90%
A spiritual master is lucid.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:40.600 align:middle line:84%
So he is not losing
his conscious.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:45.310 align:middle line:84%
But he can or she can
connect directly in the place

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:47.050 align:middle line:90%
of information-- this library--

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:51.160 align:middle line:84%
and then bring back everything
that is needed right now, here.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is what Falco
did with us to bring back

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:57.175 align:middle line:90%
many of these new information--

00:22:57.175 --> 00:22:59.440 align:middle line:90%
I mean, of this knowledge.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Another element that is not
less important than the others

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.290 align:middle line:90%
is the research.

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:09.700 align:middle line:84%
So the research is what
driven all of us, all of us

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.340 align:middle line:84%
that we love to be considered
as spiritual researcher.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:16.290 align:middle line:84%
So people that are dedicating
their life to this goal,

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:18.500 align:middle line:84%
to the goal of the
spiritualization of the matter.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:19.960 align:middle line:90%
So we never stop the research.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:23.560 align:middle line:84%
We never stop to find new
things and new meanings,

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:26.350 align:middle line:84%
because it's the same
concept of the mystery.

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:29.650 align:middle line:84%
So even what now we cannot
understand or we can just

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:32.530 align:middle line:90%
translate with a human logic.

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:36.080 align:middle line:84%
So through the knowledge,
through the research,

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.426 align:middle line:90%
we will understand.

00:23:37.426 --> 00:23:38.800 align:middle line:84%
We will give
another meaning that

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:43.050 align:middle line:84%
probably will open other
meanings, but it's unlimited.

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:46.990 align:middle line:84%
It's not stopped by dogmas
or things like that.

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:49.690 align:middle line:84%
We are not living
the same reality.

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:54.970 align:middle line:84%
No, there is at least one
reality for each of us.

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:58.930 align:middle line:84%
The same event could be for
me-- fantastic, amazing.

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:01.120 align:middle line:10%
For another person--
could be a tragedy.

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:01.930 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:03.520 align:middle line:84%
We are talking about
the same thing.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.800 align:middle line:84%
How come there is
so much difference?

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Because the perception
of that event--

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:11.770 align:middle line:84%
and the perception
is a mix of element

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:15.310 align:middle line:84%
that is involving emotion,
feelings, experience,

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:18.070 align:middle line:84%
what I did before, what
I supposed to do after.

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:24.790 align:middle line:84%
So it give me a perception
of their reality.

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:28.810 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, we might imagine
that there is a common field.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:32.980 align:middle line:10%
In this field, it's called time.

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:34.950 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
moment, this field

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:38.350 align:middle line:84%
is containing everything
that is possible.

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:40.980 align:middle line:84%
That means I'm going
to perceive this.

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Everything is possible
in a different way.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:47.090 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason why we
cannot talk about one reality,

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:49.260 align:middle line:90%
but multiple reality.

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:54.180 align:middle line:84%
I cannot talk about me and my
sensation in my life and then

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.770 align:middle line:84%
compare it with others,
because they are going to be,

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:57.915 align:middle line:90%
in any case, different.

00:24:57.915 --> 00:25:01.980 align:middle line:84%
So for the simply fact that
I'm using different senses.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, which give me more
power in what I'm living?

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:10.500 align:middle line:84%
What give me more power in
what I'm living in this moment?

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:14.520 align:middle line:84%
What held me to guide
my life to the goal

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.740 align:middle line:90%
that I want to achieve?

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:19.530 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is the knowledge.

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And the knowledge is affecting
directly my way of thinking.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.580 align:middle line:84%
My way of thinking is
directly affecting what?

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:28.260 align:middle line:90%
My perception.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.060 align:middle line:90%
My way to perceive the reality.

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm starting to
live not one reality,

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:37.060 align:middle line:84%
but multiple reality, as I'm
not living it only one time,

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:39.330 align:middle line:90%
but I'm living in multiple time.

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:43.110 align:middle line:84%
The capacity to start
to sense, to feel, also

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:44.770 align:middle line:90%
to think about all of this--

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:47.470 align:middle line:90%
it makes my reality stronger.

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:51.870 align:middle line:84%
It makes my power of
creation here stronger.

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
why we want to know more.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Because knowing more
give us the possibility

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.920 align:middle line:84%
to do more, to be more
effective in what we are

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.790 align:middle line:90%
living in every single moment.

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:07.500 align:middle line:10%
Now, could be
interesting to know

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:12.250 align:middle line:10%
if there is a final goal
also in every existence.

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:17.120 align:middle line:10%
Yes, there is a final goal
in every single incarnation.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Time and the event of
the structure of time

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:27.360 align:middle line:84%
are moving us in the direction
of what we call the mission.

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is very important
to define mission

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.270 align:middle line:90%
from what many people--

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:35.300 align:middle line:90%
they might think about destiny.

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Yes, people-- they say, OK,
I have a destiny in life.

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.870 align:middle line:90%
I just have to wait.

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And then things just going to
happen and things like that.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm not saying that
for everyone it's like this.

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:50.270 align:middle line:10%
But this could be a tendency
of what we can imagine is life.

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:53.820 align:middle line:90%
Now, we talk about mission.

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:54.860 align:middle line:90%
What is the mission?

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.860 align:middle line:84%
The mission is
exactly the program

00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:02.520 align:middle line:84%
that we have to achieve
during a lifetime.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.360 align:middle line:84%
We can call it
our karma program.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.660 align:middle line:84%
So karma in Sanskrit
means action.

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.120 align:middle line:84%
So what I did in the
past will bring me here

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:16.040 align:middle line:84%
to do something that is
the result of what I did.

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:20.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, we already decided
past is non-existent, OK?

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:22.980 align:middle line:90%
So it's all at the same moment.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:26.210 align:middle line:84%
But it means that in these
moments or in this territory,

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:28.090 align:middle line:90%
I have something unique.

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:33.890 align:middle line:84%
I have something that I am
the only one that I can do.

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:36.230 align:middle line:90%
It's called a mission.

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:40.460 align:middle line:84%
If you want, is a mix of element
that is about what I learned

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:43.460 align:middle line:84%
and what I have to learn
in this life, what I did,

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:46.610 align:middle line:84%
and what I have to
realize here now.

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:49.940 align:middle line:84%
So for all of us, in their
existence, in their life,

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:52.760 align:middle line:84%
there is a mission,
something that we have

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:56.330 align:middle line:90%
to do right now in this life.

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And who's to say
that the mission--

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.280 align:middle line:84%
it's never about you, me,
as an individual, as ego,

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:10.400 align:middle line:84%
but as like
collective, as others,

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:15.750 align:middle line:84%
as for a bigger aim that is not
just my-- what I want to do,

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:17.930 align:middle line:90%
but what I have to do for--

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:20.720 align:middle line:84%
achieve that
particular condition.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.940 align:middle line:84%
It is going to
involve other people.

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Because evolution is bringing
more and more element together.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.250 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not here to serve myself.

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:30.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to serve
something bigger.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And the mission
is many times also

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:36.980 align:middle line:84%
very close to what
we call happiness.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:38.930 align:middle line:90%
What makes us-- me happy?

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:40.620 align:middle line:90%
Don't ask me, what is happiness?

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:40.760 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:43.051 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone has a
different interpretation of what

00:28:43.051 --> 00:28:44.080 align:middle line:90%
is happiness.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.650 align:middle line:90%
Happy is what make me happy.

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:49.400 align:middle line:84%
It may be doing the things
that I like so much.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Founding your mission
in every life--

00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:55.200 align:middle line:84%
it's a very important element
or one of the most important.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:00.740 align:middle line:84%
But even more important
is to realize the mission

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:07.240 align:middle line:84%
to make it happen to fulfill
what I have to do in this life.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:10.970 align:middle line:84%
The time structure
and all the events

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:16.190 align:middle line:84%
that I confound in the time
are supporting these element,

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:19.220 align:middle line:84%
because they are support
by the complexities.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:21.320 align:middle line:10%
So by the fact that
everything is going

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.400 align:middle line:10%
in the direction of evolution.

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:27.980 align:middle line:84%
So I can decide in every
life how much resistance I

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:32.150 align:middle line:84%
want to put to realize
my mission or not.

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:38.300 align:middle line:10%
To me, guides my events
into these different times

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:41.860 align:middle line:10%
in the direction of the
accomplishment of the mission

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:42.679 align:middle line:10%
or not.

00:29:42.679 --> 00:29:43.970 align:middle line:90%
Everything is working together.

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:47.320 align:middle line:90%
