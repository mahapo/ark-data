00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Back in time, back
in the time travel.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.320 align:middle line:10%
So we left with some of the
example of some time travel

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.410 align:middle line:10%
that has been done
physically in the past.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.010 align:middle line:84%
Now we can also keep
going and express

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.948 align:middle line:84%
others of this time travel,
all the different modality

00:00:43.948 --> 00:00:46.240 align:middle line:84%
that we've been touched, the
recognition, the physical,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.600 align:middle line:84%
and the possession, and
also maybe some proof,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.180 align:middle line:84%
some element that
at least it give us

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.970 align:middle line:84%
the confirmation
that what we did

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.630 align:middle line:84%
is being creating
an effect here.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.490 align:middle line:84%
After the example
of the physical one,

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.019 align:middle line:84%
we can talk about an example
of the possession when.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.170 align:middle line:84%
I told you before, this
is pretty much expensive,

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.440 align:middle line:84%
because it looks that
we need to keep the time

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.330 align:middle line:90%
door open on the both side.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Necessary, because like
at a very high level

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.120 align:middle line:84%
of astro traveling, you are
traveling with your conscious,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.030 align:middle line:84%
with one of your astral
body, of your energetic body.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Using, renting, if we can say
like this, the body of someone

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.600 align:middle line:90%
temporarily.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.360 align:middle line:84%
But you need to
keep the doors open,

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.910 align:middle line:84%
because you are linked
with your physical body,

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.210 align:middle line:90%
you traveler need to be open.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.340 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you can
really die, literally.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.000 align:middle line:10%
One of these
different time travel,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.900 align:middle line:10%
it's a time travel done
back in the time of Egypt,

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.080 align:middle line:10%
a period of time that
is between the 10th

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.420 align:middle line:10%
and the 12th Dynasties, or more
or less 2,600, 2,700 years ago.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.010 align:middle line:84%
A period of time actually
pretty well unknown.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.740 align:middle line:84%
So instead of other
dynasty, where

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.170 align:middle line:84%
we know a lot of
things and things

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.400 align:middle line:84%
are really not going very
intensely, well, this

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.560 align:middle line:84%
is a period of time, or a time
package, that is pretty open.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.250 align:middle line:84%
So we don't even know
the name of the pharaoh.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.410 align:middle line:90%
We're not sure what is going on.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.290 align:middle line:84%
So what it means
for the information

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.650 align:middle line:84%
that we have about time
and the structure of time?

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.185 align:middle line:84%
Well, these are time packages
pretty full of neutral events.

00:02:30.185 --> 00:02:31.810 align:middle line:84%
So instead of the
others, where there's

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.840 align:middle line:84%
so many things going on, so
pretty saturated, so there's

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.770 align:middle line:84%
not so much to change anymore,
this one, the unknown one,

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.880 align:middle line:84%
so the one where we can
really still change things

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.930 align:middle line:84%
and we can really
create an effect

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.020 align:middle line:84%
that is going to be right
now here from where we start.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.980 align:middle line:84%
So the operation, more
or less, is this one.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.420 align:middle line:10%
We said that Egypt was one
of the colony of Atlantis

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.850 align:middle line:10%
at the time of Atlantis.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.070 align:middle line:10%
And it was the
place of the farms.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a territory that
was so rich with visitation,

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.780 align:middle line:84%
of any kind of different
plants and vegetables,

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.120 align:middle line:84%
so very different from the
desert one that we know now.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And this was actually
one of the first things

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.540 align:middle line:90%
that I had as an indication.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.170 align:middle line:84%
In this case, I'm sharing
one of my experience

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.090 align:middle line:84%
in time, one of my time travel,
a position time travel, where

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.750 align:middle line:84%
the operation was to go
nearby the Nile, where

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.570 align:middle line:84%
a priest in that
moment was there

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.290 align:middle line:84%
in prayer and
meditation, literally

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.990 align:middle line:90%
open and ready to be possessed.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.600 align:middle line:84%
A priest that was pretty
close to the pharaoh,

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.080 align:middle line:84%
probably a friend
of the pharaoh.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And I need to go and
convince this pharaoh

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.120 align:middle line:90%
to build a pyramid.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.120 align:middle line:84%
In a time where, well,
the resources was not

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.820 align:middle line:84%
enough for everything,
it is very difficult.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Also because I know that all
the counsels of the pharaoh

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.070 align:middle line:90%
will be against me.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.770 align:middle line:84%
So they are really
thinking that all of this

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.580 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely crazy.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.400 align:middle line:84%
The reason why I'm
doing a possession?

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.490 align:middle line:84%
Because a local person,
actually a friend,

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.770 align:middle line:90%
could be much more friendly.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:14.990 align:middle line:90%
In this could also--

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.860 align:middle line:84%
and in possession,
there is the possibility

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.640 align:middle line:84%
to speak the language
of the place.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.940 align:middle line:84%
This is a great advantage,
because if you have

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.120 align:middle line:90%
to talk a lot or to convince.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.740 align:middle line:90%
The cabin is activated.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.870 align:middle line:90%
The entire temple is vibrating.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.470 align:middle line:84%
The spheres are also ready
for other individual,

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.740 align:middle line:84%
order people prepared to observe
and to check that everything

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.920 align:middle line:90%
is going to be well.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.120 align:middle line:90%
Everything is ready.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.710 align:middle line:10%
I'm sitting in the right
position, in the cabin.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.730 align:middle line:84%
All the vital energy created
by the singing and the drumming

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.390 align:middle line:84%
and everything has been going
on for many hours before.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.700 align:middle line:90%
Everything is set to go.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:59.280 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, the S,
this white S moving almost

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.090 align:middle line:84%
like a snake, the black hole,
is being in front of me.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.460 align:middle line:90%
It is now really in front of me.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.030 align:middle line:84%
I know that I don't have
doubts, and I have to jump in.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.070 align:middle line:90%


00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, the kind of
feeling and emotion

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.220 align:middle line:84%
are probably very hard to
be described with words,

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.520 align:middle line:84%
because it's something that
obviously is going to follow

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.770 align:middle line:90%
you for your entire existence.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.770 align:middle line:84%
But when I open my
eyes, I'm definitely

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.720 align:middle line:84%
in the body of
this young priest.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.770 align:middle line:84%
What it is immediately
touching my feeling

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.340 align:middle line:84%
is this extremely
rich environment

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.780 align:middle line:84%
of plants and flowers
and everything.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.000 align:middle line:84%
I have just the time to
see the river, the Nile.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I have
to run, because I'm

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.930 align:middle line:84%
being waited in this case
in the temple of Dendera.

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.260 align:middle line:10%
Dendera is this gorgeous temple
building a couple of hours

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.870 align:middle line:10%
from Luxor, nearby
Abydos, dedicated

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.360 align:middle line:10%
to the goddess Hathor.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And in the actual
Dendera it's still also

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.040 align:middle line:84%
possible to visit some of
the underground places.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Because I have to remind you
that in the stone language,

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.730 align:middle line:84%
every temple is
built on the surface,

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.250 align:middle line:90%
but then always underground.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.050 align:middle line:90%
Even the pyramids.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.930 align:middle line:84%
You have a pyramid on
the surface and a pyramid

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.160 align:middle line:90%
underground.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And underground is where they
are the most sacred part,

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.610 align:middle line:90%
the most precious part.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.160 align:middle line:84%
Because the temple they
represent, the human body,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.920 align:middle line:84%
and in the human body, where
is the most important thing?

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, the most important
thing is the soul.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.850 align:middle line:90%
It's inside.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.200 align:middle line:90%


00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.480 align:middle line:84%
So I know that I'm going to
meet the pharaoh underground

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.830 align:middle line:90%
in the temple.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.850 align:middle line:84%
I still have clear
memory of me being below.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And then on the stage,
there is the pharaoh

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.010 align:middle line:84%
sitting on the throne and
all the different counsel

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.460 align:middle line:90%
around him.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm starting to
communicate, and I'm

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.250 align:middle line:84%
starting to say, "well,
look it's not me.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm coming from another time."

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Or I could even say something
more, like I'm a god,

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.220 align:middle line:84%
and I'm telling you for
the benefit of your people

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.990 align:middle line:84%
and of the entire
humankind, it's

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.310 align:middle line:84%
absolutely crucial that you're
going to build a pyramid.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.420 align:middle line:84%
OK, if then you think
that all of this

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.610 align:middle line:84%
is going to be very
small, forget about it,

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.550 align:middle line:90%
because it's not true.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.980 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
very challenging.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.020 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that we didn't
mention about the time travel

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.450 align:middle line:90%
is also the time difference.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.240 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, we know that we go
from more complexity to less

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.320 align:middle line:90%
complexity.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.240 align:middle line:84%
But one of the effect
is that, for example,

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.560 align:middle line:84%
from where you start, one
hour of time traveling

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.280 align:middle line:84%
could represent eight hours
in another time package.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.400 align:middle line:84%
So the feeling and
the perception of time

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.805 align:middle line:84%
is changing very much,
as we know it is already.

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And we know in
the time territory

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:59.210 align:middle line:84%
that there are territory where
we feel tag time is different,

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:01.190 align:middle line:90%
that it's moving different.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.800 align:middle line:84%
All of this operation,
it takes a lot of hours

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.760 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't absolutely
want to build this pyramid.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.200 align:middle line:90%
It was absolutely crazy.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.890 align:middle line:90%
They didn't believe me.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:15.380 align:middle line:84%
They thought O was just a fool,
and many, many other things,

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.890 align:middle line:84%
beside the fact that obviously
there was also very good reason

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.770 align:middle line:90%
not to do something like that.

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.865 align:middle line:90%
So the situation got even worse.

00:08:23.865 --> 00:08:25.740 align:middle line:84%
So they wanted to imprison
me and everything.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:30.410 align:middle line:84%
So thanks to the people that was
following me with this fears,

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.270 align:middle line:84%
I was able to say, OK,
you don't believe me.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.270 align:middle line:84%
You don't think that I
am who I'm telling you.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, look, and the spheres.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.760 align:middle line:84%
Literally like
light, sphere light,

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:44.000 align:middle line:84%
it was moving around
the room in a way that

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.900 align:middle line:84%
was obviously paranormal,
was not possible,

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.500 align:middle line:84%
or you know bright of
light, all of a sudden,

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:51.710 align:middle line:90%
it was entering the room.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And I just say look,
this is not a joke.

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.200 align:middle line:84%
This is something very
serious and very important.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.120 align:middle line:90%
You need to do that.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.580 align:middle line:10%
And if you're going to
do that, when you going

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.640 align:middle line:10%
and inaugurate the new pyramid,
we promise that one of us

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.600 align:middle line:10%
will come physically
to follow you

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.760 align:middle line:10%
as a demonstration
of the connection

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.560 align:middle line:10%
that the pharaoh has
with god and for the good

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.480 align:middle line:10%
of the humankind.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, finally, the pharaoh
agree and do the pyramids.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.180 align:middle line:84%
I remember myself
absolutely exhausted,

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.840 align:middle line:84%
also because energetically
speaking but also physically,

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.360 align:middle line:90%
it's literally very exhausting.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:40.160 align:middle line:84%
I remember exactly coming
out from another part

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.780 align:middle line:90%
of the Temple of Dendera.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.420 align:middle line:84%
Actually, a part of
the temple that I

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:48.580 align:middle line:84%
recognize when then physically
in this life I went there.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was a big emotion
for me and obviously also

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.370 align:middle line:90%
a strong confirmation.

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.920 align:middle line:84%
I knew that the
point to come back

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:03.710 align:middle line:84%
was exactly nearby where I get
the possession of the priest.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.470 align:middle line:84%
So the priest arrived
there, and then

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:10.730 align:middle line:84%
I was literally recalled
back inside of the cabin,

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:15.350 align:middle line:84%
passing through the black hole
with this white S that was just

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.890 align:middle line:84%
in front of me in
the time of Egypt,

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:20.900 align:middle line:84%
and I'm back in my
physical body in the cabin.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.820 align:middle line:90%


00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:28.510 align:middle line:84%
The first physical sensation
that I had when I came back

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.520 align:middle line:90%
was my throat completely dry.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:34.720 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't even speak, because
I'd been speaking and speaking

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.800 align:middle line:84%
and convincing for
a long, long time.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.980 align:middle line:90%
I talk about this experience.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And soon I'm going to also tell
you the result of all of this.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can imagine that
the pyramid has been built,

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.220 align:middle line:84%
and then another
time traveler has

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.160 align:middle line:84%
been sent in the time
of the inauguration

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.590 align:middle line:84%
to be beside the
pharaoh to demonstrate

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.180 align:middle line:84%
the fact that the
pharaoh was right,

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.090 align:middle line:84%
and he's been connected
to the forces,

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:04.247 align:middle line:84%
and connected to the
good of the humankind.

00:11:04.247 --> 00:11:06.930 align:middle line:90%


00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was really a very, very
strong emotion some weeks later

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:17.850 align:middle line:84%
to see the news about
the pyramid in one

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:20.910 align:middle line:84%
of the most important
newspapers in Italy,

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:24.180 align:middle line:84%
La Stampa, that is from
Turin, and the pictures

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:27.240 align:middle line:84%
of a pyramid that had
been recently found

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:32.060 align:middle line:84%
in the area where we
did this time travel.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.860 align:middle line:10%
It was the confirmation
that also that operation

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.520 align:middle line:10%
is being successful,
at least for what

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.370 align:middle line:10%
we needed to keep the
timeline well separated.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Again, this obviously, it looks
something very impressive.

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, imagine how much events
you can affect on the fact

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:02.050 align:middle line:84%
that people will
see that symbology.

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Imagine the effect of the Giza
Plateau and the three pyramids,

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.490 align:middle line:84%
or even just let's talk
about the Cheops pyramid,

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:11.730 align:middle line:84%
the Great Pyramid, how
much this symbology

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:15.990 align:middle line:84%
has been affecting the mind,
the thoughts, the ideas,

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:20.740 align:middle line:84%
the feeling of so many
people for such a long time,

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.320 align:middle line:90%
almost like an inspiration.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:27.270 align:middle line:84%
So imagine how many little
change you can bond to that

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:28.890 align:middle line:90%
or you can link to that.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:32.310 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason why
probably that symbology,

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:36.760 align:middle line:84%
not even so much about the
building of the pyramids,

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.930 align:middle line:84%
but probably the
symbology of the pyramid

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:41.790 align:middle line:84%
has been affecting so many
people all along time.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:44.800 align:middle line:90%


00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a fact that some
kind of structure,

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:50.480 align:middle line:84%
like pyramid, or
a secret geometry,

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:55.400 align:middle line:84%
they have an effect physically
on the psychological level,

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.480 align:middle line:84%
but also on the energetic
level, on their aura.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:02.380 align:middle line:84%
So creating effect that
are then moving people

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.500 align:middle line:84%
to do some action
instead of others.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:09.220 align:middle line:84%
I can talk about other
time travel, both physical,

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:14.950 align:middle line:84%
both with possession, done
in another part of time,

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:17.290 align:middle line:84%
more or less again
more than 2,000 years,

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.100 align:middle line:90%
but nearby one another.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:19.900 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Because again, there
was a sequence of event

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:27.910 align:middle line:84%
that was very much important
to modify related to a boat.

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:29.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a wooden boat.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:33.326 align:middle line:84%
It was in this
river, the Chiusella,

00:13:33.326 --> 00:13:38.200 align:middle line:84%
that is actually the river that
gives the name to our valley.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And we did several of this
time travel with many of us.

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:45.380 align:middle line:90%
To do what?

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, we needed to make this
boat appearing right now

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.950 align:middle line:90%
here in this time.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:55.450 align:middle line:84%
The result of all of this was
at the end of all the operation,

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:58.090 align:middle line:84%
with our big
surprise, but we was

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:03.970 align:middle line:84%
expecting that, the fact that
in a certain point, in 1994,

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:11.320 align:middle line:84%
in the bigger and most important
newspaper of Valchiusella,

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.810 align:middle line:90%
La Sentinella del Canavese.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:17.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, all of the sudden, in
the first page, what we found?

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:21.700 align:middle line:84%
The pictures of a
wooden boat, very old,

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:26.590 align:middle line:84%
more than 2,000 years,
that has been found aside

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.690 align:middle line:90%
the river Chiusella.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is the most important
archaeological things

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:34.420 align:middle line:84%
found in these last
15 years, and is

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:38.560 align:middle line:84%
going to be exposed in one
museum that is still existing

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.060 align:middle line:90%
in Valchiusella.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:44.080 align:middle line:84%
So that was the proof
that we was waiting.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.450 align:middle line:84%
It was the proof
that the element

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:52.150 align:middle line:84%
of time that we was changing had
been succeeding in this time.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:56.960 align:middle line:84%
I know that this
information, it can really--

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.230 align:middle line:84%
OK, but if this is
possible, if this is true,

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:02.350 align:middle line:84%
if this time is really one,
if he's really territory,

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:05.660 align:middle line:84%
if it's really sphere, and if
it's really possible to move,

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:11.430 align:middle line:84%
so how that if now or
here, when he may live,

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:15.130 align:middle line:84%
when he was happening something,
is true because when he was

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:17.740 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
trial timeline,

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.930 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that I
put something here,

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:21.370 align:middle line:90%
and then I found it there.

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:24.890 align:middle line:84%
Or that I was a place, and
then I was in another one.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.310 align:middle line:84%
So probably the mind
is just limited.

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:32.590 align:middle line:84%
So my intention, as I'm
sure Gaia's intention,

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:35.540 align:middle line:84%
is to open more and more
that way of thinking,

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:39.730 align:middle line:84%
and to start to achieve that new
paradigm that is what is needed

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:42.010 align:middle line:90%
so much for all of us.

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:43.810 align:middle line:84%
That is probably what
is being preparing

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:48.610 align:middle line:84%
for this time territory, the
fact that we need to do a jump.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.610 align:middle line:84%
We need to bring back
things on a level

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:55.960 align:middle line:84%
that we could not even
imagine from the I to the We.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:00.220 align:middle line:84%
But not just in a very romantic
way, but also in a way where

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:04.390 align:middle line:84%
spirituality would be
probably the possibility

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:07.180 align:middle line:84%
to embrace a big
change for this planet.

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.160 align:middle line:84%
Something that can
really reinforce

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.960 align:middle line:90%
the separation of the timeline?

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, personally I see at
least a couple of elements.

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:16.030 align:middle line:90%
One is history.

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.830 align:middle line:90%


00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Because rewriting the history
of humankind is what is needed.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.690 align:middle line:84%
It's needed to shake the
conscious of billions

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.490 align:middle line:90%
of people in this planet.

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:29.350 align:middle line:90%
It's history.

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:30.830 align:middle line:90%
It's not something spiritual.

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:32.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not something esoteric.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:33.908 align:middle line:90%
People, they might be scared.

00:16:33.908 --> 00:16:36.200 align:middle line:84%
History is something that
touches the life of everyone.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.260 align:middle line:84%
So if finally we're
going to prove

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.180 align:middle line:84%
that what is written
in the book of history

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:46.760 align:middle line:84%
is just a fake interpretation,
if there was much more evolved

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.430 align:middle line:84%
civilization, if
Atlantis was existing,

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:52.130 align:middle line:84%
if we can prove that the
pyramids had been created

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:55.700 align:middle line:84%
by an advanced civilization
with advanced technology

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.390 align:middle line:84%
that we don't even know, if we
can prove that we was connected

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:03.800 align:middle line:84%
with others, because this
is the natural expression

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:04.650 align:middle line:90%
of evolution.

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:08.400 align:middle line:84%
So planets, universe that
are connecting with us.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:13.970 align:middle line:84%
So it will not be a shake in
the belief system of people,

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:15.800 align:middle line:90%
I truly believe.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.230 align:middle line:84%
and I truly believe,
and I'm sustaining

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:20.540 align:middle line:84%
everyone that is doing
research in this field.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.089 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
really the border,

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:24.920 align:middle line:84%
the border that we
are moving every day

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.170 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more
further to finally

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:28.790 align:middle line:90%
enter in a new paradigm.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And if it's going
to be such a shake,

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:35.720 align:middle line:84%
well, probably well we
might get the possibility

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:40.280 align:middle line:84%
to reconnect with something
that out there is waiting.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Many people sometimes
are asking me, oh, you

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.433 align:middle line:84%
know, the UFO or
the aliens, when

00:17:44.433 --> 00:17:46.100 align:middle line:84%
they're going to come
back, when they're

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.420 align:middle line:90%
going to connect with us.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, look,
let's see things reversed.

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that they
are waiting us.

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.470 align:middle line:84%
In the true sense
that how they can

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:00.310 align:middle line:84%
reconnect with a
planet that is still

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:03.170 align:middle line:84%
expressing such a low level of
evolution, where we're still

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:05.670 align:middle line:84%
killing each other, where we're
still destroying the planet,

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:08.140 align:middle line:84%
where we're still
destroying resources.

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.690 align:middle line:90%
So it's not possible.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:14.340 align:middle line:84%
We are not at the minimum
level to be re-approached

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.040 align:middle line:90%
by something else.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.400 align:middle line:90%
Well, nobody will do that.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.030 align:middle line:84%
It's not even allowed
to do that, OK?

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.140 align:middle line:90%
Because we are not there.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.480 align:middle line:90%
We didn't get that minimum.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:28.240 align:middle line:90%


00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.310 align:middle line:84%
So the third elements
that, in my opinion,

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:35.020 align:middle line:84%
will be the possibility
really to make

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:39.310 align:middle line:84%
a big change in this time
is also directly related

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:40.830 align:middle line:90%
to what we touch.

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:43.970 align:middle line:84%
In other episodes
about the time package,

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:47.230 align:middle line:84%
you remember the time
package, complexity?

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:50.580 align:middle line:84%
The fact that in some time
package we can change things,

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.390 align:middle line:90%
in others we can't.

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:53.500 align:middle line:90%
Because it's saturated.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:54.670 align:middle line:90%
Everything is full.

00:18:54.670 --> 00:19:00.060 align:middle line:84%
This time package, they
might be closed from inside.

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.005 align:middle line:90%
Wait a moment.

00:19:01.005 --> 00:19:02.630 align:middle line:84%
We are introducing
something different.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.240 align:middle line:84%
We're not just talking about
the saturation of the event.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.210 align:middle line:84%
So many things going on
that there's nothing else

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:09.330 align:middle line:90%
that we can do.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.440 align:middle line:84%
No, we are talking
about something

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.530 align:middle line:84%
that is directly
connected to what

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:18.035 align:middle line:90%
we call the galactic empires.

00:19:18.035 --> 00:19:20.790 align:middle line:90%


00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:23.770 align:middle line:84%
The idea, again, that
we are not alone.

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And there is an interaction
between many different planets

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.260 align:middle line:84%
and many different
points of what

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.490 align:middle line:90%
we call the universe of form.

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And when they interest, they
come together, well, we really

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.380 align:middle line:90%
can imagine empires.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Not very different
from the empires

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.400 align:middle line:84%
that we have in our
little world, OK?

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.840 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about Europe
or United States of America,

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.665 align:middle line:90%
Russia, China, and so on.

00:19:45.665 --> 00:19:50.740 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty much a power gain,
but it works also out there.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:56.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, in a specific
moment of time, at least,

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:01.360 align:middle line:84%
when we talk about these
last 30,000 to 35,000 years,

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:05.600 align:middle line:84%
so pretty much connecting
to the time of Atlantis,

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.860 align:middle line:84%
let's imagine the
time technology.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because all the things
that we talk until now,

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:14.290 align:middle line:84%
in all our episodes,
are definitely

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:16.870 align:middle line:84%
connecting to a
technology that we

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:21.640 align:middle line:84%
can call time, a technology
that is being used also now

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.890 align:middle line:84%
from our country, even if
they're not telling to us.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:27.670 align:middle line:84%
But by the way,
the time technology

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:34.040 align:middle line:84%
changed completely the
idea of being in a space.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.220 align:middle line:84%
So if before I was talking
about galactic empires,

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:38.060 align:middle line:90%
so I'm an empire.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:39.490 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm in this place.

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:40.730 align:middle line:90%
It's mine, because I'm here.

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:41.530 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm occupying a space.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm adding another
element, the element of time.

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:48.940 align:middle line:90%
So wait a moment.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.120 align:middle line:10%
Instead of being
here all the time,

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.540 align:middle line:10%
I'm staying here only when
I need, when I want it.

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.670 align:middle line:90%
The other time, who cares?

00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:01.930 align:middle line:84%
So I'm putting space and
time on the same place.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:06.880 align:middle line:84%
That means that if, for example,
I know that from time 500

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:12.130 align:middle line:84%
to time 620 these places,
fine, quiet, perfect.

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:13.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I want to be here.

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:14.410 align:middle line:90%
It's mine.

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:20.870 align:middle line:10%
But if I know that from
years 621 until 850,

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:25.884 align:middle line:10%
it's going to be a
disaster, earthquakes

00:21:25.884 --> 00:21:28.330 align:middle line:10%
and other not very
easy situation,

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:29.770 align:middle line:10%
why I have to be here?

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:32.620 align:middle line:84%
No, I just simply don't
be here for the time,

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:36.360 align:middle line:84%
and then come back
at the year 851.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.920 align:middle line:84%
I know, it's a different
shifting of logic,

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.940 align:middle line:84%
but we touch many things
that are connecting to that.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:48.900 align:middle line:84%
So with this new idea of not
anymore of galactic empires

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:52.030 align:middle line:84%
but of time empires, so
I'm putting space and time

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:52.830 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:54.450 align:middle line:90%
What it means?

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:59.630 align:middle line:84%
That in this case for a time
empire to protect a territory.

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:01.970 align:middle line:84%
But in this case,
what is a territory?

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:07.440 align:middle line:84%
A specific time package, or
a series of time package.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:16.680 align:middle line:84%
So from inside, there is the
technology to close the border.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.748 align:middle line:84%
So you are not allowed
to cross that border.

00:22:18.748 --> 00:22:20.790 align:middle line:84%
You are not allowed to
enter, because you are not

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:24.180 align:middle line:84%
allowed to change anything,
because that territory is

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:25.760 align:middle line:84%
the territory that
is my territory.

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:29.520 align:middle line:84%
It's the territory
of the time empires.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.490 align:middle line:84%
That is the reason why
some of these time package,

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:36.570 align:middle line:90%
they are not open anymore.

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:39.690 align:middle line:84%
They are closed by
empires, empires

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:42.180 align:middle line:84%
that we might know, empires
that we might not know,

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:45.203 align:middle line:84%
empires that have been affecting
this planet in the past,

00:22:45.203 --> 00:22:46.620 align:middle line:84%
and maybe they are
going to impact

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.230 align:middle line:90%
this planet in the future.

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:51.630 align:middle line:90%
Or maybe there's already impact.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:56.570 align:middle line:90%
Now, why Falco?

00:22:56.570 --> 00:23:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Why in the '90s we was able
to travel into Atlantis?

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, probably because
there was a connection.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.940 align:middle line:84%
We already know that,
unfortunately, Atlantis

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.110 align:middle line:90%
is stuck there.

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:10.100 align:middle line:90%
There was a fracture.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.300 align:middle line:90%
There was a separation.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:13.130 align:middle line:90%
We cannot enter.

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, little by little, but it
takes really such a long time.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And most of all, the evolution,
the level of complexity

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:24.380 align:middle line:84%
that has been represented
by Atlantis, it's lost.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:28.250 align:middle line:84%
After that, we really restart,
and we are still very far away

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:30.410 align:middle line:90%
to achieve the same level.

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Why not to imagine
that we maybe can

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.455 align:middle line:90%
come back and save Atlantis?

00:23:36.455 --> 00:23:39.240 align:middle line:90%


00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.160 align:middle line:90%
No, this is not possible.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.450 align:middle line:90%
And we know why.

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Because we remember that in the
time territory, when an event,

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:49.500 align:middle line:90%
it's moving so much mass--

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.530 align:middle line:90%
remember earthquake, all that--

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:53.880 align:middle line:90%
we cannot change it anymore.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:54.790 align:middle line:90%
It would be so easy.

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:58.350 align:middle line:84%
I come back, save everyone,
save the evolution, save--

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:01.320 align:middle line:84%
no, there is an interaction
between these two timelines.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.460 align:middle line:90%
So it could not be so easy.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:04.770 align:middle line:90%
But what I can do?

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:08.070 align:middle line:84%
I need to save the
place, the island,

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:11.580 align:middle line:84%
or I need to save the
culture, the civilization.

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:12.960 align:middle line:90%
And this is represented by what?

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.450 align:middle line:90%
By the people, by the Atlantean.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:18.800 align:middle line:10%
So what I can try to
do, but is very complex

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.770 align:middle line:10%
and it takes an enormous
quantity of travels,

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:27.240 align:middle line:10%
actually not only anymore
travels but reincarnation.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:33.170 align:middle line:84%
I might come back in
time, before the creation

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:36.890 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis, in
that people that are

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:40.240 align:middle line:84%
going to form Atlantis, that
are going to create Atlantis.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.630 align:middle line:90%
And do what?

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:46.310 align:middle line:84%
Change so many events that
sometimes it's really changing

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:47.630 align:middle line:90%
entirely the life of people.

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:49.790 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason why we
talk about reincarnation.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:50.848 align:middle line:90%
And it's not enough.

00:24:50.848 --> 00:24:53.140 align:middle line:84%
You need to keep going, and
keep going, and keep going.

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Because we know that
Atlantis, it was the best,

00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:00.000 align:middle line:84%
and then it was pretty
much also the worst.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.790 align:middle line:84%
It was the highest
point of evolution

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:05.270 align:middle line:84%
in these last millions of
years, but did also a lot

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.610 align:middle line:90%
of very not nice mistakes.

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:12.020 align:middle line:10%
So to make it very
short, what I can

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.690 align:middle line:10%
try, what we can try
to do is to come back,

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:19.130 align:middle line:10%
to modify so many events, to
modify from the people that

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:22.310 align:middle line:10%
are going to create
Atlantis, and do what?

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:24.350 align:middle line:90%
We cannot save the island.

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:26.720 align:middle line:84%
The asteroid will
shoot the planet.

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.060 align:middle line:84%
The island will disappear
under the ocean.

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.690 align:middle line:90%
It will be a disaster.

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:33.772 align:middle line:84%
But the people are
somewhere else.

00:25:33.772 --> 00:25:34.730 align:middle line:90%
And who are the people?

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:36.470 align:middle line:90%
The people are the civilization.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:39.440 align:middle line:84%
The people carry
on the evolution.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:43.580 align:middle line:10%
The people are representing
Atlantis, not that island.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:47.120 align:middle line:84%
So if we can make that the
island will be completely

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.430 align:middle line:84%
empty, and the people
are going to be saved,

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:53.750 align:middle line:90%
we are going to save Atlantis.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:57.140 align:middle line:10%
If this is going to happen,
because it's not still

00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:02.330 align:middle line:10%
happening, even if we've
been working since 1998

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:05.930 align:middle line:10%
with more and more and more
energy, with more and more

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:11.940 align:middle line:10%
travels, and we never stop,
even after the pass of Falco.

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:15.780 align:middle line:84%
So if we're going to succeed,
what is going to happen?

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:19.680 align:middle line:10%
Well, someone will
discover Atlantis.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And no doubt, they're going
to say that this is a system.

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:25.198 align:middle line:84%
They were doing
something very clearly.

00:26:25.198 --> 00:26:26.490 align:middle line:90%
They were using the technology.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:30.600 align:middle line:84%
They were in contact
with the rest, and so on.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.690 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
some new technology,

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:36.990 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be
discovered, technology

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:39.780 align:middle line:84%
that are going to change
the life of people,

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:43.630 align:middle line:84%
like electricity did in the
past, just to give an example.

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:46.960 align:middle line:84%
As the internet did
for us more recently.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:50.130 align:middle line:84%
So technologies that are going
to create this new paradigm

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:52.170 align:middle line:90%
that we're looking for.

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:53.550 align:middle line:90%
Probably, who knows?

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we're going to be really
reconnected, because all

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.510 align:middle line:84%
of this is going to make
such a shake in the conscious

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:03.060 align:middle line:84%
of people that all
the old paradigm,

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.950 align:middle line:84%
they're not going
to exist anymore.

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Because the feeling of
people is to live differently

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:09.870 align:middle line:84%
and to live in a way
that, at the moment,

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:12.540 align:middle line:84%
we are still not
able to live, even

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.810 align:middle line:90%
if we are looking for that.

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And many are practical
things, many other things

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:22.220 align:middle line:84%
that are going really
to make this shift.

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.810 align:middle line:84%
It is actually a shift that
has been announced also

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:29.070 align:middle line:84%
by many other civilizations,
a shift that maybe is also

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:33.480 align:middle line:84%
linked to the prophecy of
2012, of the big change,

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.950 align:middle line:84%
and many, many,
many other things

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:38.140 align:middle line:84%
that I'm sure you can
remember better than me.

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:42.070 align:middle line:84%
So this is going to be the
bigger acceleration that we all

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.870 align:middle line:90%
deserve.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:46.710 align:middle line:84%
But until that
moment, we still have

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:51.440 align:middle line:84%
to work day by day through
our action to change us

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.660 align:middle line:90%
and to change this world.

00:27:53.660 --> 00:28:02.091 align:middle line:90%
