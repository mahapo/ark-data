00:00:01.515 --> 00:00:05.146
(spacious atmospheric music)

2
00:00:09.952 --> 00:00:12.597 line:15% 
<v ->Hey, I'm Jay Weidner and we're back for our fifth</v>

3
00:00:12.597 --> 00:00:14.858 line:15% 
episode of our conversations with

4
00:00:14.858 --> 00:00:17.451 line:15% 
Crotalo from Italy,

5
00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:18.805
from Damanhur.
<v ->Here we are.</v>

6
00:00:18.805 --> 00:00:20.704
And we're here today and we're gonna talk.

7
00:00:20.704 --> 00:00:22.048
He's going to take us through

8
00:00:22.048 --> 00:00:25.748
the incredible temple that they built in Italy.

9
00:00:27.028 --> 00:00:27.892
Right outside Turin.

10
00:00:27.892 --> 00:00:30.356
<v ->Yes Jay, it's a pleasure to be back here.</v>

11
00:00:30.356 --> 00:00:31.711
<v ->Yeah, it's a pleasure to have you.</v>

12
00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:35.433 line:15% 
<v ->Yes, and we're going to do a journey, now, underground</v>

13
00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:37.536 line:15% 
a little, actually in one of the most

14
00:00:37.536 --> 00:00:40.445 line:15% 
magical places of the planet

15
00:00:40.445 --> 00:00:42.940
according to our study the synchronic lines.

16
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.424
And we're going to do a journey in the

17
00:00:45.424 --> 00:00:47.836
Damanhur Temple of Humankinds.

18
00:00:47.836 --> 00:00:50.446
A temple that is dedicated to the humankinds

19
00:00:50.446 --> 00:00:52.881
because is not connected to one specific religion

20
00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:56.069
or to one specific spiritual research,

21
00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:59.686
but is really dedicated to all the form of spirituality

22
00:00:59.686 --> 00:01:03.110
that this planet embrace in many thousands of years.

23
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.477
<v ->Right, let's talk about these for a second.</v>

24
00:01:05.477 --> 00:01:07.995
You've already addressed this in a previous program,

25
00:01:07.995 --> 00:01:11.600
but just quickly recap what we're lookin' at hear.

26
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.832
<v ->Yes, so these are what we call the synchronic lines.</v>

27
00:01:14.832 --> 00:01:16.880
In the past they was mentioned also

28
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.399
with the name of the "points of the back of the dragon."

29
00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.079
And the dragons, or the big snakes,

30
00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.298
they was representing the movement

31
00:01:26.298 --> 00:01:29.295
of this river of energy all around the planet.

32
00:01:29.295 --> 00:01:30.660
<v ->Like feng shui, a little bit.</v>

33
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.419
<v ->Like a feng shui, or someone,</v>

34
00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:34.595
they are confusing them with ley lines,

35
00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:37.998
but there are many different energy lines.

36
00:01:37.998 --> 00:01:39.674
When we talk about the synchronic lines,

37
00:01:39.674 --> 00:01:41.945
we talk about the main one, the most important.

38
00:01:41.945 --> 00:01:46.445
And in this map, they are sign in blue and in red

39
00:01:46.445 --> 00:01:50.178
just to define the one that are moving horizontally,

40
00:01:50.178 --> 00:01:53.006
the blue one, and the one that are moving vertically,

41
00:01:53.006 --> 00:01:54.339
the red one.

42
00:01:54.339 --> 00:01:56.419
In total there are 18,

43
00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:59.619
and they are going to connect themself

44
00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.037
close to the poles.

45
00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:02.882
Into the poles they are extending themself

46
00:02:02.882 --> 00:02:06.017
like a double spiral in the rest of the solar system,

47
00:02:06.017 --> 00:02:07.521
connecting to the other synchronic lines

48
00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:10.586
coming from the other planet, from the Sun.

49
00:02:10.586 --> 00:02:12.130
They are going out and then connecting

50
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.623
all the rest of the Universe.

51
00:02:13.623 --> 00:02:14.530
So, let's say--

52
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.022
<v ->So the whole Universe is connected</v>

53
00:02:16.022 --> 00:02:17.249
by these lines of energy.

54
00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:19.584
<v ->Well, yes, let's say that there is a huge</v>

55
00:02:19.584 --> 00:02:23.503
star net of synchronic lines that are

56
00:02:23.503 --> 00:02:26.433
making us connected to everything.

57
00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:30.070
But what is really interesting about this energy lines,

58
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.574
so we can not see

59
00:02:31.574 --> 00:02:34.516
them with our eyes, we can perceive them

60
00:02:34.516 --> 00:02:36.278
through mediumship,

61
00:02:36.278 --> 00:02:38.240
through astral traveling,

62
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.016
through our kind of research connecting to the energy.

63
00:02:42.016 --> 00:02:43.199
<v Jay>We can feel 'em, too.</v>

64
00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:44.596
<v ->We can feel it, for sure.</v>

65
00:02:44.596 --> 00:02:47.518
Well, what is interesting, is when the line

66
00:02:47.518 --> 00:02:50.558
are touching together, they are crossing together,

67
00:02:50.558 --> 00:02:52.650
and you can see in this map

68
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.335
there is many of these places.

69
00:02:54.335 --> 00:02:57.258
Two, three, sometimes four lines.

70
00:02:57.258 --> 00:02:59.498
Well, when the line cross.

71
00:02:59.498 --> 00:03:02.557
So, this point are becoming something that

72
00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:04.616
I mention like source.

73
00:03:04.616 --> 00:03:06.909
Source of information, source of energy.

74
00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.277
Or if you want, in Egyptian culture,

75
00:03:09.277 --> 00:03:12.510
they are called the source of the Nile.

76
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.037
Where the Nile is not just the physical river,

77
00:03:15.037 --> 00:03:17.033
but is really this, let's say,

78
00:03:18.363 --> 00:03:21.457
stream of information, this stream of energy.

79
00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:25.042
What is also very interesting about the synchronic lines

80
00:03:25.042 --> 00:03:26.865
is that they are moving.

81
00:03:26.865 --> 00:03:28.337
Slowly, but they are moving.

82
00:03:28.337 --> 00:03:31.461
So places that in the past that was extremely important,

83
00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:33.050
now they are not so important.

84
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.133
In new places, they are now preparing to be

85
00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:38.138
the one for this period of time.

86
00:03:38.138 --> 00:03:40.656
Looking at this from the humankind,

87
00:03:40.656 --> 00:03:43.931
every time we are in one of these source,

88
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:45.936
in one of these crossing points.

89
00:03:45.936 --> 00:03:49.115
There are temples, there are sacred places,

90
00:03:49.115 --> 00:03:50.853
there are important civilizations,

91
00:03:50.853 --> 00:03:52.633
there are important town.

92
00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:54.756
Because what, there is a knowledge

93
00:03:54.756 --> 00:03:58.532
that is using the energy of this synchronic lines.

94
00:03:58.532 --> 00:04:01.434
So what happened, in the 70s,

95
00:04:01.434 --> 00:04:03.898
before Damanhur start,

96
00:04:03.898 --> 00:04:06.298
it was in interesting research.

97
00:04:06.298 --> 00:04:08.335
The Falco, the founder of Damanhur,

98
00:04:08.335 --> 00:04:09.892
with the first group of people,

99
00:04:09.892 --> 00:04:11.832
needed to do what, well to complete

100
00:04:11.832 --> 00:04:14.189
the map of this time, because they didn't have

101
00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:17.251
all, let's say, the different points.

102
00:04:17.251 --> 00:04:18.936
So what they did, they travel.

103
00:04:18.936 --> 00:04:20.611
They traveled all around the world.

104
00:04:20.611 --> 00:04:23.437
They do astral traveling, they're doing many of this

105
00:04:23.437 --> 00:04:25.091
energetic research

106
00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:27.128
to complete the map and then to find out

107
00:04:27.128 --> 00:04:29.175
which was the best place.

108
00:04:29.175 --> 00:04:30.647
The best place for what,

109
00:04:30.647 --> 00:04:32.514
well the best place to create Damanhur.

110
00:04:32.514 --> 00:04:35.212
To create then, something that is not just

111
00:04:35.212 --> 00:04:37.869
a community, but something that could be really like

112
00:04:37.869 --> 00:04:39.416
a station.

113
00:04:39.416 --> 00:04:43.767
A point of connection between time, dimension and space.

114
00:04:43.767 --> 00:04:46.721
So, and we was ready to build Damanhur

115
00:04:46.721 --> 00:04:48.855
wherever it was this

116
00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:50.294
<v ->Wherever that place was.
<v ->important place.</v>

117
00:04:50.294 --> 00:04:52.791
And it's a very funny story, very humoristic,

118
00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:54.124
because when they finished,

119
00:04:54.124 --> 00:04:57.004
when they complete all this research,

120
00:04:57.004 --> 00:04:58.924
they found out that the most important point

121
00:04:58.924 --> 00:05:01.461 line:15% 
where four synchronic lines are crossing,

122
00:05:01.461 --> 00:05:03.329 line:15% 
it was just 10 miles

123
00:05:03.329 --> 00:05:05.291 line:15% 
from where Falco was born.

124
00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:07.723
Falco was born in Balangero Canavese.

125
00:05:07.723 --> 00:05:10.486
Damanhur is in Baldissero Canavese.

126
00:05:10.486 --> 00:05:13.248
So it's a metaphor, but we are always

127
00:05:13.248 --> 00:05:14.944
looking outside for the most important things

128
00:05:14.944 --> 00:05:16.523
and then we forget that the most important things

129
00:05:16.523 --> 00:05:17.788
is just right here.

130
00:05:17.788 --> 00:05:18.922
<v Jay>And he could have chose</v>

131
00:05:18.922 --> 00:05:20.426
to be born there anyway, so.

132
00:05:20.426 --> 00:05:22.858
<v Crotalo>Well, probably he was guided to be born</v>

133
00:05:22.858 --> 00:05:23.775
exactly in that place.

134
00:05:23.775 --> 00:05:25.013
<v ->So that's that place right there</v>

135
00:05:25.013 --> 00:05:26.378
where all the stuff is

136
00:05:26.378 --> 00:05:27.658
coagulating.
<v ->Exactly.</v>

137
00:05:27.658 --> 00:05:29.951
North of Italy,

138
00:05:29.951 --> 00:05:33.535
25 miles from Turin, that is the largest city.

139
00:05:33.535 --> 00:05:34.793
<v Jay>Very nice place.</v>

140
00:05:34.793 --> 00:05:36.137
<v Crotalo>Yes, very nice place,</v>

141
00:05:36.137 --> 00:05:38.335
just one and a half hour from Milan.

142
00:05:38.335 --> 00:05:39.497
So--

143
00:05:39.497 --> 00:05:40.713
<v Jay>The foot of the Alps, there?</v>

144
00:05:40.713 --> 00:05:43.219
<v ->Yes, just at the bottom of the Alps.</v>

145
00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:45.257
A very interesting place,

146
00:05:45.257 --> 00:05:49.758
because it's pretty nearby a lot of important places.

147
00:05:50.788 --> 00:05:52.104
But, let's say the right place

148
00:05:52.104 --> 00:05:54.205
then to start the project.

149
00:05:54.205 --> 00:05:56.637
And the project is to create a place

150
00:05:56.637 --> 00:05:59.240
that could represent our spiritual research,

151
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.344
but also to create an instrument,

152
00:06:02.344 --> 00:06:06.738
a temple, that is a sort of spiritual accelerator.

153
00:06:07.778 --> 00:06:11.730
We already mentioned this aspect.

154
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.746
When we talk about a spiritual accelerator,

155
00:06:13.746 --> 00:06:17.105
we talk about a place that is able to talk to your soul.

156
00:06:17.105 --> 00:06:20.412
Or if you want to re-awake the memory.

157
00:06:20.412 --> 00:06:22.748
The memory of why your soul is back,

158
00:06:22.748 --> 00:06:24.550
why you're back here, which is the reason

159
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.750
why you are in this life, in this incarnation.

160
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.173
So, there are places, the temple of humankind

161
00:06:31.173 --> 00:06:32.848
is not the only one, but there are places

162
00:06:32.848 --> 00:06:35.471
all around the planet, that are able to

163
00:06:35.471 --> 00:06:37.552
make the click inside.

164
00:06:37.552 --> 00:06:41.072
So they are called spirit accelerator

165
00:06:41.072 --> 00:06:42.544
because they are accelerating

166
00:06:42.544 --> 00:06:46.032
the memory of what you have accomplished in this life

167
00:06:46.032 --> 00:06:48.549
to realize which is your mission.

168
00:06:48.549 --> 00:06:52.943
So, little by little, we create the spirit accelerator

169
00:06:52.943 --> 00:06:54.276
underground.

170
00:06:54.276 --> 00:06:57.679
Because underground is where this synchronic lines

171
00:06:57.679 --> 00:06:59.716
are passing through.

172
00:06:59.716 --> 00:07:03.299
So, into the temple, we're going to discover also,

173
00:07:03.299 --> 00:07:05.443
some of these places, there are the plug,

174
00:07:05.443 --> 00:07:08.941
perfectly plug to these four synchronic lines.

175
00:07:08.941 --> 00:07:11.779
And now maybe we can go to the next one.

176
00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:13.880
Oh, and here we go.

177
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.186
This is an interesting picture, because will help us

178
00:07:17.186 --> 00:07:20.599
to discover all the different chambers,

179
00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:22.626
all the different part of the temple.

180
00:07:22.626 --> 00:07:25.303
The temple is like a body.

181
00:07:25.303 --> 00:07:28.886
So, every single chamber represent the different organs,

182
00:07:28.886 --> 00:07:30.700
a different function.

183
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:35.873
The one with the entire

184
00:07:35.873 --> 00:07:37.878
project, with the entire view,

185
00:07:37.878 --> 00:07:39.254
well it was Falco.

186
00:07:39.254 --> 00:07:40.821
But we didn't know that we was

187
00:07:40.821 --> 00:07:43.254
going to create all of this.

188
00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:44.896
At the beginning it was

189
00:07:44.896 --> 00:07:47.158
just a temple, a little place,

190
00:07:47.158 --> 00:07:50.240
into the mountain, to be well-isolated

191
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.541
from the radiation,

192
00:07:51.541 --> 00:07:54.080
from all the other things that

193
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.800
can disturb our research.

194
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.317
<v Jay>Just kind of a spontaneous, spiritual thing.</v>

195
00:08:00.457 --> 00:08:02.666
<v ->Well, it was hard.</v>

196
00:08:03.856 --> 00:08:05.045
<v Jay>I bet.</v>
<v ->There was</v>

197
00:08:05.045 --> 00:08:06.484
one direction, the other direction,

198
00:08:06.484 --> 00:08:07.438
what to do?

199
00:08:07.438 --> 00:08:08.852
We're going to ask the government,

200
00:08:08.852 --> 00:08:10.271
to the Italian government,

201
00:08:10.271 --> 00:08:12.479
to build 6,000 kilometers underground

202
00:08:12.479 --> 00:08:15.316
according to ancient knowledge,

203
00:08:15.316 --> 00:08:19.219
without engineer, without architect,

204
00:08:19.219 --> 00:08:20.456
<v ->You would have been laughed at.</v>

205
00:08:20.456 --> 00:08:22.834
<v ->or yes, and then they would also control.</v>

206
00:08:22.834 --> 00:08:24.030
<v Jay>Eventually no.</v>

207
00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:27.058
<v ->Or, take the risk, do everything in secret.</v>

208
00:08:27.058 --> 00:08:29.330
So, it was our secret, it was our temple.

209
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.677
And then, take the risk on all of this.

210
00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:33.352
And we choose the second option.

211
00:08:33.352 --> 00:08:35.858
So, we start to dig into the rock,

212
00:08:35.858 --> 00:08:37.416
with our hands.

213
00:08:37.416 --> 00:08:40.221
Without any support from outside,

214
00:08:40.221 --> 00:08:42.173
and I'm lucky because I'm part of this

215
00:08:43.573 --> 00:08:45.266
group of the builder of the temple.

216
00:08:45.266 --> 00:08:47.751
There was an incredible energy,

217
00:08:47.751 --> 00:08:51.868
because everything was done to be secret.

218
00:08:51.868 --> 00:08:54.887
So everything doesn't appear

219
00:08:54.887 --> 00:08:57.161
as we was creating a temple, but,

220
00:08:57.161 --> 00:09:01.308
these people, a little bit crazy or alternative.

221
00:09:02.888 --> 00:09:04.101
They're coming and going.

222
00:09:04.101 --> 00:09:05.175
<v Jay>They loved it.</v>

223
00:09:05.175 --> 00:09:06.325
<v ->Doing a lot of things day and night,</v>

224
00:09:06.325 --> 00:09:08.401
because for us this was the mission,

225
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:12.006
and part of the mission was to create something

226
00:09:12.006 --> 00:09:14.843
that represent our spiritual research.

227
00:09:14.843 --> 00:09:16.400
So we dig with our hands,

228
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.160
we dig together.

229
00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.421
We did incredible, crazy things.

230
00:09:20.421 --> 00:09:23.418
But, the energy was really the energy

231
00:09:23.418 --> 00:09:26.479
that makes the glue of the entire community,

232
00:09:26.479 --> 00:09:28.463
because when you work side by side

233
00:09:28.463 --> 00:09:30.117
there is really something to know

234
00:09:30.117 --> 00:09:33.060
who you have beside you.

235
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.154
And also, let's say, digging into the rock,

236
00:09:36.154 --> 00:09:39.609
and I have to tell you, there was no empty space,

237
00:09:39.609 --> 00:09:40.889
it was all rock.

238
00:09:40.889 --> 00:09:43.449
So we dig every single centimeter.

239
00:09:43.449 --> 00:09:46.052
But digging into the rock it was like to

240
00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:47.470
dig inside of you.

241
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:50.253
So every time that you was creating a space outside,

242
00:09:50.253 --> 00:09:52.387
it was like to create a space inside.

243
00:09:52.387 --> 00:09:54.894
So it was, if you want a practical meditation.

244
00:09:54.894 --> 00:09:57.465
And then you know, build the temple,

245
00:09:57.465 --> 00:09:59.394
was like to build your inner temple.

246
00:09:59.394 --> 00:10:03.650
So it was always this work, inside and outside.

247
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:06.370
And all of the sudden we start to create something

248
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:08.887
unbelievable, because it's true, there was

249
00:10:08.887 --> 00:10:11.927
no architect, there was no engineer.

250
00:10:11.927 --> 00:10:15.607
We follow the ancient knowledge of the past,

251
00:10:15.607 --> 00:10:17.346
the use of the sacred geometry.

252
00:10:17.346 --> 00:10:20.065
The one the Egyptians used in the Pyramids in Giza,

253
00:10:20.065 --> 00:10:23.031
the one that the Mayans used in Chichen Itza

254
00:10:23.031 --> 00:10:24.588
in just the pyramid.

255
00:10:24.588 --> 00:10:27.745
What the Incas did in Machu Picchu,

256
00:10:27.745 --> 00:10:29.728
and in many different civilizations.

257
00:10:29.728 --> 00:10:31.361
<v ->The Parthenon in Greece.</v>

258
00:10:31.361 --> 00:10:33.847
<v ->Yes and all over the planet there are</v>

259
00:10:33.847 --> 00:10:38.390
places that are talking with symbols,

260
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:39.744
with geometry,

261
00:10:39.744 --> 00:10:42.240
with numbers,

262
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.429
that are able then to translate,

263
00:10:45.429 --> 00:10:48.469
to connect energies that, in these places,

264
00:10:48.469 --> 00:10:49.568
are alive.

265
00:10:49.568 --> 00:10:52.544
And this energy are information, are knowledge,

266
00:10:52.544 --> 00:10:55.627
and simply to be there, it's like to be inside

267
00:10:55.627 --> 00:10:56.960
of all of this information.

268
00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.688
And this information is really affecting

269
00:10:58.688 --> 00:11:01.503
then your soul, your aura, your energy.

270
00:11:01.503 --> 00:11:04.767
So, these places are

271
00:11:06.537 --> 00:11:09.758
talking a language that we call the Stone Language.

272
00:11:09.758 --> 00:11:11.956
"Stone," because the material that resists more

273
00:11:11.956 --> 00:11:13.311
during time.

274
00:11:13.311 --> 00:11:16.478
Because it's a long terms project, okay, it's not just for

275
00:11:16.478 --> 00:11:19.689
one generation but for many, many generation.

276
00:11:19.689 --> 00:11:22.590
At the same times, it's the Stone Language because,

277
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.489
you don't need to read a book.

278
00:11:24.489 --> 00:11:26.857
Because the book is the entire temple.

279
00:11:26.857 --> 00:11:27.753
The book, it's--

280
00:11:27.753 --> 00:11:29.256
<v Jay>Do we have a picture of the cover of that book?</v>

281
00:11:29.256 --> 00:11:30.430
Yeah, there we are.

282
00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.574
<v ->This is definitely for who is--</v>

283
00:11:32.574 --> 00:11:34.077
<v Jay>Alex Gray published it.</v>

284
00:11:34.077 --> 00:11:36.456
<v ->Yes, Alex Gray, that is a dear friend of ours, so</v>

285
00:11:36.456 --> 00:11:37.832
<v Jay>Yeah, same here.</v>
<v Crotalo>when he</v>

286
00:11:37.832 --> 00:11:38.972
discovered the temple, he say,

287
00:11:38.972 --> 00:11:41.149
"Well, I want to make a book

288
00:11:41.149 --> 00:11:42.536
"about The Temple of Humankind,

289
00:11:42.536 --> 00:11:44.210
"because everybody need to know

290
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:45.714
"about this incredible place."

291
00:11:45.714 --> 00:11:48.007
And he did a great job, and this is definitely

292
00:11:48.007 --> 00:11:50.450
the reference point for who wants really

293
00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:53.217
to discover The Temple of Humankind in Damanhur.

294
00:11:53.217 --> 00:11:55.009
<v ->I mean if Alex Gray likes it, you know it has to be</v>

295
00:11:55.009 --> 00:11:55.809
top quality.

296
00:11:55.809 --> 00:11:57.185
(laughing)
<v ->Yes, absolutely,</v>

297
00:11:57.185 --> 00:11:58.582
absolutely.

298
00:11:58.582 --> 00:12:00.481
So, and then now coming back to

299
00:12:00.481 --> 00:12:02.699
the main picture,

300
00:12:02.699 --> 00:12:04.779
the map of the temple,

301
00:12:04.779 --> 00:12:05.985
<v Jay>Yeah, let's go back to that.</v>

302
00:12:05.985 --> 00:12:07.861
Is this supposed to be how it looks on the hillside?

303
00:12:07.861 --> 00:12:08.682
<v ->Exactly.</v>

304
00:12:08.682 --> 00:12:09.823
<v Jay>Where's the entrance, over there?</v>

305
00:12:09.823 --> 00:12:11.242
<v ->Well, there is more than one entrance,</v>

306
00:12:11.242 --> 00:12:12.683
I cannot, you know--

307
00:12:12.683 --> 00:12:13.984
<v Jay>Is there a secret entrance?</v>

308
00:12:13.984 --> 00:12:17.546
<v ->Well, you know, "secret" is part of the</v>

309
00:12:17.546 --> 00:12:20.287
spiritual process to transform yourself.

310
00:12:20.287 --> 00:12:23.285
So "secret" could be also what doesn't appear

311
00:12:23.285 --> 00:12:26.420
and then appear as the solution, as the new opening, so--

312
00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:29.119
<v ->How long did it take you to carve this out of the rock?</v>

313
00:12:29.119 --> 00:12:31.657
<v ->Well, to tell you the truth, it doesn't take so much,</v>

314
00:12:31.657 --> 00:12:34.067
because we start around 1978,

315
00:12:35.377 --> 00:12:38.484
and all of this was done in 1992, 1993.

316
00:12:38.484 --> 00:12:39.709
<v ->14, 15 years.</v>

317
00:12:39.709 --> 00:12:42.750
<v ->14, 15 years, and not more than 40, 50 people</v>

318
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:43.625
working, digging.

319
00:12:43.625 --> 00:12:44.873
<v Jay>Wow.</v>

320
00:12:44.873 --> 00:12:46.686
<v ->And if you can believe me,</v>

321
00:12:46.686 --> 00:12:49.544
well, this was a secret, also for the Damanhurians,

322
00:12:49.544 --> 00:12:50.686
for some Damanhurians.

323
00:12:50.686 --> 00:12:52.051
<v Jay>They didn't know.</v>
<v ->Because also for us,</v>

324
00:12:52.051 --> 00:12:54.269
it was a spiritual process,

325
00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:56.487
then to be aware that it was a temple,

326
00:12:56.487 --> 00:12:59.592
then to be honored to walk into the temple.

327
00:12:59.592 --> 00:13:01.490
So even in Damanhur there was Damanhurians,

328
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.005
there was working the temple.

329
00:13:03.005 --> 00:13:06.673
Damanhurians, they didn't know anything about a temple,

330
00:13:06.673 --> 00:13:09.073
so it was very interesting, and it was again,

331
00:13:09.073 --> 00:13:12.763
the application of spiritual principle.

332
00:13:12.763 --> 00:13:16.443
So all of this was done, as I told you, according to

333
00:13:16.443 --> 00:13:19.153
the synchronic lines, so plugging perfectly

334
00:13:19.153 --> 00:13:20.647
to these energy lines.

335
00:13:20.647 --> 00:13:22.310
And it's very interesting, because then,

336
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:26.406
when in 1995, when there was all these adventure

337
00:13:26.406 --> 00:13:27.962
that maybe we can talk about,

338
00:13:27.962 --> 00:13:30.970
to legalize the structure, because we was blackmailed.

339
00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.487
<v Jay>So you got busted, and the police came.</v>

340
00:13:33.487 --> 00:13:34.383
Tell that story.

341
00:13:34.383 --> 00:13:37.391
<v ->Well, the story, it's probably not a nice story</v>

342
00:13:37.391 --> 00:13:40.027
at the beginning, because around 1991

343
00:13:40.027 --> 00:13:42.928
we were starting to be blackmailed from a person

344
00:13:42.928 --> 00:13:44.549
that was living before in Damanhur,

345
00:13:44.549 --> 00:13:46.511
knowing about the temple, then he left,

346
00:13:46.511 --> 00:13:49.967
and then he come out, asking money not to reveal

347
00:13:49.967 --> 00:13:51.684
that the temple was existing.

348
00:13:51.684 --> 00:13:53.348
But blackmail is not really part of our

349
00:13:53.348 --> 00:13:54.810
way of living.

350
00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.282
So we didn't accept that.

351
00:13:56.282 --> 00:13:57.626
And then one day,

352
00:13:57.626 --> 00:13:59.865
the policemen, the judge arrive

353
00:13:59.865 --> 00:14:02.788
to this place with explosive and everything

354
00:14:02.788 --> 00:14:04.548
and say, "We're going to blow up everything

355
00:14:04.548 --> 00:14:06.520
"if we're not opening the temple."

356
00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.549
So, in that moment we decided to open the temple.

357
00:14:09.549 --> 00:14:11.629
Then the judge and the policemen, they enter,

358
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:14.382
and when they come out, they was crying.

359
00:14:14.382 --> 00:14:16.984
They was completely astonished, say,

360
00:14:16.984 --> 00:14:19.566
"We couldn't believe that you did something like this.

361
00:14:19.566 --> 00:14:22.083
"It's something unbelievably beautiful."

362
00:14:22.083 --> 00:14:25.282
So, we're going to do whatever we can to protect this place.

363
00:14:26.642 --> 00:14:29.389
But, unfortunately, the first request from the country

364
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:31.970
was to destroy everything, can you imagine?

365
00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.573
It's more than 6,000 square meters, so you have to

366
00:14:34.573 --> 00:14:36.172
destroy the mountain, so,

367
00:14:36.172 --> 00:14:39.435
it went to be a long process.

368
00:14:39.435 --> 00:14:42.667
It was a battle to then make the temple

369
00:14:42.667 --> 00:14:44.074
completely legal.

370
00:14:44.074 --> 00:14:47.190
But, let's say, also our temple, because there was

371
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:52.107
also the idea to lose the temple

372
00:14:53.187 --> 00:14:57.238
and then to be used for something that is not really

373
00:14:57.238 --> 00:14:59.243
the reason why the temple is there.

374
00:14:59.243 --> 00:15:02.219
So, finally, 1995, we legalize everything,

375
00:15:02.219 --> 00:15:06.058
we become the official owner of the temple.

376
00:15:06.058 --> 00:15:09.216
And at that moment, many geologists,

377
00:15:09.216 --> 00:15:12.959
they came to control, to check if the structure was

378
00:15:12.959 --> 00:15:14.901
strong enough and everything,
<v Jay>Safe.</v>

379
00:15:14.901 --> 00:15:16.042
<v ->safe enough.</v>

380
00:15:16.042 --> 00:15:18.026
So, well, the structure is not only safe,

381
00:15:18.026 --> 00:15:20.425
because if a earthquake will come, and it's very rare

382
00:15:20.425 --> 00:15:21.587
in this area,

383
00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:23.038
the structure will move

384
00:15:23.038 --> 00:15:26.057
instead of be broken or something like that.

385
00:15:26.057 --> 00:15:28.895
But what is more interesting is that here,

386
00:15:28.895 --> 00:15:31.699
we are in a very important tectonic plates

387
00:15:31.699 --> 00:15:33.573
of the planet.

388
00:15:33.573 --> 00:15:37.193
And because the rock that are in the surface

389
00:15:37.193 --> 00:15:41.448
are rocks that normally, you find only very deep inside,

390
00:15:42.738 --> 00:15:43.774
what they discover,

391
00:15:43.774 --> 00:15:48.371
that all the temple is built exactly in a layer of rock

392
00:15:48.371 --> 00:15:50.812
that is called mylonite.

393
00:15:50.812 --> 00:15:52.189
Probably people are not so

394
00:15:52.189 --> 00:15:53.969
used to the mylonite,

395
00:15:53.969 --> 00:15:55.377
but the mylonite,

396
00:15:55.377 --> 00:15:58.471
it's called the energetic rock.

397
00:15:58.471 --> 00:16:01.895
So, it's the rock that brings the energy of the earth

398
00:16:01.895 --> 00:16:04.316
to flow from one place to another place.

399
00:16:04.316 --> 00:16:05.521
And we didn't know that.

400
00:16:05.521 --> 00:16:06.694
<v Jay>It's like a conductor.</v>

401
00:16:06.694 --> 00:16:08.316
<v ->Exactly, and we didn't know that.</v>

402
00:16:08.316 --> 00:16:10.641
And these geologists, they was absolutely

403
00:16:10.641 --> 00:16:12.497
astonished on the fact that we was building

404
00:16:12.497 --> 00:16:13.862
exactly on that layer,

405
00:16:13.862 --> 00:16:14.993
not another one,

406
00:16:14.993 --> 00:16:17.777
but all the temple is exactly and only that layer.

407
00:16:17.777 --> 00:16:19.857
So, it was the physical proof

408
00:16:19.857 --> 00:16:23.696
of what we are researching in the energetical field.

409
00:16:25.536 --> 00:16:27.941
And then, we can maybe now start with the--

410
00:16:27.941 --> 00:16:29.200
<v ->Yeah let's start, let's take a tour.</v>

411
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.003
<v ->We start with a tour,</v>

412
00:16:31.003 --> 00:16:32.784
we're going to come back, well,

413
00:16:32.784 --> 00:16:35.845
we talk about secret passage, this is true.

414
00:16:35.845 --> 00:16:39.573
Many places are done to

415
00:16:41.153 --> 00:16:43.776
open secret part, secret door.

416
00:16:43.776 --> 00:16:46.122
Because the secret doors are again the metaphora

417
00:16:46.122 --> 00:16:47.743
of what we have inside.

418
00:16:47.743 --> 00:16:50.377
If you want, it's a metaphora of the labyrinth.

419
00:16:50.377 --> 00:16:53.642
So even when it looks like that everything is finished,

420
00:16:53.642 --> 00:16:55.742
so there's always, you know, a door,

421
00:16:55.742 --> 00:16:58.079
something that opens completely,

422
00:16:59.729 --> 00:17:01.829
that can open something completely different.

423
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:05.914
And I'm going to maybe to go to other pictures

424
00:17:07.124 --> 00:17:08.420
that we have at the beginning.

425
00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.287
Okay, this one, exactly.

426
00:17:10.287 --> 00:17:13.423
Just to remind you that when you come to visit a temple,

427
00:17:13.423 --> 00:17:18.061
because probably it's nice to know that the temple

428
00:17:19.211 --> 00:17:22.600
is open, so everybody can come to visit a temple,

429
00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.835
to experience the temple, because more than a visit

430
00:17:24.835 --> 00:17:27.289
we like to talk about it in spirits.

431
00:17:28.449 --> 00:17:31.481
It's a sort of spiritual pilgrimage, but the temple is open

432
00:17:31.481 --> 00:17:32.974
really to everyone.

433
00:17:32.974 --> 00:17:35.236
So, in Damanhur we have every year

434
00:17:35.236 --> 00:17:36.920
it's thousand and thousand of people from all over

435
00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.419
the planet are coming to visit.

436
00:17:38.419 --> 00:17:41.426
But outside, doesn't looks as a temple.

437
00:17:41.426 --> 00:17:42.685
It's normal house.

438
00:17:42.685 --> 00:17:44.083
And you see there is a normal

439
00:17:44.083 --> 00:17:45.384
<v Jay>Door.</v>
<v Crotalo>wooden door.</v>

440
00:17:45.384 --> 00:17:48.554
And if you cross this door, in the next picture,

441
00:17:49.814 --> 00:17:52.050
well you're going in a corridor, and this corridor

442
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.151
doesn't look like anything.

443
00:17:54.151 --> 00:17:55.825
But, all of the sudden,

444
00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:57.531
there is a remote control,

445
00:17:57.531 --> 00:18:01.393
and one part of the corridor, simply enter inside

446
00:18:01.393 --> 00:18:03.996
of the mountain, and this is one of the doors,

447
00:18:03.996 --> 00:18:07.270
one of the entrance, and all of the sudden,

448
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:09.295
you are inside of the temple.

449
00:18:09.295 --> 00:18:10.629
Okay,
<v Jay>Wow.</v>

450
00:18:10.629 --> 00:18:13.232
<v Crotalo>we are in front of miles and miles</v>

451
00:18:13.232 --> 00:18:14.790
of different corridors.

452
00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:18.672
Again, you can imagine that the temple is like a schema,

453
00:18:18.672 --> 00:18:23.312
so also, how you walk from one chamber to another chamber,

454
00:18:23.312 --> 00:18:25.796
so it's like to follow a path.

455
00:18:25.796 --> 00:18:27.695
So you are creating a symbols

456
00:18:27.695 --> 00:18:29.956
that is reflecting inside of you.

457
00:18:29.956 --> 00:18:32.336
So, like a key that is open again,

458
00:18:32.336 --> 00:18:35.450
to open memories, because this is

459
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:36.773
a place of memories.

460
00:18:36.773 --> 00:18:38.415
This is a place of reconnection,

461
00:18:38.415 --> 00:18:40.068
this is a place where--
<v Jay>Like a pilgrimage,</v>

462
00:18:40.068 --> 00:18:40.996
even.

463
00:18:40.996 --> 00:18:42.436
<v Crotalo>Like a pilgrimage.</v>

464
00:18:42.436 --> 00:18:45.753
And all the symbols that you see

465
00:18:45.753 --> 00:18:50.489
are part of what we call the archetype language.

466
00:18:50.489 --> 00:18:54.830
Again, symbols, sounds, movement of the body,

467
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:59.011
able to connect and reconnect to energy,

468
00:18:59.011 --> 00:19:00.291
to information.

469
00:19:00.291 --> 00:19:04.045
All the temple is done according to the use of this

470
00:19:04.045 --> 00:19:05.507
archetype language.

471
00:19:05.507 --> 00:19:09.891
Okay, we are now going to one of them,

472
00:19:10.951 --> 00:19:14.135
one of the first part of the temple created--

473
00:19:14.135 --> 00:19:15.521
<v Jay>How tall is that door?</v>

474
00:19:15.521 --> 00:19:17.261
<v ->Well, the door is about two meters.</v>

475
00:19:17.261 --> 00:19:19.213
<v Jay>Oh so it's six feet.</v>
<v Crotalo>Yes.</v>

476
00:19:19.213 --> 00:19:20.835
<v ->So that's about, what,</v>

477
00:19:20.835 --> 00:19:22.179
one, two, three,

478
00:19:23.999 --> 00:19:25.799
about 35 feet high?

479
00:19:25.799 --> 00:19:27.399
<v Crotalo>Yeah, something like that.</v>

480
00:19:27.399 --> 00:19:29.489
We can maybe go to the other one,

481
00:19:29.489 --> 00:19:32.775
that, okay, that gives more details.

482
00:19:32.775 --> 00:19:34.610
Well, this is one of my favorite

483
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:36.210
<v Jay>Wow.</v>
<v Crotalo>places,</v>

484
00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.290
this is called the Hall of the Water.

485
00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:40.977
And it's all connecting to

486
00:19:40.977 --> 00:19:42.737
female side,

487
00:19:42.737 --> 00:19:45.212
to memory.

488
00:19:45.212 --> 00:19:47.910
What you see all around

489
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:52.070
are, again, use of symbols,

490
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:55.099
use of signs that brings this place

491
00:19:55.099 --> 00:19:56.656
to be a sort of book.

492
00:19:56.656 --> 00:19:57.957
It's a book of knowledge.

493
00:19:57.957 --> 00:20:00.559
Actually, who paints all these rooms

494
00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:01.711
was Falco.

495
00:20:01.711 --> 00:20:04.250
Was his first, let's say, selfic paintings.

496
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.448
We're going to talk about selfica later on.

497
00:20:06.448 --> 00:20:08.208
And, what is interesting,

498
00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:11.365
okay, this is a very nice one because you can

499
00:20:11.365 --> 00:20:14.767
appreciate the floor with symbology again,

500
00:20:14.767 --> 00:20:17.124
connecting to the water, and to the female side.

501
00:20:17.124 --> 00:20:20.623
But also, one of the first dome

502
00:20:20.623 --> 00:20:22.340
in Tiffany glass.

503
00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.028
This was the first one, the little one.

504
00:20:25.028 --> 00:20:27.342
I want to bring your attention

505
00:20:27.342 --> 00:20:29.742
on that sphere, you see?

506
00:20:29.742 --> 00:20:31.086
<v Jay>Yeah.</v>
<v Crotalo>And in this</v>

507
00:20:31.086 --> 00:20:34.286
sort of altar you probably see that there is rock,

508
00:20:34.286 --> 00:20:36.419
and it's pretty interesting because,

509
00:20:36.419 --> 00:20:38.264
everything is so amazed,

510
00:20:38.264 --> 00:20:41.059
everything is so much art, and then what?

511
00:20:41.059 --> 00:20:42.647
We left rock there?

512
00:20:42.647 --> 00:20:45.667
Well, this is something that is not a secret,

513
00:20:45.667 --> 00:20:47.085
so I can share with you.

514
00:20:47.085 --> 00:20:49.560
When you find places in the temple where there is rock,

515
00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.821
is because there is one of the access point

516
00:20:51.821 --> 00:20:53.421
to the synchronic lines.

517
00:20:53.421 --> 00:20:55.703
That's one of the reasons why we left rock.

518
00:20:57.243 --> 00:20:59.884
We go forward, to the next one.

519
00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:03.692
Just to admire the central part of the dome.

520
00:21:03.692 --> 00:21:04.892
I have to tell you,

521
00:21:04.892 --> 00:21:05.873
<v Jay>Spectacular.</v>

522
00:21:05.873 --> 00:21:07.312
<v ->all of this artwork,</v>

523
00:21:07.312 --> 00:21:09.051
it's coming from Damanhurians.

524
00:21:09.051 --> 00:21:11.547
But what people, they don't know, is that there was

525
00:21:11.547 --> 00:21:13.670
no professional artist in Damanhur.

526
00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:15.889
No one of us, zero.

527
00:21:15.889 --> 00:21:19.088
But because we need to bring,

528
00:21:19.088 --> 00:21:20.870
well, why art?

529
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:24.687
Well art is another way to translate

530
00:21:24.687 --> 00:21:25.988
your spiritual values.

531
00:21:25.988 --> 00:21:28.048
So through art, through these corridors,

532
00:21:28.048 --> 00:21:30.469
through the symbols, you are giving meanings.

533
00:21:30.469 --> 00:21:34.031
And art is that kind of emotional language.

534
00:21:34.031 --> 00:21:36.389
It doesn't need any translation, so everybody can

535
00:21:37.639 --> 00:21:40.207
feel the same set of conscious, the same emotion.

536
00:21:40.207 --> 00:21:43.491
<v ->I like to say that if a picture is worth a thousand words,</v>

537
00:21:43.491 --> 00:21:45.593
a symbol is worth a thousand pictures.

538
00:21:45.593 --> 00:21:47.727
<v ->Absolutely, absolutely.</v>

539
00:21:47.727 --> 00:21:51.150
So also, all these game, let's say,

540
00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:53.230
of beautiful forms,

541
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:55.929
well this is a page of the book.

542
00:21:55.929 --> 00:21:59.245
Because all the symbols are in the archetype language.

543
00:21:59.245 --> 00:22:02.893
So even it looks only art, in this moment

544
00:22:02.893 --> 00:22:04.707
you are in front of information.

545
00:22:04.707 --> 00:22:07.373
And you are receiving this information

546
00:22:07.373 --> 00:22:09.624
to the only fact that you're observing that.

547
00:22:09.624 --> 00:22:11.704
They're entering and they're coming to,

548
00:22:11.704 --> 00:22:13.005
starting to work.

549
00:22:13.005 --> 00:22:14.210
<v ->It's the real purpose of a temple.</v>

550
00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:14.786
<v ->Exactly.</v>

551
00:22:16.256 --> 00:22:17.271
<v Jay>Wow.</v>
<v Crotalo>This is a very</v>

552
00:22:17.271 --> 00:22:18.103
nice one.

553
00:22:18.103 --> 00:22:19.309
<v Jay>That's the whole dome there, huh?</v>

554
00:22:19.309 --> 00:22:22.647
<v Crotalo>Yes, this is a picture I took from the floor,</v>

555
00:22:22.647 --> 00:22:24.983
so this is the entire dome.

556
00:22:24.983 --> 00:22:27.041
Well, the lens give really

557
00:22:27.041 --> 00:22:28.727
<v Jay>Fisheye.</v>
<v Crotalo>devioso</v>

558
00:22:28.727 --> 00:22:30.327
of the shape.

559
00:22:30.327 --> 00:22:31.990
<v Jay>Yeah, that's really beautiful.</v>

560
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:33.526
<v Crotalo>It's a book of knowledge, I told you,</v>

561
00:22:33.526 --> 00:22:34.689
<v Jay>You're right, it is.</v>

562
00:22:34.689 --> 00:22:36.908
<v ->so you can really stay there for days and days</v>

563
00:22:36.908 --> 00:22:38.709
and study every single detail.

564
00:22:38.709 --> 00:22:41.109
<v ->This is just really spectacular.</v>

565
00:22:41.109 --> 00:22:43.862
<v ->Yes, I'm maybe thinking to come back</v>

566
00:22:43.862 --> 00:22:46.207
for a moment to the main map of the temple

567
00:22:46.207 --> 00:22:48.149
just to show where we are going.

568
00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:49.248
<v Jay>Alright.</v>

569
00:22:49.248 --> 00:22:50.368
<v ->Okay, very good, so,</v>

570
00:22:50.368 --> 00:22:51.680
<v Jay>So there's that,</v>
<v ->Before it was there,</v>

571
00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:52.928
you see?
<v Jay>Yep.</v>

572
00:22:52.928 --> 00:22:54.186
<v ->That one?
<v Jay>Yep.</v>

573
00:22:54.186 --> 00:22:57.664
<v ->We enter from the lady in Mozai,</v>

574
00:22:57.664 --> 00:22:58.922
they represent--
<v Jay>(mumbles) this way.</v>

575
00:22:58.922 --> 00:23:00.147
<v ->Yes.
<v Jay>Then to here,</v>

576
00:23:00.147 --> 00:23:01.267
<v ->and from that way,
<v Jay>Now they're here,</v>

577
00:23:01.267 --> 00:23:04.701
<v ->the ladies represent the tarot card, the star,</v>

578
00:23:04.701 --> 00:23:08.210
and from the secret passage we went to the Hall of Water.

579
00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:10.992
Now we're going just right there,

580
00:23:10.992 --> 00:23:12.593
you see where there is this column,

581
00:23:12.593 --> 00:23:15.047
we are going to the Hall of the Spheres, okay,

582
00:23:15.047 --> 00:23:16.613
we are going to (laughing).

583
00:23:16.613 --> 00:23:18.290
<v Jay>Now you can see the spheres and the enclaves.</v>

584
00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:19.488
<v ->All of the spheres.</v>

585
00:23:19.488 --> 00:23:23.345
Well, this is really, let's say, the console.

586
00:23:23.345 --> 00:23:26.683
It's the place where you are really in contact

587
00:23:26.683 --> 00:23:28.623
with all the synchronic lines.

588
00:23:28.623 --> 00:23:31.259
The sphere are, let's say,

589
00:23:31.259 --> 00:23:34.918
an instrument to connect to the synchronic lines.

590
00:23:34.918 --> 00:23:36.102
Why?

591
00:23:36.102 --> 00:23:37.862
Well, not only because through them you are

592
00:23:37.862 --> 00:23:39.503
connecting to the entire world,

593
00:23:39.503 --> 00:23:42.597
but what is passing through these synchronic lines.

594
00:23:42.597 --> 00:23:44.239
Well, we say energy.

595
00:23:44.239 --> 00:23:47.663
But we can go more precise, is what is also energy?

596
00:23:47.663 --> 00:23:49.241
Well, yes, energy's information.

597
00:23:49.241 --> 00:23:51.075
But it's also an information that can be translated

598
00:23:51.075 --> 00:23:52.802
as ideas.

599
00:23:52.802 --> 00:23:55.394
Dreams, thoughts.

600
00:23:55.394 --> 00:23:59.160
So, we might imagine that through the spheres

601
00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.819
it's possible to send thoughts, to send inspiration,

602
00:24:02.819 --> 00:24:04.301
to send dreams.

603
00:24:04.301 --> 00:24:07.714
Dreams, inspiration, thoughts, they might inspire

604
00:24:07.714 --> 00:24:10.786
people that are living in that area of the world

605
00:24:10.786 --> 00:24:12.909
nearby the synchronic lines.

606
00:24:12.909 --> 00:24:16.343
So from here you can really help the planet,

607
00:24:16.343 --> 00:24:18.583
help in many different situations,

608
00:24:18.583 --> 00:24:23.201
sending the right thoughts, the right intention

609
00:24:23.201 --> 00:24:27.308 line:15% 
to solve, to help, to reawake,

610
00:24:27.308 --> 00:24:29.483 line:15% 
not only for us,

611
00:24:30.923 --> 00:24:32.492 line:15% 
but for everyone.

612
00:24:32.492 --> 00:24:34.857 line:15% 
And, because the synchronic lines

613
00:24:34.857 --> 00:24:37.399
are the connection with all the rest,

614
00:24:37.399 --> 00:24:39.245
well we might imagine that the synchronic lines

615
00:24:39.245 --> 00:24:42.199
are also from where we are coming

616
00:24:42.199 --> 00:24:43.639
and from where we are going,

617
00:24:43.639 --> 00:24:44.866
through the re-incarnations,

618
00:24:44.866 --> 00:24:47.446
so the souls are leaving through the synchronic lines

619
00:24:47.446 --> 00:24:49.622
and they are coming back from the synchronic lines.

620
00:24:49.622 --> 00:24:51.841
And there is a rhythm of opening and closing

621
00:24:51.841 --> 00:24:53.942
of these lines that are

622
00:24:53.942 --> 00:24:56.406
the most important rituals of the year.

623
00:24:56.406 --> 00:24:58.561
Solstice and Equinox.

624
00:24:58.561 --> 00:25:00.842
Summer Solstice, 21 of June.

625
00:25:00.842 --> 00:25:03.339
Winter Solstice, 21 of December.

626
00:25:03.339 --> 00:25:05.898
Spring Equinox, 21 of March.

627
00:25:05.898 --> 00:25:08.479
Fall Equinox, 21 of September,

628
00:25:08.479 --> 00:25:12.224
so these are the rhythm of opening and closing

629
00:25:12.224 --> 00:25:13.483
of the synchronic lines.

630
00:25:13.483 --> 00:25:15.018
This solstice

631
00:25:15.018 --> 00:25:17.280
are the most important.

632
00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.785
And probably you can see the roof.

633
00:25:19.785 --> 00:25:21.300
The roof is pretty interesting,

634
00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:24.138
because the roof is all in gold.

635
00:25:24.138 --> 00:25:25.162
<v Jay>Really.</v>

636
00:25:25.162 --> 00:25:27.945
<v ->Real gold, they are leaf and leaf of gold.</v>

637
00:25:27.945 --> 00:25:29.908
Why, well because

638
00:25:29.908 --> 00:25:31.455
gold in this case

639
00:25:31.455 --> 00:25:35.453
has a function to isolate, to protect.

640
00:25:35.453 --> 00:25:38.035
Here there is really a lot of energy,

641
00:25:38.035 --> 00:25:40.094
there is more than nine spheres,

642
00:25:40.094 --> 00:25:43.593
so to isolate from the rest,

643
00:25:43.593 --> 00:25:45.837
<v Jay>To contain it.</v>
<v ->To contain</v>

644
00:25:45.837 --> 00:25:47.008
everything, well in this case,

645
00:25:47.008 --> 00:25:48.870
you need the gold.

646
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:51.713
<v Jay>And you're telling me that no artist did this floor,</v>

647
00:25:51.713 --> 00:25:52.907
that you guys did all this?

648
00:25:52.907 --> 00:25:54.113
<v Crotalo>We did everything.</v>

649
00:25:54.113 --> 00:25:55.115
<v Jay>And these paintings?</v>

650
00:25:55.115 --> 00:25:56.140
<v Crotalo>Every single--</v>

651
00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.061
<v Jay>Well you guys must be like</v>

652
00:25:57.061 --> 00:25:58.806
reincarnated Michael Angelos or something.

653
00:25:58.806 --> 00:26:00.461
<v ->Well, we are teaching</v>

654
00:26:00.461 --> 00:26:02.808
how to discover your inner artist,

655
00:26:02.808 --> 00:26:04.674
because we are all artists.

656
00:26:04.674 --> 00:26:07.053
But unfortunately we believe that just few people,

657
00:26:07.053 --> 00:26:09.750
or not me or "I didn't study, I can't."

658
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:12.194
Well, to give an example, when I just arrived

659
00:26:12.194 --> 00:26:14.114
to Damanhur I was 18 years old.

660
00:26:14.114 --> 00:26:16.994
Well, I started immediately to work in the Tiffany glass

661
00:26:16.994 --> 00:26:19.489
laboratory and I didn't have any,

662
00:26:19.489 --> 00:26:21.612
zero experience.

663
00:26:21.612 --> 00:26:23.607
And then I started, because I was a young

664
00:26:23.607 --> 00:26:26.230
Damanhurians, to work in this huge

665
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:28.449
pieces of Tiffany glass.

666
00:26:28.449 --> 00:26:31.393
And I was cutting the glass, I was assembling the glass,

667
00:26:31.393 --> 00:26:32.609
I was plumbing the glass.

668
00:26:32.609 --> 00:26:34.155
Every single part, and I did

669
00:26:34.155 --> 00:26:35.901
a lot of these pieces and you know what?

670
00:26:35.901 --> 00:26:37.088
<v Jay>You became an expert.</v>

671
00:26:37.088 --> 00:26:38.539
<v ->I didn't know for what it was.</v>

672
00:26:38.539 --> 00:26:41.120
I didn't know if it was for us, for other people.

673
00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.914
And then, when six months later,

674
00:26:43.914 --> 00:26:47.060
I was introduced into the temple,

675
00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:48.521
I finally discovered

676
00:26:48.521 --> 00:26:50.037
<v Jay>What you were doing.</v>
<v ->what I did.</v>

677
00:26:50.037 --> 00:26:52.351
And I will share with you,

678
00:26:52.351 --> 00:26:54.314
when we're going to the pictures

679
00:26:54.314 --> 00:26:56.351
what I did or what part I did because

680
00:26:56.351 --> 00:26:58.836
it was astonishing, but I did it,

681
00:26:58.836 --> 00:27:00.510
I was 19 years old,

682
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:02.409
with no experience.

683
00:27:02.409 --> 00:27:03.689
So everybody can do it.

684
00:27:03.689 --> 00:27:05.172
And we did everything.

685
00:27:05.172 --> 00:27:07.550
Painting, mosaic, clay,

686
00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.227
Tiffany glass,

687
00:27:10.227 --> 00:27:13.545
or other techniques about glass.

688
00:27:13.545 --> 00:27:15.379
So everything done from us.

689
00:27:15.379 --> 00:27:16.222
<v Jay>Nice.</v>

690
00:27:16.222 --> 00:27:17.437
<v ->And the temple was</v>

691
00:27:17.437 --> 00:27:18.866
the reason.

692
00:27:18.866 --> 00:27:20.083
It was pushing us, then,

693
00:27:20.083 --> 00:27:22.643
to cross the limit.

694
00:27:22.643 --> 00:27:25.661
The temple was always the instrument

695
00:27:25.661 --> 00:27:29.063
to cross one limit, to go over what you think

696
00:27:29.063 --> 00:27:30.184
is possible.

697
00:27:30.184 --> 00:27:31.857
Because if you think about it,

698
00:27:31.857 --> 00:27:35.677
the temple is the temple of the impossible possible.

699
00:27:35.677 --> 00:27:38.258
And if we did it in Italy with no money,

700
00:27:38.258 --> 00:27:40.242
with no support, by our hands,

701
00:27:40.242 --> 00:27:42.759
I mean, everybody can do it even better,

702
00:27:42.759 --> 00:27:43.964
all over the planet.

703
00:27:43.964 --> 00:27:45.564
<v Jay>Very inspirational.</v>

704
00:27:45.564 --> 00:27:47.566
<v ->We are in the (mumbles) so,</v>

705
00:27:47.566 --> 00:27:50.627
we was over there in the whole sphere,

706
00:27:50.627 --> 00:27:53.123
and now we're going in the big one.

707
00:27:53.123 --> 00:27:54.702
<v Jay>Okay, let's see the big one, that looks</v>

708
00:27:54.702 --> 00:27:56.088
really interesting.

709
00:27:57.408 --> 00:27:58.775
<v Crotalo>Yes, this is a really--</v>

710
00:27:58.775 --> 00:27:59.896
<v Jay>Go through the gate,</v>

711
00:27:59.896 --> 00:28:01.836
hey!
<v Crotalo>There we go.</v>

712
00:28:01.836 --> 00:28:03.309
<v Jay>Hee-oh-wow.</v>

713
00:28:03.309 --> 00:28:05.794
<v Crotalo>Well the mirror, they might</v>

714
00:28:05.794 --> 00:28:08.986
play a little bit in this picture.

715
00:28:08.986 --> 00:28:10.480
This is called The Hall of the Mirror,

716
00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.144
it's the largest one.

717
00:28:13.554 --> 00:28:17.893
It's definitely the chambers that we are using also

718
00:28:17.893 --> 00:28:22.287
more when we are inviting people to have experience

719
00:28:22.287 --> 00:28:23.930
that are not just

720
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:27.108
a pilgrimage a few hours,

721
00:28:27.108 --> 00:28:30.351
that there is also the possibility to slip into the temple,

722
00:28:30.351 --> 00:28:33.273
to do some seminars inside of the temple.

723
00:28:33.273 --> 00:28:34.927
And this is the right place to do it.

724
00:28:34.927 --> 00:28:36.025
<v Jay>Well that is</v>

725
00:28:36.025 --> 00:28:37.390
really amazing.
<v Crotalo>And look at that.</v>

726
00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:41.166
That is also in the Guinness Records,

727
00:28:41.166 --> 00:28:46.051
because it's the largest Tiffany glass dome in the world.

728
00:28:46.051 --> 00:28:48.450
It's only the Tiffany glass dome,

729
00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:50.627
it's 120 square meters.

730
00:28:50.627 --> 00:28:54.413
It's more than 24,000 pieces of Tiffany glass.

731
00:28:54.413 --> 00:28:56.131
<v Jay>Just so you understand that, people,</v>

732
00:28:56.131 --> 00:28:59.106
that's one fifth larger than a football field.

733
00:28:59.106 --> 00:29:02.232
<v Crotalo>So, to give an idea,</v>

734
00:29:02.232 --> 00:29:05.612
well, I did 20% of that.

735
00:29:05.612 --> 00:29:07.543
This is what I was working for six months,

736
00:29:07.543 --> 00:29:09.569
and I didn't know for what it was.

737
00:29:09.569 --> 00:29:12.225
Can you imagine, when then I was introduced,

738
00:29:12.225 --> 00:29:14.465
well Falco introduced me for the first time in the temple.

739
00:29:14.465 --> 00:29:16.151
<v Jay>You must have been</v>
<v ->They brought me in that</v>

740
00:29:16.151 --> 00:29:17.451
<v Jay>very proud of yourself.</v>

741
00:29:17.451 --> 00:29:19.125
chamber that was just finished,

742
00:29:19.125 --> 00:29:21.942
and I look up and I see all the pieces that I was

743
00:29:21.942 --> 00:29:23.702
putting together, it was,

744
00:29:25.882 --> 00:29:27.713
one of the moments that you never forget in your life.

745
00:29:27.713 --> 00:29:30.198
It will be some of the frame

746
00:29:30.198 --> 00:29:33.078
that will keep with you in your soul.

747
00:29:33.078 --> 00:29:36.512
So, that is also representing

748
00:29:38.022 --> 00:29:40.160
a page of the book.

749
00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.018
That means that all these form,

750
00:29:43.018 --> 00:29:44.725
all the symbols

751
00:29:44.725 --> 00:29:47.465
are based on this archetype languages,

752
00:29:47.465 --> 00:29:49.183
so it's talking to you.

753
00:29:49.183 --> 00:29:50.579
It's telling you something.

754
00:29:50.579 --> 00:29:53.663
Also the different colors, the different element,

755
00:29:53.663 --> 00:29:55.604
are part of these,

756
00:29:55.604 --> 00:29:58.441
of the energy inside of the chamber.

757
00:29:58.441 --> 00:30:00.904
So everything, every step--

758
00:30:00.904 --> 00:30:02.804
<v Jay>The lines here are phi ratio,</v>

759
00:30:02.804 --> 00:30:05.224
right here in the flower.
<v ->Yes, you can measure that.</v>

760
00:30:06.514 --> 00:30:07.513
<v Jay>Very nice.</v>

761
00:30:07.513 --> 00:30:09.999
<v ->And I have to remind you, the light that you see,</v>

762
00:30:09.999 --> 00:30:11.406
<v ->Yeah, where's that coming from?</v>

763
00:30:11.406 --> 00:30:12.686
<v ->is not coming from outside.</v>

764
00:30:12.686 --> 00:30:14.137
We are underground.

765
00:30:14.137 --> 00:30:16.239
So all the light is artificial.

766
00:30:17.779 --> 00:30:18.734
All artificial.

767
00:30:18.734 --> 00:30:20.932
Even if it doesn't look that you are underground,

768
00:30:20.932 --> 00:30:23.693
but everything is underground.

769
00:30:23.693 --> 00:30:25.506
So the light is not coming from outside,

770
00:30:25.506 --> 00:30:27.331
it's coming from artificial light.

771
00:30:27.331 --> 00:30:29.891
<v ->Have you spend days in the temple?</v>

772
00:30:31.101 --> 00:30:33.655
<v ->Well, to say days and days,</v>

773
00:30:33.655 --> 00:30:35.395
well it depends.

774
00:30:35.395 --> 00:30:38.040
It's not really a place where you're going to stay days.

775
00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.503
But, to stay for example, overnight,

776
00:30:40.503 --> 00:30:42.722
yes that's for sure.

777
00:30:42.722 --> 00:30:44.354
And also we are inviting people to have

778
00:30:44.354 --> 00:30:45.399
the same experience,

779
00:30:45.399 --> 00:30:47.458
because the dreams here are completely different,

780
00:30:47.458 --> 00:30:48.599
<v Jay>I'm sure.</v>

781
00:30:48.599 --> 00:30:50.769
<v ->or teaching astral travel and do astral traveling</v>

782
00:30:50.769 --> 00:30:53.409
inside of the temple, well, that is something.

783
00:30:53.409 --> 00:30:54.668
<v Jay>What's this chamber again?</v>

784
00:30:54.668 --> 00:30:56.379
<v Crotalo>This is still the Hall of Mirrors.</v>

785
00:30:56.379 --> 00:30:57.472
<v Jay>Hall of Mirrors, that's right.</v>

786
00:30:57.472 --> 00:30:58.768
<v Jay>Because it's so tall,</v>

787
00:30:58.768 --> 00:31:02.277
there is a terrace all around the chamber,

788
00:31:02.277 --> 00:31:05.380
and there is a beautiful mosaic

789
00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.460
on the walls.

790
00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:09.603
<v Jay>Those are dolphins there?</v>

791
00:31:09.603 --> 00:31:11.599
<v Crotalo>Yes, there is other symbology</v>

792
00:31:11.599 --> 00:31:14.095
connecting to male parts, to female parts,

793
00:31:14.095 --> 00:31:15.534
to ancient traditions,

794
00:31:15.534 --> 00:31:19.662
so there is the falcon that represent Horus.

795
00:31:19.662 --> 00:31:23.203
Well, Horus is not only the divine force connecting to

796
00:31:23.203 --> 00:31:24.238
the Egyptian.

797
00:31:24.238 --> 00:31:26.456
But for us, Horus is also

798
00:31:26.456 --> 00:31:29.838
an important force that is connecting to

799
00:31:29.838 --> 00:31:32.653
a period of time that is pre-Atlantian.

800
00:31:32.653 --> 00:31:35.277
Well we talk about Atlantis many times,

801
00:31:35.277 --> 00:31:37.794
well, Horus was already there in that time.

802
00:31:37.794 --> 00:31:41.121
And also, to an important part

803
00:31:41.121 --> 00:31:43.661
that is what we call the triad,

804
00:31:43.661 --> 00:31:46.935
that if you want is the idea, or the operation

805
00:31:46.935 --> 00:31:49.932
to bring together all the divine forces

806
00:31:49.932 --> 00:31:52.033
from these last 22,000 years,

807
00:31:52.033 --> 00:31:53.857
from all over the planet,

808
00:31:53.857 --> 00:31:57.014
and bring them let's say, in the same direction,

809
00:31:57.014 --> 00:31:59.596
in the same harmonious direction to support

810
00:31:59.596 --> 00:32:01.516
the growth of the human kind.

811
00:32:01.516 --> 00:32:02.774
Yes, I'm sorry, it's just--

812
00:32:02.774 --> 00:32:05.099
<v Jay>Those falcons there, they represent Horus, then.</v>

813
00:32:05.099 --> 00:32:07.393
<v ->In this case, yes, they represent Horus.</v>

814
00:32:08.633 --> 00:32:11.744
And as you know, Horus is the protector of the human kind,

815
00:32:11.744 --> 00:32:14.464
is the one that brings knowledge to the human kind,

816
00:32:14.464 --> 00:32:17.205
so I have a lot of very important symbology.

817
00:32:17.205 --> 00:32:18.602
<v Jay>Very much so.</v>

818
00:32:19.722 --> 00:32:20.608
<v ->Let's go for the next one.</v>

819
00:32:20.608 --> 00:32:21.685
<v Jay>See the next one.</v>

820
00:32:21.685 --> 00:32:22.602
Woah.

821
00:32:22.602 --> 00:32:23.765
<v Crotalo>Details.</v>

822
00:32:23.765 --> 00:32:26.249
Details still of this chamber,

823
00:32:26.249 --> 00:32:28.245
well, we can really spend

824
00:32:29.535 --> 00:32:31.956
many, many hours to see all the different

825
00:32:31.956 --> 00:32:33.354
meanings about that.

826
00:32:33.354 --> 00:32:35.977
We see again sphere, also the different colors

827
00:32:35.977 --> 00:32:37.012
of the sphere.

828
00:32:37.012 --> 00:32:39.135
They represent the different connection

829
00:32:39.135 --> 00:32:40.979
with the synchronic lines.

830
00:32:40.979 --> 00:32:43.699
And if we go to the next one,

831
00:32:45.199 --> 00:32:46.601
we are going to see also

832
00:32:46.601 --> 00:32:49.417
something that happens during the visit,

833
00:32:49.417 --> 00:32:52.755
so it's possible to do different kind of meditation.

834
00:32:52.755 --> 00:32:57.661
Also to use the sacred language as dance,

835
00:32:57.661 --> 00:33:00.403
a sacred dance, not because you have to do

836
00:33:00.403 --> 00:33:04.040
beautiful movement, but because the movement,

837
00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:07.378
it's another way to communicate inside,

838
00:33:07.378 --> 00:33:10.162
outside to other dimension, to other beings,

839
00:33:10.162 --> 00:33:12.519
and these are experience that we are sharing

840
00:33:12.519 --> 00:33:14.834
with guests that are coming from all over the world

841
00:33:14.834 --> 00:33:18.396
as I told you, because there's no many places like this one.

842
00:33:18.396 --> 00:33:20.422
<v ->I would say you're right about that.</v>

843
00:33:20.422 --> 00:33:22.756
(laughing)

844
00:33:22.756 --> 00:33:23.782
Goodness.

845
00:33:23.782 --> 00:33:26.652
<v Crotalo>And some of these position of the body,</v>

846
00:33:26.652 --> 00:33:28.710
this sacred dance are also represent

847
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:32.593
on the roof of another chamber.

848
00:33:32.593 --> 00:33:37.040
In the next picture we are going now to

849
00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.320
the Hall of Metals.

850
00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.466
On the walls the paintings are completely changed,

851
00:33:41.466 --> 00:33:45.584
because also the temple is changing, constantly.

852
00:33:45.584 --> 00:33:49.637
Because every time that we are creating new space,

853
00:33:49.637 --> 00:33:51.802
or we are modifying something,

854
00:33:51.802 --> 00:33:53.839
this is affecting the entire structure.

855
00:33:53.839 --> 00:33:56.740
So in terms of art, in terms of symbology,

856
00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:59.801
there is a constant update, let's say.

857
00:33:59.801 --> 00:34:01.625
This the reason why people,

858
00:34:01.625 --> 00:34:03.876
they love to come back often to Damanhur,

859
00:34:03.876 --> 00:34:05.198
not just for one time.

860
00:34:05.198 --> 00:34:07.417
Because, Damanhur looks always in movement.

861
00:34:07.417 --> 00:34:08.558
<v Jay>Evolving.</v>

862
00:34:08.558 --> 00:34:11.064
<v Crotalo>Everything is evolving and transforming.</v>

863
00:34:11.064 --> 00:34:13.763
So, this place in particular,

864
00:34:13.763 --> 00:34:16.398
is dedicated to the beyond.

865
00:34:17.908 --> 00:34:22.221
Every month, connecting to the different moon phase,

866
00:34:22.221 --> 00:34:25.784
there are moments, celebration that are really

867
00:34:25.784 --> 00:34:29.240
the connection with the beyond, with the visible,

868
00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:32.705
with who is in the other side, also.

869
00:34:32.705 --> 00:34:35.661
So, this is really dedicated to

870
00:34:37.101 --> 00:34:41.260
the beyond, to the different age of the humankind.

871
00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:45.025
The different windows that you see.

872
00:34:45.025 --> 00:34:46.903
This is one of the meditation,

873
00:34:46.903 --> 00:34:49.324
one of the guided meditation that we are offering

874
00:34:49.324 --> 00:34:50.368
for the guest.

875
00:34:50.368 --> 00:34:52.641
Well, there are eight of them,

876
00:34:52.641 --> 00:34:55.062
and they represent the different age

877
00:34:55.062 --> 00:34:57.547
that we are crossing during our life.

878
00:34:57.547 --> 00:35:01.003
From zero to eight, from eight to 16,

879
00:35:01.003 --> 00:35:03.126
from 16 to 24,

880
00:35:03.126 --> 00:35:07.861
so they represent the different, let's say,

881
00:35:07.861 --> 00:35:10.986
personality, the different part,

882
00:35:10.986 --> 00:35:13.344
that in different age they are manifesting.

883
00:35:13.344 --> 00:35:15.285
Because we are not all the same, we are also

884
00:35:15.285 --> 00:35:16.607
constantly changing.

885
00:35:16.607 --> 00:35:18.559
<v Jay>So like the eight folded path of--</v>

886
00:35:18.559 --> 00:35:21.066
<v ->Sort of, if you want.</v>

887
00:35:21.066 --> 00:35:24.926
Well, we are going just down there,

888
00:35:24.926 --> 00:35:26.623
where you see that white column.

889
00:35:26.623 --> 00:35:28.319
<v Jay>Right here.</v>

890
00:35:28.319 --> 00:35:29.343
<v Crotalo>Yes,</v>

891
00:35:29.343 --> 00:35:32.425
we are going to the Hall of the Earth.

892
00:35:32.425 --> 00:35:34.782
This is the deepest one.

893
00:35:34.782 --> 00:35:38.398
We are more than 45 meters below

894
00:35:39.698 --> 00:35:41.246
the level of the sea

895
00:35:41.246 --> 00:35:43.912
and this is another very, very,

896
00:35:43.912 --> 00:35:45.768
well, they are all special, I'm sorry.

897
00:35:45.768 --> 00:35:46.909
<v Jay>Yeah, they are.</v>

898
00:35:46.909 --> 00:35:48.488
<v Crotalo>And sometimes it's mind blowing because--</v>

899
00:35:48.488 --> 00:35:50.135
<v Jay>That's spectacular.</v>

900
00:35:50.135 --> 00:35:53.618
<v Crotalo>Being there, believe me, it's really something.</v>

901
00:35:53.618 --> 00:35:55.336
<v Jay>I'm sure,</v>
<v Crotalo>If you are touched</v>

902
00:35:55.336 --> 00:35:56.552
<v Jay>I will be there.</v>

903
00:35:56.552 --> 00:35:58.236
I'm coming for sure.

904
00:35:58.236 --> 00:35:59.537
<v Jay>Yes, absolutely.</v>

905
00:35:59.537 --> 00:36:01.330
And if you're touched from the picture,

906
00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:03.474
believe me, being there it's really,

907
00:36:03.474 --> 00:36:05.297
be in another world.

908
00:36:05.297 --> 00:36:07.537
This is the Hall of the Earth.

909
00:36:07.537 --> 00:36:11.708
This is a double chamber that represents

910
00:36:11.708 --> 00:36:14.033
the symbol of the infinity.

911
00:36:15.383 --> 00:36:18.257
This is the first one with this eight wide column

912
00:36:18.257 --> 00:36:20.081
that are holding

913
00:36:21.551 --> 00:36:24.038
the entire roof,

914
00:36:24.038 --> 00:36:29.038
that is painted and is describing prayer

915
00:36:29.136 --> 00:36:31.739
repeated 66 times.

916
00:36:31.739 --> 00:36:34.501
All this painting, they represent

917
00:36:34.501 --> 00:36:36.336
the history of the humankind

918
00:36:36.336 --> 00:36:38.404
with a different part and also,

919
00:36:38.404 --> 00:36:40.336
let's say the battle between

920
00:36:41.826 --> 00:36:44.047
the enemy and humankind.

921
00:36:44.047 --> 00:36:46.501
Between the dark and the light.

922
00:36:47.701 --> 00:36:49.871
With many different element that are part

923
00:36:49.871 --> 00:36:52.036
of our spiritual research.

924
00:36:52.036 --> 00:36:55.129
The next one, this is one of the door,

925
00:36:55.129 --> 00:36:58.873
one of the entrance of the Hall of the Earth,

926
00:36:58.873 --> 00:37:02.873
and this was the first work with Tiffany glass.

927
00:37:02.873 --> 00:37:05.870
Was really the beginning of the beginning.

928
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:07.929
And this door represent the Sun.

929
00:37:07.929 --> 00:37:10.872
There is one, there is one entrance

930
00:37:10.872 --> 00:37:12.792
that represent the Sun, and another one,

931
00:37:12.792 --> 00:37:15.076
specular on the other side represent the moon.

932
00:37:16.166 --> 00:37:16.773
<v Jay>The moon?</v>

933
00:37:16.773 --> 00:37:18.166
<v ->It's easy to understand that this is the moon,</v>

934
00:37:18.166 --> 00:37:19.276
colors are changing.

935
00:37:19.276 --> 00:37:20.276
(gasping)

936
00:37:21.836 --> 00:37:23.717
<v Jay>Well that is just amazing.</v>

937
00:37:23.717 --> 00:37:28.217
<v ->The roof has the center in Tiffany glass,</v>

938
00:37:28.217 --> 00:37:32.996
but all the rest is this prayer in ancient language

939
00:37:32.996 --> 00:37:35.897
repeated 66 times, and it was an amazing work

940
00:37:35.897 --> 00:37:39.001
because the picture, they was working,

941
00:37:39.001 --> 00:37:41.151
lay down.
<v Jay>Well just like Michael</v>

942
00:37:41.151 --> 00:37:41.911
Angelo.
(laughing)

943
00:37:42.941 --> 00:37:44.278
<v ->Something like that,</v>

944
00:37:44.278 --> 00:37:45.811
something like that.

945
00:37:45.811 --> 00:37:49.118
It was really an incredible work for the time,

946
00:37:49.118 --> 00:37:51.844
and also, well you have to imagine that Damanhur,

947
00:37:51.854 --> 00:37:53.885
we was not very rich,

948
00:37:53.885 --> 00:37:55.107
or we was not rich at all.

949
00:37:55.107 --> 00:37:56.750
<v Jay>Looks like you got a lot of money to me.</v>

950
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:59.280
<v ->And all our effort was for the temple,</v>

951
00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:02.004
'cause the temple is one of the most precious part,

952
00:38:02.004 --> 00:38:03.978
or one of the most precious part.

953
00:38:03.978 --> 00:38:06.395
From there there is a little stair,

954
00:38:06.395 --> 00:38:08.134
that bring us to the other room.

955
00:38:08.934 --> 00:38:09.434
Let's go.

956
00:38:09.434 --> 00:38:10.654
Oh.
<v Jay>Oh my God.</v>

957
00:38:10.654 --> 00:38:11.328
<v ->You see?</v>

958
00:38:11.328 --> 00:38:12.632
The little stair, we went from that side,

959
00:38:12.632 --> 00:38:13.632
<v Jay>I see, I see, right.</v>

960
00:38:13.632 --> 00:38:15.827
and we are--
<v Jay>And what's this one</v>

961
00:38:15.827 --> 00:38:16.665
called?

962
00:38:16.665 --> 00:38:19.236
<v Crotalo>Well, this is still the Hall of the Earth,</v>

963
00:38:19.236 --> 00:38:20.597
so all of them,

964
00:38:21.837 --> 00:38:23.224
it's about it.

965
00:38:23.224 --> 00:38:26.157
And what is really interesting here,

966
00:38:26.157 --> 00:38:29.079
well on the wall we are representing

967
00:38:29.079 --> 00:38:30.924
many different animals.

968
00:38:32.814 --> 00:38:34.263
Many different animals and unfortunately

969
00:38:34.263 --> 00:38:36.119
they are on the risk to disappeared.

970
00:38:36.119 --> 00:38:38.806
You know that we have animal and plants name,

971
00:38:38.806 --> 00:38:41.601
and for us, these are spiritual names,

972
00:38:41.601 --> 00:38:44.758
so they are a deep connection with these spiritual animals.

973
00:38:44.758 --> 00:38:47.158
So we are always very aware to be,

974
00:38:48.638 --> 00:38:51.904
to support to protect the nature and environment.

975
00:38:51.904 --> 00:38:53.824
And in this one,

976
00:38:53.824 --> 00:38:55.126
<v Jay>Is this the constellations?</v>

977
00:38:55.126 --> 00:38:55.968
<v Crotalo>Yes.</v>

978
00:38:55.968 --> 00:38:57.333
What is described here,

979
00:38:57.333 --> 00:39:00.427
on these little light dot

980
00:39:00.427 --> 00:39:03.210
is the sky,

981
00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.420
seen from the planet Earth,

982
00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.301
about 22,000 years ago.

983
00:39:09.301 --> 00:39:12.703
So he's representing the sky of 22,000 years ago.

984
00:39:12.703 --> 00:39:14.143
<v Jay>Why did you pick 22,000?</v>

985
00:39:14.143 --> 00:39:18.591
<v ->Because as far as the ancient history of humankind,</v>

986
00:39:18.591 --> 00:39:20.511
that is an important date,

987
00:39:20.511 --> 00:39:22.889
connecting to civilization like Atlantis,

988
00:39:22.889 --> 00:39:26.174
but also connecting to a moment, a age

989
00:39:26.174 --> 00:39:29.918
where the planet Earth was connected really to everything.

990
00:39:31.038 --> 00:39:33.321
Not only here but also out there.

991
00:39:33.321 --> 00:39:34.845
<v ->Synchronic lines going everywhere.</v>

992
00:39:34.845 --> 00:39:37.459
<v ->Let's go to the labyrinth.</v>

993
00:39:37.459 --> 00:39:38.856
(laughing)

994
00:39:38.856 --> 00:39:40.243
This is an amazing place.

995
00:39:40.243 --> 00:39:43.219
It's a Labyrinth, it's based on

996
00:39:44.769 --> 00:39:46.269
four different, well,

997
00:39:46.269 --> 00:39:48.349
I say four now, but you can imagine

998
00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:51.634
that we are still creating new part of the temple.

999
00:39:52.904 --> 00:39:54.397
The statue at the corner

1000
00:39:54.397 --> 00:39:56.039
are all specular,

1001
00:39:56.039 --> 00:39:58.780
because like in a labyrinth, you don't know where you are.

1002
00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:01.660
And the labyrinth represent the labyrinth inside,

1003
00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:04.156
the labyrinth that will get to discover

1004
00:40:04.156 --> 00:40:07.064
your talent, your meaning.

1005
00:40:07.064 --> 00:40:10.275
And in all the different windows

1006
00:40:10.275 --> 00:40:12.611
that probably you can see,

1007
00:40:12.611 --> 00:40:14.574
and maybe in the next one, okay.

1008
00:40:14.574 --> 00:40:16.994
This is one of the many different windows.

1009
00:40:16.994 --> 00:40:19.629
They are representing the different divine forces,

1010
00:40:19.629 --> 00:40:21.250
connecting to the humankind,

1011
00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:23.970
or artists from other civilizations.

1012
00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:26.690
So like to honor and represent

1013
00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:30.946
and integrate all the different divine forces.

1014
00:40:30.946 --> 00:40:34.530
It's a pretty, pretty complex work.

1015
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:38.102
Let's go for the next one.

1016
00:40:38.102 --> 00:40:39.340
<v Jay>Okay, so we're over--</v>

1017
00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.662
<v Crotalo>Well, it was over there.</v>

1018
00:40:40.662 --> 00:40:42.454
So, we almost catch everything,

1019
00:40:42.454 --> 00:40:44.214
but there is still some pictures

1020
00:40:44.214 --> 00:40:47.617
about what we call selphica.

1021
00:40:47.617 --> 00:40:48.939
<v Jay>Yeah, let's talk about that.</v>

1022
00:40:48.939 --> 00:40:50.241
<v ->You see over there, there is this</v>

1023
00:40:50.241 --> 00:40:52.235
sort of uh--
<v Jay>What is that?</v>

1024
00:40:53.615 --> 00:40:54.507
<v ->Oh, here we go.</v>

1025
00:40:54.507 --> 00:40:56.864
Well, selphica will probably be our next topic,

1026
00:40:56.864 --> 00:40:59.819
and selphica come from an ancient names

1027
00:40:59.819 --> 00:41:01.600
that means spiral.

1028
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:05.279
And there's nothing new, it's an ancient knowledge

1029
00:41:05.279 --> 00:41:07.327
that combine the sacred geometry

1030
00:41:07.327 --> 00:41:11.519
with different materials like copper or gold

1031
00:41:11.519 --> 00:41:15.082
or silver or stones or crystals or liquids,

1032
00:41:15.082 --> 00:41:17.546
to do what, to create a sort of instrument

1033
00:41:17.546 --> 00:41:20.063
able to catalyze the vital energy,

1034
00:41:20.063 --> 00:41:21.641
transform it and then donate it

1035
00:41:21.641 --> 00:41:25.321
for many different function.

1036
00:41:25.321 --> 00:41:26.942
But what the people they don't know

1037
00:41:26.942 --> 00:41:28.745
is that the largest selphica in the world

1038
00:41:28.745 --> 00:41:30.259
is the temple.

1039
00:41:30.259 --> 00:41:32.201
So inside of the temple there are

1040
00:41:32.201 --> 00:41:34.345
miles and miles of different

1041
00:41:34.345 --> 00:41:37.864
metal circuits that inside of

1042
00:41:40.124 --> 00:41:43.208
floors, roof, walls,

1043
00:41:43.208 --> 00:41:46.706
are creating a sort of huge antennae.

1044
00:41:46.706 --> 00:41:48.988
So the temple is an antennae, it's like a selphic antennae,

1045
00:41:48.988 --> 00:41:51.730
able to give signal and receive signal.

1046
00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:54.482
So we are able, through the synchronic lines

1047
00:41:54.482 --> 00:41:57.863
through the temple to connect very refined energy.

1048
00:41:57.863 --> 00:42:00.882
Pure energy, pure information.

1049
00:42:00.882 --> 00:42:02.790
Attractor, mic-attractor,

1050
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:05.201
many technical names

1051
00:42:05.201 --> 00:42:08.284
to talk about something that bring us to do

1052
00:42:08.284 --> 00:42:10.630
some spiritual surgery.

1053
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:14.001
To shift of wrong information and the correct information,

1054
00:42:14.001 --> 00:42:17.968
to rejuvenate, to open doors to time,

1055
00:42:17.968 --> 00:42:20.080
dimension and spaces.

1056
00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.704
And many, many, many other things.

1057
00:42:22.704 --> 00:42:25.360
<v Jay>So let's do our next show on these,</v>

1058
00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.269
and we can, I wanna get deeper into this.

1059
00:42:27.269 --> 00:42:30.960
<v ->Yes, so if we come back to the first one.</v>

1060
00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:33.647
Here we go.

1061
00:42:33.647 --> 00:42:38.266
We have the example of one of these complex selphica,

1062
00:42:38.266 --> 00:42:42.170
well, selphicas are also my rings or some bracelet

1063
00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:43.694
or some necklace.

1064
00:42:43.694 --> 00:42:46.489
Well, all of them are able

1065
00:42:46.489 --> 00:42:49.326
to work on your aura.

1066
00:42:49.326 --> 00:42:53.252
So, when you bring them in contact with your body,

1067
00:42:53.252 --> 00:42:56.333
so they are starting to affect,

1068
00:42:56.333 --> 00:42:58.794
to help your aura

1069
00:42:58.794 --> 00:43:02.357
to a sort of frequency,

1070
00:43:02.357 --> 00:43:04.361
to a sort of energy.

1071
00:43:04.361 --> 00:43:06.612
So you are changing your frequency

1072
00:43:06.612 --> 00:43:09.119
instead of the frequency of the selphica.

1073
00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:11.401
And this is a very simple explanation.

1074
00:43:11.401 --> 00:43:14.175
When you are in a temple, when you are in this cabin,

1075
00:43:14.175 --> 00:43:17.682
so you have structure of selphica

1076
00:43:17.682 --> 00:43:22.439
that are able, really, to brought information that are,

1077
00:43:22.439 --> 00:43:25.151
when I say pure information, it's like to imagine

1078
00:43:25.151 --> 00:43:28.244
from where we're coming, from where the soul is coming.

1079
00:43:28.244 --> 00:43:32.244
And many times when there are issues

1080
00:43:32.244 --> 00:43:34.249
or situation because we're also using that

1081
00:43:34.249 --> 00:43:36.564
for healing reason, I have to tell you,

1082
00:43:36.564 --> 00:43:39.508
many people are going now to visit Damanhur

1083
00:43:39.508 --> 00:43:41.587
also for health reasons.

1084
00:43:41.587 --> 00:43:45.982
Not only because we are using natural medicine,

1085
00:43:45.982 --> 00:43:48.542
but because what we are doing in the temple,

1086
00:43:48.542 --> 00:43:50.782
is something absolutely unique.

1087
00:43:50.782 --> 00:43:52.605
And it's something that is really

1088
00:43:52.605 --> 00:43:54.770
connecting to the fact

1089
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:58.749
that the temple represent also

1090
00:43:58.749 --> 00:44:00.584
a possible future.

1091
00:44:00.584 --> 00:44:04.146
And the selphica, it might also represent

1092
00:44:04.146 --> 00:44:06.087
a possible technology.

1093
00:44:06.087 --> 00:44:07.804
Well, here, the border between knowledge,

1094
00:44:07.804 --> 00:44:09.042
technology, magic,

1095
00:44:09.042 --> 00:44:11.404
looks like--
<v Jay>Getting blurred there.</v>

1096
00:44:11.404 --> 00:44:12.837
<v ->Very, very thin.</v>

1097
00:44:12.837 --> 00:44:14.875
So selphica is at the same time

1098
00:44:14.875 --> 00:44:17.594
an ancient knowledge, because here, there is a lot

1099
00:44:17.594 --> 00:44:20.090
of museum in the United States about Native American,

1100
00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:23.034
and you can see many selphica instruments, for example,

1101
00:44:23.034 --> 00:44:24.154
in their museum.

1102
00:44:24.154 --> 00:44:25.829
Or if you go to the north of Europe,

1103
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:27.876
to the pre-viking civilization,

1104
00:44:27.876 --> 00:44:30.148
in their museum in Copenhagen, you see them.

1105
00:44:30.148 --> 00:44:32.612
Or if you go in Egypt, the Cairo museum

1106
00:44:32.612 --> 00:44:36.355
or in the Turin Egyptian museum, nearby Damanhur,

1107
00:44:36.355 --> 00:44:38.574 line:15% 
you see a lot of this selphica.

1108
00:44:38.574 --> 00:44:40.953 line:15% 
But at the same times if you go into Mexico City,

1109
00:44:40.953 --> 00:44:43.289 line:15% 
and you go in their incredible museum,

1110
00:44:43.289 --> 00:44:47.513 line:15% 
about old Meso-American civilization,

1111
00:44:47.513 --> 00:44:49.774
there's a lot of many different selphicas.

1112
00:44:49.774 --> 00:44:51.992
<v ->Alright, let's get back to these on our next show.</v>

1113
00:44:51.992 --> 00:44:53.390
We've just--
<v Crotalo>Absolutely.</v>

1114
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:55.469
<v ->Thank you for coming, Crotalo.</v>

1115
00:44:55.469 --> 00:44:56.429
<v Crotalo>Thank you, Jay.</v>

1116
00:44:56.429 --> 00:44:57.667
<v ->And I'm Jay Weidner,</v>

1117
00:44:57.667 --> 00:44:59.331
and we just did a tour of Damanhur.

1118
00:44:59.331 --> 00:45:01.044
Where else are you gonna find this kinda stuff,

1119
00:45:01.044 --> 00:45:02.900
but Gaiam TV, I ask you?

1120
00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.041

1121
00:45:04.041 --> 00:45:05.065
<v ->Thank you Jay, for the next time.</v>

1123
00:45:08.319 --> 00:45:11.512
(spacious atmospheric music)
