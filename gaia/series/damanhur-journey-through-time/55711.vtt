00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.520 align:middle line:10%
Hi, I'm Jay Weidner, back
with Crotalo Excessivo,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.520 align:middle line:10%
ambassador from Damanhur.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.230 align:middle line:84%
We've been talking about
the lost city of Atlantis.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.680 align:middle line:84%
To review, the
leader of Damanhur

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.460 align:middle line:84%
and his companion, a painter
travel to Atlantis via portal

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.390 align:middle line:90%
in Italy.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.110 align:middle line:84%
They spent three nights
and three days in Atlantis.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.590 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't bring
anything with them.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.820 align:middle line:84%
So they returned with
stories of magical place

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.210 align:middle line:84%
and quickly painted
what they saw.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.960 align:middle line:84%
When we last spoke,
we were talking

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.860 align:middle line:90%
about the location of Atlantis.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Now there is evidence that
reportedly backs up your claim.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.830 align:middle line:84%
An underwater period of
the coast of the Azores

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:44.930 align:middle line:90%
has been discovered.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there is evidence
about Atlantis.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.840 align:middle line:10%
And it's pretty cool in
these moments in times.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.460 align:middle line:10%
Well actually, the new, it's
coming from September, 2013.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Where just nearby the
Azor, they found out

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.510 align:middle line:84%
that there are three pyramids
aligned with the pyramids

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.440 align:middle line:90%
of Giza in Egypt.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And with the pyramid in
Chichen Itza in Mexico.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like the
evidence of something

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.860 align:middle line:84%
that is really, really big
and huge under the water.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.420 align:middle line:84%
So , it is probably
the first evidence

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.240 align:middle line:90%
that Atlantis is coming back.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Well it was prophesied
to come back to this time

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.660 align:middle line:84%
and maybe that's
what's going on.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.330 align:middle line:84%
But I can't remember exactly
what the next image, but let's

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.650 align:middle line:90%
look at it.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.300 align:middle line:90%
Oh Yeah, right.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.010 align:middle line:84%
This is the line between
Cuba and Spain and Portugal.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Yes, exactly and
maybe in the next one

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.910 align:middle line:84%
we can see some little
green dot inside of all this

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.410 align:middle line:84%
let's say the shape of
island are the Azor.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.530 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.060 align:middle line:84%
You see the little tiny green
dots, well this are Azor.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.980 align:middle line:84%
So where they found under the
water these three pyramids.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis was really
a huge island.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.710 align:middle line:84%
It was more or less one third
of what it is called Europe now.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.830 align:middle line:84%
So if some little
part survived, well we

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.360 align:middle line:84%
are talking about a disaster
that was happening around

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.790 align:middle line:90%
10,000 to 12,000 years ago.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.060 align:middle line:84%
So these are like the
tops of the mountains.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.200 align:middle line:90%
Something like that.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Something that is like to
imagine the Alps, the top

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.020 align:middle line:90%
of the Alps for example.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.610 align:middle line:84%
In Italy on the top of
mountains and other places.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.590 align:middle line:90%
Like Hawaii.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.520 align:middle line:90%
Like Hawaii, exactly.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:36.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's really exciting to see
how in this moment of time that

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.500 align:middle line:84%
is really an interesting
moment of transformation

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.460 align:middle line:90%
for the planet.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Is the moment where all of these
information they're coming out.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.100 align:middle line:84%
So why did you have that line
going from Portugal to Cuba?

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Is that just like the
line going through?

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Because there's evidence of
Atlantis in the Cuba area,

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.380 align:middle line:90%
that's why I ask.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Well definitely, well we can
also mention about [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.230 align:middle line:90%
in the Bahamas, for example.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.630 align:middle line:84%
So it goes right through
like the Bermuda Triangle.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Yes, this is just to give
more or less the distance

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.670 align:middle line:90%
between the two continent.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And also you probably
see the tectonic plates

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.540 align:middle line:84%
of the planet that
is really crossing

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.360 align:middle line:90%
the ex island I of Atlantis.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately because we
are in such a delicate place.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So when there was a disaster
the island was really

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.500 align:middle line:90%
collapsing into their ocean.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.410 align:middle line:84%
This is a good occasion
to see in how many places

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.780 align:middle line:84%
of the planet we have
probably to rewrite

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.510 align:middle line:90%
that issue of the humankind.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.090 align:middle line:84%
I recently met my friends
at the [INAUDIBLE] reach.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.480 align:middle line:90%
The men of the Bosnian Pyramids.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure you've heard about it.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.570 align:middle line:84%
We have specialized,
and I mean it's

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.510 align:middle line:84%
pretty evident, that
all decide that we

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.950 align:middle line:90%
went to visit many times.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.870 align:middle line:90%
So it's older than 30,000 years.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's absolutely incompatible
with the classical history.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.240 align:middle line:84%
So there's more
and more evidence

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.900 align:middle line:84%
the origin of the human kind
and the origin of our society

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.980 align:middle line:84%
are much more
complex and probably

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.730 align:middle line:84%
very different
from what we study

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.790 align:middle line:90%
in the classical history book.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the discovery at
Gobekli Tepe for instance.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.150 align:middle line:84%
A city in Turkey which
now have been a carbon

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.279 align:middle line:90%
dated 12,000 years old.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:21.100 align:middle line:84%
Just like everything seems to
be breaking our way recently.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.530 align:middle line:84%
There is probably already
a meaning why in this moment

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.320 align:middle line:84%
that there could be a return
of Atlantis in this time.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Because of the internet
and interconnection

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.120 align:middle line:84%
of the entire world,
it is like the world

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.260 align:middle line:84%
could now be the Atlantis
and so just an island.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, yes, and there is
also other reason, maybe not

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.000 align:middle line:84%
so classical, and
this is what I want

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.710 align:middle line:90%
to share with everyone today.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.240 align:middle line:90%
So this is the painter.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Came back and started
painting these paintings.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.260 align:middle line:84%
We are just back in the
pictures that we saw last time.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.100 align:middle line:90%
We are on the ground.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.420 align:middle line:84%
We are in one of the
columns that are really

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.430 align:middle line:90%
holding the surface Atlantis.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Many of these
columns, as you see,

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.670 align:middle line:90%
are completely covered in gold.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean we are in front of a
very advanced civilization.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Probably a civilization
that we are representing.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.890 align:middle line:90%
One of the human golden age.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.260 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
talking about Atlantis,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.400 align:middle line:84%
it's like to talk about two
completely different things.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.440 align:middle line:84%
One is really the
best of the best.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And one that is
probably will not

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.000 align:middle line:90%
be one of the best of the best.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm starting from
this picture is because

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.640 align:middle line:84%
Imagine such a refined,
powerful, civilization.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And then imagine that all of
the sudden, everything's gone.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.430 align:middle line:84%
Yes for sure there
is a disaster.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.340 align:middle line:90%
There's a great flood.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.860 align:middle line:84%
Probably an asteroid
shooting the planet,

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.560 align:middle line:90%
and creating this tsunami over.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately the
morphology of the island

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.650 align:middle line:84%
brings the island
really to collapse

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.970 align:middle line:90%
into the ocean in a few days.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's pretty
difficult to understand

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:04.070 align:middle line:84%
how they couldn't prevent
-Or save themselves.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.430 align:middle line:90%
Or save themselves.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.950 align:middle line:84%
So and I'm starting
from these pictures.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And now we can go
to the second one.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.100 align:middle line:84%
Because if we're enlarging the
little part of the pictures,

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.040 align:middle line:84%
we see something that
is pretty interesting.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.070 align:middle line:84%
To try to give another
approach about Atlantis.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Or to talk about one
of the technology

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.291 align:middle line:84%
that they was really
able to use correctly.

00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:31.990 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So this is an ancient
divination called karomakia.

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Well if you want is the
divination with Toros.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.710 align:middle line:90%
There is still connection in--

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.960 align:middle line:90%
They would sacrifice the bull.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Let's say in the
sacrifice of the bull,

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.310 align:middle line:84%
that there is a sort
of reading of the sign.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.090 align:middle line:90%
Like to have a perspective.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.490 align:middle line:84%
We probably already
know that Atlantis

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:02.240 align:middle line:84%
is using correctly a technology
that is very powerful.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.400 align:middle line:90%
But also very dangerous.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.310 align:middle line:90%
Like the time to technology.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.120 align:middle line:84%
Yes, many civilization
are talking

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.040 align:middle line:90%
that time is like a territory.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.140 align:middle line:84%
So we can move in
this territory.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And I mean what is
very delicate, is

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.850 align:middle line:84%
that when we move in
time, we will also

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.940 align:middle line:90%
reach are the chain the event.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, if I'm
coming back 2000 years,

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.250 align:middle line:84%
and I modify something
2000 years ago,

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm modifying
something right now.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.600 align:middle line:90%
So it's extremely powerful.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.530 align:middle line:84%
But it's also
extremely delicate.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.140 align:middle line:90%
Because I can really change.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.570 align:middle line:90%
So the grandfather effect.

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.380 align:middle line:84%
You go back and kill
your grandfather,

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.260 align:middle line:90%
what happens to you.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.730 align:middle line:90%
And create a lot of paradox.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:45.620 align:middle line:84%
So this time technology that
many civilizations used.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.870 align:middle line:84%
There was also a possibility
sometimes to have

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:50.110 align:middle line:90%
perspective about the future.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Because it's easy to
travel into the past.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.330 align:middle line:84%
It's almost impossible to
travel into the future.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Simply because
the future is what

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.130 align:middle line:84%
we are creating
moment after moment

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.210 align:middle line:90%
right now in our present.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:09.190 align:middle line:84%
So why they did some of
these and many other kinds

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.820 align:middle line:84%
of exploration about
possible future.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Because even when we read the
[INAUDIBLE] when we [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:15.960 align:middle line:90%
rooms.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.391 align:middle line:84%
So we are reading
some possible future.

00:08:20.391 --> 00:08:21.090 align:middle line:90%
What it means.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:25.770 align:middle line:84%
It means that OK, I can see
that probably can happen this.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.180 align:middle line:84%
If I knew that, is because
I can probably also

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.460 align:middle line:90%
modify that possible future.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason
why I'm reading.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.460 align:middle line:84%
I want to know about
what can happen.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:39.240 align:middle line:84%
So many, many years
before the disaster.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.520 align:middle line:84%
Many different signs
many different messages

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.930 align:middle line:84%
they was brought up
like this to say,

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:49.240 align:middle line:84%
hey something
extremely dangerous

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.140 align:middle line:84%
can happen to the plan
is something that could

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.550 align:middle line:90%
be really a big, big danger.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:58.430 align:middle line:84%
For the entire
civilization can happen.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And here we are entering in
the second part of a Atlantis.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:05.350 align:middle line:84%
let's say the part
close to the end.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:11.040 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately for every
human civilization,

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.260 align:middle line:84%
well human are pretty good
to repeat the same mistakes.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.350 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:21.980 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately we are so
difficult for us to understand

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:25.190 align:middle line:90%
from the past experience.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.470 align:middle line:84%
So we are repeating, repeating,
repeating to the same things

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:32.630 align:middle line:84%
and when you grow so fast
you become so powerful

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.280 align:middle line:90%
so you have a power power.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.490 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately it is an
instrument and is an issue

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:43.640 align:middle line:84%
and it can also corrupt you
so when I can decide whatever

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.820 align:middle line:90%
I want whatever I want.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:50.630 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to use the power
to what I want over what I have

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:56.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm supposed to use the power
how much my values my dreams

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:02.820 align:middle line:84%
are guiding my action or
how much my ego is guiding

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.780 align:middle line:84%
my action so we know
unfortunately that even

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:12.140 align:middle line:84%
with the best game I mean if the
conscious inside is not awake

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.300 align:middle line:84%
we can really lose
the way we can do

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.350 align:middle line:84%
is the reason why we
are doing something

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:21.570 align:middle line:84%
we create something we are
part of a civilization.

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is the second
part of Atlantis.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.970 align:middle line:84%
So a power that
corrupt Atlantis.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:32.050 align:middle line:84%
It is not anymore the
testimony of this golden age.

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:35.170 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, this is
testimony for use of the power.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Or just for the power
or just for the ego.

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, they want
they can decide things.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:46.230 align:middle line:84%
I just want to mention some
of these pictures regarding

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.490 align:middle line:84%
the most sacred
part of a Atlantis.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Underground like
in old tradition,

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.080 align:middle line:90%
there are the most precious.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.860 align:middle line:90%
The more secular part.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Underground is like to enter
inside of the human body.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.930 align:middle line:84%
So every temple for example,
has a temple in the surface,

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:04.470 align:middle line:84%
and then a [INAUDIBLE]
like in the church.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Under the ground because that
represent what is inside.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.300 align:middle line:90%
The soul.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.670 align:middle line:90%
The region.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:10.980 align:middle line:90%
The hidden part.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.130 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.770 align:middle line:84%
The secret, but
the secret in terms

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.060 align:middle line:90%
of the mystery that has to--

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.217 align:middle line:84%
Even today, the
cathedrals of Europe

00:11:18.217 --> 00:11:19.350 align:middle line:84%
have a crypt in
every one of them.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:20.570 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:24.850 align:middle line:84%
So on the ground there are all
the sacred place of Atlantis.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:29.120 align:middle line:84%
Places where they are studying
also all the different life

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.410 align:middle line:90%
forms.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And as you remember,
life forms that are

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.200 align:middle line:84%
connected to this
planet, socially

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.490 align:middle line:90%
connected to other places.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Because we know the
region of everything.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Is a colony that's
of something that

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.690 align:middle line:90%
is coming not from this planet.

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:49.540 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of these portal
were the guardians is just

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.620 align:middle line:84%
reminding to [INAUDIBLE]
in the [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.030 align:middle line:84%
that they are not
allowed to enter.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Just the people that are
really doing this research.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And in these very
rich, refined portal,

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.690 align:middle line:84%
behind there are laboratory
starting older form

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.820 align:middle line:90%
of life connecting to insects.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:08.650 align:middle line:90%
Just to give an idea.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:11.360 align:middle line:90%


00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.100 align:middle line:84%
-Everything.
-Everything.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.370 align:middle line:90%
Every kind of life form.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:18.280 align:middle line:90%
This is one of my favorite.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.480 align:middle line:90%
This is really powerful.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
represent the core.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.830 align:middle line:90%
The heart of Atlantis.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Not only because the
shape of this stone

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:31.140 align:middle line:90%
is in a form of heart.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:35.990 align:middle line:84%
But this reminds us the
myth of the emerald tablets.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:41.807 align:middle line:84%
So here we have
all the knowledge.

00:12:41.807 --> 00:12:42.540 align:middle line:90%
To get this straight.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.820 align:middle line:84%
You're saying that all that
writing on there, that's

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.700 align:middle line:90%
the emerald tablet writing?

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.960 align:middle line:84%
So for those people don't
know the emerald tablet

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.780 align:middle line:84%
was the writings
of Thoth or Hermes.

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And all the secrets
of metaphysical life

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.210 align:middle line:90%
are in the emerald tablet.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying that it
was originally Atlantis.

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:02.300 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Also something that
contain the knowledge

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.650 align:middle line:90%
about many different life form.

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Again because we don't have to
forget that in the evolution,

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.100 align:middle line:84%
the most important
elements is life.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.210 align:middle line:90%
And the diversity of life.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And actually, [INAUDIBLE]
they decided not to paint

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.460 align:middle line:90%
exactly sign that they saw.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:25.190 align:middle line:84%
So this is not really
all the original one.

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.720 align:middle line:90%
Simply for security reasons.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.180 align:middle line:84%
I completely understand and
appreciate why they do that.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:35.210 align:middle line:90%
It's like a [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:36.570 align:middle line:90%
You can tell too much.

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:37.970 align:middle line:90%
You can say too much.

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:39.410 align:middle line:90%
It's good to know.

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:43.090 align:middle line:84%
But then it's good who
has to know will know.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:44.200 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:48.740 align:middle line:84%
But it's definitely a picture
that give us a lot of energy.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:50.080 align:middle line:90%
Lot of power.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And also Poseidon, as you
know, is the main winding

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:55.770 align:middle line:90%
forces of the time.

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:59.310 align:middle line:84%
Is embracing, protecting,
this knowledge.

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:02.910 align:middle line:84%
So it give us really at
the sense of the pressures

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.450 align:middle line:90%
of this part of Atlantis.

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:07.910 align:middle line:90%
Again, we are now underground.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:11.456 align:middle line:84%
We're really in one of these
huge caves that naturally,

00:14:11.456 --> 00:14:16.730 align:middle line:84%
in Atlantis, are creating
also the perfect spot

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:20.470 align:middle line:84%
for the energy lines over
the entire planet Earth.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:22.010 align:middle line:84%
We went into that
in the last one.

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:23.390 align:middle line:90%
The synchronic lines.

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:27.270 align:middle line:84%
The one that are not only the
connection all over the planet.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.500 align:middle line:84%
But they are also the
connection that are connecting

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.130 align:middle line:90%
the planets all over.

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And the planet probably
to other planets and stars.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:34.820 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And to all the rest of the
galaxy and the other planets

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:41.810 align:middle line:90%
connecting to the empire.

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:46.160 align:middle line:84%
In this beautiful
picture of these.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:51.460 align:middle line:84%
Just the enlargement of the
detail about this stone,

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:55.710 align:middle line:84%
we can really enjoy many
other details for other reason

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:57.770 align:middle line:90%
now I'm not going enter.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:00.730 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm getting
close to give a meaning

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:02.490 align:middle line:90%
about the end of Atlantis.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And also what could
be the reflection

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.060 align:middle line:90%
in this time of Atlantis.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Because we talk about the
coming back of Atlantis.

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:11.500 align:middle line:90%
So there's a meaning.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:15.130 align:middle line:90%
Let's go and for the next one.

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And we are coming
back in the surface.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:19.610 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful sunset.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:27.490 align:middle line:84%
But also we have a picture that
is talking about the other form

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.660 align:middle line:90%
of expression of art.

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.780 align:middle line:84%
For example, below there
we see an amphitheater

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:36.970 align:middle line:84%
just to remember that the
art is in every kind of form.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And someone told
me in the paintings

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:42.520 align:middle line:84%
there are not
trees or vegetation

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.380 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And I reminded to people
that they decided to describe

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.030 align:middle line:84%
more the building or the
symbols, or the places

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:52.680 align:middle line:90%
because there was more--

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.890 align:middle line:90%
Anyone could draw a tree.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.340 align:middle line:90%
Evocative.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.750 align:middle line:90%
But just to let you know.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.580 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot
more vegetation,

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:02.960 align:middle line:84%
but they weren't
interested in it

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.950 align:middle line:84%
because they wanted
information which

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:06.410 align:middle line:90%
is why it's important for.

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:07.470 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:11.650 align:middle line:84%
A lot of point of
observation of the stars.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.560 align:middle line:84%
We know for which reason we
don't have to repeat that.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And in the next one
it's interesting.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.560 align:middle line:84%
Because they went to visit
the museum in Atlantis.

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.520 align:middle line:84%
I like to go to New York
and then go to the fantastic

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.320 align:middle line:90%
Metropolitan Museum.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.230 align:middle line:84%
it's really great and recently
I've been again there.

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:32.550 align:middle line:90%
It never gets old.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:34.360 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.580 align:middle line:84%
So here we are
not in this space.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:37.980 align:middle line:90%
We're not in the stars.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And probably you see two
little figure just right there.

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:44.180 align:middle line:90%
These are [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.200 align:middle line:90%
About 9 o'clock

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.580 align:middle line:90%
Exactly there.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.470 align:middle line:90%
These people are [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:51.780 align:middle line:84%
They represent them
IN a very tiny way.

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:55.120 align:middle line:84%
But because in these museum
they discover technology

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.350 align:middle line:84%
that unfortunately we
are still not using,

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.460 align:middle line:84%
that is a sort of
laser able to create

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.020 align:middle line:90%
three dimensional figures.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.110 align:middle line:90%
and pictures.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:07.339 align:middle line:84%
So when you want to study
or to look around the stars,

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:10.450 align:middle line:84%
it's is not cool just
walk around the stars.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:12.319 align:middle line:90%
Projected in this 3D.

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:13.359 align:middle line:90%
Like a holograph?

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:14.750 align:middle line:90%
Like a holograph.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:19.569 align:middle line:84%
But in a very complex
and a very refined way.

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:22.230 align:middle line:84%
So they was just
walking into the stars,

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:24.031 align:middle line:84%
but it was just in a
holographic projection.

00:17:24.031 --> 00:17:26.810 align:middle line:84%
-Got ya.
-Yes, we have some pictures.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:32.490 align:middle line:84%
They might look less exciting
compared to the others.

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:35.580 align:middle line:84%
But they are part of
the history of Atlantis.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:38.260 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't have to forget
that the history of Atlantis

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:39.560 align:middle line:90%
is a long history.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And they have an evolution,
as we have an evolution.

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:48.100 align:middle line:84%
So they passed through many
different historical moment.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.320 align:middle line:90%
Like this one for example.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Well we don't know exactly
which kind of battle.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Or which kind of
kingdom is this one.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:18:00.370 align:middle line:84%
But it got it gives us the
ideas of old the process.

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And all of the evolution
again maybe increasing

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.860 align:middle line:90%
a to our process of evolution.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:11.280 align:middle line:84%
If we go to the next one,
we are in another pictures

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.900 align:middle line:90%
about another battle.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:17.220 align:middle line:84%
Who know what is this,
a sort of [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Well but here we can
really see different races.

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:24.920 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to forget that
this is really a melting pot

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.430 align:middle line:90%
of different races.

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And we know these King or this
commander from which side is,

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:34.460 align:middle line:90%
but it's really royal.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And it brings elements that
probably are representing

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.300 align:middle line:90%
the power of that moment.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Like when we talk about
Genghis Khan and the Mongols

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.860 align:middle line:84%
or we're going to
the Roman Empires

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.840 align:middle line:84%
and then we go to
Alexander the Great.

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.770 align:middle line:90%
And then we go to Napoleon.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:54.010 align:middle line:84%
So we are crossing
period of time like that.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Again, still a
historical moment.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Just to give other ideas
who knows this queen.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:05.170 align:middle line:84%
That this [INAUDIBLE]
doesn't look very happy.

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And probably this picture they
saw really impressed Falco

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:13.700 align:middle line:84%
in the [INAUDIBLE]
and then decided

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:18.280 align:middle line:84%
to do it because it gives
a sense of something

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.420 align:middle line:90%
that is not so far from us.

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.940 align:middle line:90%
But pretty close.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.440 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's a
beautiful painting.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.540 align:middle line:90%
Again, other races also.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:30.360 align:middle line:90%
Some kind of a makeup.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Also a typical makeup
that we use in [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:35.050 align:middle line:90%
now for our women.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And some ceremony
or special occasion.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.190 align:middle line:90%


00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:42.970 align:middle line:90%
She's spectacular looking.

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:44.790 align:middle line:90%
Very, very spectacular.

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Again, also the jewelry, and
the use of metals, as you know,

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.620 align:middle line:84%
it's extremely
refined with metals

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.470 align:middle line:90%
also coming from modern planet.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:57.200 align:middle line:84%
It's very similar to what
we call self or [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Self in ancient
language means spiral.

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.610 align:middle line:84%
The use of the sacred
geometry or if you want,

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:04.030 align:middle line:90%
the archetype sign.

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:06.545 align:middle line:84%
Combine it with metals
or different materials

00:20:06.545 --> 00:20:09.635 align:middle line:84%
to [INAUDIBLE] the vital energy,
transform it, and then donate

00:20:09.635 --> 00:20:11.990 align:middle line:90%
it for specific function.

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.910 align:middle line:90%
A reason.

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:15.890 align:middle line:84%
So here the reasons are
wonderful and beautiful

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:17.740 align:middle line:90%
for effect.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:21.420 align:middle line:84%
What could be something
that looks like a jewelery,

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.550 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time is
really also like an instrument

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:25.900 align:middle line:90%
that we're using for itself.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:30.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just an environment
it's action as a function.

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.470 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:37.810 align:middle line:84%
if you know is also there's
the way to give meanings.

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:39.720 align:middle line:90%
And what's going on here?

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Well I don't want it
you have a bad impression

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:47.350 align:middle line:84%
about [INAUDIBLE] because
she's not the queen,

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.520 align:middle line:90%
she's not the princess.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.820 align:middle line:90%
She's not that important person.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Well everyone is important,
is not about a VIP.

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:58.600 align:middle line:84%
But this is a picture took
from a woman into the restroom

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.550 align:middle line:84%
into the bathroom.
-I see.

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:03.100 align:middle line:90%


00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.541 align:middle line:84%
those statues of these
angelic beings are they real?

00:21:06.541 --> 00:21:08.670 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
No, of these are statues.

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:09.370 align:middle line:90%
Structures.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And that if you remember, the
big palace this statue palace.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:20.930 align:middle line:84%
So that there's many element
that remind us again.

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:24.080 align:middle line:90%
What we saw in the palace.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.690 align:middle line:84%
In what now is
inside of a bathroom.

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:29.690 align:middle line:84%
Andy there are like
people dancing in the back?

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:31.970 align:middle line:90%
This is just the reflection.

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:36.480 align:middle line:84%
All these different lamp
that are creating light.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.090 align:middle line:84%
You remember that
we taught many times

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:40.120 align:middle line:90%
about different kind of energy.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Using Atlantis like they
use in the magnetic field.

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Probably even more
interesting the use of sound.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:49.350 align:middle line:90%
And the vibration of sound.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:52.800 align:middle line:90%
To create energy.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And also to create
physical affect

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.550 align:middle line:90%
like levitation for example.

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:00.090 align:middle line:84%
So she's a regular
person in Atlantis.

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:03.701 align:middle line:84%
And he's just kind of taken
with her beauty or something.

00:22:03.701 --> 00:22:04.400 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Is she looking
into a mirror there?

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Well we don't know exactly
what she's looking maybe--

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:11.470 align:middle line:90%
She is quite beautiful.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:12.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes pretty beautiful.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And you see also in her
ankles again [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:19.490 align:middle line:90%
A tattoo or something?

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:21.650 align:middle line:84%
No this is again
is [INAUDIBLE],

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:26.030 align:middle line:90%
so it's metals used to.

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:28.550 align:middle line:84%
You see there is
also a little spiral

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:32.430 align:middle line:84%
That just to remind us that
this is an instrument for her.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:35.420 align:middle line:84%
I would always say
that probably this

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.950 align:middle line:84%
is used for the
circulation because it's

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:39.860 align:middle line:90%
very similar to the self.

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:43.450 align:middle line:90%
We are creating for that reason.

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:49.910 align:middle line:84%
The beauty and the refinement
of these woman in the bathroom,

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:54.170 align:middle line:84%
it gives us, again
how much refine was.

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:55.600 align:middle line:90%
Even the common people.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.670 align:middle line:90%
Even the common people.

00:22:56.670 --> 00:23:00.350 align:middle line:84%
So you didn't have to be
such an important one.

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.990 align:middle line:90%
Everything is so refined.

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is making
me even more upset.

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:07.110 align:middle line:84%
The fact that the end
of Atlantis is doing.

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:10.550 align:middle line:90%
It's a long way down.

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:16.940 align:middle line:84%
Yes now we don't have
really pictures anymore.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.110 align:middle line:90%
We saw almost all of them.

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:23.170 align:middle line:84%
We just skipped some
enlargement of the main one,

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:26.530 align:middle line:84%
so just to be sure who
is following us knows

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:29.000 align:middle line:90%
that there is everything here.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And there are now some
sketch the video did just

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:38.010 align:middle line:84%
to again give the
impression and ideas

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:41.060 align:middle line:90%
over the more common life.

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:45.090 align:middle line:84%
So there are a life
that is probably not

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:48.550 align:middle line:90%
so far from the life we have.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:50.030 align:middle line:90%
For example music.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:54.160 align:middle line:84%
With instrument that probably
that don't exist anymore.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:24:01.200 align:middle line:84%
But they are part of the
enjoying life, as usual.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Or in the next one
we see the ball game.

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:08.500 align:middle line:90%
Playing a ball game, right.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.320 align:middle line:84%
It's similar to the
Mayan ball game, In fact.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:14.790 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, you anticipate me.

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:18.010 align:middle line:84%
The ball game like in the Mayans
and in the Mayan's tradition.

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:20.400 align:middle line:90%
And again is not just the game.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Or if you want is a
very serious game.

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Because the game was
using it as a divination.

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:30.570 align:middle line:84%
You can throw the stones
and then sit the stones are

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:33.260 align:middle line:90%
moving and creating figures.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:35.300 align:middle line:90%
Or you could follow a match.

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.680 align:middle line:90%
In how the match is going.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:41.230 align:middle line:84%
How the players are moving
inside of the match.

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:43.090 align:middle line:90%
It's like to have a perspective.

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:46.310 align:middle line:84%
It's like to have a reading
of a possible future.

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Exactly how it was in
the Mayan's tradition.

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:51.940 align:middle line:90%
So it was out retrial game.

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Because it was out of
various use meaning

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.820 align:middle line:90%
connect into the game.

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Let go for something
even more interesting.

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:02.720 align:middle line:90%
Well everything is Interesting.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to say it is not.

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:09.140 align:middle line:84%
But here we have one
of the interpretation.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:13.130 align:middle line:84%
One of the big questions
mark of this planet.

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Because as we mentioned
the Bosnian Pyramids.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.170 align:middle line:90%
But there are pyramid in Italy.

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:20.850 align:middle line:90%
There are pyramids in China.

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:22.690 align:middle line:84%
There are pyramid
made in America.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:24.100 align:middle line:90%
There pyramid in Russia.

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.700 align:middle line:90%
There are pyramids in Africa.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:29.140 align:middle line:84%
There are pyramid
all over the world.

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And as we know,
also a lot of them

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.790 align:middle line:90%
under the water and the oceans.

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And one of the big questions
is for which reason

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:41.110 align:middle line:90%
there are these pyramids.

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:44.390 align:middle line:84%
We cannot really imagine and
then they are [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Not as the classical
archaeologist

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:50.180 align:middle line:90%
trying to tell us.

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:53.290 align:middle line:84%
Not at all also because
in almost no one

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:55.220 align:middle line:84%
that we can really
find something

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.820 align:middle line:84%
that could be a thumb of a
Pharaoh or important person.

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And also I mean if the other
three pyramids in Giza.

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:04.960 align:middle line:84%
The King that built
a little tiny one.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.260 align:middle line:84%
What is he saying that he's
not as good as the other two.

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:09.760 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Come on, that doesn't
make any sense.

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:14.960 align:middle line:84%
I just want a
little tiny pyramid.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.520 align:middle line:90%


00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.220 align:middle line:90%
It's not fair for a Pharaoh.

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.750 align:middle line:84%
It's much more
important than that.

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And also imagine Teotihuacan,
in nearby Mexico City.

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.990 align:middle line:90%
An incredible site.

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Where we have hundreds
of step pyramid.

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:34.910 align:middle line:84%
Like the one we are
to describe here.

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:39.980 align:middle line:84%
So for which reason they really
build all of this pyramid.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Why there are all of these
pyramids all over the planet.

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:45.360 align:middle line:90%
And just to give another detail.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:49.840 align:middle line:84%
We know how our insides
simply because we

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:56.420 align:middle line:84%
open a hole right in the middle
of the wall of the pyramid.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Like in the great
pyramid in Giza.

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.970 align:middle line:84%
But the real entrance
are not on the surface.

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:05.020 align:middle line:90%
It's down below.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.490 align:middle line:84%
People don't realize
that the entrance

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:08.910 align:middle line:84%
that you go to in the pyramid
was actually blown up.

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:10.440 align:middle line:84%
With the well they
actually carved

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.660 align:middle line:90%
it with pick axes and vinegar.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:15.430 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:18.160 align:middle line:84%
If we're coming back
here, we might imagine

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:22.870 align:middle line:84%
that these pyramid
there was something

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:28.060 align:middle line:90%
more like, how to say, vehicle.

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:29.670 align:middle line:90%
To move.

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:32.380 align:middle line:84%
From one planet
for another planet.

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:35.110 align:middle line:90%
To bring that colonizers.

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Or the others intelligence that
was coming into this planet.

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:43.200 align:middle line:90%
To create this different colony.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:47.400 align:middle line:84%
These different kind of empires
or planets, whatever you know.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And when Atlantis one of
the most important colony

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:54.930 align:middle line:84%
becomes finally dependent
from these empires outside

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:56.230 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And then, I mean, in a
very short period of time.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.160 align:middle line:90%
Becoming an empire too.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:07.250 align:middle line:10%
But base on the humans
of the planet Earth,

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:13.010 align:middle line:10%
they decided to left this
pyramid all over the planet.

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:17.030 align:middle line:84%
Pyramid that are not
functioning anymore.

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:21.960 align:middle line:90%
But to remember not to forget.

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:22.980 align:middle line:90%
Not to forget.

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:25.530 align:middle line:84%
With it was the
beginning of everything.

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:27.030 align:middle line:90%
From where we're coming from.

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:31.460 align:middle line:90%
Also the risk of how it was.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:34.890 align:middle line:84%
The because when you
are colony, you are

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:37.370 align:middle line:90%
at the control of someone else.

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:40.570 align:middle line:84%
So you're not free Atlantis
was the demonstration

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:46.090 align:middle line:84%
that it was possible to be
free from all of these empires.

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:50.130 align:middle line:84%
So this is one all the
interpretation of why there are

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:53.320 align:middle line:90%
pyramids all over this planet.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:56.250 align:middle line:84%
Why they have that
particular shape.

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Why they follow the
precise measure.

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:03.140 align:middle line:84%
Why they are done with
some materials like stone

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:07.710 align:middle line:84%
that is the material that
resist more into time.

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:10.150 align:middle line:84%
So not because they
are [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:11.950 align:middle line:84%
not because they
are strange places,

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:17.260 align:middle line:84%
but simply because they
was left as a memory.

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And in this catch it
looks that the [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:24.800 align:middle line:84%
with the [INAUDIBLE] help
is really describing that.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:30.740 align:middle line:84%
So places, instrument,
vehicle, for that function.

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Yes, some of this catch are
part of the different kind

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:36.920 align:middle line:90%
of architecture.

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:42.390 align:middle line:84%
That again, is not just
the art of the beauty.

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Because we are so
impressive about that.

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:46.610 align:middle line:84%
But this is really the
art that are connecting

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:48.210 align:middle line:90%
to the sacred geometry.

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:51.725 align:middle line:84%
So these places are able
to capitalize energy.

00:29:51.725 --> 00:29:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Are able to create effect on
the matter on the physical form.

00:29:56.430 --> 00:30:00.146 align:middle line:84%
They are able also to
influence the subconscious.

00:30:00.146 --> 00:30:00.960 align:middle line:90%
The emotion.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.270 align:middle line:90%


00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:06.330 align:middle line:90%
The awakeness of people.

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:09.480 align:middle line:84%
It's really the concentration
of etheric energy.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:15.610 align:middle line:84%
In the mathematical, scientific
way that we have lost.

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:18.450 align:middle line:84%
Well but we are
used a say that all

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:22.380 align:middle line:90%
is a translation of numbers.

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.200 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Everything is just a
translation of numbers.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:29.940 align:middle line:84%
So there's all the numbers
is the law that let's say is

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:33.320 align:middle line:90%
managing the entire universe.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.040 align:middle line:90%
Let's go for the next one.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:38.320 align:middle line:90%
Again the detail of the art.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Now it becomes a little
bit different, also.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Because as I told you, there is
the positive side of Atlantis.

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:48.840 align:middle line:90%
The best of the best.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
there is the dark side.

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:54.560 align:middle line:90%
Decided to take the control.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:58.770 align:middle line:84%
This side is really going
against their values.

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:02.620 align:middle line:10%
And if we go to
the next one, it's

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:06.410 align:middle line:10%
also politically speaking,
what is unfortunately

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:09.630 align:middle line:10%
happening also this time.

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:12.690 align:middle line:10%
When you are so powerful,
when you can really decide

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:15.550 align:middle line:10%
the life or death of everyone.

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:17.340 align:middle line:10%
I mean who cares.

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:20.750 align:middle line:84%
You will do what you want,
not what you have to do.

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And if you have to take
responsibility of choices

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:27.560 align:middle line:84%
that maybe other
people will not like.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Or the population
would not like.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.660 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know what to do.

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.730 align:middle line:84%
The better way is
to not do anything.

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:34.700 align:middle line:90%
Just wait.

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:38.110 align:middle line:84%
If the problem that
will be solved--

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:39.670 align:middle line:84%
That's what's
going on right now.

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:40.790 align:middle line:90%
Nothing's getting done.

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's pretty
humanistic, or sad,

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:49.750 align:middle line:84%
to see how many analogy we
have with the actual situation

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:51.140 align:middle line:90%
of our society.

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And what it was going on
at the end of Atlantis.

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:59.730 align:middle line:10%
A power that the respect
of the other life or that

00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:03.380 align:middle line:10%
caused some destruction
of the environment

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:06.960 align:middle line:10%
but also political speaking
a class of politicians

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:10.250 align:middle line:10%
it means that all taking
the responsibility

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:14.770 align:middle line:10%
of their position making choices
because we elect them to make

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:19.970 align:middle line:10%
choices not to sit-in a chair
so instead of making decision

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:23.250 align:middle line:10%
b I just sitting on this year
we're just waiting there it

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:26.750 align:middle line:10%
says try not to do anything
because they are not taken

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:31.660 align:middle line:10%
in the weeks of their action so
even if there's maybe something

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:36.060 align:middle line:10%
dangerous could happen if
you know then maybe you

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.830 align:middle line:10%
have to take decisions
there will not be

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:41.180 align:middle line:10%
a very popular to the people.

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:42.380 align:middle line:10%
They will go like this.

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:44.420 align:middle line:10%
Everybody's looking
somewhere else.

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:46.340 align:middle line:10%
Not taking decision.

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:49.830 align:middle line:10%
And then the dangers
becomes close and close.

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:51.550 align:middle line:10%
They don't know
exactly what it is.

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And also they believe
that because Atlantis

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:56.480 align:middle line:90%
is so big so powerful.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.050 align:middle line:90%
What can happen?

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:01.600 align:middle line:84%
Even if something happened
they will react as they need

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.050 align:middle line:90%
and as they want.

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:07.770 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, if we go
also in the next one.

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:10.710 align:middle line:84%
These losing the
values because I

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:12.800 align:middle line:90%
have to come back to the point.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Every societies based
on values on the dream.

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:17.510 align:middle line:90%
Now here we're going to America.

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:18.870 align:middle line:90%
American dream.

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:24.090 align:middle line:84%
So if the dream is not awake
if the dream is not there,

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:28.030 align:middle line:84%
so if you lose the dream
your starting to die.

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:30.540 align:middle line:84%
You're starting to
really collapse.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is working
for every kind

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:37.210 align:middle line:84%
of society, group organization,
business, et cetera, et cetera.

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:40.750 align:middle line:90%


00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:43.400 align:middle line:84%
You've got me, I
completely agree with you.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.600 align:middle line:84%
I got to go to this
painting though,

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:45.633 align:middle line:90%
because it's really disturbing.

00:33:45.633 --> 00:33:50.470 align:middle line:90%


00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:51.940 align:middle line:90%
Using of the values.

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:53.140 align:middle line:90%
I get you are going.

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Is also about manipulation of
all the DNA and genetic stuff.

00:33:57.980 --> 00:33:59.130 align:middle line:90%
So something that they can't.

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:00.260 align:middle line:90%
We're crossing right now.

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:02.590 align:middle line:84%
So this is where the
mythologies came from.

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:07.050 align:middle line:84%
The center exactly the
centaur or the Minotaur.

00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:11.260 align:middle line:84%
They are in a mythological
animal or form of life.

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:12.820 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just mythical.

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:15.770 align:middle line:90%
it was laboratory products.

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:19.889 align:middle line:84%
They was produced from the
crossing of the genetic

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:21.440 align:middle line:90%
between humans and animals.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.091 align:middle line:84%
Sure, it could be
done right now why not?

00:34:23.091 --> 00:34:24.449 align:middle line:84%
Exactly.
Why not?

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And why not is which
is my direction?

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Are my values that are
giving me the direction

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:35.850 align:middle line:90%
and then there is a limit.

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And not a limit because I
want to stop the research.

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:39.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm not talking about that.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.270 align:middle line:84%
But I'm talking
about can I cross

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:46.190 align:middle line:84%
the border between different
life form for example.

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.940 align:middle line:90%
I will not do that.

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Because this is really not
only unfair, but it against.

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:54.940 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like an
airplane that's out to see.

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:58.540 align:middle line:84%
It passes the halfway
on the gas tank.

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:01.770 align:middle line:84%
You can either go back,
or you have to go forward.

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And they cross that line,
there's no going back.

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, this is
part of the last period of time

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:10.170 align:middle line:90%
and in Atlantis.

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:11.670 align:middle line:90%
There's not control.

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:12.560 align:middle line:90%
There's no values.

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Or the values are
completely, forget about it.

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.440 align:middle line:84%
So they're starting
to manipulate.

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.350 align:middle line:84%
They're starting to
create a monster.

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:24.800 align:middle line:84%
They are starting really
to create very nasty stuff.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is also
about the capacity

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:30.260 align:middle line:90%
to confront themselves.

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:34.730 align:middle line:84%
This is just to give an idea
that's also if before Atlantis

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:37.710 align:middle line:84%
is coming from the
integration of all

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:40.500 align:middle line:84%
these different
races, diversity,

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.890 align:middle line:90%
different point of view.

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:42.830 align:middle line:90%
Different thoughts.

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:44.720 align:middle line:90%
But now that begins changing.

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.250 align:middle line:90%
No, now is this is the law.

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:48.480 align:middle line:90%
This is the thought.

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.490 align:middle line:90%
This is the direction.

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And if you are not
in, you are against.

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:55.651 align:middle line:84%
This is frighteningly close to
what's going on in our country

00:35:55.651 --> 00:35:56.350 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:59.560 align:middle line:90%


00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:00.650 align:middle line:90%
This is the risk.

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:02.410 align:middle line:90%
Like this is the line.

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:04.030 align:middle line:84%
If you cross the
line you are against.

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:05.090 align:middle line:90%
You're killed.

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:06.120 align:middle line:90%
Or you out.

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:06.940 align:middle line:90%
Or you are in prison.

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Or you are not allowed to
say something different.

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:11.920 align:middle line:84%
This is very risky
in our society

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.880 align:middle line:84%
because if you
lose the confront.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:19.000 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the different
point of view to get,

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.220 align:middle line:84%
you are really starting to
get in big, big trouble.

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.320 align:middle line:84%
So this is a policeman
who's just killed someone.

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Yes, something like this,
well again the sketch

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:30.200 align:middle line:84%
are just an excuse for
us right to describe

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.280 align:middle line:90%
how was the end of Atlantis.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And its pretty upset again,
because Atlantis for all

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:38.960 align:middle line:84%
us is this hope of
the better society.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.560 align:middle line:90%
Of the better civilization.

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And now we discover
that oh my goodness,

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.540 align:middle line:90%
this was actually pretty nasty.

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:46.280 align:middle line:90%
And pretty negative.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:46.980 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Because again, it's
all in our hands.

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:54.000 align:middle line:90%
Is only the conscious inside.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.880 align:middle line:90%
That can guide a big power.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:37:01.230 align:middle line:84%
If we lose the conscious we
are really, really big trouble.

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:02.340 align:middle line:90%
It's our choice.

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:05.570 align:middle line:84%
It's our choice is always
based on the last event power.

00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:07.810 align:middle line:90%
We call free will.

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:08.830 align:middle line:90%
The power to make mistakes.

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:10.320 align:middle line:90%
No I'm sorry.

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.970 align:middle line:84%
The power the make
the right choice.

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:13.920 align:middle line:84%
The freedom to make
a mistake though.

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but if you are able to
learn from the mistakes well,

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:19.900 align:middle line:90%
work on mistakes.

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:20.630 align:middle line:90%
We get better.

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:23.720 align:middle line:84%
If I can get better, if I
can become a better person.

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:27.150 align:middle line:84%
But if the mistakes is
just to do whatever I want,

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:31.740 align:middle line:84%
and not care about the result,
That is really serious.

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:35.170 align:middle line:84%
These are details
of some instrument.

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Well I'm in love with all
the research of sound.

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not the only
one in this planet.

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:42.000 align:middle line:90%
And the effect of the sound.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.560 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE] incredible healer.

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.510 align:middle line:90%
They're using sound.

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:48.830 align:middle line:90%
Sound healing, sound technique.

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Many video symatics
and Hans Jenny's work.

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:55.715 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, and also that
the the mystical journey.

00:37:55.715 --> 00:38:00.800 align:middle line:84%
The shamanic journey is
many times based on mantras.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:03.420 align:middle line:90%
Or frequencies of sounds.

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:05.900 align:middle line:84%
You're repeating, repeating
the prayer, the words.

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And then that's
frequency that you get

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:10.560 align:middle line:84%
is all that is on
top of what you say.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:13.010 align:middle line:84%
What you are
producing or chanting

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:15.420 align:middle line:90%
is creating physical effect.

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And so, the sound technology
is one of the most interesting

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:24.980 align:middle line:90%
technology use in Atlantis.

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:26.800 align:middle line:90%
Used for creating energy.

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.260 align:middle line:90%
Producing energy.

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:31.290 align:middle line:84%
But also to create
this anti gravity.

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:33.320 align:middle line:90%
This levitation effect.

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Probably a knowledge that
also other civilization.

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:42.420 align:middle line:84%
It was keeping secret as
a very precious things.

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And then used to
create their temple,

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:48.110 align:middle line:90%
their city, their places.

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:49.250 align:middle line:90%
There is so many evidence.

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:53.530 align:middle line:84%
That places like Machu
Picchu for example.

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:54.980 align:middle line:84%
How could they get
all that up there.

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and they
took have piece

00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:00.290 align:middle line:84%
of stones that was hundred
kilometres far from the place.

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:06.680 align:middle line:84%
On top on the mountain, and then
perfectly shaped with 4/8 12

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:07.500 align:middle line:90%
angles.

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.220 align:middle line:90%
And then keep it together with--

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Can't even get a razor
blade between the rocks.

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:14.760 align:middle line:90%
It's almost impossible for us.

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:17.050 align:middle line:90%
It is impossible for us.

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:18.330 align:middle line:90%
I can talk about Columbia.

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:21.740 align:middle line:84%
I can talk about Italy,
We can talk about Bolivia.

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:24.080 align:middle line:90%
We can talk about Europe.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:26.410 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about again,
all over the world

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:29.280 align:middle line:84%
there is evidence of
advanced technologies.

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.950 align:middle line:90%
Advanced civilization.

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Well so maybe we're
going to understand

00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:35.380 align:middle line:90%
from where they're coming from.

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Because definitely,
probably they

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.560 align:middle line:84%
are part of the same mother.
-Sure.

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:43.480 align:middle line:90%


00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:46.950 align:middle line:90%
So this is a speaker here?

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:50.760 align:middle line:84%
Sound system, I mean is not
for create sound for music.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:54.850 align:middle line:84%
But something that is
able to create vibration

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:59.590 align:middle line:84%
frequencies to then create
these physical effect.

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:02.230 align:middle line:84%
The next one is just
to remind you one more

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:05.660 align:middle line:90%
time the region of everything.

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Something that is not
coming from this planet.

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Something is coming
very far away.

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:15.920 align:middle line:84%
But also in the universe
The concept of human

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:22.740 align:middle line:84%
is not only connected to having
one head, two arms, and legs.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, human is more about who
is the driver of the body.

00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:30.730 align:middle line:90%
And the driver is the soul.

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:31.970 align:middle line:90%
The human soul.

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:32.670 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:33.930 align:middle line:90%
So this is just an instrument.

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:35.170 align:middle line:90%
We're using these instrument.

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:39.300 align:middle line:84%
Actually also, for
such a long time.

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:41.260 align:middle line:90%
And then we left.

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And then we will
be back, hopefully.

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:47.440 align:middle line:90%
Using another machine.

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:48.230 align:middle line:90%
Another instrument.

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:49.200 align:middle line:90%
Another body.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:54.220 align:middle line:84%
So we can imagine that this
body is adapt for this planet.

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:56.240 align:middle line:90%
For the element of this planet.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.760 align:middle line:84%
For the enivironment,
and microorganisms.

00:40:58.760 --> 00:40:59.530 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:01.540 align:middle line:90%
In another planet, maybe.

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:03.380 align:middle line:90%
It will be different.

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:06.990 align:middle line:90%
So when we talk about human.

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:08.660 align:middle line:90%
Or human soul.

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:10.040 align:middle line:90%
Or human race.

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.730 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to stop
just with a picture of us

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:13.970 align:middle line:90%
in front of the mirror.

00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:18.590 align:middle line:84%
But we can have probably to
open a little bit more the idea.

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:22.180 align:middle line:84%
What is really the
driver of this body.

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:24.160 align:middle line:90%
The drivers of this machine.

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.130 align:middle line:90%
Our soul.

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And is the soul that is
doing this time travel.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:32.230 align:middle line:84%
The reincarnation is
the as I told you.

00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:34.220 align:middle line:90%
Reincarnation is time travel.

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.910 align:middle line:84%
It's the low cost
of the time travel.

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:39.410 align:middle line:90%
Low tech, low tech time travel.

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:40.410 align:middle line:90%
There is a lot of work to do.

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:41.809 align:middle line:90%
OK well let's come back.

00:41:41.809 --> 00:41:42.575 align:middle line:90%
It will take some time.

00:41:42.575 --> 00:41:45.235 align:middle line:90%


00:41:45.235 --> 00:41:48.270 align:middle line:90%
then we can do something.

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:51.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's go for the next one,
and this is just an idea .

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And I know that it's
not really a nice idea.

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:57.720 align:middle line:84%
But this really gave me the
chance to talk a little bit

00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:58.544 align:middle line:90%
more about the act.

00:41:58.544 --> 00:41:59.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let's talk about this.

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Because danger signal or
messages of danger is coming.

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:08.440 align:middle line:90%
Just ignore them.

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:10.970 align:middle line:90%
Who care's we're the strongest.

00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:12.770 align:middle line:90%
Were the most powerful.

00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And then unfortunately,
what happened.

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:18.710 align:middle line:84%
This asteroid, this
bigger rock coming

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:21.080 align:middle line:90%
from the outside of the planet.

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately
we know that it's

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.970 align:middle line:90%
an event that is pretty common.

00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:27.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say
that every day, but yes.

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:29.560 align:middle line:90%
Everyday is a crap shoot.

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:30.450 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And just a little piece
can really create disaster.

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:35.210 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:37.970 align:middle line:84%
In this case, it is not
really a little piece.

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:39.070 align:middle line:90%
Is really big piece.

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And then the disasters
really were white.

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:44.920 align:middle line:84%
Is what the data,
what the Bible is

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.780 align:middle line:90%
describing as the great flood.

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Well then there is the
interpretation of god that

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:52.060 align:middle line:90%
is so angry with the human.

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:55.760 align:middle line:84%
But definitely
the physical event

00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:00.030 align:middle line:84%
is a disaster that will change
the face of the planet Earth

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:01.050 align:middle line:90%
completely.

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Because these gigantic
tsunami will bring the coast

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:09.160 align:middle line:84%
all the continent to
disappear under the ocean.

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:13.200 align:middle line:84%
For sometimes also 20,
30, 60 meters below.

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:18.460 align:middle line:84%
That's reason why we talk
about the underwater research,

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:21.110 align:middle line:84%
in term of archaeology,
that is so exciting now.

00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Because under the water they
are finding a lot of things.

00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:24.450 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:26.720 align:middle line:90%
Like in the Japanese islands.

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:28.820 align:middle line:90%
Like in the Sri Lanka.

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Like in Alexandra in Egypt.

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:36.240 align:middle line:90%
Like the Azor for the pyramid.

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:38.970 align:middle line:84%
But probably also,
many people know

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:44.360 align:middle line:84%
about these huge crystal pyramid
in the Bermuda Triangles.

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:46.780 align:middle line:84%
So under the water
looks like there

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:51.430 align:middle line:84%
is the real book of the
history of the human kind.

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:54.880 align:middle line:84%
So the disaster is
really incredible.

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's in few days
the disappearing

00:43:58.020 --> 00:43:59.670 align:middle line:90%
of the island of Atlantis.

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And with the island is the
end of this [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:05.300 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:12.440 align:middle line:84%
So let's try to give another
perspective of this ends.

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Actually, historically
speaking, is not really the end.

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:21.030 align:middle line:84%
Because years later we
have to imagine Atlantis.

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:22.260 align:middle line:90%
The big island.

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:24.360 align:middle line:84%
But also we have to
imagine that Atlantis

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:29.870 align:middle line:84%
has many different colony in
different parts of this planet.

00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:31.550 align:middle line:90%
What now we call a Egypt.

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:35.820 align:middle line:84%
What now we can call South
America, Chile, Peru.

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:38.540 align:middle line:90%
What we can call North America.

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:42.990 align:middle line:84%
What we can call
Europe, Asia, and so on.

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Colonies that
Atlantis was manage

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:51.440 align:middle line:84%
has unfortunately the other
empires that was doing with us.

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:55.160 align:middle line:84%
The repeating of
the same mistakes.

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Definitely we are talking
about a different planet.

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:00.880 align:middle line:84%
There is a planet
before the flood.

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And there was a planet
after the flood.

00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:04.690 align:middle line:84%
For example, what
now we call Egypt,

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:09.550 align:middle line:84%
it it was the agricultural farm.
-That's right.

00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:13.440 align:middle line:84%
All of the Sahara
Desert was a farm.

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.260 align:middle line:90%
Very fertile.

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:16.970 align:middle line:90%
But after it was a desert.

00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:18.820 align:middle line:90%
Just to give you the idea.

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:25.090 align:middle line:84%
So after the disaster,
there was one colony.

00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:27.500 align:middle line:90%
That is survive pretty well.

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:30.251 align:middle line:84%
I mean, pretty well in
a situation that is--

00:45:30.251 --> 00:45:30.950 align:middle line:90%
Horrible.

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:32.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean it is more than
horrible, probably.

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Because we can imagine also the
effect for many, many years.

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:40.180 align:middle line:90%
In terms of the radiation.

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:43.370 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the sun
that cannot warm

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:45.660 align:middle line:84%
up the planet anymore
for all the [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:46.800 align:middle line:90%
in the atmosphere.

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:48.540 align:middle line:90%
For the radio communication.

00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And also for the
immediate disappearing

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:55.000 align:middle line:90%
of many technology.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine if something
like this will happen today.

00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:58.860 align:middle line:84%
We will have the
car, but then we

00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:00.920 align:middle line:84%
don't have the petrol and
all the chain that created,

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:01.620 align:middle line:90%
ya know.

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:02.550 align:middle line:90%
Can't grow food.

00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:03.470 align:middle line:90%
Can't do anything.

00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:04.530 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:08.190 align:middle line:84%
So one of these colonies
survived pretty well.

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And it will be, let's say,
an opportunity to Atlantis

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:16.030 align:middle line:84%
to try to recover
Atlantis and to bring

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:17.970 align:middle line:90%
back Atlantis to the planet.

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:23.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the islands
of Santorini in Greece.

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:24.100 align:middle line:90%
The big island.

00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Because actually now,
that island is only at 30%

00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:32.130 align:middle line:84%
because unfortunately, there
was a volcano eruption that was

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:34.010 align:middle line:90%
destroying the entire island.

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:37.040 align:middle line:84%
So Santorini was the last
possibility for Atlantis

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:40.130 align:middle line:84%
to recover to try
to let's say, keep

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:42.090 align:middle line:90%
together the entire empire.

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:44.710 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
after a few years.

00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Also this last
possibility was gone.

00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:52.320 align:middle line:84%
A volcanic eruption was
destroying more than 70%

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:53.190 align:middle line:90%
of the island.

00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:56.731 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
the end of the end.

00:46:56.731 --> 00:46:57.430 align:middle line:90%
Let's come back.

00:46:57.430 --> 00:47:04.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's try now to probably give a
meaning to what's going on now.

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Because we didn't talk so
much about spirituality.

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:09.290 align:middle line:84%
We didn't talk about
spiritual master.

00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:12.050 align:middle line:84%
We didn't talk about
the esoteric project.

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Where the esoteric
project is the project

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:17.660 align:middle line:90%
to spiritualize the matter.

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:20.760 align:middle line:84%
To bring the entire
matter to become light.

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:23.950 align:middle line:84%
We talk about probably
the first time.

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:27.550 align:middle line:84%
So these esoteric projects,
and these spiritual masters.

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Well who are the
spiritual masters.

00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:31.600 align:middle line:90%
Are people in light.

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:34.085 align:middle line:84%
Like the Christ.
Like Buddha.

00:47:34.085 --> 00:47:35.640 align:middle line:90%
Like Prometheus.

00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:39.830 align:middle line:84%
If you want the same
conscious, it is coming back.

00:47:39.830 --> 00:47:40.650 align:middle line:90%
Why.

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:43.410 align:middle line:84%
Because the enlightenment
of one person is not enough.

00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:46.710 align:middle line:84%
We need to enlight a
certain number of souls.

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And to make these
irreversible for all the rest.

00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:52.650 align:middle line:90%
So why they're coming back.

00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:53.450 align:middle line:90%
To help.

00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:54.330 align:middle line:90%
To teach.

00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:55.830 align:middle line:90%
To show how to do it.

00:47:55.830 --> 00:47:57.060 align:middle line:90%
To make it happen.

00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:58.540 align:middle line:84%
So they did, they
still come back

00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:00.570 align:middle line:90%
and they're doing their job.

00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:03.140 align:middle line:90%
Helping to find their way.

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And then to cross this
way to enlightenment.

00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:09.740 align:middle line:84%
So the esoteric project and
the spiritual master-- I mean

00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:14.440 align:middle line:84%
is a story besides
this classical story.

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And they are always
inside of this planet.

00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.490 align:middle line:90%
In every time in every moment.

00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:26.680 align:middle line:84%
So also Atlantis also in that
very difficult moment of time,

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:29.640 align:middle line:90%
just near the end.

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:31.950 align:middle line:84%
So let's imagine that
in the Atlantis society

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:34.350 align:middle line:90%
there are souls.

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:38.490 align:middle line:84%
People and light people,
spiritual master.

00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And this spiritual master, let's
say they know that something

00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:43.240 align:middle line:90%
really that could just happen.

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:46.360 align:middle line:84%
They know that they
could also disappear.

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:49.660 align:middle line:84%
What represents in
terms of evolution,

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:50.990 align:middle line:90%
when we talk about Atlantis.

00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Because we can imagine
that before Atlantis,

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:56.260 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter if they was
acting good or I acting bad.

00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:59.850 align:middle line:84%
But before Atlantis, the level
of evolution was like this.

00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:02.247 align:middle line:84%
After Atlantis, where is
the level of evolution?

00:49:02.247 --> 00:49:03.410 align:middle line:90%
Down.

00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:05.590 align:middle line:84%
OK, so they know
there's something

00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:10.270 align:middle line:84%
that is going to happen,
so what they tried to do.

00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:13.530 align:middle line:84%
They decided to
abandon Atlantis.

00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:15.470 align:middle line:90%
So abandon the big island.

00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:18.390 align:middle line:90%
To find places.

00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:20.250 align:middle line:90%
Let's say safety not enough.

00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:23.670 align:middle line:84%
But safe also in
terms of disaster.

00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And if you think that
a disaster will come,

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:29.040 align:middle line:84%
you will not stay nearby
the sea, for example.

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:30.330 align:middle line:90%
A very bad place.

00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:33.780 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
up to the mountain.

00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:35.500 align:middle line:84%
Why, also because
the mountain they

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:39.880 align:middle line:84%
are again a natural spot to
connect the synchronic lines.

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And this souls also, the
source of this spiritual master

00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:45.316 align:middle line:90%
from where they are coming from.

00:49:45.316 --> 00:49:47.130 align:middle line:90%
From these synchronic lines.

00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:53.510 align:middle line:84%
So this they found places safe
enough from the big island.

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:55.000 align:middle line:84%
They arrive in
one of the colony.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.710 align:middle line:84%
From the colony
they disappeared.

00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:59.540 align:middle line:90%
They arrive in these places.

00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:00.590 align:middle line:90%
And they're not alone.

00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:03.250 align:middle line:84%
So other people they
believe in what they teach,

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:04.560 align:middle line:90%
in what they say.

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:08.090 align:middle line:84%
So little by little
from Atlantis,

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:10.850 align:middle line:90%
in different part of the planet.

00:50:10.850 --> 00:50:12.240 align:middle line:90%
Tibet.

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.490 align:middle line:90%
The Andes.

00:50:14.490 --> 00:50:15.590 align:middle line:90%
Different places.

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:18.490 align:middle line:84%
Different spiritual community.
-The Hopi.

00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Secret society these was based
on these people's master.

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Then the people that
was following them.

00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:26.430 align:middle line:90%
That was believing in them.

00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:28.450 align:middle line:90%
They are all in contact.

00:50:28.450 --> 00:50:30.760 align:middle line:90%
And what they brought with them.

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:33.390 align:middle line:90%
They brought technologies.

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:35.490 align:middle line:84%
They brought what
they call it see.

00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:40.060 align:middle line:84%
Like, OK, if everything
would really go wrong,

00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:43.561 align:middle line:84%
I will keep see that at the
right time, maybe a long time

00:50:43.561 --> 00:50:44.260 align:middle line:90%
after.

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:47.370 align:middle line:84%
But see that they will
give back the opportunity

00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:50.100 align:middle line:84%
to the human kind.
-To rise up.

00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:51.530 align:middle line:90%
To rise up.

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:52.780 align:middle line:90%
So they bring technology.

00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:54.280 align:middle line:90%
They bring see.

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:57.270 align:middle line:84%
They are separate, even
if they know each other.

00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:59.710 align:middle line:84%
So this is like the
stories of Quatzequatel

00:50:59.710 --> 00:51:02.200 align:middle line:84%
coming to Maya
Mexico with seeds.

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And teaching them how to
plant food and how to write.

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And Oros-- and Oros and
Prometheus and all of them.

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:12.590 align:middle line:84%
-And how to respect women.
-Exactly.

00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:15.710 align:middle line:84%
So they are creating
this secret society.

00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis becomes more
and more suspicion.

00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Too many people
are disappearing.

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Too many people
are where they are.

00:51:22.650 --> 00:51:23.850 align:middle line:84%
There is something
against Atlantis.

00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:26.500 align:middle line:84%
So they're going
to look at them.

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately they
found some of them,

00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:29.920 align:middle line:90%
and they destroy it.

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.280 align:middle line:90%
Kill them, everyone.

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:34.290 align:middle line:84%
So all these different
secret society they start

00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:35.630 align:middle line:90%
not to be in contact anymore.

00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:36.350 align:middle line:90%
Too dangerous.

00:51:36.350 --> 00:51:39.430 align:middle line:84%
if they find one, they
can find the others.

00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:43.210 align:middle line:84%
What happened, unfortunately,
we know what happened.

00:51:43.210 --> 00:51:44.320 align:middle line:90%
Is the disaster.

00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:45.780 align:middle line:90%
Is the catastrophe.

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:48.490 align:middle line:90%
So, they are the only one left.

00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:50.720 align:middle line:90%
Or they are left.

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Very little islands of
the Atlantian knowledge.

00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:56.460 align:middle line:84%
But they aren't in
communication any longer.

00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but can you imagine
it's after the disaster.

00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:02.450 align:middle line:84%
The planet is
completely upside down.

00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:04.300 align:middle line:90%
Atlantis disappeared.

00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:06.540 align:middle line:90%
There are survivors.

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:09.280 align:middle line:84%
But the situation is
really, really difficult.

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:10.580 align:middle line:90%
So you are a secret society.

00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:14.060 align:middle line:84%
So you have knowledge,
energy, seeds.

00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:15.550 align:middle line:90%
OK, I survived.

00:52:15.550 --> 00:52:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Because unfortunately,
I was right.

00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Right at the end you
could make two choices.

00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:26.450 align:middle line:84%
You can make a
choice and say OK.

00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:29.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
be there anymore.

00:52:29.530 --> 00:52:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Human kind is doing
so many mistakes.

00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:35.490 align:middle line:84%
I will keep everything
still secret.

00:52:35.490 --> 00:52:38.180 align:middle line:90%
I will work to bloom the seed.

00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:40.990 align:middle line:84%
I will work to
write up the planet.

00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:42.840 align:middle line:90%
Maybe only the right moment.

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:45.100 align:middle line:90%
But I will hide myself.

00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:47.280 align:middle line:84%
I will keep myself and
my community secret.

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Because it is too risky.
What else.

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Who choose that choice
probably are shambala.

00:52:55.130 --> 00:53:00.430 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] In all these
medical secret societies.

00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:05.980 align:middle line:90%
Others, they decide to open.

00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:07.680 align:middle line:90%
To open their knowledge.

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:09.380 align:middle line:90%
To open their technology.

00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:11.800 align:middle line:90%
And then to gather the survivor.

00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:12.840 align:middle line:90%
To do what.

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:16.900 align:middle line:90%
We try to create a civilization.

00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:19.180 align:middle line:90%
All for a better civilization.

00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:22.310 align:middle line:84%
To give a chance
for the human kind.

00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Maybe civilization what now
we call, Mayas, we call Incas,

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:32.080 align:middle line:84%
we call [INAUDIBLE] we call
pre-Greece civilization.

00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:35.770 align:middle line:90%
We call them Toltecs and Olmecs.

00:53:35.770 --> 00:53:38.500 align:middle line:90%


00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:42.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean now it makes sense why
they have the same language.

00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:47.470 align:middle line:84%
They have the same idea
about life, god, stars.

00:53:47.470 --> 00:53:50.100 align:middle line:90%
They know exactly about time.

00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And they have very
refined calendar.

00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:54.560 align:middle line:90%
They have book of knowledge.

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:57.500 align:middle line:84%
It's the book of the
death for the Egyptian.

00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:00.010 align:middle line:90%
Is the Popul Voh for the Mayans.

00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Is the [INAUDIBLE]
for the Tebetans.

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:06.670 align:middle line:84%
But is with a formulas
we did technical things

00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:07.790 align:middle line:90%
to make it happen.

00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:10.960 align:middle line:84%
In the method of things that
otherwise are impossible.

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:13.950 align:middle line:84%
They have more as
the same technology.

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:19.560 align:middle line:84%
They have the same
attention to the death.

00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:21.480 align:middle line:90%
To the beyond.

00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:23.550 align:middle line:90%
To after death.

00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:24.900 align:middle line:90%
Why.

00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:28.150 align:middle line:90%
Because probably they knew.

00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:30.310 align:middle line:84%
It's their most
important knowledge.

00:54:30.310 --> 00:54:32.160 align:middle line:84%
But they knew also
that unfortunately,

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:32.940 align:middle line:90%
in front of them.

00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:35.520 align:middle line:90%
There is a long period of time.

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:37.950 align:middle line:90%
A long time territory.

00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Where things are not
really so exciting.

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Or they would be
even more difficult.

00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And only after a
long period of time,

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:48.920 align:middle line:84%
they would be finally the
right occasion to do what.

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:50.220 align:middle line:90%
To bloom the seed.

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:54.440 align:middle line:84%
To give back an
opportunity to rise up

00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:56.200 align:middle line:90%
the evolution of this planet.

00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:58.570 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason
why the Egyptians was

00:54:58.570 --> 00:55:02.220 align:middle line:90%
so almost upset about death.

00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And all their ritual
and the mummification.

00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:07.290 align:middle line:90%
Why.

00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:09.820 align:middle line:90%
Because it was trying to guide.

00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:10.790 align:middle line:90%
What.

00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:12.570 align:middle line:90%
Their reincarnation.

00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:15.305 align:middle line:90%
Guide them to come back.

00:55:15.305 --> 00:55:16.670 align:middle line:90%
But come back where.

00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:17.600 align:middle line:90%
And when.

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.780 align:middle line:84%
When and where there
will be finally

00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:24.110 align:middle line:90%
the time for bloom the seed.

00:55:24.110 --> 00:55:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And this was going on for
many civilization for very,

00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:29.950 align:middle line:90%
very, very, very long time.

00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:32.330 align:middle line:90%
To prepare the right moment.

00:55:32.330 --> 00:55:34.180 align:middle line:90%
To prepare the new age.

00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:35.730 align:middle line:90%
The new golden age.

00:55:35.730 --> 00:55:37.400 align:middle line:90%
The age of the re-awakening.

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:41.020 align:middle line:84%
The age of the opening
up of the spirituality.

00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:46.420 align:middle line:84%
They age able finally to
brings back opportunity

00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:48.990 align:middle line:90%
for the entire human.

00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:51.320 align:middle line:90%
And that age is right now.

00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Well I would love to
change this picture.

00:55:53.490 --> 00:55:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Because I like to
talk about this.

00:55:54.670 --> 00:55:55.840 align:middle line:90%
Let's change that picture.

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:57.950 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that's where we sit in.

00:55:57.950 --> 00:56:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Because that is,
in a way, that's

00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:02.350 align:middle line:90%
the goal of the guy on TV, too.

00:56:02.350 --> 00:56:06.170 align:middle line:84%
Is to help them create
this new awakening

00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:08.030 align:middle line:90%
and recreate the golden age.

00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:09.080 align:middle line:90%
The second golden age.

00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:09.810 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:56:09.810 --> 00:56:12.030 align:middle line:90%
So I don't have to tell you.

00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:13.360 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to tell you that.

00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:18.260 align:middle line:84%
So Atlantis has built
a warning and a hope.

00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:22.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a teaching and at
the same time, a warning.

00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:25.860 align:middle line:84%
So I don't have to tell
you that is the age.

00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:26.920 align:middle line:90%
This is the time.

00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:28.940 align:middle line:84%
This is the, you know
that requires age.

00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:31.240 align:middle line:84%
The re-awakening of
the spirituality.

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:37.380 align:middle line:84%
It's in these time also
something that was not planned.

00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:38.280 align:middle line:90%
It's here.

00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:40.830 align:middle line:84%
What that I can talk a
little bit about Damonhur.

00:56:40.830 --> 00:56:44.080 align:middle line:84%
Damonhur is one of
these seed if you want.

00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:47.830 align:middle line:84%
One of these seed that
is blooming at this time.

00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Representing
something this could

00:56:49.450 --> 00:56:51.430 align:middle line:90%
be a perfect secret society.

00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Because we are a few hundred
people close to the mountain.

00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:56.770 align:middle line:90%
Digging in the ground.

00:56:56.770 --> 00:56:59.180 align:middle line:84%
Creating a huge
underground temple.

00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:02.960 align:middle line:84%
With ancient knowledge,
we've ancient language.

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:06.830 align:middle line:84%
We ancient technology
centric and everything.

00:57:06.830 --> 00:57:09.660 align:middle line:84%
But oops we are
not secret anymore.

00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:11.630 align:middle line:84%
We are front are what
we are travelling

00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:12.530 align:middle line:90%
we are inviting people to--

00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:14.510 align:middle line:90%
There's no secrets anymore.

00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:16.770 align:middle line:84%
Yes because the best
way to hide a secret

00:57:16.770 --> 00:57:20.860 align:middle line:84%
is to bringing the secret
in front of everyone.

00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:23.180 align:middle line:90%
Nobody will see about that.

00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:25.980 align:middle line:84%
So we could be a
perfect secret society.

00:57:25.980 --> 00:57:30.340 align:middle line:84%
But the role that we
are playing this game

00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:31.970 align:middle line:90%
is to be in front of everyone.

00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:33.830 align:middle line:84%
It could be two
we inspired work.

00:57:33.830 --> 00:57:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Is to give the chance to
have a spiritual accelerator

00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:38.190 align:middle line:90%
like the temple.

00:57:38.190 --> 00:57:39.760 align:middle line:90%
Because who's coming to visit.

00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Who's coming to
meditate in this place.

00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:43.610 align:middle line:90%
Is receiving.

00:57:43.610 --> 00:57:45.950 align:middle line:84%
When they receive to
wake up their memory.

00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:48.070 align:middle line:90%
To woke up why they are here.

00:57:48.070 --> 00:57:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Because if we're
here, my friend,

00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:52.280 align:middle line:84%
is because we are
the right people.

00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:53.350 align:middle line:90%
The right soul.

00:57:53.350 --> 00:57:54.330 align:middle line:90%
In the right moment.

00:57:54.330 --> 00:57:56.460 align:middle line:90%
To change this planet.

00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:57.750 align:middle line:90%
To bloom the seed.

00:57:57.750 --> 00:58:01.090 align:middle line:90%
And also to bring back Atlantis.

00:58:01.090 --> 00:58:04.080 align:middle line:90%
Well no that's part of Atlantis.

00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.010 align:middle line:90%
Not the bad one.

00:58:05.010 --> 00:58:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Maybe also that part
of evolution if we

00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:10.620 align:middle line:90%
lost when Atlantis disappeared.

00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:13.360 align:middle line:84%
Maybe who knows, to go
in different time travel

00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:15.390 align:middle line:90%
is not possible anymore.

00:58:15.390 --> 00:58:18.450 align:middle line:84%
To change these
events the asteroids

00:58:18.450 --> 00:58:19.980 align:middle line:90%
because it's impossible.

00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:22.051 align:middle line:84%
Is moving too many things.
-You can't do it.

00:58:22.051 --> 00:58:23.750 align:middle line:84%
You can't survive.
-Maybe you can change it.

00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the good
Atlantian will survive.

00:58:26.890 --> 00:58:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And if they survive
all of a sudden someone

00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:33.440 align:middle line:84%
will discover right now,
that Atlantis was there.

00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:35.380 align:middle line:84%
That Atlantis was
doing this and that.

00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:37.530 align:middle line:84%
That Atlantis was,
as I mentioned,

00:58:37.530 --> 00:58:40.230 align:middle line:90%
advise advanced civilization.

00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:43.890 align:middle line:84%
They was using technology
that we still are not using.

00:58:43.890 --> 00:58:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And these will bring
the book of history

00:58:46.690 --> 00:58:48.070 align:middle line:90%
to be completely rewrite.

00:58:48.070 --> 00:58:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And these will be a shake
for the conscious of billions

00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:53.640 align:middle line:90%
of people around the planet.

00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Because people
say oh my goodness

00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:57.660 align:middle line:84%
coming in off from
slaves it was just

00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:00.110 align:middle line:90%
pulling in all a piece of rock.

00:59:00.110 --> 00:59:01.940 align:middle line:84%
But I'm coming from a
completely different

00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:03.740 align:middle line:90%
perspective evolution.

00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:06.590 align:middle line:84%
So for us, is
important to follow

00:59:06.590 --> 00:59:08.340 align:middle line:90%
in all of these researcher.

00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:10.060 align:middle line:90%
As the wasn't pyramid.

00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:11.320 align:middle line:90%
As now India's.

00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:14.190 align:middle line:84%
Or the others and to do
more there or the other

00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:18.380 align:middle line:84%
is another planet because they
could be one of the evidence

00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:22.520 align:middle line:84%
that these Atlantis
time is coming back.

00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And the good part
of the Atlantis

00:59:23.970 --> 00:59:29.070 align:middle line:84%
will finally help us to bloom
a seed that will accelerate

00:59:29.070 --> 00:59:32.780 align:middle line:84%
the evolution of the
conscious of billions

00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:34.120 align:middle line:90%
of people on this planet.

00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is also the reason
why there is Damonhur.

00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:38.080 align:middle line:90%
It is inspiration.

00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Damonhyr is a place where
to reawake the memory.

00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:43.090 align:middle line:84%
Not to become [INAUDIBLE]
because we don't

00:59:43.090 --> 00:59:44.930 align:middle line:90%
want to settle on the truth.

00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:46.620 align:middle line:90%
We are just an instrument.

00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:50.580 align:middle line:10%
But an instrument, a service
of all of this project.

00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:54.440 align:middle line:10%
A project that is the big
picture of the history

00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:56.220 align:middle line:10%
of the human kind

00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:59.290 align:middle line:10%
Wow thanks,
Crotolo [INAUDIBLE],

00:59:59.290 --> 01:00:00.990 align:middle line:10%
ambassador from Damonhur.

01:00:00.990 --> 01:00:01.770 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:00:01.770 --> 01:00:03.090 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:00:03.090 --> 01:00:04.490 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Jay.

01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:06.480 align:middle line:90%
Really pleased to be here.

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really looking
for the next one.

01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:10.290 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:00:10.290 --> 01:00:20.467 align:middle line:90%
