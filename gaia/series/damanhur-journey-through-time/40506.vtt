00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.230 align:middle line:10%
Hey, I'm Jay Weidner, and
we're here today with--

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.280 align:middle line:10%
and I hope I don't mangle this
too much-- Crotalo Sesamo.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.010 align:middle line:10%
He's an ambassador from the
Damanhur School, mystery

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.150 align:middle line:10%
school in northern Italy.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.640 align:middle line:10%
And he's here today to talk
about a plethora of subjects,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.100 align:middle line:10%
and it should be incredibly
entertaining, I think.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.080 align:middle line:90%
How you doing?

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.990 align:middle line:90%
Very good, thank you.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.140 align:middle line:90%
Thank you to invite me out here.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.311 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's great
to have you here.

00:00:36.311 --> 00:00:37.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.000 align:middle line:84%
So let's start
at the beginning.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.460 align:middle line:84%
You come from a very
famous mystery school

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.830 align:middle line:90%
in Italy, the Damanhur School.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:44.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.840 align:middle line:10%
Well, more than
a mystery school,

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.775 align:middle line:10%
we can talk about a
federation of community,

00:00:47.775 --> 00:00:50.660 align:middle line:10%
a spiritual community that's
called Damanhur that was born

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.880 align:middle line:10%
in 1975 from the
vision of [INAUDIBLE],

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.000 align:middle line:10%
and also a group of founders
that was studying to create

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.550 align:middle line:10%
a place where to study and
research their spirituality,

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.129 align:middle line:10%
but also to bring
the spirituality

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.550 align:middle line:10%
in the everyday life.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And so it's been
around since 1975.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes, almost 40 years.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.470 align:middle line:90%
Wow, that's great.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things
that you guys did was you

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.640 align:middle line:84%
wanted to explore what
Atlantis was like, right?

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.150 align:middle line:10%
Well let's say
Damanhur, that comes

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.210 align:middle line:10%
from the name of an
ancient place in Egypt,

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.060 align:middle line:10%
an ancient village that
means city of light,

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.360 align:middle line:10%
it's really an experience
that is coming, if you want,

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.720 align:middle line:10%
from the past, but also from
the future, because Damanhur is

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.990 align:middle line:10%
based on a spiritual research.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And this spiritual research
is not on our religion,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.330 align:middle line:84%
but is really connecting
to the soul journey.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Or if you want, to the
reason why we're here.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And the big picture that bring
us to come back in this time,

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.130 align:middle line:84%
and then to have talent, to have
capacity that we have to apply,

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.490 align:middle line:90%
something that we call mission.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.919 align:middle line:84%
So let's say Damanhur
was born to accomplish

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.509 align:middle line:90%
a spiritual mission.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And to create, in this time,
something pretty unique,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.830 align:middle line:84%
or something that could be as
an example or an inspiration

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.280 align:middle line:90%
for the world.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.430 align:middle line:84%
If you want, a sort of
spiritual accelerator.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Damanhur is probably very
well-known for what we

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.060 align:middle line:90%
call the temple of humankind.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.920 align:middle line:84%
This is really an
incredible place.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.800 align:middle line:84%
It's an underground temple
that we built according

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.760 align:middle line:84%
to the ancient languages,
the sacred geometry,

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.380 align:middle line:84%
or, if you want, the stone
language, the same that many

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.590 align:middle line:84%
civilizations in
the past they used

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.890 align:middle line:84%
in the creation of pyramids and
the creation of sacred temples

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.460 align:middle line:84%
or the stepped pyramids, or
other places that with stones

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.230 align:middle line:84%
was following the signs,
symbols, sacred geometry,

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.420 align:middle line:90%
that are sort of language.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.740 align:middle line:84%
So they left page of a book
of a book of knowledge.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.720 align:middle line:84%
So according to this, we
created an underground temple

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.300 align:middle line:84%
that is following all these
different sacred geometry,

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.110 align:middle line:84%
these stone language,
to create a book.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.050 align:middle line:84%
A book of knowledge, a book
that is able then to talk really

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.870 align:middle line:84%
inside of us, really
directly to the soul,

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.690 align:middle line:84%
and also probably to get
the answer to the reason

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.420 align:middle line:90%
why we are here.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.230 align:middle line:84%
So we created this
magnificent place

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.770 align:middle line:84%
that is more than
6,000 square meters,

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.350 align:middle line:90%
completely digged by hands.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.150 align:middle line:10%
And I mean, I'm lucky, because
I've been living in Damanhur

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.370 align:middle line:10%
for more than 25 years,
and I'm part of the builder

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.670 align:middle line:10%
of the temple, temple
that was built actually

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.010 align:middle line:10%
mostly completely in
secret because-- well,

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.680 align:middle line:10%
this is a long story.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.350 align:middle line:10%
But you can imagine that
probably to ask permission

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.880 align:middle line:10%
to the country to
create something

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.000 align:middle line:10%
like this, well
probably the answer

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.360 align:middle line:10%
will not be very successful.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.580 align:middle line:84%
So we took the risk
to do it in secret.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.350 align:middle line:90%
Then we legalize everything.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:14.180 align:middle line:84%
But the temple represent our
way of seeing the spirituality.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.350 align:middle line:84%
Not only meditate,
not only research,

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.240 align:middle line:90%
but then acting, doing.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.190 align:middle line:90%
Make it happen.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.970 align:middle line:84%
The action is the
most important part

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.520 align:middle line:84%
of what we call the
spiritualization of the matter,

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.240 align:middle line:84%
that is really like
to bring the values,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.050 align:middle line:84%
the significance that the
spirituality is bringing

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.970 align:middle line:84%
into the everyday life,
but also into the things

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.410 align:middle line:90%
that you have around you.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.990 align:middle line:84%
So the temple is the example
that is possible to do it,

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.920 align:middle line:84%
and it's actually still possible
to create incredible places,

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.790 align:middle line:84%
and it's still
possible to-- let's say

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.910 align:middle line:90%
really to create your dream.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Many times, Damanhur is
described as a real dream.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Because even if we was a
little group, even if we start

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.750 align:middle line:84%
with no money support
from big power behind us,

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.910 align:middle line:84%
so the will and the desire to
create this dream all together

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.480 align:middle line:84%
was moving us to create
something that is an example

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.390 align:middle line:84%
that everybody can do
it all over the world.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And this world it seems
it needs so much dreamers.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.350 align:middle line:84%
People able to dream
a different life,

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.530 align:middle line:84%
people able to bring
into the matter what

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.910 align:middle line:90%
they really wish about life.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.990 align:middle line:84%
So Damanhur is all of
this in few worlds.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And the temple, that is
definitely one place that

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.520 align:middle line:84%
is visited from thousands
and thousands of people

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.520 align:middle line:84%
from all over the
world every year,

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.480 align:middle line:84%
is an inspiration for everyone
that wants to change their life

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.710 align:middle line:84%
or transform their
life according

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.040 align:middle line:84%
to their mission, the reason
why they are back here.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Why did you build
it underground?

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Well underground because in
all the ancient knowledge, well,

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.210 align:middle line:84%
where is the most
important thing?

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.230 align:middle line:90%
It's here, inside.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.390 align:middle line:90%
The soul is here inside.

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.370 align:middle line:84%
So every temple, as
also every pyramid,

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.020 align:middle line:84%
there was, let's say, a
pyramid on the surface,

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.660 align:middle line:90%
and then a pyramid underground.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Also in the Catholic
Church they say

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.060 align:middle line:84%
there is the part
on the surface,

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.450 align:middle line:84%
but then the Sancta Sanctorum,
the most sacred and important

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.880 align:middle line:90%
part, are always underground.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.971 align:middle line:84%
-The crypt.
-Exactly.

00:06:18.971 --> 00:06:20.690 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-Or any house.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.180 align:middle line:84%
So being inside
of the earth, it's

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.150 align:middle line:84%
really being inside
of-- or to be in contact

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.600 align:middle line:90%
with the most sacred part.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.330 align:middle line:84%
But there's also
another reason, and this

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.590 align:middle line:84%
is about what in the
past was called the point

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.660 align:middle line:90%
of the back of the dragon.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
energy lines, what

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.930 align:middle line:90%
we call the Synchronic Lines.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Synchronic Lines
are not the only one.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Someone mentioned them as
the lay lines, for example.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.130 align:middle line:90%
Or feng shui, in Chinese.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.950 align:middle line:90%
Or the feng shui in Chinese.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And as we have these energy
lines outside in the planet,

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.010 align:middle line:84%
we have also these
energy lines inside,

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.300 align:middle line:84%
the microlines or,
again, the meridians,

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:06.360 align:middle line:84%
point of the body that are
responding to specific element.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Synchronic Lines
is a study that involved

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:12.280 align:middle line:90%
Damanhur since the beginning.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Well actually, at the
beginning of the beginning,

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.390 align:middle line:84%
we didn't know where
to build Damanhur,

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.890 align:middle line:84%
where to build a temple, because
these energies lines that

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:23.100 align:middle line:84%
are surrounding the
planet in every direction,

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.810 align:middle line:90%
they're moving.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.040 align:middle line:90%
Very slowly, but they're moving.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.500 align:middle line:84%
That means that places
that in the past

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.010 align:middle line:84%
it was pretty important, now
they are not so important.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And other places,
they've been preparing

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.940 align:middle line:90%
to be the one in this time.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.480 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately-- I'm talking
about 1973, 1974-- we didn't

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.640 align:middle line:90%
have them completely mapped.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.610 align:middle line:84%
So Falco and this
first group of people

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.640 align:middle line:84%
went to do many travel
all around the world,

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.930 align:middle line:84%
and then using technique
connecting to the astro travel

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.910 align:middle line:84%
or to channeling.
To do what?

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Well to perceive, to complete
this map of the Synchronic

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Lines, and then
to find out where

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:03.490 align:middle line:90%
is the most important point.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And which are these
important points?

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.661 align:middle line:84%
Where the line are crossing
together, attaching together.

00:08:08.661 --> 00:08:09.360 align:middle line:90%
Intersection.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.390 align:middle line:84%
In that case, we have
really a source of energy,

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.490 align:middle line:84%
a spot of energy that is
really able to influence

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.350 align:middle line:90%
everything and everyone.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.230 align:middle line:84%
So after many years
of traveling-- well,

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.430 align:middle line:84%
it's a funny story,
to tell you the truth.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.660 align:middle line:84%
They realized when
the map was complete

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:30.200 align:middle line:84%
that the most important point
in this time, on this planet,

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.600 align:middle line:84%
it was simply 10 miles
from where Falco was born.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Falco was born in Balangero,
that is a little village

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.830 align:middle line:84%
in Piedmont, in
Italy, and we are,

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Damanhur is in
Baldissero Canavese.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:48.090 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's a funny
story, it's very humoristic,

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:50.670 align:middle line:84%
but again is what
many times happens.

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.900 align:middle line:84%
So we are always going to
travel around to find where

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.190 align:middle line:90%
is the most important things.

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And then again, the
most important things

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.530 align:middle line:90%
is just right inside of us.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:03.500 align:middle line:84%
So when we found out this place,
we decided to create Damanhur

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.420 align:middle line:84%
and to create a
temple of humankind.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Underground because,
well, these energy lines,

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.810 align:middle line:84%
they're going very up into
the sky, but also very deep

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:13.300 align:middle line:90%
into the earth.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:18.780 align:middle line:84%
So according to this, we dig
into the earth to connect,

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:24.530 align:middle line:84%
to plug, this temple,
laboratory, station,

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.530 align:middle line:84%
whatever we want
to call, exactly

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:30.400 align:middle line:84%
with all the energies that
we need for all our research.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty
interesting because when,

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:37.090 align:middle line:84%
then, in the middle of the
'90s, when we legalize all

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:40.650 align:middle line:84%
the structure, all the
temple, when the geologists,

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:47.410 align:middle line:84%
they went to do many tests
about where and how we build all

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:51.430 align:middle line:84%
the structure, they was
absolutely surprised

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:55.630 align:middle line:84%
to discover that we dig the
temple exactly where there is

00:09:55.630 --> 00:10:00.080 align:middle line:84%
a layer of a very special
rock, a stone that

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.320 align:middle line:90%
is called menolite.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean probably people don't
know so much about that

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.690 align:middle line:84%
because these are
stones that normally

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:11.150 align:middle line:84%
you find only in very deep and
profound level of the earth.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:15.410 align:middle line:84%
But these rocks can
be more on the surface

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:18.340 align:middle line:84%
when there is some tectonic
planes of the planet,

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:22.990 align:middle line:84%
as where we are in
where is Damanhur.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:28.210 align:middle line:84%
So this menolite is called
the energetic stone,

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:32.660 align:middle line:84%
where the energy flow
free inside of this rock.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Well we build completely
the temple inside

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:37.940 align:middle line:90%
of these layers of [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.340 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't know that,
because we was following

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.500 align:middle line:84%
our spiritual
research, the knowledge

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.110 align:middle line:84%
according to the
Synchronic Lines.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And this was, let's say, the
practical proof of something

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.490 align:middle line:84%
that is coming from an
ancient part of the knowledge

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:52.670 align:middle line:90%
of the humankind.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:56.340 align:middle line:84%
So talk to me about
your paintings.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.190 align:middle line:84%
Well actually, it's
not really my paintings.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:04.560 align:middle line:84%
It's the painting that, in one
specific seminar that is inside

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.000 align:middle line:84%
of what we call the
Damanhur Mystery School,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.160 align:middle line:84%
we're teaching all
over the world.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.040 align:middle line:84%
This is a pretty interesting
seminar of one of my favorite,

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.890 align:middle line:84%
because I have the
passion about the history,

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.070 align:middle line:90%
the history of humankind.

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:19.900 align:middle line:84%
But let's say not
the history that you

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.130 align:middle line:90%
find in the normal book.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Another kind of history, or
more connecting to the mystery

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:31.710 align:middle line:84%
archaeology that is
trying to describe

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.790 align:middle line:84%
the issue of the
evolution of the humankind

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.710 align:middle line:84%
in a different way, and
not just with the idea

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:40.120 align:middle line:90%
that now we are the top.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.660 align:middle line:84%
At the top of
everything, at the top

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.500 align:middle line:84%
of the organization,
of our resources,

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.140 align:middle line:84%
of the use of energy
and et cetera.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:51.170 align:middle line:84%
But the vision start
with the approach

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:53.220 align:middle line:84%
that well, this
is just one point.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And in the past, probably we was
arriving in point much higher.

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.841 align:middle line:84%
And then we also fall down,
and then we rise again.

00:11:59.841 --> 00:12:00.540 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.700 align:middle line:84%
Cyclic history, instead
of linear history.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.970 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's very interesting
to observe-- and I'm lucky,

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.340 align:middle line:84%
because as an
ambassador of Damanhur,

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm really travelling
all over the world also,

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:16.230 align:middle line:84%
because I'm the one specialized
to create new connection,

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:19.240 align:middle line:84%
new reference point, new
embassy for Damanhur.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's very interesting to see
how, all over the world, more

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.150 align:middle line:84%
and more people are so
interested about history,

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:28.180 align:middle line:84%
and are so interested
to find answer--

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they are.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:29.945 align:middle line:90%
From the history.

00:12:29.945 --> 00:12:31.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems that until
now, we was in a sort of bubble

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.800 align:middle line:84%
where there was someone
telling us what is true,

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.590 align:middle line:90%
what isn't true.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.550 align:middle line:90%
What is black, what is white.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:40.840 align:middle line:84%
What is positive,
what is negative.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.960 align:middle line:90%
Those days are over.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.280 align:middle line:84%
But this seems more
like a box that's

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:49.190 align:middle line:84%
something that then brings
people to be free to discover

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:51.210 align:middle line:90%
what is your truth.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Again, Damanhur is not
here to sell a new truth,

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.510 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not here
to convince anyone.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:00.610 align:middle line:84%
But I'm here to offer something
that might help people

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:03.100 align:middle line:84%
to change their way of
thinking, to see things

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.150 align:middle line:84%
with a different perspective,
to connect element

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:07.380 align:middle line:84%
that before that
was so far away,

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.540 align:middle line:84%
and then they are
creating a perfect role.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.900 align:middle line:90%
So Damanhur is doing this.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't want to bring
everyone to live in Damanhur,

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:20.800 align:middle line:84%
or to join only the
Damanhur things.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Damanhur wants to
be an inspiration

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:25.400 align:middle line:84%
for everyone to find your way--
-An example.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.610 align:middle line:84%
To find your expression
of spirituality,

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.880 align:middle line:90%
whatever is this expression.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And if it's spirituality,
it will be always

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:35.950 align:middle line:84%
in the respect of the
other spirituality,

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:38.740 align:middle line:84%
or the other expression
of what you feel is true.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:39.590 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:44.400 align:middle line:84%
Anyhow, the history, it
seems to be an interesting key

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.100 align:middle line:84%
to shift the
conscious, to change

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.860 align:middle line:90%
the way of thinking of people.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.100 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we believe so.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Well we are in a
period of time that

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:57.480 align:middle line:84%
could be a sort of new
golden age for the humankind.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.330 align:middle line:90%
That would be nice.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Or a period of time
that maybe can bring us

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:06.840 align:middle line:84%
opportunity that for many, many
years was not possible to have.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.530 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to
be ready to catch

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:13.480 align:middle line:84%
this opportunity, or the
opportunity to just pass

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.790 align:middle line:90%
and another time, it's gone.

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.950 align:middle line:84%
Well the idea is that
from the spirituality,

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:21.900 align:middle line:84%
from the history-- and history
is a topic that really touch

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.350 align:middle line:84%
everyone, you don't have
to be a spiritualist person

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:28.660 align:middle line:84%
to be interested about
history-- that might change

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:33.010 align:middle line:84%
the different perspective
about evolution, about history,

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:37.400 align:middle line:84%
about time, about technology,
about what is inside

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.250 align:middle line:84%
of this planet and what
is outside of the planet,

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.100 align:middle line:84%
and the concept that
probably we're not alone,

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.810 align:middle line:84%
because imagine that in
billions and billions of planet

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:48.080 align:middle line:84%
we are the only one with
life is pretty weird

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.240 align:middle line:90%
or absolutely crazy or fantasy.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:55.250 align:middle line:84%
So inside of these
seminars, as we call,

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.450 align:middle line:84%
the ancient history of
humankind, the Atlantis

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:01.560 align:middle line:84%
and pre-Atlantis
history, well, we

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:06.660 align:middle line:84%
talk about a history that start
two millions of years ago,

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:10.390 align:middle line:84%
an history that is
involving this planet.

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:14.070 align:middle line:84%
A little, green, full-of-life
planet, but really

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:17.590 align:middle line:90%
at the corner of our galaxy.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And we start also to talk about
something that is probably

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:23.290 align:middle line:84%
outside of this
planet, something

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:27.840 align:middle line:84%
that could be more connecting
to empires or whatever.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.380 align:middle line:84%
But I mean it doesn't
matter the terms,

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.320 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't matter the names.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And in all these
seminar, we are trying

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:41.140 align:middle line:84%
to passing through these
different period of time,

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:47.650 align:middle line:84%
because we see the past as a
possibility to see the future,

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:50.700 align:middle line:84%
or to give a meaning
to the present.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.510 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason why we are
looking also from the past.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:58.110 align:middle line:84%
The time could be described
also as a wheel, big wheel

00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:59.540 align:middle line:90%
that is moving very slowly.

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:04.810 align:middle line:84%
So let's say this wheel can
bring back some, as I told you,

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:06.130 align:middle line:90%
opportunity.

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:08.610 align:middle line:84%
So if I know how
was in the past,

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:11.430 align:middle line:84%
I may know how could
be the possible future.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:12.180 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.350 align:middle line:84%
If I see how it
went, probably I

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:19.380 align:middle line:84%
might not repeat the same
mistakes, or the same things

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.130 align:middle line:90%
that I already did.

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:24.110 align:middle line:84%
So the past is a way
to see the future.

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And this the reason why we're
teaching these seminars,

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:30.570 align:middle line:84%
because they give the big
frame, the big pictures

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.660 align:middle line:84%
about the history
of the humankind,

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:36.850 align:middle line:84%
but also our personal
position in this big picture.

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:40.180 align:middle line:90%


00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.390 align:middle line:84%
When we start to
talk about Atlantis,

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:47.420 align:middle line:84%
and I know that Atlantis is
one of the topics that inspire,

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.460 align:middle line:84%
you know, make people
to dream, and then, you

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.810 align:middle line:84%
know, their hearts
start to beat strongly,

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:56.000 align:middle line:84%
because everybody's so
inspired by Atlantis.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.390 align:middle line:84%
There's so many people talking
about Atlantis, so many books.

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Plato was probably the first,
but after Plato, there's

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.290 align:middle line:84%
many writer was
trying to describe,

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:12.679 align:middle line:84%
say, locate Atlantis in
many different position

00:17:12.679 --> 00:17:13.390 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:14.090 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:18.191 align:middle line:84%
But actually, in this
moment, in this time,

00:17:18.191 --> 00:17:20.020 align:middle line:90%
Atlantis doesn't exist.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.030 align:middle line:84%
-No, it doesn't.
-Nope.

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:22.839 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:23.810 align:middle line:90%
Sorry about it.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.240 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.500 align:middle line:84%
They either say oh yes,
it's in Santorini in Greece,

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.630 align:middle line:84%
oh no, is the island
of Sardinia in Italy,

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:38.380 align:middle line:84%
oh no, it's Cuba
nearby United States,

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.440 align:middle line:90%
no, is in the island of Malta.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.660 align:middle line:84%
So there are many
different theory,

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:47.250 align:middle line:84%
but actually no one prove
that Atlantis was existing,

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:51.120 align:middle line:84%
that Atlantis was there, it was
this civilization, and so on.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there is element, but
nothing that can really

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:58.820 align:middle line:84%
finally say wow, we are
coming from something

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.800 align:middle line:84%
that was more evolved.
-Right.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And probably we are still, you
know, the result of the fact

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:10.010 align:middle line:90%
of the falling of Atlantis.

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.050 align:middle line:90%
But actually, no proof.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.610 align:middle line:90%


00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Well how to take
to improve, and why

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.022 align:middle line:90%
to take some proof at the end.

00:18:19.022 --> 00:18:20.890 align:middle line:84%
I have to come
back a little bit,

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:22.960 align:middle line:84%
and I have to come
back to Damanhur.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And I have to come
back to Falco.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:30.720 align:middle line:84%
Falco, it is, and it was,
a very [INAUDIBLE] man.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, he passed
this year, the 23 of June.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.900 align:middle line:10%
And this is really
an important moment

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.890 align:middle line:10%
for the entire community, for
the entire Damanhur for what,

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:46.020 align:middle line:10%
who, was Falco, and also
for what he represent.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:51.540 align:middle line:84%
Not only as a spiritual master,
but also as a very incredible

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:56.050 align:middle line:84%
person with the capacity to--
not only to have the vision,

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:58.660 align:middle line:84%
but mostly to have
the memory, the memory

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.298 align:middle line:90%
from where he was coming from.

00:19:01.298 --> 00:19:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And from where he was
coming from-- well,

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.630 align:middle line:84%
we can talk about
future, but again, we

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:09.550 align:middle line:90%
can also talk about past.

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:13.340 align:middle line:84%
We have in Damanhur a
different approach about time.

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Past, future, well, we can
see them as prospective.

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I see in one direction
I see the past, well,

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.030 align:middle line:84%
and then there is the
future, or vice versa.

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And in many spiritual
approach, time is

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.180 align:middle line:90%
also described as a territory.

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:34.301 align:middle line:84%
So everything is present
at the same moment.

00:19:34.301 --> 00:19:35.000 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.240 align:middle line:84%
Also, when we talk
about past life,

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.290 align:middle line:84%
well, it's probably not
correct to say past life.

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:43.780 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about lives,
or experience, that

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.900 align:middle line:90%
are all at the same moment--

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:46.820 align:middle line:90%
Parallel.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.310 align:middle line:90%
In different parallel.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.160 align:middle line:84%
In different places
of this territory.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.200 align:middle line:90%
I like this idea.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And they are all affecting
all of them at the same time.

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:57.870 align:middle line:84%
So again, why have to
look at the past life?

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at the
past life, or lives,

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:03.530 align:middle line:84%
to give understanding
to what is happening

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.830 align:middle line:84%
in this life, in this
actual life, in this moment.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Why I have the talent, why
I hate so much that place,

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:11.540 align:middle line:84%
why I have that
capacity, why I have

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:13.560 align:middle line:90%
these issues always in my life.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Because these is connecting
to all the experience,

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:20.790 align:middle line:84%
and actually from where
we are coming from.

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:24.190 align:middle line:84%
So in this different
vision of time--

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.300 align:middle line:84%
and again, I'm not
here to convince even

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:31.560 align:middle line:84%
if, scientifically speaking,
well, for example, time travel,

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.160 align:middle line:90%
it's possible.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.050 align:middle line:84%
The magazine "Science" says,
yes, time travel is possible,

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:39.170 align:middle line:90%
well, already 10, 15 years ago.

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.110 align:middle line:84%
How to do it, well,
they don't know yet,

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:42.660 align:middle line:90%
or they will not tell us.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.130 align:middle line:90%
They're not gonna tell us, yes.

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:46.630 align:middle line:84%
They're still not telling
us if they did it or not,

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:48.900 align:middle line:90%
but probably yes, but who cares?

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Anyhow, the concept of time
as a territory and the concept

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:57.385 align:middle line:84%
of time traveling, it was in
every ancient civilization--

00:20:57.385 --> 00:20:58.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it was.

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:00.410 align:middle line:90%
Connecting to the spirituality.

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:04.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we want to see
another vision about Egyptian,

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.490 align:middle line:84%
for example, well, I'm
in love with Egyptian,

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:10.160 align:middle line:84%
as I'm in love with all
the Mesoamerican culture

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.550 align:middle line:84%
because, well,
[INAUDIBLE], rattlesnake,

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:15.370 align:middle line:84%
is the sacred animal, is
the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:17.260 align:middle line:84%
It's half [INAUDIBLE],
half rattlesnack.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:18.860 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.670 align:middle line:90%
Just publicity for my name.

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:22.010 align:middle line:90%
Promotion of the [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Well anyhow, for example, all
these important civilization,

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:32.110 align:middle line:84%
they was so focusing themselves
on the beyond, on the death,

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:35.420 align:middle line:84%
with all these ritual,
the mummification

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:39.550 align:middle line:84%
and the preparation with
all the elements, and so on.

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, many times people will
say oh, my goodness, they

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:45.770 align:middle line:84%
was so sad people always
thinking about death

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:46.820 align:middle line:90%
and blah, blah, blah.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:47.920 align:middle line:90%
Superstitious.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:48.900 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.120 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is not true.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was absolutely
happy civilization.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.170 align:middle line:90%
Much happier than ours.

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:57.010 align:middle line:90%
Really-- absolutely.

00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, they was really connecting
to the true sense of life.

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:05.010 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
times, what they did,

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:08.520 align:middle line:90%
it was to recreate a bridge.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.220 align:middle line:90%
What it means?

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:14.230 align:middle line:84%
It means that, if we have
to come back, because if we

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:17.670 align:middle line:84%
believe in the reincarnation and
if we believe in the alignment,

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:20.610 align:middle line:84%
and the alignment
is very briefly

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:23.720 align:middle line:84%
passing through all the
experience, then to bring

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.210 align:middle line:90%
the matter to become light.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:28.530 align:middle line:90%
The fore is become energy.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:31.560 align:middle line:84%
So we refine constantly
to one experience

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.850 align:middle line:84%
after an experience,
one life after one life,

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:36.070 align:middle line:90%
it takes a little while.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:38.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean technically, one
life could be enough.

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.790 align:middle line:90%
Practically, doesn't so well.

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:44.170 align:middle line:84%
So we need to come back and
come back and come back.

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:45.620 align:middle line:90%
So what happened?

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.980 align:middle line:84%
That is really
important, to come back

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.780 align:middle line:84%
in the right place, in the right
moment, in the right situation.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:52.480 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.909 align:middle line:84%
-Isn't that true?
-Yes.

00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:56.610 align:middle line:84%
So what they did,
in a certain way,

00:22:56.610 --> 00:23:01.280 align:middle line:84%
through all these rituals,
all this complexity connecting

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.490 align:middle line:90%
to death, they create bridge.

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Bridge into the beyond, into the
threshhold, into the invisible.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.820 align:middle line:90%
To do what?

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.940 align:middle line:90%
To guide the soul.

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Not to be lost,
but to come back.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Or to, if we want,
to time travel

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:21.800 align:middle line:84%
exactly in the right
place, in the right moment,

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.860 align:middle line:90%
in the right situation.

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:26.440 align:middle line:84%
Could be a completely
different vision.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And actually, talking about
the different time travel,

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:34.940 align:middle line:84%
well, the low cost, if I can say
like this, of the time travel,

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:36.770 align:middle line:84%
when you have really a
lot of things to do in one

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:39.950 align:middle line:90%
place, which method you use?

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:41.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, the reincarnation.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:45.920 align:middle line:84%
You go there, you are
born in that place,

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and then you spend your
life in that place,

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.046 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
lot of work to do.

00:23:50.046 --> 00:23:51.660 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-That's it.

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:54.670 align:middle line:84%
So, completely
different perspective.

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:55.410 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:58.870 align:middle line:84%
Maybe also Falco and
the Damanhurians,

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:03.120 align:middle line:84%
they was traveling in many
different moment of time

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.970 align:middle line:84%
to come back in this
time, to realize Damanhur,

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:09.350 align:middle line:84%
to realize something is not
just a community or just

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:middle line:84%
a federation of
spiritual communities,

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.590 align:middle line:84%
not just to create a
temple, but is really

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:20.670 align:middle line:84%
like to create an instrument
that could be an inspiration,

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:25.260 align:middle line:84%
an acceleration, for the
spiritual reawakening

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:28.831 align:middle line:84%
of the people of this world,
or as much people we can.

00:24:28.831 --> 00:24:30.240 align:middle line:84%
-Right.
-Why?

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
the right moment.

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:34.050 align:middle line:84%
This is the right
moment to finally catch

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:36.000 align:middle line:90%
that occasion that are coming.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.570 align:middle line:90%
Why is this the right moment?

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:44.970 align:middle line:84%
Well because finally we
are in a piece of time,

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:47.540 align:middle line:84%
in a time frame,
that if we want,

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:51.240 align:middle line:84%
it was prepared for
such a long time,

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:56.150 align:middle line:84%
we can also imagine since the
end of Atlantis, so since 10,

00:24:56.150 --> 00:25:01.390 align:middle line:84%
probably 12,000 years ago,
when the great floods arrive

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:05.640 align:middle line:84%
and unfortunately destroy
that civilization.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And for a long time, it was
not possible to recreate

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:14.750 align:middle line:84%
this same occasion, occasion
that now it seems to be here.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Well here then not probably
today, but in this timeframes,

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:20.160 align:middle line:90%
in these years.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And I can imagine
that-- I mean people

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.231 align:middle line:84%
are really perceiving that
there's a big change all

00:25:26.231 --> 00:25:27.190 align:middle line:84%
over the world.
-Yeah.

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.950 align:middle line:90%
Everybody can feel it.

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:28.660 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.081 align:middle line:84%
And there is also an
acceleration in this.

00:25:30.081 --> 00:25:30.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes, there is.

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And the entire system
is now on the way

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:38.060 align:middle line:84%
to be changed simply
because finally people

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.130 align:middle line:90%
are attaching their values.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:43.575 align:middle line:84%
Well for me, the economic
crisis is just an opportunity--

00:25:43.575 --> 00:25:44.610 align:middle line:90%
I agree with that.

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:48.280 align:middle line:84%
To-- well, to bring
people, even if sometimes

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:51.080 align:middle line:84%
it's a painful process,
I understand that,

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:54.500 align:middle line:84%
but really to bring
back out of that box,

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.300 align:middle line:84%
the box of what is
true, what is not true,

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.950 align:middle line:84%
what is white or what is
black, what the society is

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:02.360 align:middle line:90%
telling us what we have to do.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:07.670 align:middle line:84%
So how come I feel safe if
I receive a piece of paper

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:10.290 align:middle line:84%
and in this piece of paper
there is one zero more,

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:13.020 align:middle line:84%
and I feel lost if I
receive a piece of paper

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:14.460 align:middle line:90%
and there is a zero less.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:15.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.850 align:middle line:90%
Wait a moment.

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:18.600 align:middle line:90%
It is true, it is not true.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:22.640 align:middle line:84%
What is simply a big
game, or something fake.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.210 align:middle line:90%
What is really value?

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:28.262 align:middle line:84%
Friendship is a value, or the
piece of paper are values.

00:26:28.262 --> 00:26:29.195 align:middle line:90%
I would say the friendship.

00:26:29.195 --> 00:26:32.260 align:middle line:84%
Is the family one
values of my life,

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:36.231 align:middle line:84%
or is simply go at work to
earn money to spend more money.

00:26:36.231 --> 00:26:36.930 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:41.190 align:middle line:84%
So many people are touched
in these last five years,

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:45.051 align:middle line:84%
since the crisis of 2008, in
their values, in what is true,

00:26:45.051 --> 00:26:45.750 align:middle line:90%
what is not true.

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And they are
questioning themselves.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And they are trying
to find new answer.

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.831 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason why we have to
be ready to help these people.

00:26:53.831 --> 00:26:56.330 align:middle line:84%
-That's right.
-To give them answer.

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And in this, Damanhur could
be a great inspiration,

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:04.210 align:middle line:84%
as Gaiam TV is absolutely great
inspiration for many people

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:06.780 align:middle line:84%
that are looking for
new answer, because this

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.110 align:middle line:90%
is the time of change.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:12.300 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also used to say that
change doesn't mean that we

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:14.550 align:middle line:90%
have to destroy our society.

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:16.270 align:middle line:84%
We're not here to
destroy anything.

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:18.180 align:middle line:84%
We're here to
change the society.

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:21.190 align:middle line:84%
But since now the
perspective was

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:23.230 align:middle line:90%
that we was waiting someone.

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:24.400 align:middle line:90%
President.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.560 align:middle line:84%
The president will
change our society.

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.270 align:middle line:84%
The important person will come
and will change the society.

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Say OK, [INAUDIBLE].
-Yeah.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:32.240 align:middle line:84%
-No.
-No.

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.639 align:middle line:84%
-That is completely different.
-Yeah.

00:27:34.639 --> 00:27:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Why I'm talking about
a spiritual awake?

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.260 align:middle line:90%
Why I'm talking about dreamers?

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Because only will people, they
will make the click inside.

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And they will really
touch their soul,

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.840 align:middle line:84%
and they will really touch
their values, their dreams.

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:53.280 align:middle line:84%
The reason why it's good to
spend one's life-- so only

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.830 align:middle line:84%
with that conscious
they will really change

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:58.940 align:middle line:90%
the society from the bottom.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.840 align:middle line:84%
So we are the people that
will change the society,

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.600 align:middle line:84%
and not the big
important people,

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.690 align:middle line:90%
not the VIP, not the president.

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:08.990 align:middle line:84%
But until a certain number of
people will not be reawakened,

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:10.780 align:middle line:90%
this will not be possible.

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Why, for example, am I going to
choose to live as a community?

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:19.310 align:middle line:84%
Because for us, community is
an instrument to create dream.

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Because while alone,
as an individual,

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.980 align:middle line:90%
well, I can do a lot of things.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.290 align:middle line:90%
A lot.

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:27.040 align:middle line:90%
But not everything.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.060 align:middle line:90%
Not all.

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:28.820 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Nope.

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:29.740 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: When
I'm in a group--

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:30.960 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: You need a team.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.820 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: When I'm in a
team, when I'm in a community,

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.230 align:middle line:90%
I can move the mindset.

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:37.080 align:middle line:90%
Everything is possible.

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.740 align:middle line:84%
It's more difficult,
but I can do it.

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And one of these examples--
a little group of people,

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:48.150 align:middle line:84%
no money, in the north of Italy
in a valley that was completely

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:51.160 align:middle line:84%
poor-- I mean, with
this same commitment,

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:54.390 align:middle line:84%
with this same dream,
we create something that

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:56.570 align:middle line:90%
is an example for everyone.

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:59.230 align:middle line:90%
So why not to do it even better?

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:00.390 align:middle line:90%
Why not to do it here?

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:02.150 align:middle line:90%
Why not to do it in India?

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:03.940 align:middle line:90%
Why not to do it in Japan?

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Why not to do it
all over the world?

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.140 align:middle line:84%
So community could be
also one of the answer

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.531 align:middle line:90%
for-- for the people--

00:29:11.531 --> 00:29:12.530 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: For the problems.

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:15.430 align:middle line:84%
 --to really
realize their dreams.

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And also, to find out
other people where I

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:21.595 align:middle line:84%
can really face the same
values, the same beliefs.

00:29:21.595 --> 00:29:23.270 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: So they
know they're not alone.

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, because this
planet is so full of people

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.880 align:middle line:84%
that are feeling so lonely.
JAY WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is extremely the
opposite of what's happening

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:33.970 align:middle line:84%
physically because
people are going,

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:35.660 align:middle line:84%
you know, in big cities,
millions and millions

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:38.070 align:middle line:84%
of people who live
together, they don't even

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:40.310 align:middle line:84%
know each other who is living
in the other apartment in front

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:42.660 align:middle line:84%
of them.
It's crazy.

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.650 align:middle line:84%
So people are coming
back to live outside

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:46.540 align:middle line:84%
of the city in the
villages because there's

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:48.810 align:middle line:90%
more the sense of community.

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:53.030 align:middle line:84%
So we need the group, we
need the others, to realize,

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:54.110 align:middle line:90%
to make it happen.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:57.740 align:middle line:84%
So we believe that this is
the moment where people are

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:00.650 align:middle line:84%
bringing back their
conscious of their power,

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:02.410 align:middle line:84%
of their possibility,
their possibility

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:05.220 align:middle line:84%
to change the world,
to change the society,

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.740 align:middle line:90%
to change actually their life.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And together to do
it for a better wish.

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:15.070 align:middle line:90%
Whatever is then your values.

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And if it's a value,
if it's spiritually,

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:20.640 align:middle line:84%
it would be in the respect
of the other values

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.525 align:middle line:90%
and with the other people.

00:30:21.525 --> 00:30:22.391 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: That's right.

00:30:22.391 --> 00:30:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Because this is another
magical word-- respect.

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:27.880 align:middle line:84%
We are still killing
people in the name of God.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.990 align:middle line:84%
actually, this is one of the
most recent unfortunately.

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:31.910 align:middle line:90%
And this is crazy.

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:35.320 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't, I mean, fit
spirituality with this.

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Religion probably
are something that

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:39.830 align:middle line:84%
was working for a long time,
but now probably they are not

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:42.900 align:middle line:84%
giving any more answer,
and people are trying

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.950 align:middle line:84%
to find other answer
because killing in the name

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:48.920 align:middle line:90%
of a religion, it's crazy.

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:51.820 align:middle line:84%
It's completely something
that is insane but is

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.150 align:middle line:90%
what happened at the moment.

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:59.650 align:middle line:84%
So that is why this time,
it's so, so important.

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And actually for
me, this process

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:06.270 align:middle line:84%
was already starting
in 1989 and 1990,

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:11.860 align:middle line:84%
or around that
part of time where

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:15.230 align:middle line:90%
the Berlin Wall fell down.

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, Falco was
always saying, well my friend,

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:20.410 align:middle line:90%
don't forget.

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:24.610 align:middle line:84%
When a wall is falling down,
it's not only in one way

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:26.220 align:middle line:90%
but in the both way.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:30.270 align:middle line:84%
So it was, let's say,
for the time, the end

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:31.660 align:middle line:90%
of what we call the communists.

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:34.720 align:middle line:84%
But it was also the
beginning of the end

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:38.990 align:middle line:84%
of the west, of the free
market, of all the system.

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And now, we are just simply
at the beginning of this.

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.911 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't know if to say to
the beginning, in the middle,

00:31:44.911 --> 00:31:45.610 align:middle line:90%
or the end.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:46.784 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel at
the end, actually.

00:31:46.784 --> 00:31:47.550 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Not quite.

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:49.080 align:middle line:84%
Close, maybe, but--
-Close.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, since
2008, not many things

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:54.460 align:middle line:90%
are changed in the system.

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And the people are still
sitting in the same chair,

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:59.870 align:middle line:84%
the same one that was
creating all this disaster.

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:04.690 align:middle line:84%
But well, you know, probably
it's also good like this

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:06.510 align:middle line:90%
because we need to be shaked.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And more than a
tsunami-- because then

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:13.090 align:middle line:84%
there is also this idea that oh,
2012, there will be a disaster.

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:14.941 align:middle line:84%
Something will kill
and blah blah blah.

00:32:14.941 --> 00:32:15.640 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.410 align:middle line:84%
I always say the most effective
tsunami is the one that

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:21.896 align:middle line:84%
is touching your pocket because
that is really touching you

00:32:21.896 --> 00:32:24.760 align:middle line:84%
a lot, because when there
is a tsunami in Indonesia,

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.310 align:middle line:90%
they are saying oh, poor people.

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:28.480 align:middle line:84%
For one week, everybody
is so impatient.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:32.380 align:middle line:84%
This and some money,
and that's it.

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is a tsunami that is
really touching you every day,

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.600 align:middle line:90%
every single moment.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.880 align:middle line:90%
So that is about this time.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is also the reason
why there is Damanhur.

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:49.200 align:middle line:84%
So Damanhur is something
that is a project that is

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.380 align:middle line:90%
not just for this generation.

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:51.620 align:middle line:90%
It's for many generations.

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And the temple is a
gift for the humankind

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:58.400 align:middle line:84%
as an example that can inspire
people all over the world.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And the fact to come
to visit down Damanhur,

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:04.460 align:middle line:84%
it's really like to be
in contact with energy

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:06.609 align:middle line:90%
that are talking silent.

00:33:06.609 --> 00:33:07.875 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter
what you believe

00:33:07.875 --> 00:33:10.540 align:middle line:84%
and it also doesn't matter for
which reason you're coming.

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:13.720 align:middle line:84%
So this is also an
invitation for Gaiam TV

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.880 align:middle line:84%
to come very soon
to visit Damanhur.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:17.660 align:middle line:90%
We'd love to.

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:18.880 align:middle line:90%
We love Italy.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, be there.
Be there.

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:22.920 align:middle line:90%
Enter into this temple.

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.010 align:middle line:90%
That is not a visit.

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:25.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, we call a
visit of the temple,

00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:27.850 align:middle line:84%
but it's an experience
in the temple.

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:31.320 align:middle line:84%
Enter in contact
with that energy,

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.960 align:middle line:84%
it's really like to
start a dialogue inside

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.890 align:middle line:84%
of yourself, inside with your
soul, touching the reason

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:37.950 align:middle line:90%
why you are there.

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And maybe will not to be
a click that you will have

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:43.180 align:middle line:90%
immediately into the temple.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:45.740 align:middle line:84%
But maybe your
dream in your life,

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:49.600 align:middle line:84%
then there will be this
change, the crisis.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.325 align:middle line:84%
Well actually, I love crisis.
JAY WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:33:51.325 --> 00:33:52.410 align:middle line:90%
You know why?

00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, because crises
are the only moment

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.324 align:middle line:90%
where you are open to change.

00:33:56.324 --> 00:33:57.190 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: That's right.

00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:59.145 align:middle line:84%
Because when everything
is going well,

00:33:59.145 --> 00:34:01.040 align:middle line:84%
who wants to change?
I don't know.

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.375 align:middle line:84%
I want to keep it
if that's fine.

00:34:02.375 --> 00:34:03.175 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Absolutely.

00:34:03.175 --> 00:34:05.861 align:middle line:84%
A divorce, or a death, or--
-Whatever.

00:34:05.861 --> 00:34:07.060 align:middle line:84%
 --could be the
greatest catalyst--

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:08.870 align:middle line:90%
Or the '40s, you know.

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:11.679 align:middle line:84%
The crisis of the '40s, the
crisis of the '20s, the crisis

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:13.840 align:middle line:84%
of-- well, the crises
for me in this case

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:17.960 align:middle line:84%
are the knock, the knocking
of the soul at the door.

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.120 align:middle line:90%
Like, hello.

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.584 align:middle line:90%
There be someone there?

00:34:20.584 --> 00:34:22.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're not
really doing the life

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:24.239 align:middle line:90%
that you're supposed to do.

00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:26.170 align:middle line:90%
Time to do something else.

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And then the crises
are an opportunity

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:33.489 align:middle line:84%
to finally change life according
to the reason why we're here.

00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:35.449 align:middle line:90%
So I'm really inspired.

00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:36.719 align:middle line:84%
And the mystery
school, actually,

00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:40.170 align:middle line:84%
is probably the most
powerful instrument

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:43.230 align:middle line:84%
we can offer to everyone
all over the world

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:47.650 align:middle line:84%
to give to every one
instrument to touch themselves

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:50.150 align:middle line:90%
and to transform people.

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:52.730 align:middle line:84%
So people, they need to
have practical instruments

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:58.830 align:middle line:84%
to support this transformation,
to support the realization,

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:00.590 align:middle line:90%
which is the mission, you know.

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Also, how to
accomplish the mission.

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:05.720 align:middle line:84%
So that is what people
are looking for.

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:08.990 align:middle line:84%
The answer are also
the possibility

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:12.190 align:middle line:84%
to be enough
practical, because too

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:14.340 align:middle line:84%
many people are talking
about spirituality

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.880 align:middle line:90%
only in a structured level.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:19.260 align:middle line:84%
We need them to have
practical example.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:20.350 align:middle line:90%
I need to have instrument.

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:23.200 align:middle line:84%
I need to have something
that I know I can use it

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.220 align:middle line:90%
and it actually is working.

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I will
feel lost again.

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:32.450 align:middle line:84%
So in these, the answer
of the spirituality

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:35.640 align:middle line:84%
need to be always
a practical answer.

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm meditating when
I'm crossing my legs,

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:42.520 align:middle line:84%
but I also "medit-ating"
action, "medit-action,"

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:46.070 align:middle line:84%
when I move my hands, when
I'm working for a bigger goal,

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:49.311 align:middle line:84%
when I'm doing something with
my hands, when I'm creating art,

00:35:49.311 --> 00:35:50.010 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Before, we was
talking about art.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Art is another incredible
expression of spirituality

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.990 align:middle line:84%
into the matter,
meanings into the matter.

00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Anyhow, so this could
be the general idea

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:08.280 align:middle line:84%
of why this is the moment,
or the important moment.

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:11.630 align:middle line:84%
So we we're talking about
your-- the Damanhur Institution

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:14.160 align:middle line:84%
and mystery school
in northern Italy,

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.690 align:middle line:84%
and now we're going to talk
about some of the research

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:18.420 align:middle line:84%
that you guys have
done, which I think

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:21.560 align:middle line:84%
is really fascinating,
especially on Atlantis.

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think your whole reasoning
for wanting to go to Atlantis

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:29.670 align:middle line:84%
to find out what it was like
so that we know how to live

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:32.550 align:middle line:84%
is really a pretty
interesting idea.

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:34.470 align:middle line:90%
So tell me how it got started.

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:37.995 align:middle line:84%
Well, we talk a little
bit about before,

00:36:37.995 --> 00:36:41.650 align:middle line:84%
and about the Damanhur
mission, and also the mission

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:45.200 align:middle line:84%
to be this inspiration in
this time in the world.

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.280 align:middle line:84%
But if we are coming
back to the vision

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:52.877 align:middle line:84%
that time is a territory
and then in this territory,

00:36:52.877 --> 00:36:54.010 align:middle line:84%
there's many things
that are going

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:56.760 align:middle line:90%
on in many different places.

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
there is something,

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:04.780 align:middle line:84%
as Atlantis, that unfortunately
is still that is non-existent.

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:05.860 align:middle line:90%
Everybody is so exciting.

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:10.357 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is feeling that it
is true, but actually there's--

00:37:10.357 --> 00:37:11.360 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: No proof.
-No.

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.490 align:middle line:90%
It's not proof.

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:14.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a sort of
invisible wall that--

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:15.790 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Outside of Plato.

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:16.880 align:middle line:90%
Plato, but that's it.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:17.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's it.

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:19.960 align:middle line:84%
So there is an
invisible wall that it

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:24.470 align:middle line:84%
seems to separate Atlantis
with this other period of time.

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you imagine
that Atlantis,

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:31.250 align:middle line:84%
it was really existent
and it was really

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:34.060 align:middle line:84%
one of the highest
moment of what

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:38.480 align:middle line:84%
could be the evolution,
the expression,

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:44.800 align:middle line:84%
the capacity of the
human kind to evolve.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
Atlantis is also

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.680 align:middle line:90%
the one that was falling down--

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.920 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Yep, sunk.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Also probably with
two different phase.

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:59.700 align:middle line:84%
One, extremely exciting, the
golden age of the human kind.

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:03.070 align:middle line:84%
But also one that is hmm,
probably not so nice.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:04.520 align:middle line:90%
Not probably so good.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.950 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Some
dark magic, maybe.

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:06.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:10.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the power
that corrupt, or when

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:16.340 align:middle line:84%
you have the power of
death and life, I mean,

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.540 align:middle line:90%
you can do whatever you want.

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:18.520 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Right, corrupt.

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And not anymore
what you have to do.

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:25.480 align:middle line:84%
But if in any case, we can
imagine that in the history

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.590 align:middle line:84%
that we are living
at this moment,

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:33.550 align:middle line:84%
we are still paying the
price of what Atlantis was.

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And we are paying the
price of this catastrophe.

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:43.450 align:middle line:84%
It might be interesting or it
might be important to prepare

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:49.700 align:middle line:84%
the next, the next time frame,
the next possible future,

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:54.735 align:middle line:84%
to Atlantis and also to many
other places in this territory.

00:38:54.735 --> 00:38:57.240 align:middle line:90%


00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:01.210 align:middle line:84%
In Damanhur, we talk
about time travel.

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Actually, we don't
share so much anymore

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:06.900 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise,
Damanhur, it's a little bit

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:07.600 align:middle line:90%
misunderstood.

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:10.800 align:middle line:84%
So then people are just
coming from the time

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.017 align:middle line:90%
travel and not anymore for--

00:39:12.017 --> 00:39:12.850 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Sprituality.

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:16.040 align:middle line:84%
 --the spiritual research
and for the inspiration,

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:16.970 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:19.750 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going to talk
so much, but a little bit--

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:21.449 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: That's all right.
- --for sure.

00:39:21.449 --> 00:39:22.410 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: I understand.

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And talking about
Atlantis, there

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:30.340 align:middle line:84%
is something that in the
seminar that I mentioned before.

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:34.020 align:middle line:84%
We are sharing, and we are
sharing something that is,

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:37.760 align:middle line:90%
well, a story, crazy things.

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't want
to convince you,

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:43.700 align:middle line:84%
but it's really connecting
to Falco, to Damanhur,

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:45.890 align:middle line:90%
and to the possible future.

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:50.570 align:middle line:84%
So let's say if in this time,
Atlantis is still not existing,

00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:54.430 align:middle line:84%
but we are trying to
reconnect these two

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:57.240 align:middle line:84%
different territories, these
two different times, because it

00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:00.780 align:middle line:84%
really seems that there
is a fracture before when

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:02.830 align:middle line:90%
there was Atlantis and after.

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And maybe finally, we can find
out how to cross this fracture

00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:12.160 align:middle line:84%
and then to reconnect
and maybe to suddenly

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.280 align:middle line:90%
appear something here.

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:16.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe someone
will discover

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:20.450 align:middle line:84%
an element that will finally
say that Atlantis was true.

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, to do all of this,
probably since the beginning

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:29.740 align:middle line:84%
of Damanhur, there was
connection, time travelling,

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:34.640 align:middle line:84%
line into time able to
connect and to reconnect,

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:37.810 align:middle line:84%
to bring information,
to bring knowledge,

00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:44.190 align:middle line:84%
to help then the preparation
of this actual time.

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:47.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the '80s,
the beginning of the '80s.

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:49.330 align:middle line:84%
At the time, the
temple, unfortunately,

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:51.470 align:middle line:90%
was not still complete.

00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And you can imagine that the
temple is not only a temple

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:59.260 align:middle line:84%
but is also a laboratory,
or also maybe a station.

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:00.540 align:middle line:90%
Not a train station.

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a time station, or a
dimensional station, or a--

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:03.920 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Astral travel.

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.340 align:middle line:90%
 --astral station.

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:06.250 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:08.490 align:middle line:84%
The fantasy could be
just a limitation.

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:12.260 align:middle line:84%
But because we built
Damanhur according

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:15.850 align:middle line:84%
to the study of the
synchronic lines,

00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:18.610 align:middle line:84%
actually, the synchronic
lines, their movement

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:22.370 align:middle line:84%
are creating also a
lot of natural gate--

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:24.100 align:middle line:90%
dimensional gate, time gate.

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:26.620 align:middle line:90%
Well, just to give an example.

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Just remember the
Bermuda Triangle.

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:33.270 align:middle line:84%
Remember, very
[INAUDIBLE] in the past.

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:36.720 align:middle line:84%
Boats, aeroplane,
people, stuff that was

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:39.760 align:middle line:90%
disappearing in that area.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's say in this planet,
there's many different places

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.570 align:middle line:84%
that are like
natural gates, doors

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:51.310 align:middle line:84%
that you can open for get
dimension times very far away.

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:53.360 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Going to
the past or the future.

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:54.070 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:55.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, also
different dimensions.

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:59.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, I mean, it's just to
touch very briefly that topic.

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Around Damanhur, there is
some of this natural gate,

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:04.940 align:middle line:90%
and it's actually what?

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:07.330 align:middle line:84%
At the time, it was
used to do what?

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, to do a time
travel, a time

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:14.780 align:middle line:84%
travel that was not
the first, and it

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:17.510 align:middle line:90%
was not also the last one.

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:19.890 align:middle line:84%
A time travel to do
what in particular?

00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:29.890 align:middle line:84%
To brings back symbols,
signs, images about Atlantis.

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:34.604 align:middle line:84%
Let's say like to help to
make Atlantis more real.

00:42:34.604 --> 00:42:35.470 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: I understand.

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe to cross this sort
of fracture between this time

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:40.870 align:middle line:90%
and the other time.

00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:46.900 align:middle line:84%
But there is a problem because
there is different possibility

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.290 align:middle line:90%
in the time travel.

00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:52.800 align:middle line:84%
We already mentioned one, the
low cost of reincarnation.

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Let's say we are
all time traveler.

00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:57.340 align:middle line:90%


00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Another one is the
physical time travel.

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Well actually, you
physically, you jump

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:05.740 align:middle line:90%
inside of one of these doors.

00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:08.420 align:middle line:84%
You disappear from
this time, and you

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:11.330 align:middle line:84%
appear from another
door in another time.

00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Actually, mostly more
easy to jump into the past

00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:17.750 align:middle line:90%
than to jump into the future.

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:19.930 align:middle line:84%
Future, pretty
complicated or almost

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:21.530 align:middle line:84%
impossible because
future is something

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:22.520 align:middle line:90%
that we are creating--

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.910 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Hasn't
been created yet.

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:25.890 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:31.300 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately, to
bring pictures back,

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:33.170 align:middle line:90%
there is a little problem.

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:35.720 align:middle line:84%
The problem is one of the
rule of the time travel,

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:39.200 align:middle line:84%
and the rule is that you cannot
export complexity, let's say.

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.147 align:middle line:84%
You cannot bring
anything with you.

00:43:41.147 --> 00:43:41.980 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Makes sense.

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:44.070 align:middle line:90%
So you can just go naked.

00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Like Arnold Schwarzenegger
in "The Terminator."

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:47.087 align:middle line:90%
Eh, something like that.

00:43:47.087 --> 00:43:47.920 align:middle line:90%
It's Something like that.

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.580 align:middle line:84%
So even "The Terminator"
is coming after.

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:52.010 align:middle line:90%
The movie was coming after this.

00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:53.630 align:middle line:90%
This is true.

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Well anyhow, so you
can just go naked.

00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:58.227 align:middle line:84%
You cannot bring video
camera, camera, whatever.

00:43:58.227 --> 00:43:59.260 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Sure, makes sense.

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:01.100 align:middle line:90%
So what to do?

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:05.980 align:middle line:84%
So at the time, Falco decided
to invite another person

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:10.050 align:middle line:84%
to this incredible journey,
to this time travel, actually

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:12.260 align:middle line:84%
a very good friend of
him and of Damanhur,

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:15.920 align:middle line:90%
a painter called Dovilio Brero.

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately also, Dovilio
passed some years ago.

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:24.960 align:middle line:84%
But Dovilio is a painter
with an incredible capacity

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:28.310 align:middle line:84%
to paint exactly what
he saw with his eyes,

00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:33.087 align:middle line:84%
like to be a sort
of alive camera.

00:44:33.087 --> 00:44:34.020 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Perfect memory.

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Perfect memory, but also
the capacity to paint with so

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:41.860 align:middle line:90%
many details what he remember.

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:44.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to tell you that
he accept this invitation,

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:52.280 align:middle line:84%
and they both, Falco and Dovilio
at the right time through one

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:54.990 align:middle line:84%
of these gates in
the perfect moment,

00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:58.870 align:middle line:84%
they physically jump
inside of the gate,

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:03.410 align:middle line:84%
disappeared from this time,
and actually appear-- well,

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:04.920 align:middle line:90%
there was someone waiting them.

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:06.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are
not journey that you

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:09.540 align:middle line:90%
can do whatever you want.

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:14.080 align:middle line:84%
So there is always a
connection on the two sides.

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:17.670 align:middle line:84%
So they appear from
one of these time gates

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:20.930 align:middle line:84%
on the time, the
time of Atlantis--

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:23.590 align:middle line:90%
before the disaster for sure.

00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:27.565 align:middle line:84%
And they spent three days and
three nights in the capital

00:45:27.565 --> 00:45:33.190 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis in the city that
as Plato was describing,

00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:37.500 align:middle line:84%
it was the city done on
rings surrounding from water,

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:41.810 align:middle line:84%
exactly how he did
a long time ago.

00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And they went exactly
there and to the capital,

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:48.050 align:middle line:84%
because the capital was the
place that was representing

00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:51.200 align:middle line:84%
better than others
the entire culture,

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:53.394 align:middle line:84%
the entire civilization of
Atlantis that actually--

00:45:53.394 --> 00:45:54.560 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Like
going to New York

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:55.730 align:middle line:84%
if you wanted to visit
the United States.

00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:56.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:58.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean-- or you go
to Rome because--

00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.230 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Or Paris.

00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Or to Paris, and also
because the capital,

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:03.695 align:middle line:84%
it's done to impress
the visitors,

00:46:03.695 --> 00:46:07.620 align:middle line:84%
the guests, because I mean, this
is the capital of the country.

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:11.650 align:middle line:84%
So and in the capital,
in the city called Atlan,

00:46:11.650 --> 00:46:14.110 align:middle line:84%
they spent these three days
and three night visiting

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:17.910 align:middle line:84%
the main places of this
incredible civilization,

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:20.940 align:middle line:84%
civilization that
again, we might

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:25.290 align:middle line:84%
imagine that is for sure
connecting to humankind

00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:26.720 align:middle line:90%
and to this planet.

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:30.930 align:middle line:84%
But that maybe was also the
capital of something bigger.

00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:35.090 align:middle line:84%
So maybe Atlantis was not
only an important civilization

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:37.410 align:middle line:84%
or an empire based
on the planet Earth,

00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:40.330 align:middle line:84%
but something also that
was really connecting

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:42.590 align:middle line:84%
many different places,
many different planets,

00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:46.130 align:middle line:84%
many different intelligence,
many different races in this

00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:47.740 align:middle line:90%
regards.

00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:51.020 align:middle line:84%
So after these three days
and three nights, again,

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:56.040 align:middle line:84%
from one of these time gates in
Atlantis, at the right moment

00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:59.570 align:middle line:84%
at the right time, they
jump into these gates,

00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:01.750 align:middle line:84%
disappear from
Atlantis, and then

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:06.140 align:middle line:84%
reappeared naked as
they was in this time,

00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:07.910 align:middle line:90%
and then start to do what?

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:09.177 align:middle line:84%
Well, to paint.
JAY WEIDNER: To paint.

00:47:09.177 --> 00:47:10.841 align:middle line:84%
To paint.
Not to forget and to bring--

00:47:10.841 --> 00:47:11.540 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Hurry.

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:15.600 align:middle line:84%
 --and to bring whatever
they was able to remember

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:17.810 align:middle line:90%
during this incredible journey.

00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Paintings that are-- I don't
know, painting like this

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:21.470 align:middle line:90%
is 44, 50 centimeters.

00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:22.930 align:middle line:90%
Not very big.

00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:29.450 align:middle line:84%
But when you going to show
this slide, these pictures,

00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:31.570 align:middle line:84%
we have truly to
remember the people

00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:34.120 align:middle line:84%
that these are not
camera pictures

00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:35.830 align:middle line:90%
but they are paintings.

00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And the numbers of details
that Dovilio thanks

00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:43.770 align:middle line:84%
to the Falco's help, brought
into the canvas is amazing,

00:47:43.770 --> 00:47:45.550 align:middle line:90%
is incredible.

00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:48.070 align:middle line:84%
I teach these seminars
many, many times,

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:50.750 align:middle line:84%
hundreds and hundreds of
times all over the world.

00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And I have to admit
that every time--

00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:53.730 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: You
showed these pictures.

00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:57.140 align:middle line:84%
 --I discover something new,
and it's-- and it's incredible

00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:58.620 align:middle line:90%
because hey, hey come on.

00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:00.150 align:middle line:90%
This will not happen.

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:03.960 align:middle line:84%
Every time, I'm discovering
something new, and which

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:06.360 align:middle line:84%
is the effect of these
pictures, because that

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.640 align:middle line:90%
is also the interesting part.

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And I can observe this with
people from all over the world,

00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:17.580 align:middle line:84%
from South America, to Europe,
to Japan, or to Australia.

00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:22.130 align:middle line:10%
It's incredible how these
pictures that are also

00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:25.200 align:middle line:10%
full of these symbols--
symbols that are connecting

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:29.810 align:middle line:10%
to different languages,
ancient languages, or let's

00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:34.514 align:middle line:10%
say ancestral languages,
archetype languages, the same

00:48:34.514 --> 00:48:35.880 align:middle line:10%
that we are also
studying in that manner,

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:38.480 align:middle line:10%
we call archetype languages
because they are based

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:46.520 align:middle line:10%
on symbols, words, sounds,
vibrations, frequencies,

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:49.670 align:middle line:10%
and also movement of the body.

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:51.710 align:middle line:84%
From all the study, for
example, in Damanhur, we have

00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:53.550 align:middle line:90%
our sacred dance, for example.

00:48:53.550 --> 00:48:55.730 align:middle line:84%
It is not just dancing
in a very beautiful way,

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:58.210 align:middle line:84%
but it's a way to
move the energy,

00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:01.540 align:middle line:90%
teach, transform things.

00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Or for example, all our chanting
music that is not simply

00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:11.400 align:middle line:84%
pleasant but again,
is a way to open doors

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:14.690 align:middle line:84%
through the dimension,
is open to touch

00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:16.520 align:middle line:90%
parting [INAUDIBLE] people.

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:18.190 align:middle line:90%
It's a way of teaching.

00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:24.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of really opening
doors connecting to the memory.

00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Inside of these
paintings, it's all of us.

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter
if you know the symbol.

00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:32.650 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter.

00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:36.440 align:middle line:10%
But just looking
them, it's really

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:39.330 align:middle line:10%
like something that
is starting to touch,

00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:45.140 align:middle line:10%
and it's like turn on a
memory, a conscious something.

00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's incredible to see the
effect that these paintings are

00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:50.960 align:middle line:84%
in front of people
when they saw them,

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:53.780 align:middle line:84%
but also for example
into their dreams.

00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Because what, maybe you're
not immediately aware

00:49:56.850 --> 00:49:58.920 align:middle line:84%
because your rational
part is still

00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:01.960 align:middle line:84%
controlling everything during
the night, during the dreams.

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:03.060 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And people, they
have clear vision.

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:10.570 align:middle line:84%
They have remembers about
them also in the time

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:14.040 align:middle line:84%
or connecting to
Atlantis because I'm

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:18.850 align:middle line:84%
used to say if we all believe
that this is the time, is

00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:20.910 align:middle line:84%
the time of transformation,
is the time where there is

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:25.890 align:middle line:84%
so many investment from energy,
forces, intelligence, then

00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:30.200 align:middle line:84%
from many different parts of
this time and also from outside

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:31.900 align:middle line:90%
are investing.

00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:35.520 align:middle line:84%
As Damanhur is one of these
investments, and we are here,

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:38.440 align:middle line:84%
and we are talking about
this, and you are following

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:41.940 align:middle line:84%
this interview on the
internet or on TV or whatever,

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:43.460 align:middle line:90%
it's because there is a meaning.

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:47.480 align:middle line:84%
It's because you are
connecting to all this history.

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.340 align:middle line:84%
You are connecting to
all these projects.

00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:51.250 align:middle line:90%
You are a part of this.

00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:53.360 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, why you're here?

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:54.490 align:middle line:90%
Why you are in this time?

00:50:54.490 --> 00:50:56.160 align:middle line:90%
Why you are living this time?

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:57.390 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't make sense.

00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:59.820 align:middle line:90%
Who is here is the right one.

00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:02.100 align:middle line:84%
It's the right one
to change this world.

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Believe me or not, that you
feel it or you don't feel it.

00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:08.070 align:middle line:84%
If you're here, it's
because there is a reason.

00:51:08.070 --> 00:51:11.460 align:middle line:90%
So we need to make this click.

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:15.450 align:middle line:10%
We need to find out that we
have an important mission

00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:18.400 align:middle line:10%
to accomplish right
now in this time,

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:24.410 align:middle line:10%
not only for working, money,
money, working, blah blah,

00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:26.500 align:middle line:10%
but for something that
is really connecting

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:29.040 align:middle line:10%
to what you feel is your dream.
JAY WEIDNER: Right.

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And probably if
it's a dream, it's

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:33.530 align:middle line:84%
very nearby or connecting
to what you think about

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:36.210 align:middle line:84%
and what you feel
about spirituality.

00:51:36.210 --> 00:51:46.800 align:middle line:90%
