00:00:03.451 --> 00:00:24.160 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Probably the most fascinating
time travel is the idea

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.640 align:middle line:10%
of physical time travel to
leave with the body and then go,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.775 align:middle line:10%
and then literally disappear
from this time and then appear

00:00:38.775 --> 00:00:41.140 align:middle line:10%
in another time,
and then come back.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And the physical time
travel is definitely

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.710 align:middle line:84%
something that can enter
not only our fantasy,

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.940 align:middle line:90%
but can really our soul.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Whatever is the possibility
of a time travel--

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.490 align:middle line:84%
it's an enormous
investment of energy.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm talking
about energy,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.300 align:middle line:84%
we are really talking about that
unit of energy that is directly

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.790 align:middle line:90%
connecting to our vital energy.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.790 align:middle line:84%
It's directly
connecting to the energy

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.980 align:middle line:84%
that we create when we are
living with fully consciousness

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.670 align:middle line:90%
what is going on in our life.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.140 align:middle line:90%
Unit of vital energy.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's like to imagine
enormous quantity of effort,

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.100 align:middle line:84%
and strength, and
attention by many people--

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.470 align:middle line:84%
by many individuals to
make something possible.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.270 align:middle line:84%
That means to make something
possible like that, well,

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.440 align:middle line:90%
you cannot do it for you.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.440 align:middle line:84%
You cannot do it
for your family.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.870 align:middle line:84%
You cannot do it
for your people.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.030 align:middle line:84%
You have to do it for the
planet, for the world,

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.210 align:middle line:84%
for a bigger aim,
for something that

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:57.110 align:middle line:84%
is definitely much bigger than
our individual ideas or need.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Easiest one on the time travel
is what we are already doing.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.700 align:middle line:90%
It's called reincarnation.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.780 align:middle line:10%
When you have to
do a lot of change,

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.150 align:middle line:10%
when the task is
really, very complex

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.039 align:middle line:10%
and you have to do
a lot of things,

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.180 align:middle line:10%
the best way is
simply to come back

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.670 align:middle line:10%
to the time package
that is going

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.770 align:middle line:10%
to host our soul
for an incarnation

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.640 align:middle line:10%
where, in this case,
whatever we're going to do,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.190 align:middle line:10%
it's linked to
something that has

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.340 align:middle line:10%
been originated by the point
from where we come from.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.420 align:middle line:90%


00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.282 align:middle line:84%
The second one-- the
physical time travel.

00:02:39.282 --> 00:02:41.960 align:middle line:84%
The physical time
travel is literally

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.720 align:middle line:84%
the magical technology to
make the time travel possible.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.140 align:middle line:84%
For magical technology,
it means the knowledge

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.350 align:middle line:84%
to use these enormous
quantity of energy

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:01.730 align:middle line:84%
to literally create a break,
a connection or creating

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.840 align:middle line:84%
that angle that allowed
us to cross all these time

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:14.180 align:middle line:84%
packages, the 51.51, that bring
not only our soul, but also

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.210 align:middle line:90%
our body to be in another time.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Modify what is
need to be modify.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And then in the same way
from another time door,

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.700 align:middle line:84%
come back from where
we start everything,

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.340 align:middle line:84%
keeping our conscious
for all the time.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.830 align:middle line:84%
That means we are
not forgetting,

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.150 align:middle line:84%
but there is simply a
continuity of our experience,

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.220 align:middle line:84%
but simply from one place to
another place from-- and then

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.690 align:middle line:84%
back to the place from
where we came from.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.200 align:middle line:90%
The third kind of time travel--

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.750 align:middle line:90%
we call possession.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.070 align:middle line:84%
The possession is a sort of very
high level of astral traveling,

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.050 align:middle line:84%
where we move our
conscious to another person

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.690 align:middle line:90%
or for another animal.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.920 align:middle line:10%
The fact that we need to keep
the doors open in all the time

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.210 align:middle line:10%
is because literally, as we
are doing an astral travel,

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.337 align:middle line:10%
there is what we call the golden
rope, the umbilical rope that

00:04:17.337 --> 00:04:19.170 align:middle line:10%
is the connection between
your physical body

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.180 align:middle line:10%
and your astral body.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And you need to keep it open,
otherwise you're going to die.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason why you
need to be with the door open

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:29.710 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.740 align:middle line:84%
So you need to train yourself
for an experience like that.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.480 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, animal
are excellent for that.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.070 align:middle line:90%
And believe me.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Possess a cat instead of a bird
or a fish instead of a dog.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.350 align:middle line:90%
It is absolutely very different.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.910 align:middle line:84%
Because you are taking all--
the character is of the animal.

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.030 align:middle line:84%
But for example, to
explore territory before,

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.430 align:middle line:84%
to know where you are, what
is there, the context--

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.510 align:middle line:84%
animals-- they are a great
opportunity in this regards.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.330 align:middle line:90%


00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.840 align:middle line:10%
So reincarnation,
physical time travel,

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.620 align:middle line:10%
and what we call possession
are to say the three

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.520 align:middle line:10%
main instrument-- the
three main modality

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.120 align:middle line:10%
that we can use when we
talk about interacting

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.400 align:middle line:10%
with the past.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.500 align:middle line:10%
And we go to change
something that is creating

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.730 align:middle line:10%
an effect right now, here.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:38.070 align:middle line:84%
When I'm saying it's changing
right now, here, wait a moment.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.220 align:middle line:90%
We might have two visions.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.290 align:middle line:84%
The first vision is
the cause/effect.

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.820 align:middle line:84%
If I'm changing something in
the past in all these chain,

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.876 align:middle line:90%
there's going to be a change.

00:05:52.876 --> 00:05:54.660 align:middle line:90%
It's not true?

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.890 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, yes.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.450 align:middle line:84%
But this is our
vision here, now.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.560 align:middle line:84%
We know that this
is not correct.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.290 align:middle line:84%
We know that there
is not one time.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Actually, there
are multiple time.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And we are living, moving
in this different time,

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.390 align:middle line:90%
in this different territory.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:14.030 align:middle line:84%
We are creatures of time that
they are moving into time.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.780 align:middle line:90%
They're not just going there.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:23.100 align:middle line:84%
My mind can give me the
illusion that time is only one.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.960 align:middle line:90%
And I'm choosing only the next.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.270 align:middle line:90%
Oh, this is not true.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:33.630 align:middle line:84%
My mind cannot accept
that if, for an example,

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:39.700 align:middle line:84%
I went back 2,700 years
back into the past.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.430 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to Egypt.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going in a
specific moment of time

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.250 align:middle line:84%
where there's no money
and possibilities.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.120 align:middle line:84%
But it's so important
to build a new pyramid.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And I have to convince a
pharaoh to build that pyramid.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And let's imagine that
I succeed to do that.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And then the pharaoh
with an enormous effort,

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:08.010 align:middle line:84%
with their population, they are
creating a pyramid there, OK?

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.980 align:middle line:84%
That pyramid-- all
of a sudden, it's

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.570 align:middle line:90%
already there when I come back.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.560 align:middle line:84%
But it's there like
it was always there.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Nobody can see, feel,
perceive the difference

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.190 align:middle line:90%
from before and after.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:24.510 align:middle line:90%
It's already there.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Because again, everything
came back to the evolution,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.180 align:middle line:90%
to the reason why we're here.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.670 align:middle line:84%
That is the reason
why to evolve,

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.560 align:middle line:84%
to spiritualize the
matter, to transform

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.170 align:middle line:84%
the matter to becoming
light, to bring

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:41.860 align:middle line:84%
the universal form to be
reunited with the real from we

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:42.660 align:middle line:90%
came from.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.620 align:middle line:90%
From where?

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.070 align:middle line:84%
These primeval human
divinity start everything

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.380 align:middle line:84%
and then brings many
different pieces

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:54.590 align:middle line:84%
inside of the matter that are
us and everything here, OK?

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.580 align:middle line:84%
We are just a little
bigger pieces.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.580 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason why we
call ourself divine spark.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.410 align:middle line:90%


00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Talking now about the
physical time travel,

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.580 align:middle line:84%
that in a subtle way is
the basic preparation

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:10.930 align:middle line:90%
for all the others.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:15.820 align:middle line:84%
The possession one-- the same
part of preparation of physical

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.731 align:middle line:90%
is involved in the other one.

00:08:17.731 --> 00:08:22.790 align:middle line:84%
In this sphere-- how
we describe time--

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.270 align:middle line:84%
if you move something
in one direction,

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.160 align:middle line:84%
you need to
compensate what you're

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.450 align:middle line:90%
moving in the other direction.

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:32.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about mass.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the physical
mass, our mass.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.659 align:middle line:90%
So we are occupying a space.

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:40.240 align:middle line:84%
We have a specific
mass in this case.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:46.270 align:middle line:84%
There are events that are
not possible to be changed

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:47.840 align:middle line:90%
in the structure of time.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.640 align:middle line:90%
You can't.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:53.830 align:middle line:84%
Even if you bring five packages
of bags of neutral events,

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:56.560 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to
do several travel--

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.460 align:middle line:84%
no, you can't
change these events.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.560 align:middle line:90%
Which are these events?

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:11.200 align:middle line:84%
These events are what is,
naturally or not, obviously

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.910 align:middle line:84%
is moving a large
quantity of mass.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.590 align:middle line:90%
Practical example?

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, earthquake,
volcano eruption,

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:30.070 align:middle line:84%
an asteroid that is
impacting with the planet.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:36.090 align:middle line:84%
So events that are involving
so much movement of mass--

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:40.780 align:middle line:84%
they are becoming still,
like you cannot move it.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:45.790 align:middle line:84%
These are like in a map
the point of reference

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.380 align:middle line:90%
to know where you are.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.050 align:middle line:84%
For a time traveler,
all these events

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:54.640 align:middle line:84%
are the GPS to know
exactly where you are.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.620 align:middle line:90%
So you cannot change it.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:02.320 align:middle line:10%
But coming back now to
our physical time travel,

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.680 align:middle line:10%
let's understand better
what it means to compensate.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.000 align:middle line:84%
So whatever that you
add in one place,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.710 align:middle line:84%
you need to put
in another place.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:17.290 align:middle line:84%
So whatever, for example, is
the mass of the time traveler,

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:22.450 align:middle line:84%
you need to move this same
relative mass to the time

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:25.580 align:middle line:84%
from where the time
traveler has been moving.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:31.110 align:middle line:90%
So if I'm 66 kilos and I move--

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:32.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't know--

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:37.480 align:middle line:84%
2,700 years in the
past, well, there

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:43.120 align:middle line:84%
might be a compensation of
a mass at least of 66 kilos.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, this doesn't
need to be another person.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it could be
the mass of a rock.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:51.890 align:middle line:84%
It could be the
mass of a person.

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:55.270 align:middle line:84%
It could be the mass
of water, for example.

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:57.610 align:middle line:90%
And just mentioning water--

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:02.830 align:middle line:84%
it's the easiest substance, is
being used for compensation.

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:08.230 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason why
many of the places where

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:13.300 align:middle line:84%
there is the technology,
the machines to do the time

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.320 align:middle line:90%
travel--

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.670 align:middle line:84%
they are next to source
of water or where

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.660 align:middle line:90%
there is containers of water.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Because the water
in this case can

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:25.510 align:middle line:84%
be compensated in one
way or another way when

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:26.980 align:middle line:90%
the time traveler--

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:33.350 align:middle line:84%
it's been-- sent it back
in that part of time.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:35.470 align:middle line:84%
This is what we talk
about-- compensation.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.120 align:middle line:84%
There is a preparation
that in this case,

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:42.820 align:middle line:84%
it's involving many different
level of the person.

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.910 align:middle line:84%
The first level is
the physical level.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.490 align:middle line:90%
So you need to train yourself.

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:49.900 align:middle line:90%
You need to train yourself.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:57.370 align:middle line:84%
It means also that you need
to be prepared for everything.

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:01.630 align:middle line:10%
When we travel in
time physically,

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:04.240 align:middle line:10%
we cannot bring
anything with us.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.190 align:middle line:90%
We cannot export complexity.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Or in a subtle way, we might
bring just little things

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.390 align:middle line:84%
inside of our mouth,
but very little.

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Because they are
inside of the body.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.340 align:middle line:84%
But nothing that could
be brought outside.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.760 align:middle line:84%
So in our hand, my
friend, I'm telling you

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.710 align:middle line:90%
that you travel naked--

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:25.510 align:middle line:90%
literal naked.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:29.430 align:middle line:84%
Not because you want to impress
the others on the other side.

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:34.040 align:middle line:84%
It's because literally you
cannot bring anything with you.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.450 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
traveling naked--

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:41.870 align:middle line:84%
it means that I need to
know how to walk barefoot.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:46.870 align:middle line:84%
I need to know how to survive if
I'm in a very warm environment

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:50.780 align:middle line:90%
or maybe in a cold environment.

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And then I need to
prepare to survive

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.540 align:middle line:90%
in any kind of occasion.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.810 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously,
everything is always

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:03.100 align:middle line:84%
done to be perfectly
aligned to go and come back.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:07.520 align:middle line:84%
There is always a
percentage of risk.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.360 align:middle line:90%
Always.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.360 align:middle line:90%
That's obvious, OK?

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.620 align:middle line:90%
Which is the risk?

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:17.230 align:middle line:84%
The risk is to be stuck
there, not to come back,

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:19.280 align:middle line:90%
not to be able to return.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And then you need to have all
the possibilities to survive

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:29.270 align:middle line:84%
as long as needed, then to
recreate a condition to open

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:31.280 align:middle line:90%
a time door and come back.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.560 align:middle line:90%
So I need to protect myself.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:39.630 align:middle line:84%
I need to build a place where
I can rest and recover myself.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.320 align:middle line:84%
I need to recognize
what I can eat.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:46.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's literally a
survival preparation

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:51.980 align:middle line:84%
where you learn how to
do whatever is needed.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Or is it with the hope that
you don't need to do anything?

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:59.650 align:middle line:84%
It's also to be able
to orient yourself.

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:01.560 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:06.240 align:middle line:10%
The time door is not
always in the same place

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:10.500 align:middle line:10%
where we are arriving.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.400 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:15.390 align:middle line:84%
This is also connecting to
the movement of the Earth.

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:18.390 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm arriving,
it's not the same place

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:19.740 align:middle line:90%
where I'm going to leave.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:23.820 align:middle line:84%
Because in any case, the
Earth is going to move, OK?

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.870 align:middle line:84%
So I need also to know
how to orient myself

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.090 align:middle line:90%
with whatever I have.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:33.930 align:middle line:10%
If it's winds, if it's stars,
if it's moon, if it's sun,

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:34.960 align:middle line:10%
it doesn't matter.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.685 align:middle line:84%
I need to know
where I'm located.

00:14:37.685 --> 00:14:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And then there is also
the mental, psychological

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:41.910 align:middle line:90%
preparation.

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, this
is not less important.

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:51.330 align:middle line:84%
We used to say in
our spiritual path--

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:55.555 align:middle line:84%
it's sometimes better to
don't know than to know.

00:14:55.555 --> 00:14:57.520 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm talking about.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So when we know things,
we become responsible, OK?

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:07.120 align:middle line:84%
We need-- we carry on the
responsibility of knowing.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.590 align:middle line:90%
So our action, our choices--

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:14.340 align:middle line:84%
they're becoming how I say--
with a different weight.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes for your safety,
it's much better not to know,

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.915 align:middle line:90%
not to remember.

00:15:20.915 --> 00:15:22.290 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
remember things

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:27.180 align:middle line:84%
that is going to shake yourself
for the rest of your life.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.010 align:middle line:90%
No, thank you.

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:31.860 align:middle line:84%
So psychologically
speaking, you need

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.790 align:middle line:84%
to train yourself to be
able to remember what

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:38.820 align:middle line:84%
is useful to remember,
because these are information

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:42.240 align:middle line:84%
or element that you
bring back home.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:47.760 align:middle line:84%
But even more important, you
need to know how to forget.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I just want to keep
out the romance of all of this.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.720 align:middle line:90%
It's not a time travel--

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.320 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be fighting with
this, and jumping on that,

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:02.050 align:middle line:84%
and then opening the temple,
and touching and enter it.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:02.850 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:06.590 align:middle line:90%
This isn't "Indiana Jones," OK?

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes separation-- a very
precise and very specific, like

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:17.150 align:middle line:84%
move a stone from one
point to another point.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.230 align:middle line:90%
Because simply, that stone--

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:22.970 align:middle line:84%
it's going to create a
change in the events that are

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:25.170 align:middle line:90%
going to have a reflection now.

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:28.910 align:middle line:90%
But this is because--

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:32.420 align:middle line:84%
and these are the element that
we still have to discover.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:37.550 align:middle line:84%
You can observe the
wave that that event

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:40.400 align:middle line:84%
is creating on the
entire territory,

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.750 align:middle line:84%
making then the effect from
where you came from, OK?

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.550 align:middle line:10%
The third element--

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:50.480 align:middle line:10%
I would say it's really
the spiritual meaning,

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:55.280 align:middle line:10%
the spiritual ideas that
there is behind every

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.460 align:middle line:10%
of this kind of action.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:00.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's meant to be enriched
with values insignificant that

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.230 align:middle line:84%
are not own individual,
but they are collective.

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:06.800 align:middle line:84%
So now that we described
the different kind

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.400 align:middle line:84%
of time traveling, let's
try to describe how it is,

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.190 align:middle line:84%
so how this is going
to happen and which

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:16.550 align:middle line:84%
are the emotion or the feeling
that a time traveler is passing

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:18.960 align:middle line:90%
through when this--

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.150 align:middle line:90%
it can happen.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:25.805 align:middle line:10%
Probably some of you already
remember the physical time

00:17:25.805 --> 00:17:29.600 align:middle line:10%
travel done by Falco
and Dovilio Brero,

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:34.280 align:middle line:10%
the painter of the amazing
pictures about Atlantis.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want to describe the
magic technology at the time

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:42.530 align:middle line:84%
and what is now possible to
do with the magic technology

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:43.857 align:middle line:90%
that we have available.

00:17:43.857 --> 00:17:45.440 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
Falco in the video,

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.840 align:middle line:90%
we talk about the earliest '80s.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.570 align:middle line:84%
At that moment in
the '80s, Damanhur

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.110 align:middle line:90%
was just the beginning.

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:55.880 align:middle line:84%
The temple was just at the
beginning, just a few chambers

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.170 align:middle line:90%
that was complete.

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.770 align:middle line:84%
So the temple was still
not the perfect machine,

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:05.990 align:middle line:84%
the perfect bridge, the
perfect station that it still

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:12.350 align:middle line:84%
needed to recreate a point of
connection between time, space,

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:13.340 align:middle line:90%
and dimension.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not
just about time.

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.810 align:middle line:84%
But it's really about
also these other aspect.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:20.750 align:middle line:10%
We can imagine that
all around the planet,

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.400 align:middle line:10%
as I've been describing
these places,

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:27.770 align:middle line:10%
that they have a
different flow of events,

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:30.860 align:middle line:10%
a different flow of time, a
different density of time,

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.870 align:middle line:10%
nearby the synchronic lines.

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:35.270 align:middle line:84%
So these differences--
sometimes they

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:41.900 align:middle line:84%
can also create some interesting
effect like natural time gates.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:45.500 align:middle line:84%
So time door that
in some occasion,

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.100 align:middle line:84%
they can really connect
one time to another time.

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:52.820 align:middle line:10%
The fact that where
we create Damanhur--

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:55.010 align:middle line:10%
there are four synchronic lines.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:57.260 align:middle line:84%
It makes this entire
territory, but not

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:01.330 align:middle line:84%
only where Damanhur is
physically, but also nearby.

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:03.650 align:middle line:90%
The four are very interesting--

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:08.060 align:middle line:84%
extremely interesting places,
that they have these anomalies,

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.600 align:middle line:84%
anomalies that
are very important

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.960 align:middle line:90%
then if you know how to use it.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, at the time
in the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:21.200 align:middle line:84%
the need was truly to
reconnect with Atlantis, also

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:27.260 align:middle line:84%
bringing back images, symbols,
signs of Atlantis to reinforce

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:30.050 align:middle line:84%
something that, as you
rediscover already,

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:33.680 align:middle line:84%
it is separated by a fracture
in the time territory,

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.360 align:middle line:84%
this canyon that is
really separating

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.230 align:middle line:90%
the time from another time.

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:42.020 align:middle line:84%
So what about reconnect
with that level of evolution

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.450 align:middle line:84%
that we lost with Atlantis
and bring it back here?

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Will now be an enormous spin,
an enormous acceleration,

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.600 align:middle line:90%
an enormous--

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.600 align:middle line:84%
let's say in rubber
cement of the branch.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.120 align:middle line:90%
Well, we believe so.

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.130 align:middle line:90%
That's the reason why.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:00.440 align:middle line:84%
There is this directly
connection with Atlantis.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.150 align:middle line:90%
And don't forget.

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis is being also not
only an important civilization

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.330 align:middle line:90%
for the planet Earth.

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:11.480 align:middle line:84%
But we are talking
about a civilization

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.610 align:middle line:90%
that is touching the star.

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:16.970 align:middle line:90%
We call it an empire.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And if I can, not only a
galactic empires as maybe

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:25.690 align:middle line:84%
a movie like "Star Wars" can
inspire in us, but literally

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:28.700 align:middle line:90%
a time empire.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.770 align:middle line:90%
So how is to do a time travel?

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this case, it's
a little bit more rustic,

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:36.030 align:middle line:90%
if I can say.

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, because the
temple was not there.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:43.280 align:middle line:90%
And because these natural gate--

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.650 align:middle line:84%
these anomalies as
I mentioned before--

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:47.950 align:middle line:90%
they are outdoor.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:52.220 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's a specific
place that is nearby Damanhur.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.070 align:middle line:10%
They are called
the Devil's Bridge.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:57.690 align:middle line:10%
And in this case is
an old Roman bridge.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.800 align:middle line:10%
But nearby there is a
specific point close

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.780 align:middle line:10%
to a rock-- to a huge rock.

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.120 align:middle line:84%
That is one of these
natural time door.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:09.590 align:middle line:84%
To describe it, it's like
to imagine a black hole that

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:12.560 align:middle line:84%
is going to be created
in front of you

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:17.580 align:middle line:84%
with a sort of white line
that is moving like a S.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, this sensation--

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:20.760 align:middle line:90%
it's obviously very personal.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.810 align:middle line:84%
But it is really like your heart
is going in your throat then--

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:27.180 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that you
know when your soul--

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:31.470 align:middle line:84%
when you feel the door
opening, it's literally

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:36.080 align:middle line:90%
physically to jump into it.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.360 align:middle line:84%
Dovilio and Falco--
they've been both naked--

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:43.620 align:middle line:84%
jump into it, arriving
in a specific time door.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:47.340 align:middle line:84%
When they arrive, someone
was awaiting them.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.210 align:middle line:90%
Dress.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And then in this case, they
did three days and three nights

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:53.790 align:middle line:84%
in the capital of
Atlantis, because they

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:58.170 align:middle line:84%
need to visit places
that they can touch what?

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:00.260 align:middle line:90%
The memory of people.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Dovilio and Falco
in that moment--

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:07.530 align:middle line:84%
they are reappearing from
one of this time door,

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.780 align:middle line:84%
disappearing from
the time of Atlantis

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:14.190 align:middle line:84%
and reappearing in the time
here in the early '80s.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:19.560 align:middle line:84%
One of the reason why Falco
was bringing Dovilio with him

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:25.240 align:middle line:84%
is so bring back pictures, bring
back element of the Atlantis

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.040 align:middle line:90%
culture.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And because Dovilio is
one of these painters

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.810 align:middle line:90%
with these photographic memory.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:35.130 align:middle line:84%
So the capacity to paint
exactly precisely what he

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:37.030 align:middle line:90%
was sowing with these eyes.

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:42.740 align:middle line:84%
So he took him as
a natural camera

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:46.410 align:middle line:84%
to then bring back the
different paintings

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:51.880 align:middle line:84%
that there have been shows
in the [INAUDIBLE] from Gaia.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:58.830 align:middle line:84%
So this is definitely one of
the physical time travel that

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:01.410 align:middle line:84%
has been described for
a really long time ago

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:05.340 align:middle line:84%
and is described with
what we had at the time.

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's see how
it is many years

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:13.963 align:middle line:84%
after when our possibilities
are definitely different.

00:23:13.963 --> 00:23:14.880 align:middle line:90%
And what is different?

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:18.550 align:middle line:90%
Well, number one is the temple.

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:21.450 align:middle line:84%
The temple of
humankind that is again

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:24.330 align:middle line:90%
following that stone language--

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:26.795 align:middle line:84%
the temple is done
in the same way.

00:23:26.795 --> 00:23:27.670 align:middle line:90%
There's not a corner.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:28.970 align:middle line:90%
There's not an angle.

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:31.280 align:middle line:90%
The design has a meaning.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.500 align:middle line:90%
Color or shape paintings.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:35.340 align:middle line:90%
Tiffany glass.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:36.690 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:40.620 align:middle line:10%
It's done to enrich of
knowledge a place that

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:43.720 align:middle line:10%
is speaking into the rock.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.290 align:middle line:10%
The temple is a perfect station.

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:47.850 align:middle line:10%
It's a perfect laboratory.

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:48.960 align:middle line:90%
It's a perfect place.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.850 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to
go outdoor anymore.

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:54.390 align:middle line:84%
They are inside of
the temple already--

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:59.520 align:middle line:84%
the access to the energy,
to the source of energy that

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.298 align:middle line:90%
are needed.

00:24:01.298 --> 00:24:02.340 align:middle line:90%
Different kind of energy.

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Because I told you this
is an enormous investment.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason why to
use the temple for time travel

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:12.210 align:middle line:84%
is for something that is
not connecting to Damanhur,

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:14.670 align:middle line:84%
but is something that is
connecting to the humankind,

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:17.650 align:middle line:84%
otherwise will not
make any sense.

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, the temple-- it's
definitely the opportunity

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:28.540 align:middle line:84%
to have something that make
your life much easier in time

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.450 align:middle line:90%
of time traveling.

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:37.620 align:middle line:84%
So not only because the
temple is these huge Selfica

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.180 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:40.860 align:middle line:84%
We've been talking
about Selfica.

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And you know that inside of
the structure of the temple--

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.020 align:middle line:90%
I mean, walls, floors, roofs--

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.390 align:middle line:90%
there are kilometers.

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Miles and miles of
Selfica circuits

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.030 align:middle line:90%
that are creating what?

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:59.850 align:middle line:84%
An enormous Selfica
an antenna able

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:05.610 align:middle line:84%
in this case to attract not
only powerful intelligence.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Because we already know
that Selfica is not just

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:10.560 align:middle line:84%
the technology,
but is really like

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:15.850 align:middle line:84%
to realign with the
partners that in the past

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:19.650 align:middle line:84%
it was beside the humankind for
the evolution of this planet.

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:22.590 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence that are
vibrating differently

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:24.960 align:middle line:90%
to be here to support us.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's thanks to the Selfica's
intelligence and this Selfica

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:31.170 align:middle line:84%
technology that there
is the possibility

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:35.100 align:middle line:84%
to manage this energy
to literally work

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:39.860 align:middle line:84%
on the structures of time and
through that angle to penetrate

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:43.410 align:middle line:84%
the different time packages
to arrive exactly where it's

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:44.740 align:middle line:90%
needed.

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:47.940 align:middle line:84%
This is the technology
that we develop

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:51.850 align:middle line:90%
in what we call the cabin.

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:52.650 align:middle line:90%
The cabins.

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:54.750 align:middle line:90%
And we talk about many of them.

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Not only one in the temple,
but also in other place

00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:59.490 align:middle line:90%
in Damanhur.

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:03.900 align:middle line:84%
They are based on all these
very complex Selfica structure.

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:08.580 align:middle line:84%
They look more like to enter
in the piece of the future that

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.290 align:middle line:90%
is still not here.

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:13.740 align:middle line:84%
It's thanks to the Selfica
structure and thanks

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:19.980 align:middle line:84%
to the cabins that inside of
the cabins, inside of these bars

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:21.870 align:middle line:90%
that are fulfill of Selfica.

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And then they are going to be
excited both by magnetic field.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.020 align:middle line:84%
So there is electrical
conductor that

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:34.000 align:middle line:84%
are creating different
magnetic field.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.260 align:middle line:84%
But also, laser
light that are going

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.690 align:middle line:84%
to excite part of
the liquids that

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:42.580 align:middle line:84%
are containing the
different spherical, which

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:43.380 align:middle line:90%
are the liquids.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.250 align:middle line:84%
Or the liquids are memories,
our information contain it,

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:50.580 align:middle line:84%
alchemically speaking, to
activate the spherical and then

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.490 align:middle line:84%
the entire structure
for what is needed.

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:56.370 align:middle line:90%
But also, vibrations of sound.

00:26:56.370 --> 00:27:00.120 align:middle line:84%
So different frequencies of
sound that they make literally

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:05.610 align:middle line:84%
vibrate at different bars to
create that same effect that

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:08.010 align:middle line:84%
is the opening of the
time door that I'd

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:11.130 align:middle line:90%
been describing before.

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:13.110 align:middle line:84%
So this is what is
needed, but it's also

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:14.780 align:middle line:90%
needed a lot of energy.

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:16.253 align:middle line:90%
Particle energy, also.

00:27:16.253 --> 00:27:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Energy that, for
example, could be

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:23.110 align:middle line:84%
created by singing, playing
dancing, using rhythm, and et

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:24.180 align:middle line:90%
cetera.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:27.300 align:middle line:84%
At the time, we needed to
create this quantity of energy

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.640 align:middle line:90%
before the time traveling.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.070 align:middle line:84%
But now, luckily,
we can accumulate

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:35.130 align:middle line:84%
these energy all along the
week or all along the month

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:38.040 align:middle line:84%
to then use it whenever
is then needed.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:41.010 align:middle line:84%
But you also need to charge
of this kind of energy,

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:45.570 align:middle line:84%
because it's fundamental
to make everything works.

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:50.260 align:middle line:84%
In particular, what we're
using is the spheres.

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:54.000 align:middle line:84%
They are spheres actually
all over the temple.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And the spheres are both
connected to synchronic line.

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:05.790 align:middle line:84%
But also, the spheres are used
for exploring time, observation

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:08.550 align:middle line:90%
during that travel.

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Let me say for safety
reason, to check

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.550 align:middle line:90%
that everything is going well.

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:20.020 align:middle line:84%
There are other people,
other specialized operators,

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:22.420 align:middle line:84%
if we want to say
like this, that

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:27.520 align:middle line:84%
are doing a sort of
overviewing of what

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.180 align:middle line:90%
is going on in the time travel.

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:30.970 align:middle line:84%
So using the spheres
are literally

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:37.930 align:middle line:84%
like to turn on a screen that is
observing exactly what the time

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:38.730 align:middle line:90%
traveler is doing.

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:41.880 align:middle line:90%


00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And in some rare case,
also able to create

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:52.440 align:middle line:84%
some paranormal effect to
support or to help the time

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:56.880 align:middle line:84%
traveler, like to make
spheres appear in this room--

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.410 align:middle line:90%
spheres of light moving.

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:01.690 align:middle line:90%


00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe to create a thunder
or a light, or a siren.

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:11.940 align:middle line:84%
So little, small
physical effect.

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And the time that
they can support,

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:18.910 align:middle line:84%
for example, the traveler
to do what it's doing like,

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:20.510 align:middle line:90%
OK, you don't believe me?

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:23.080 align:middle line:90%
Look, I am this.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
believe them, it's boom.

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:30.090 align:middle line:10%
And then it's pretty
helpful, I have to admit,

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:31.690 align:middle line:10%
in many occasion.

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:36.160 align:middle line:90%
So before, during, and after.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.690 align:middle line:90%
What it means after?

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:41.620 align:middle line:84%
It is too easy or it's
too natural, then,

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.980 align:middle line:84%
not to perceive the change
that we did in time.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Because our mind-- it's a
sequence of cause/effect.

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:51.790 align:middle line:10%
So I need then to
have something that

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:55.270 align:middle line:10%
can observe without
be influenced by time,

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:57.700 align:middle line:10%
observing the different change.

00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:03.520 align:middle line:84%
So I can measure the fact that
I've been succeeding or not

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.040 align:middle line:90%
in that specific operation.

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:10.240 align:middle line:84%
At this point, when
everything is ready,

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.350 align:middle line:90%
you are then introduced.

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:14.950 align:middle line:84%
You're naked inside
of the cabin.

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:17.140 align:middle line:84%
The cabin is going to
be activated in the way

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:20.320 align:middle line:84%
that I did before that
I describe it before,

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:25.270 align:middle line:84%
until in a sort of moment with
everything that is vibrating,

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:28.360 align:middle line:84%
that is creating these
magnetic field, that is having

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.700 align:middle line:84%
the excitement of all
the programs inside

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:33.910 align:middle line:84%
of the sphere itself,
the liquids, and so on.

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:40.665 align:middle line:84%
Literally, the time traveler in
a specific position of the body

00:30:40.665 --> 00:30:43.960 align:middle line:90%
will have the time door--

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:48.430 align:middle line:84%
this black hole with
these sort of white S

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:51.550 align:middle line:90%
moving in the middle.

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:54.540 align:middle line:84%
It will appear in front
of the time traveler.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:57.940 align:middle line:84%
At that point, you
don't have any doubt.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.520 align:middle line:90%
You have to jump.

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:02.770 align:middle line:90%
Don't waste one single second.

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:07.990 align:middle line:84%
When you jump, you literally
disappear from this time.

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Compensating with mass,
the water then-- it

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:15.470 align:middle line:84%
need to be transferred from
one time to another time.

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:19.390 align:middle line:90%
And you are on the other side.

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:22.730 align:middle line:10%
If the travel--
it's a long travel.

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:27.302 align:middle line:10%
And remember, you're
going to stop where?

00:31:27.302 --> 00:31:28.510 align:middle line:90%
In one of these time castles.

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Because you need to breathe
a little bit to recharge

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.710 align:middle line:84%
yourself, to bring
maybe whatever we need,

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:38.220 align:middle line:84%
energetically speaking, in
terms of neutral events,

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:41.390 align:middle line:84%
to then jump again and
arrive to the destination.

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:45.410 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, depend to
how far time wise you go.

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:48.210 align:middle line:90%


00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:51.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to forget
that in the preparation

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.640 align:middle line:84%
of the codes and everything
that you're receiving.

00:31:54.640 --> 00:32:00.750 align:middle line:84%
You also need to know
exactly when and how it's

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:03.900 align:middle line:84%
going to manifest the
door to come back.

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Because safety is always
the most important thing.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:11.020 align:middle line:84%
So we need to ensure that
the traveler can come back.

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:12.960 align:middle line:90%
So you know exactly that you go.

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.898 align:middle line:84%
You have to do whatever
you have to do.

00:32:14.898 --> 00:32:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And as I told you,
sometimes you just

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:22.620 align:middle line:84%
need to move something from
one place to another place.

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:25.740 align:middle line:90%
And then you have to run away.

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.100 align:middle line:84%
Come back exactly
in that point that

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:31.690 align:middle line:84%
is being-- describe it
precisely before you

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:34.530 align:middle line:90%
are left in that time.

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Because at the right
moment, the time door

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:42.780 align:middle line:84%
will reappear exactly like
a black hole with this S

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:43.920 align:middle line:90%
while it moving.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And you need to jump
in and literally

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:51.060 align:middle line:84%
disappear from that
time and reappearing

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:53.990 align:middle line:90%
inside of the cabin.

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:56.810 align:middle line:90%
That is how physically it works.

00:32:56.810 --> 00:33:00.160 align:middle line:90%
