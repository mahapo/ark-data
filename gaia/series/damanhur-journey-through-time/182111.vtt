00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.630 align:middle line:10%
>> The last divine power is
really the fact that the free

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.160 align:middle line:10%
will is sacred.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.520 align:middle line:10%
That means that nobody
can change our free will.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.320 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.440 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes people might
imagine that they

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.410 align:middle line:10%
can change the others.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to change your life.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Or now I'm going to
help you to change

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.780 align:middle line:90%
your life, and et cetera.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.340 align:middle line:84%
In a relationship this is
working not always very well.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.920 align:middle line:10%
But also when people
are attending the class,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.100 align:middle line:10%
or they are going in
a spiritual research,

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.570 align:middle line:10%
they imagine that the
teachers or the master

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.490 align:middle line:10%
can really change them.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.410 align:middle line:10%
But we have to be
very aware of the fact

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.739 align:middle line:10%
that nobody can change nobody.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.630 align:middle line:84%
So you might not be
aware about that,

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.210 align:middle line:84%
but this is possible only
through the expression

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.540 align:middle line:90%
of your free will.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is also, in a
large expression of this,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.150 align:middle line:84%
not even God, whatever it is
your idea of gods, whatever

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.410 align:middle line:84%
is your idea of divinity, can
change the free will of humans.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.140 align:middle line:90%
This is very important.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.960 align:middle line:10%
We can, let's say,
be in a context

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.970 align:middle line:10%
that it looks in a certain way.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.640 align:middle line:84%
We might be, let's
say, invited to do,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.190 align:middle line:84%
or to think, or to imagine
something in a certain way.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.030 align:middle line:90%
But the last word is ours.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.290 align:middle line:90%
So it's yours.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.400 align:middle line:90%
It's your free will.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's very important
to get back this power,

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.790 align:middle line:90%
cause this is the power.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's the only power
that can bring us back

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.815 align:middle line:90%
to reawaken our inner god.

00:01:50.815 --> 00:01:52.440 align:middle line:84%
But it is the only
power that will

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.410 align:middle line:84%
bring us back the
possibility to enlighten

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.540 align:middle line:84%
ourself, to
metamorphosize ourself,

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.640 align:middle line:90%
to spiritualize the method.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Only through the free
will we can do that.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, as
I was referring

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.370 align:middle line:84%
before, the free will,
it goes at the same time

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.100 align:middle line:84%
with that sense
of responsibility.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Because being responsible
of our choices

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.000 align:middle line:84%
is the capacity to then
transform ourselves.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.630 align:middle line:84%
So action, continuing
in the action, and then

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.250 align:middle line:90%
a transformation is there.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.270 align:middle line:84%
It's part of what we call
the quest, the aid quest,

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.170 align:middle line:84%
from where we are describing
the path to the enlightenment.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.740 align:middle line:10%
First quest is action.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.880 align:middle line:84%
The second quest is to
continue in that action.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.860 align:middle line:84%
The third is the
transformation that

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.140 align:middle line:84%
is becoming as a consequence of
this constant in our actions.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Probably talking
about the time travel,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.490 align:middle line:84%
you might think about it, or
you might question yourself

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.890 align:middle line:84%
about which is the karma
of an action of that,

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.370 align:middle line:84%
of how this is going
to influence my karma.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Or what could be the
beneficial for me as a time

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.950 align:middle line:84%
traveler to do an
experience like that?

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, we don't have to forget
that an experience like

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.040 align:middle line:84%
that, it is not a technique
that you use, let's say,

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.450 align:middle line:84%
to improve yourself or to
grow, spiritually speaking.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.950 align:middle line:90%
It's an instrument.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And it is an instrument
that in this case,

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.440 align:middle line:84%
it makes things possible not
for you, but for a bigger

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.830 align:middle line:84%
reason, for a bigger aim,
for a bigger mission that

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.580 align:middle line:84%
is not about you or your people,
but is really about human kind.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.540 align:middle line:90%
This is very important.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.090 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like
an astro travel that

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.680 align:middle line:84%
is a technique that I can learn
to create with myself to then

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.080 align:middle line:84%
explore, to then reach,
to then make experiences

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.720 align:middle line:90%
that are transforming my life.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.630 align:middle line:84%
Now time travel, it's
not something like that.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.260 align:middle line:84%
It is always something that
is at the service of something

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.420 align:middle line:90%
bigger than you.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.470 align:middle line:84%
This is the reason
why, in a certain way,

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.120 align:middle line:84%
it's not that personally
you're going to get something.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.390 align:middle line:84%
But let's say, as human
kind you can get something.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Which is the effect
of the karma?

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, I would say that there's
no effect on the karma,

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:14.970 align:middle line:90%
individually.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously, also the
action of a time traveler

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.120 align:middle line:90%
is creating karma.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.180 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.380 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of the effects
into time, the effect that

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.770 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
created here now, we

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.640 align:middle line:84%
are not changing
the karma of people.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.440 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.340 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.580 align:middle line:84%
We are creating a
different context.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.400 align:middle line:84%
That means that we are
creating different opportunity.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.160 align:middle line:84%
We create, let's say, an
environment that could be,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.400 align:middle line:84%
let's say, more welcome
for the expression, again,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.420 align:middle line:90%
of evolution, of complexity.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.110 align:middle line:84%
But don't forget that
even if we are creating

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.920 align:middle line:84%
the most beautiful context,
the most spiritual context,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.130 align:middle line:84%
so is the free will
of the individual that

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.010 align:middle line:90%
are producing the karma.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.480 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.420 align:middle line:84%
So I can create a
beautiful environment,

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.440 align:middle line:84%
and then doing action
against others,

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.110 align:middle line:84%
I can destroy
instead of creating.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.860 align:middle line:84%
I can be at the service
instead of serve my ego.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.410 align:middle line:84%
So, again, one more
time, we are still

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.920 align:middle line:84%
the lord, the master of our
lives, thanks to the fact

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.590 align:middle line:90%
that the free will is sacred.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.930 align:middle line:84%
So if we already have to deal
with our parts and our use

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.740 align:middle line:84%
of the free will, we
know that we are also

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.990 align:middle line:84%
under the influences
of the enemy.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.980 align:middle line:90%
It's always there.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Actually, probably it's there
exactly when we are not aware.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.610 align:middle line:90%
Where is the enemy?

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.500 align:middle line:90%
Inside of us.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.490 align:middle line:10%
Where there are the fears.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.670 align:middle line:10%
When there is insecurity.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.130 align:middle line:10%
Where there limitations.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Where there are our dark side,
the side that we know we have,

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.750 align:middle line:84%
but we don't want to face,
or we are scared to face.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.556 align:middle line:84%
Or we are trying to
avoid or to control.

00:06:01.556 --> 00:06:03.360 align:middle line:90%
So the parts need what?

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.290 align:middle line:90%
They need light.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:05.460 align:middle line:90%
They need transformation.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.710 align:middle line:84%
They need the
attention, even if I

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.200 align:middle line:84%
don't like them, even if
it makes me feel weak,

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.190 align:middle line:84%
or make me face part of me that
I hate, that I really refuse.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.110 align:middle line:90%
But I have it.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.310 align:middle line:84%
So I need to accept
that I have also this.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.540 align:middle line:90%
It's easy.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.630 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult. Well,
welcome into life.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:27.950 align:middle line:84%
That is, again, how we are
able to manage all of this.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.580 align:middle line:84%
The direction is the
direction of transformation.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.290 align:middle line:84%
But, again, we might
avoid that direction.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:35.860 align:middle line:84%
We might try to
stop the direction.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.570 align:middle line:84%
We might try to put
resistance in that direction.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to justify
ourself, saying, oh, this

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.467 align:middle line:90%
is the enemy.

00:06:44.467 --> 00:06:45.550 align:middle line:90%
Because it doesn't matter.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.590 align:middle line:90%
At the end, it's my free will.

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.940 align:middle line:84%
But definitely the enemy
is playing a very big game,

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:58.210 align:middle line:84%
and it is sometimes that
feeling of go against yourself.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.640 align:middle line:84%
You're doing so
well, and then boom.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.540 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.330 align:middle line:10%
I did again that kind of thing.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.640 align:middle line:84%
So why was I so stupid to
do these kind of things?

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, besides the synchronicity
that bring everything

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.510 align:middle line:84%
to have a meaning, there is
also the plan of the enemy.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And remember this
element is important,

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.730 align:middle line:90%
because it's a battle.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a battle that we're
fighting every day.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And the little things, as in
the major of things of life.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.320 align:middle line:84%
We talk in another episode
about the past life.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And I talk about past lives,
that they have another weight,

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.050 align:middle line:90%
let's say.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.630 align:middle line:84%
They are very significant
for our soul journey.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can tell you,
this life, and it

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.610 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter what is going
on in your personal life

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.870 align:middle line:84%
at this moment, this is
one of these crucial lives,

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:53.850 align:middle line:84%
the one that probably is
opening many possibilities

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.175 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of our future life.

00:07:56.175 --> 00:07:59.970 align:middle line:84%
So spending this life
in the best way we can,

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:03.340 align:middle line:84%
it is one of the biggest
goals for all of us.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.640 align:middle line:84%
Obviously we talk about
spending according

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.560 align:middle line:84%
to our spiritual
values, according

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.810 align:middle line:90%
to our spiritual reawakening.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.640 align:middle line:84%
But, again, I'm sure
that if you are here

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.080 align:middle line:84%
and you're listening
to my words,

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.900 align:middle line:84%
it's because there is a very
important, specific reason.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.730 align:middle line:84%
So that's a reason why we bring
the experience of the time

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.980 align:middle line:84%
travel, like one
of the many others,

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.530 align:middle line:84%
One of the many possible
spiritual experiences.

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Then as every experience,
it can enrich or not.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.120 align:middle line:84%
There could be a point
where to, let's say,

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:38.010 align:middle line:84%
create the base of utter
change in your life,

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:42.270 align:middle line:84%
or just being stuck
in your ego situation.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, it's always
an interesting game.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.700 align:middle line:84%
It's always an
interesting process.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
matter where you are.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.830 align:middle line:84%
You know that there is
something all the time more

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.110 align:middle line:84%
that you can learn, and
that you can change,

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.310 align:middle line:90%
or that you can transform.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's just another
step of the many steps

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:03.990 align:middle line:84%
that you can do on the
path to the alignment.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, the idea that we
are moving in a sort

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:14.160 align:middle line:84%
a web of multiple unlimited
possibilities, a matrix,

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.830 align:middle line:84%
the idea of a time sphere
or a time territory,

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.050 align:middle line:84%
that contain every
possible event,

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:23.910 align:middle line:84%
it's really like
to imagine to move

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:29.250 align:middle line:84%
in a web that is constantly
creating multiple infinite

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.750 align:middle line:90%
possibilities.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And it also gives us
an incredible power,

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.200 align:middle line:90%
because if we know--

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.466 align:middle line:90%
and what it means to know?

00:09:38.466 --> 00:09:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Know means-- if,
through my free will,

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.020 align:middle line:84%
we might open
consciousness, I know

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:49.260 align:middle line:84%
what I desire, what
is my mission, what

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.350 align:middle line:84%
I have to achieve, what
is my next step in life.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have
unlimited possibility

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:56.440 align:middle line:90%
to make this happen.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And if this does not happen,
well, it's for several reasons.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Or because this is
not what I have to do,

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.110 align:middle line:84%
and my mind or my ego is telling
me, no, you have to do this.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.970 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And then the example of
smashing the nose in the wall.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.970 align:middle line:84%
It is the universe
that is trying

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:14.070 align:middle line:84%
to tell you that this is
not the direction, which

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:14.870 align:middle line:90%
is the universe.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:16.770 align:middle line:90%
It is the synchronicity.

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:19.650 align:middle line:84%
That guided by complexity,
say you, no, my dear.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.070 align:middle line:90%
This is not the way.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you go there,
bang, bang, bang.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Free will sometimes
doesn't agree.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.740 align:middle line:84%
But then sometimes
we can say, OK,

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.190 align:middle line:84%
now that the nose is a little
bit not aligned anymore,

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:35.890 align:middle line:84%
maybe I have to take
some other direction.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:40.920 align:middle line:10%
So when we know the direction
through these infinite possible

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.650 align:middle line:10%
branches of time, we can
reach the destination,

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:49.920 align:middle line:10%
if I can use this metaphor,
I mean, as fast as possible.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.620 align:middle line:10%
Because at that point,
it is the synchronicity

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.280 align:middle line:10%
that is working for me.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And I guide the synchronicity
through my free will

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.530 align:middle line:84%
to serve this stream of
events that will make

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.360 align:middle line:90%
me do the things like this.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And then the right
person are arriving.

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:07.830 align:middle line:84%
The right situation
are arriving.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:09.300 align:middle line:84%
The right possibility
are arriving.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.190 align:middle line:84%
But because I am ready
inside, I did a shift

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:17.010 align:middle line:84%
that make me see these
events, like something

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:21.980 align:middle line:84%
that can make me the shortcut
to where I want to land.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.280 align:middle line:90%
It's always like that.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can tell you, in some
moments, more than one moment

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.240 align:middle line:84%
of my life, I felt to be
in that perfect stream.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.450 align:middle line:90%
Voom.

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Where you got exactly with
an incredible perfect timing,

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.530 align:middle line:90%
exactly everything you need.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:45.810 align:middle line:84%
But this was proportionate to
how this was close to me, me

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:48.480 align:middle line:84%
as an individual, or
for my ego things.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Or, as more, this was for
a service, for a purpose.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.600 align:middle line:84%
It was something that
was detached from me,

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.850 align:middle line:90%
or from my personal interest.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.600 align:middle line:90%
Then it was even more quick.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure that in your
life you already cross

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:03.780 align:middle line:90%
some of these moments.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:04.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And these give you
also this feeling

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:12.660 align:middle line:84%
of almost unlimited power,
OK, that is pretty, whew.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.700 align:middle line:84%
It's really a
wonderful sensation.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.900 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm telling you is that
we can live our life constantly

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.490 align:middle line:90%
in that sensation.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:22.020 align:middle line:84%
That means that
we can accelerate

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.232 align:middle line:90%
our process of enlightenment.

00:12:23.232 --> 00:12:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's also
probably the reason

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:29.190 align:middle line:84%
why every spiritual research is
telling that we can enlighten.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:32.190 align:middle line:84%
We can do the
metamorphosis in one life.

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:33.990 align:middle line:90%
It is possible technically.

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Then unfortunately,
we still have the nose

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:39.540 align:middle line:84%
not in the right position
against the wall.

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:43.530 align:middle line:84%
But if we can listen to
the synchronicity, detached

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:48.200 align:middle line:84%
by the effects of what we
imagine is the cause, effect

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.840 align:middle line:84%
of things, well, then we
are just opening the wings,

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.220 align:middle line:90%
and we are starting to fly.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.500 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it is interesting.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.360 align:middle line:90%
We have to send back the person.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.620 align:middle line:90%
You know why?

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Because the person is
in one of their first

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:05.180 align:middle line:90%
incarnations in this planet.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:09.157 align:middle line:84%
So technically there's
nothing to research.

00:13:09.157 --> 00:13:10.865 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why we
are not researching

00:13:10.865 --> 00:13:12.350 align:middle line:84%
in past lives in
another planet is

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:15.860 align:middle line:84%
because, obviously,
the logic of that life

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:18.980 align:middle line:84%
will not be compatible,
let's say, with logic

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.700 align:middle line:84%
that we can understood living
here on the planet Earth.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:27.140 align:middle line:84%
So we have to say, sorry,
we cannot do the research.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.600 align:middle line:84%
You're here as one of
the first incarnations.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.170 align:middle line:84%
So maybe there are the
other experiences more

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:35.410 align:middle line:90%
suitable for your experience.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.440 align:middle line:90%
So that happens.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.140 align:middle line:84%
So again, when we
talk about evolution

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:44.810 align:middle line:84%
we need to enlarge this concept
to make it really bigger,

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:47.930 align:middle line:84%
and to fill also the
wholeness of the fact

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:51.540 align:middle line:84%
that we are all one, but
not only in this planet,

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.770 align:middle line:84%
but everything in
the universal form.

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And imagine that we are changing
a stream of synchronicity that

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:04.070 align:middle line:84%
is already playing the
perfect deal for us.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:05.340 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:11.040 align:middle line:84%
But we probably are forgetting
a couple of elements.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And without repeating
or bringing back

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:18.490 align:middle line:84%
the element of the
separation of the timeline,

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:24.900 align:middle line:84%
and is the fact that we are not
moving in a neutral context.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:30.450 align:middle line:84%
The universal form, there
is an element only inside

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:31.460 align:middle line:90%
of the universal form.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:33.050 align:middle line:84%
But here is where
we are playing.

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Here is where we
are doing things.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:39.750 align:middle line:84%
That is totally absolutely
against the evolution.

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:45.110 align:middle line:84%
It's totally against the
spiritualization of the method.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:47.480 align:middle line:84%
It's totally against
about whatever

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.430 align:middle line:90%
is the concept of life.

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:52.160 align:middle line:90%


00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.230 align:middle line:84%
We talk about this element
with the name the enemy.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.570 align:middle line:90%


00:14:58.570 --> 00:14:59.370 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.287 align:middle line:84%
Talking about the enemy
is always a little bit

00:15:01.287 --> 00:15:04.350 align:middle line:84%
challenging, because
people, they might imagine,

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:05.770 align:middle line:90%
positive and negative.

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:11.130 align:middle line:84%
So in every situation
there is the white side

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:12.270 align:middle line:90%
and the black side.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, the enemy,
it's something even

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:19.507 align:middle line:90%
more challenging to understand.

00:15:19.507 --> 00:15:21.840 align:middle line:84%
But not because it's difficult
to understand, but really

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.310 align:middle line:90%
to deal.

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:24.900 align:middle line:84%
So the enemy is
not the negative.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.510 align:middle line:90%
The enemy is really the no life.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:31.650 align:middle line:84%
It's the nothingness, in the
true sense of whatever is going

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:34.430 align:middle line:90%
to be against the evolution.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And we can see
the manifestation,

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.130 align:middle line:84%
and the effect of
the enemy, at least,

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:41.900 align:middle line:90%
in three different steps.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:45.140 align:middle line:90%
One is in the universal form.

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:48.602 align:middle line:84%
It is what I just
said, the nothingness.

00:15:48.602 --> 00:15:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's only the
universal form,

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:55.370 align:middle line:84%
because outside of the universal
form, the enemy doesn't exist.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.590 align:middle line:84%
The second manifestation
of the enemy

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:01.020 align:middle line:90%
is what we are containing.

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:01.820 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Similar to the idea
of the original sin

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:09.420 align:middle line:84%
of the Catholic religion,
when we are incarnated,

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.900 align:middle line:84%
so when we are taking a
body-- and it doesn't matter

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:16.190 align:middle line:84%
in which planet or in
which body we are using,

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:18.630 align:middle line:90%
because we are in the form.

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:21.030 align:middle line:84%
The form is already
containing the enemy.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.750 align:middle line:84%
So inside of me, inside of
you, inside of everyone,

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.060 align:middle line:84%
we have this component
that we call the enemy.

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.140 align:middle line:90%


00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.690 align:middle line:84%
The third manifestation
of the enemy

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:36.330 align:middle line:84%
is what we call the
agents of the enemy.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:40.975 align:middle line:84%
That makes people,
individuals, civilization,

00:16:40.975 --> 00:16:42.780 align:middle line:90%
that they choose--

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.510 align:middle line:84%
and it's very interesting
to say choose--

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:46.950 align:middle line:90%
to serve the enemy.

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:49.890 align:middle line:84%
So they choose to serve
the destruction instead

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:51.480 align:middle line:90%
of the creation.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.150 align:middle line:84%
They choose to be against the
spiritualization of the method

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.590 align:middle line:90%
instead of doing it.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:00.580 align:middle line:84%
We can see these elements all
along the history of humankind

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.920 align:middle line:84%
in many different
moments, and in

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.350 align:middle line:90%
many different crucial events.

00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:07.150 align:middle line:90%
Who knows.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:09.579 align:middle line:84%
Probably the same
asteroid that we've

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:13.780 align:middle line:84%
been talking,
regardless the ending

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.880 align:middle line:84%
of the Atlantis
civilization, who knows?

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was not
a natural event,

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:23.770 align:middle line:84%
but an event that maybe is not
even so difficult to create.

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:26.125 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, if
on the other side

00:17:26.125 --> 00:17:28.000 align:middle line:84%
there's not even the
attention that something

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.080 align:middle line:84%
is going on, making a
very, very good effect

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.900 align:middle line:90%
in terms of the enemy goals.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.760 align:middle line:84%
Because imagine in
terms of evolution what

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.700 align:middle line:90%
it means to have Atlantis lost.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Remember, high
level of complexity,

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.290 align:middle line:90%
collapsing of that complexity.

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.080 align:middle line:84%
But what could be
even more interesting

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.940 align:middle line:90%
is the affect inside of us.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And talking about
the enemy, it's

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:53.920 align:middle line:84%
very important to
refer to the fact

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:58.610 align:middle line:84%
that the enemy is not
from where we come from.

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:01.000 align:middle line:84%
So remember the beginning
of the beginning,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.700 align:middle line:84%
the myth of the
mirror, when we talk

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.460 align:middle line:84%
about this primeval
human divinity that

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:09.230 align:middle line:84%
is this state that
we call the real.

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
the threshold that

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:14.410 align:middle line:84%
is the aura of what then we
call the universal form, where

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:16.090 align:middle line:90%
we are in this moment.

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And then there is this species
of these primedial human

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:21.400 align:middle line:84%
divinity, what we
call the device part,

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.790 align:middle line:84%
not only that are entering
from the real to the threshold,

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:29.140 align:middle line:84%
and then here into
the universal form.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:30.670 align:middle line:90%
Where is the enemy?

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.330 align:middle line:90%
The enemy is not in the real.

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:33.880 align:middle line:90%
He's not even in the threshold.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.670 align:middle line:90%
It's only in the universal form.

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:39.520 align:middle line:84%
This is the reason why we
have the enemy inside of us.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And the enemy is inside
of every single lifeform

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:46.460 align:middle line:90%
that is in the universal form.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.240 align:middle line:84%
So how we can get rid
of the enemy finally?

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, we get rid of the enemy
when there's no form anymore.

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:57.280 align:middle line:84%
So exactly in that moment
that we call enlightenment.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Or one more time, in
spiritual physics,

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:02.200 align:middle line:90%
we call it metamorphosis.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.980 align:middle line:84%
When we are metamorphosizing
ourself, what it means?

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.170 align:middle line:84%
That balance between
mass and energy,

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:10.310 align:middle line:84%
remember, spiritualization
of the method.

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:13.960 align:middle line:84%
So I am accumulating more and
more energy instead of mass

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.910 align:middle line:90%
until there is no mass anymore.

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:17.020 align:middle line:90%
There's only energy.

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.460 align:middle line:90%
There's only light.

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.100 align:middle line:84%
So in that moment there
is no form anymore,

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:23.470 align:middle line:90%
that there is no mass anymore.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:27.710 align:middle line:90%
We get rid of the enemy.

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:29.540 align:middle line:90%
But only that moment.

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And when we are getting rid of
this circle of reincarnation

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:35.440 align:middle line:84%
that we are going
on, and on, and on,

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.870 align:middle line:84%
and on, well, only when
we don't need anymore.

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:41.980 align:middle line:84%
So until we are not
spiritualizing the matter,

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.780 align:middle line:90%
there is still work left.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:46.780 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately,
or fortunately, I

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:47.890 align:middle line:90%
have to come back.

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:48.910 align:middle line:90%
And come back.

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And have the possibility
to leave the spirits.

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And through this experience,
I transform myself.

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:55.090 align:middle line:90%
To do what?

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:58.260 align:middle line:10%
To accumulate more
experience, more information

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:02.260 align:middle line:10%
to finally then enlighten
and metamorphosize myself.

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:05.590 align:middle line:90%
At that point, no enemy anymore.

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:09.490 align:middle line:84%
As individual, as divine
spark, or collectively,

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:13.060 align:middle line:84%
when a sort of percentage
of this divine spark

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.860 align:middle line:84%
will do the same, there's,
again, critical mass.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:16.990 align:middle line:90%
So not 100%.

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:19.810 align:middle line:84%
But probably enough
percentage of them,

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:24.560 align:middle line:84%
the entire universal form
will be transformed by energy.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:29.380 align:middle line:84%
So we will accomplish our main
goal, the spiritualization

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.210 align:middle line:90%
of the universal form.

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Until that moment, we
know, unfortunately, we

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.010 align:middle line:84%
have to deal with this
force, with this element that

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:40.870 align:middle line:84%
sometimes is not easy
to get completely.

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:45.050 align:middle line:90%
That is what we call the enemy.

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:49.070 align:middle line:84%
What are what we
call parallel worlds?

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:54.200 align:middle line:84%
This is a term that probably
is familiar for some of you

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.850 align:middle line:90%
and is very interesting.

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:57.140 align:middle line:90%
What is a parallel world?

00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Or which is the
explanation that we

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:02.720 align:middle line:84%
do in physical spirit,
the spiritual physics

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.990 align:middle line:90%
in our spiritual path?

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:05.970 align:middle line:90%
The parallel world.

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:08.650 align:middle line:90%
It's literally a branch.

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:12.350 align:middle line:84%
Probably a branch that
it's carry on something

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:15.680 align:middle line:84%
that, in terms of
evolution, it's really high.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:21.245 align:middle line:84%
Or much higher of what has been
expressed by the main trunk.

00:21:21.245 --> 00:21:22.770 align:middle line:90%
It will happen.

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Instead of collapse,
because it cannot collapse.

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.390 align:middle line:84%
If it's still expressing,
if it's still, let's say,

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:33.420 align:middle line:84%
following a higher
level of evolution,

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:37.650 align:middle line:84%
and higher level of complexity,
it cannot literally collapse

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:38.650 align:middle line:90%
on the main one.

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:42.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's becoming literally
a branch strong enough

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.360 align:middle line:90%
to be separated by the trunk.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.710 align:middle line:90%
Parallel world.

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:48.210 align:middle line:90%
Parallel timeline.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Parallel branches that are
going to follow literally

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:55.470 align:middle line:84%
a new timeline, or a timeline
that will never collapse,

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:57.630 align:middle line:90%
but is still a parallel world.

00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.760 align:middle line:84%
That means that in
that parallel world,

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.780 align:middle line:84%
everything is going to
grow, as in the trunk

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.125 align:middle line:90%
of the other timeline.

00:22:06.125 --> 00:22:07.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
parallel world,

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:12.360 align:middle line:84%
because these could be, for
example, one of the worlds

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.990 align:middle line:84%
from where some
civilization, they just left.

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:17.970 align:middle line:84%
You probably remember,
and I've been

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:20.370 align:middle line:84%
talking in many other
episodes about the fact

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:24.075 align:middle line:84%
that during the history of the
humankind, some civilization,

00:22:24.075 --> 00:22:26.490 align:middle line:84%
a civilization with the
knowledge, a civilization

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:30.150 align:middle line:84%
that they knew how to manage all
these aspects, there is being

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:33.990 align:middle line:84%
probably also some decision,
some use of the free will

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:37.515 align:middle line:84%
from this civilization
to completely left,

00:22:37.515 --> 00:22:42.170 align:middle line:84%
left the planet, left this
time, because for them probably,

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:45.000 align:middle line:84%
let's say, it was not worth it
anymore, or they didn't have

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.770 align:middle line:84%
hope enough to save the planet
Earth, whatever it means now

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:54.870 align:middle line:84%
save, without being
in a negative ideas.

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:57.660 align:middle line:84%
But if you study the
Mayas, for example,

00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:02.040 align:middle line:84%
when they are going to be at
their top, all of a sudden,

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.270 align:middle line:90%
they disappear.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:08.220 align:middle line:84%
The main city, the temples,
everything is completely empty.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Who is going to
stay are, let's say,

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.770 align:middle line:84%
the farmers, the people
that were living,

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:17.220 align:middle line:84%
let's say, aside of the
core of this civilization.

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:21.167 align:middle line:84%
All the others, they look to
being completely disappeared.

00:23:21.167 --> 00:23:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that they are
going to find the body.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:24.050 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:25.650 align:middle line:90%
They are literally disappearing.

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:29.770 align:middle line:84%
But even if you study the
Incas, another very fascinating

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:32.970 align:middle line:84%
civilization, it looks
very much still the same.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.580 align:middle line:84%
When they are at the
top of their evolution

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:40.320 align:middle line:84%
of their civilization,
they simply disappeared.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.750 align:middle line:84%
The Etruscans,
this very unknown,

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:46.800 align:middle line:84%
mysterious civilization in
the central part of Italy,

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.030 align:middle line:90%
very well evolved.

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And again, they
looks to disappeared.

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:52.825 align:middle line:84%
And who knows how many
other civilizations

00:23:52.825 --> 00:23:54.630 align:middle line:90%
they did still the same?

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:56.100 align:middle line:90%
So where did they go?

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the
possible interpretations

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:04.680 align:middle line:84%
is literally to have been taking
one of these parallel worlds.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, talking
about time traveling

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.770 align:middle line:90%
is not only to fascinate you.

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:13.920 align:middle line:84%
In some of the possibility,
not the only one really.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.480 align:middle line:90%
To bring evolution.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.000 align:middle line:84%
In this case, also
to help us to keep

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.360 align:middle line:84%
separated these
different timelines.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.895 align:middle line:84%
And you might also
be asking, how

00:24:23.895 --> 00:24:29.280 align:middle line:84%
is it possible to know which
events you need to change

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.660 align:middle line:90%
to make this possible?

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Because I mean, we are
talking about what?

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.740 align:middle line:84%
An almost unlimited
stream of events

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:41.650 align:middle line:84%
that are going to be
all connected to that.

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, here we are going
more in the technology,

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:49.760 align:middle line:84%
more in the technical
aspect of the time travel.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, I can
introduce the idea of chambers

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:57.540 align:middle line:90%
of time observation.

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.620 align:middle line:84%
We probably briefly
touched also this element.

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:04.290 align:middle line:84%
It is exactly what
is needed to observe

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:06.150 align:middle line:90%
the possible effect of time.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I have to
tell you, whatever

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:12.230 align:middle line:84%
is going to be changed by
a time travel in the past,

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:16.920 align:middle line:84%
it will reflect something
here into the present.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.650 align:middle line:84%
I might not even perceive
there is an effect done

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:20.480 align:middle line:90%
by a time travel.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.280 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.360 align:middle line:90%
It's been here.

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.160 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Because in my perception,
in my perception

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:28.000 align:middle line:84%
my mind is telling me,
there is only one time.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.610 align:middle line:90%
Here there is a past.

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:31.260 align:middle line:90%
After there is a future.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about
the perception of time.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.060 align:middle line:90%
I will not fit it.

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.120 align:middle line:90%
It will just come.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:37.200 align:middle line:90%
It will just happen.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.710 align:middle line:90%
And it was always there.

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:40.980 align:middle line:90%
It has been always like this.

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:46.290 align:middle line:84%
So not to have this
kind of not awareness.

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:50.580 align:middle line:84%
You need to have places where
you can literally be outside

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:53.860 align:middle line:90%
of time to observe time.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.130 align:middle line:84%
This is what we call the
chambers or observation

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:58.080 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.670 align:middle line:90%
Where they are?

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, in Damanhur
some of these places

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.810 align:middle line:84%
are directly in the
temporal humankind,

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:08.200 align:middle line:84%
and directly in this
underground temple

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.580 align:middle line:84%
that we built, according
to ancient sacred geometry,

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:16.780 align:middle line:84%
but also according to the
movements of what we mentioned

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.660 align:middle line:90%
with the name synchronic lines.

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And remember that
these are literally

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:27.150 align:middle line:84%
the reverb, the highway of the
energy of the planet, energy

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:28.110 align:middle line:90%
that is not just one.

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:30.720 align:middle line:84%
So we are not just talking
about vital energy.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:35.100 align:middle line:84%
So the synchronic lines are
carrying on synchronic energy,

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:39.000 align:middle line:84%
time energy, and many
other kinds of energy that

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.150 align:middle line:84%
are extremely crucial to have,
let's say, the power enough

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:46.620 align:middle line:84%
then to succeed in
what could be also

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.140 align:middle line:84%
an inspiration,
or a time travel.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.170 align:middle line:90%
Many people specialize in that.

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:56.470 align:middle line:84%
They can really literally
observe the geography of time.

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:57.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:59.560 align:middle line:84%
It could be funny to talk
about this about time.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:00.810 align:middle line:90%
But it is literally like that.

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:02.220 align:middle line:90%
So compare.

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And to see how this
stream might then

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.520 align:middle line:90%
effect what's right now here.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Because this is, at this
moment, the most important place

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:13.180 align:middle line:90%
for us.

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Even if we're floating between
these different possibilities,

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:20.370 align:middle line:84%
even if in this new
timeline we have still

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:22.500 align:middle line:84%
time branches also
in the new timeline.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.930 align:middle line:84%
So the structures of time
that we've been describing

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:28.150 align:middle line:84%
is the same one that is working
also in this new timeline.

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:30.220 align:middle line:90%
And don't forget that.

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:34.260 align:middle line:84%
But in all of this,
so the observation

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.180 align:middle line:84%
of what is going
on in this moment

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:40.080 align:middle line:84%
is obviously at this
time the most important.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Because this is where
I'm playing the game.

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:45.840 align:middle line:84%
Or from where, at
this moment, my soul

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.110 align:middle line:84%
is playing the main game,
knowing that, in any case,

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:53.190 align:middle line:84%
the soul is standing
much more into this field

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:55.410 align:middle line:90%
that we call time.

00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:58.460 align:middle line:90%
