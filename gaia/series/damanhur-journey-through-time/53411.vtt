00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:09.810 align:middle line:90%


00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:10.730 align:middle line:90%
Hi, I'm Jay Weidner.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.160 align:middle line:10%
And we're back for our third
installment of our talks

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.750 align:middle line:10%
with Crotalo, who comes from the
Damanhur Institute and sacred

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.930 align:middle line:10%
Mystery School in Italy.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.980 align:middle line:90%
What town again?

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.770 align:middle line:90%
In Damanhur, nearby Turin.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, Turin.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to do a
quick review of what we've

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.737 align:middle line:90%
been talking about before.

00:00:29.737 --> 00:00:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And then we're
going to go in more

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.240 align:middle line:84%
depth into the great
imagery that he has

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.650 align:middle line:90%
brought with him from Italy.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:36.470 align:middle line:90%
How you doing?

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.470 align:middle line:90%
Very good, thank you.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure to be back here.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.540 align:middle line:84%
So let's do a quick
review, all right?

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.500 align:middle line:90%
What is Damanhur exactly?

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, Damanhur is a
sort of real dream.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.170 align:middle line:84%
It's the largest federation
of communities in Europe.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.695 align:middle line:10%
It was born in 1975
inspired from the dream

00:00:55.695 --> 00:00:58.110 align:middle line:10%
of Oberto Airaudi, Falco.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.100 align:middle line:10%
He was dreaming
about a place where

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.420 align:middle line:10%
to bring together
everyday life in Damanhur

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.560 align:middle line:10%
and the spiritual research.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.390 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately,
many times when

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.570 align:middle line:84%
we talk about spirituality,
we theorize a lot,

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.010 align:middle line:90%
or we have a lot of ideas.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.080 align:middle line:84%
But then on the practical
level, there is some separation.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.590 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of Damanhur
was to create a place

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.040 align:middle line:84%
to live together, but also to
make the spiritual research

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.914 align:middle line:84%
something that you
do every moment

00:01:26.914 --> 00:01:29.270 align:middle line:90%
in every part of your life.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.910 align:middle line:84%
So little by little, Damanhur
becomes something pretty big.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.320 align:middle line:10%
Because we're talking
now about 1,000 people

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.150 align:middle line:10%
that are living
in this place that

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.740 align:middle line:10%
is in the north of Italy nearby
Turin in this city called

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.540 align:middle line:10%
[INAUDIBLE].

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And Damanhur in expression of
this practical spirituality--

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.110 align:middle line:84%
let's say, to meditate
not only when we sit,

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.240 align:middle line:90%
but also when we move our hands.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.420 align:middle line:84%
So in this action, and in this
make it happen, all of this,

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.010 align:middle line:84%
creates this Temple
of Humankind that

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.280 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
popular things

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.210 align:middle line:90%
that people know about us.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.310 align:middle line:84%
It's the largest
underground temple

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.940 align:middle line:84%
completely built by hands from
us, from the Damanhurians.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.950 align:middle line:84%
It's more than 6,000 square
meters dug into the rock done

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.110 align:middle line:84%
according to the
ancient knowledge,

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.760 align:middle line:84%
or if you want,
the stone language,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.340 align:middle line:84%
the same used in the
Pyramids or in cathedrals

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.350 align:middle line:90%
or in other temples.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.890 align:middle line:10%
So you use the sacred
geometry to talk

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.490 align:middle line:10%
a language, a language
in this case that's

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.360 align:middle line:10%
touching the vital energy.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.170 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
when you are inside,

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.530 align:middle line:84%
when you're visiting,
when you're meditating,

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.570 align:middle line:84%
is a language that talks
really deep inside, just right

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.230 align:middle line:90%
into your soul.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's dedicated
to the humankind.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.060 align:middle line:10%
Because Damanhur is
not a new religion.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.550 align:middle line:10%
Damanhur doesn't
want to convince

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.280 align:middle line:10%
anyone about what we believe
and what we are researching.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.495 align:middle line:84%
But Damanhur is a
spiritual research.

00:03:06.495 --> 00:03:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And in this, we believe
that we can inspire people

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.400 align:middle line:84%
to find their way,
their spiritual way,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.600 align:middle line:90%
to find out why they're here.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Or as we say in Damanhur,
which is your mission,

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.290 align:middle line:90%
the reason why you're back.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.070 align:middle line:90%
There is a special thing to do.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.290 align:middle line:84%
So the temple is a place
dedicated to the humankind.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a place that
is dedicated to everyone

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.570 align:middle line:84%
and to the fact that everyone is
here because there is something

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.800 align:middle line:90%
special for this person.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.150 align:middle line:84%
So one of the goals is to help
people find out why they came

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.320 align:middle line:84%
back here, what their
mission is, in this life

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.580 align:middle line:84%
so that the incarnation
process is more complete.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.340 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you're right.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.980 align:middle line:84%
So we believe that we have
a bigger goal than simply,

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.340 align:middle line:84%
if I can say, go to work every
day, spend money, or more money

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.220 align:middle line:84%
than we earn, and go out to
restaurants, coming back.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.470 align:middle line:90%
So life is something bigger.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And life is not
only what appears,

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.370 align:middle line:90%
what we see with our eyes.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.110 align:middle line:84%
But life is also
what doesn't appear,

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.470 align:middle line:84%
is invisible, is what
we perceive but we

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.690 align:middle line:90%
cannot see with these eyes.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.260 align:middle line:84%
So Damanhur, like other
places in the world--

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.220 align:middle line:84%
and the Temple of Humankind
is one of these places built

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.170 align:middle line:84%
to inspire people, to inspire
talking a language that is not

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.650 align:middle line:84%
done on words, but is
done on, if you want,

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.960 align:middle line:84%
silence, or feelings, or energy,
that are a talk for the soul,

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.190 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity for the soul,
to express who we really are.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And who we really
are is not only

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.410 align:middle line:84%
what the others are
telling us who we are

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.420 align:middle line:90%
or what we have to do.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Because unfortunately we
are many times living a life

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.460 align:middle line:84%
that other people want from
us-- what our girlfriend

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.770 align:middle line:84%
or wife wants, or what
parents, teachers,

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.580 align:middle line:90%
businesses, et cetera.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.980 align:middle line:84%
So then we start to
appear how they like.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.090 align:middle line:84%
Because then we feel
that we are valuable.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.120 align:middle line:84%
But at the end, maybe we're
not really living the life

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.530 align:middle line:90%
that we feel, that we desire.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.220 align:middle line:84%
So there is moments in
life, that "crisis," where

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.330 align:middle line:84%
we stop for a
moment, and then we

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.640 align:middle line:84%
start to listen again what
is coming from inside,

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.750 align:middle line:90%
not what is coming from outside.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And then we might realize
that, oops, we're not really

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.360 align:middle line:90%
doing what we deserve to do.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And then people
are maybe changing,

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.560 align:middle line:90%
transforming their life.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.580 align:middle line:84%
So in that moment, when we start
to listen to the voice inside,

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.950 align:middle line:84%
we start to come close
to discover our mission--

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.300 align:middle line:84%
who we are according to
what we have to realize.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.340 align:middle line:84%
Again, there is
something very specific

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.060 align:middle line:84%
that every life is bringing for
us, something unique for us.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Like imagine to be all 007,
in this case, spiritual

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.630 align:middle line:90%
007 with mission to transform.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And then we have really to
transform our life according

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.340 align:middle line:90%
to what we have inside.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And inside we have so many
potentials, so many talents,

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.840 align:middle line:90%
so many possibilities.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.620 align:middle line:84%
So the temple is this
knocking at the door,

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.570 align:middle line:84%
is this opportunity to let the
soul express again the reason

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:27.500 align:middle line:90%
why we're here.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And we don't believe
that everyone has to come

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:30.590 align:middle line:90%
to live in Damanhur-- no.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.660 align:middle line:90%
This is not our intention.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.020 align:middle line:84%
But Damanhur can really
be that inspiration,

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.180 align:middle line:84%
that example, that
instrument that opens

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.300 align:middle line:90%
up a little bit the heart.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.380 align:middle line:84%
We can use the forensic words
to talk about these same things.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.080 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, it's using
spiritual principles

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.340 align:middle line:84%
to reprogram the person so that
they're more attuned to what

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.640 align:middle line:84%
they really are here
for and not for what

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.450 align:middle line:90%
they think they're here for.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:05.580 align:middle line:84%
That is pretty smart--
reprogramming, yes.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, we live our life
according to programs that we

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.770 align:middle line:90%
get since we were little kids.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.910 align:middle line:84%
In education, the
first eight years

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.790 align:middle line:84%
are pretty, pretty
important to get many

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.900 align:middle line:84%
of the programs, many
of the values, that then

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.760 align:middle line:90%
will influence our entire life.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And many times, then,
we don't understand

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.660 align:middle line:84%
why our life is going
always in some way,

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.690 align:middle line:90%
or we have always these issues.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And this also connects
to these programs

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:39.850 align:middle line:90%
that are running behind.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we're
not conscious of that.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:46.390 align:middle line:84%
So how we change
these programs--

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.760 align:middle line:84%
when we start to come back
to the values, when we start

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:55.073 align:middle line:84%
to come back to the significant,
why I'm here, the reason why

00:07:55.073 --> 00:07:58.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm back, and also
which are the values

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.360 align:middle line:90%
that are guiding my life.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.190 align:middle line:84%
So talking about spirituality
or spiritual research,

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:05.820 align:middle line:90%
well, there it is done.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.700 align:middle line:84%
It's really to come
back to the fundamental,

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:15.690 align:middle line:84%
come back to the basic values,
and then to reprogram ourself

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:19.190 align:middle line:84%
according to these new
values, or ancient values.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Because what is inside
is already everything.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.210 align:middle line:90%
So there's nothing new.

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:27.740 align:middle line:84%
We are simply remembering or,
let's say, open the memory

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.830 align:middle line:90%
that is coming from the past.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.169 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that
unfortunately we're

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:34.799 align:middle line:84%
living in a society where
all the attention is

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:37.669 align:middle line:84%
outside on the
surface, how we appear,

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:41.240 align:middle line:84%
how nice is this body, how we
dress, how we cut our hair,

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.900 align:middle line:84%
which car we're driving, and
et cetera, and et cetera.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So we constantly move the
attention from outside.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:52.080 align:middle line:84%
Every spiritual research,
it's exactly the opposite--

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.020 align:middle line:84%
brings attention deep inside,
but really deep inside

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.150 align:middle line:84%
in listening to
your inner voice,

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:02.000 align:middle line:84%
in touching your essence,
in touching the true meaning

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.660 align:middle line:90%
of who you are.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:07.830 align:middle line:84%
But people sometimes are lost
in this kind of environment.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.380 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't
know how to do it.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.080 align:middle line:90%
They never studied at school.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Or their parents never
told them what to do.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.910 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: And they've
never sat in silence.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Yes, or many times--
I mean, oh my goodness,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.040 align:middle line:84%
don't even talk
about some topic.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Or don't try to
express yourself.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Because then you appear
weak in front of the others,

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.010 align:middle line:84%
or you're not allowed
to thinking in that way.

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:31.840 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately, we are
trapped in a sort of box

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.900 align:middle line:84%
where we know more what we are
not allowed to do than what

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.234 align:middle line:90%
we are allowed to express.

00:09:38.234 --> 00:09:39.100 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: That's right.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.066 align:middle line:90%
That's a great way to put it.

00:09:40.066 --> 00:09:43.220 align:middle line:84%
So spirituality, in
every kind of form,

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:47.400 align:middle line:90%
is the path to come back inside.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And then inside, listen
and research and discover

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.680 align:middle line:90%
the true values of your life.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you want, this
is a great opportunity

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:00.330 align:middle line:84%
this we have in this
time, the time of crisis.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:05.330 align:middle line:84%
From 2008, everybody's mad
about money, financial things,

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.470 align:middle line:90%
the economy, and so on.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, for me, for us,
it's not just about

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.050 align:middle line:84%
a crisis regarding
the financial system

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:16.430 align:middle line:90%
or the free market or the banks.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:19.840 align:middle line:84%
But it's more a
crisis about values.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.780 align:middle line:90%
What is true?

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.410 align:middle line:90%
What is not true?

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:27.480 align:middle line:84%
It's true my family, my
friendships, the people nearby,

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.520 align:middle line:84%
my feelings, my emotion, is
more true than what I receive

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.220 align:middle line:84%
from the bank, a piece
of paper or letter

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.990 align:middle line:84%
that's saying that I have
a zero more or a zero less.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And then I feel safe
if I have a zero more,

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.820 align:middle line:84%
and I feel unsafe
if it's a zero less.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:42.720 align:middle line:90%
So what is true?

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.530 align:middle line:90%
What is not true?

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:47.350 align:middle line:84%
What is fake, and
what is really real?

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:49.620 align:middle line:84%
So many people are really
questioning themselves.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And they are really
also suffering.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
not used to this.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And the entire system
seems to be now so

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.600 align:middle line:90%
unstable, almost to collapse.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.300 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, probably because we are
in a new age or in a new era

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.920 align:middle line:84%
that can really open something
completely different.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.680 align:middle line:84%
But to do that, we
have to come back.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.430 align:middle line:84%
We have to come back inside
and then finally feel

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:20.080 align:middle line:84%
what is true for us,
not for what is outside.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.820 align:middle line:84%
So this, for us, is
a great opportunity,

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.110 align:middle line:90%
crisis, to make change.

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Because when everything is
going well, who wants to change?

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:29.070 align:middle line:90%
No one.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Only when we are in
a sort of crisis then

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:34.160 align:middle line:90%
we are, yes, open to transform.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.610 align:middle line:84%
So crises are an
incredible opportunity

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:42.320 align:middle line:84%
now, not only to
change people, but

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.020 align:middle line:90%
probably to change the system.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't believe that
we have to destroy the system,

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:50.270 align:middle line:84%
or because sometimes you say,
OK, the system is not working.

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:51.440 align:middle line:90%
Let's destroy the system.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.040 align:middle line:90%
Well no, it doesn't work.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.000 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: It
needs to be fixed.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:56.700 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:01.960 align:middle line:84%
Or let's say we have to change
the system, but from inside.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:07.060 align:middle line:84%
So we believe that
now the opportunity

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:12.691 align:middle line:84%
is to change, but not from
above, but from below,

00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:13.390 align:middle line:90%
from the bottom.

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.270 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Because if
you change from below,

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.461 align:middle line:90%
the change will happen above.

00:12:16.461 --> 00:12:17.660 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO:
Exactly, so we don't

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:21.534 align:middle line:84%
have to wait that president
will make the changes we need.

00:12:21.534 --> 00:12:23.200 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: That only
politicians or scientists--

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.600 align:middle line:84%
Or politicians or
important people--

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.770 align:middle line:90%
no, we are the important people.

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:31.790 align:middle line:84%
We are the ones that
are changing the world.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And the first step is really
to be conscious of this.

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:35.960 align:middle line:90%
You can change the world.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:36.900 align:middle line:90%
I can change the world.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Everybody can change the world
if we're conscious of this.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:43.080 align:middle line:84%
So the change starts
from the bottom.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.690 align:middle line:90%
It starts from people.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:46.030 align:middle line:90%
We have to care about people.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.190 align:middle line:84%
We have to care about
what they feel inside.

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:52.490 align:middle line:84%
We have to care about what
they feel is their truth.

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And if it's true, it will be
in the respect of their truth.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Because this is another
big topic-- the respect,

00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:59.440 align:middle line:90%
oh my goodness.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Religion, how they
respect themselves--

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.657 align:middle line:90%
actually, probably not so much.

00:13:04.657 --> 00:13:05.690 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Not very much, no.

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Are we able really to respect
the ideas of the others?

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.190 align:middle line:90%
Mm, eh, probably not so much.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:12.990 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about
the truth, we don't talk

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:16.010 align:middle line:90%
about one truth or one god.

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:19.560 align:middle line:84%
We talk about the fact
that truth is a crystal

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.770 align:middle line:90%
based on many different faces.

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And all of these faces
is a different truth.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.370 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk
about the change,

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:27.880 align:middle line:84%
it's about the
change of the fact

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:33.310 align:middle line:84%
that people have to
choose their truth.

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.560 align:middle line:84%
But to do that, they
have to feel it before.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And after that,
this truth has to be

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:40.510 align:middle line:90%
in the respect of the others.

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:43.440 align:middle line:84%
When this happens
from the bottom,

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.200 align:middle line:90%
this will change all the system.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.310 align:middle line:84%
So the reason why Damanhur
is, let's say, encouraging

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:52.440 align:middle line:84%
so much people to
come to visit us,

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.710 align:middle line:84%
to come to meditate
in the into temple,

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:59.150 align:middle line:84%
or we are ambassadors traveling
all over the world to spread

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:01.840 align:middle line:84%
the message and also then
to teach different kinds

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.740 align:middle line:84%
of seminars or topics, is
really to inspire people

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:12.670 align:middle line:84%
to find their way, inspire
people to look inside,

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:16.120 align:middle line:84%
giving them an instrument,
spiritual instrument--

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.300 align:middle line:84%
techniques, whatever
you want to call--

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.520 align:middle line:84%
to dive into their
feelings, and then to find

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.230 align:middle line:90%
out which is their mission.

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:26.690 align:middle line:84%
When people are doing
that, we are starting

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:31.080 align:middle line:84%
to create the movement that
will change the world according

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:34.140 align:middle line:84%
to what the people will
believe in their values

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.900 align:middle line:84%
and in their respect
of the values.

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.690 align:middle line:84%
Because spirituality
is something universal.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:42.910 align:middle line:84%
It's not just reserved for
someone or for some religion.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:46.510 align:middle line:90%
So this is the general approach.

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And Damanhur is also the example
that, practically speaking,

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.830 align:middle line:84%
it's also possible to
create a new reality,

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:55.640 align:middle line:90%
new society, new way of living.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.090 align:middle line:84%
The idea of the community,
that unfortunately

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:02.050 align:middle line:84%
sometimes is more connected to
sex, drugs, and rock and roll.

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Or in the past, it
was more like this.

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:09.210 align:middle line:84%
It's, for us, an
interesting experiment

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:11.820 align:middle line:84%
not only to create a
new society, but also,

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.920 align:middle line:90%
again, to work inside of you.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you
live with others--

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:20.300 align:middle line:84%
and I have to say that
community doesn't mean that you

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.200 align:middle line:90%
are 20 people in one room, no.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.140 align:middle line:84%
That could be fun for a few
days, but it's not working.

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.910 align:middle line:84%
So community means that everyone
has their private room--

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:32.770 align:middle line:84%
couple, single,
couple with children,

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.000 align:middle line:90%
young people, old people.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.450 align:middle line:84%
So we share the common
room-- the kitchen,

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:41.260 align:middle line:84%
the bathroom, the
living room, et cetera.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:45.250 align:middle line:84%
But we are creating then what we
call a nuclear family of about

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:49.620 align:middle line:84%
18, 22 people that are
living together as families,

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.540 align:middle line:90%
like large families.

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:53.460 align:middle line:84%
But the opportunity
to live together

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:57.030 align:middle line:84%
is not only an incredible
celebration of experience.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Because you share not only
your life, but the life

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:02.490 align:middle line:84%
of the other 20 people with
the different perspective,

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.220 align:middle line:84%
with the different logic,
sometimes also with

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.690 align:middle line:90%
a different culture, languages.

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Because Damanhur is an
international place.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.230 align:middle line:84%
So we have people really
from all over the world.

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.400 align:middle line:84%
But living together,
spiritually speaking,

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.230 align:middle line:84%
it's a great, great
exercise when you

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:18.900 align:middle line:90%
want that everyday exercise.

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:21.015 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
live with the others,

00:16:21.015 --> 00:16:23.560 align:middle line:84%
it's like to have mirrors,
do you know what I mean?

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Many mirrors around you,
and they are constantly

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.110 align:middle line:90%
reflecting who you are.

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Because many times, we have an
idea of us that is not exactly

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:34.470 align:middle line:90%
what we project from outside.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:39.250 align:middle line:84%
So maybe I feel and I believe
that I'm so good, so fantastic,

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.480 align:middle line:84%
so generous, and then
maybe the others don't

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.350 align:middle line:90%
have the same perspective.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:48.960 align:middle line:84%
So living together gives you
always the exact position

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:49.960 align:middle line:90%
in where you are.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And many times what you really
don't like of the others

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:57.300 align:middle line:84%
is many times what
you really like

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.550 align:middle line:90%
of what you don't like of you.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:04.150 align:middle line:84%
So living together is an
acceleration of that process

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:09.329 align:middle line:84%
that every spiritual research
brings-- the transformation,

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:12.609 align:middle line:84%
the change, and in this
case, not to transform what

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:15.980 align:middle line:84%
is already good, but
to change what probably

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.200 align:middle line:90%
is still not completely good.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:22.680 align:middle line:84%
So Damanhur is a model, is
an experience, is an example,

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:27.060 align:middle line:84%
is an inspiration to say,
hey, if we did it in Italy

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.980 align:middle line:84%
with no money in this
little village with not so

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.050 align:middle line:84%
many opportunities,
come on, everybody

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.340 align:middle line:90%
can do it all over the world.

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And the community
model, who knows?

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:41.170 align:middle line:84%
It could be maybe a future
model for the humankind.

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Maybe people, instead of living
millions in the same place,

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:48.910 align:middle line:84%
and they don't even know who
is living in front of you,

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:53.190 align:middle line:84%
well, people might create many
different communities all based

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:56.490 align:middle line:84%
on their values, all
based on their beliefs,

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:59.000 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time, in the
respect of the other beliefs,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.810 align:middle line:84%
in the respect of
the other values,

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.690 align:middle line:90%
and then creating diversity.

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:06.620 align:middle line:10%
Because this planet
needs so much diversity.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.950 align:middle line:90%
Because it's becoming too flat.

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:10.134 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Homogenous.

00:18:10.134 --> 00:18:11.500 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: Many
things are the same.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.870 align:middle line:84%
So we need multicolor,
not just one color.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:middle line:84%
We need the expression
of who we are.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And we are many things, not
just one or some things.

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:23.550 align:middle line:84%
So we have really to
create the instrument

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:27.600 align:middle line:84%
to express people in
who they are always

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.650 align:middle line:90%
in the base of their values.

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:32.260 align:middle line:90%
So that is the process.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.490 align:middle line:84%
So we start from something
that is coming inside,

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.510 align:middle line:84%
that is touching the soul, that
is touching the real values.

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And then we have to bring this
outside and make it happen.

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is a spiritual
research-- not only meditating,

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:51.470 align:middle line:84%
but then also do the practical
meditation; not only to look

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:54.170 align:middle line:84%
for, which are your
values, but then apply

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.160 align:middle line:84%
these values in
your everyday life;

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.010 align:middle line:84%
not only imagine to
transform your life,

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:01.110 align:middle line:90%
but then to change your life.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that
this is absolutely

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.840 align:middle line:84%
one of the greatest adventures
that every individual can do.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Well actually, I live my
life as a great adventure.

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:14.650 align:middle line:84%
I've been living in Damanhur
for more than 26 years.

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And already to say 26, 25
years-- oh my goodness.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.170 align:middle line:90%
But it was like this.

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:24.325 align:middle line:84%
It was a great, fantastic,
incredible adventure.

00:19:24.325 --> 00:19:25.890 align:middle line:90%
And it still is.

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Because you are constantly in
something that brings not only

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:37.020 align:middle line:84%
the best of you to be used,
but also to discover always

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:43.070 align:middle line:84%
something different and to have
always the dreams in front that

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.040 align:middle line:84%
is not only ones
you get tomorrow,

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.980 align:middle line:84%
but always, what could
be the next step.

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And it makes your life really a
life that you deserve to live.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.660 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: At Gaiam
TV, we kind of follow

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:59.800 align:middle line:84%
that same philosophy of an
electronic community more,

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.060 align:middle line:90%
and not together.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about these
images that you have.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
incredibly fascinating.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.210 align:middle line:84%
You were here talking
about them before.

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:15.110 align:middle line:84%
As I recall, the founder
of Damanhur and an artist

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:18.940 align:middle line:90%
went back in time to Atlantis.

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:20.030 align:middle line:90%
Tell us that story.

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, we might just come
in the previous picture,

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:29.700 align:middle line:84%
just because that
can help us to give

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.510 align:middle line:90%
a different meaning about that.

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:32.810 align:middle line:90%
What is this picture anyway?

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is the
picture of what

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.700 align:middle line:90%
we call the synchronic lines.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And in the past, it
was called the point

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.260 align:middle line:90%
of the back of the dragon.

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And many times, the symbology
of dragons or big snakes

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.770 align:middle line:90%
represent the energy river.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:50.245 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Like feng shui.

00:20:50.245 --> 00:20:51.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, something like that.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:55.740 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine that as we
have a physical body, and then

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.060 align:middle line:84%
an aura that is
surrounding us, we

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:01.570 align:middle line:84%
might imagine that the planet
is done in a physical form,

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:03.340 align:middle line:90%
but also with a sort of aura.

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And like we have
meridians, or how

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:10.030 align:middle line:84%
we call in Damanhur
microlines, points where

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:13.651 align:middle line:84%
the energy are coming in and
out, well, for the planet,

00:21:13.651 --> 00:21:14.350 align:middle line:90%
it's the same.

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:17.900 align:middle line:84%
So there are lines,
synchronic lines,

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:21.650 align:middle line:84%
that represent the highway
of the vital energy that is

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:24.370 align:middle line:90%
moving inside of this planet.

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:28.360 align:middle line:84%
We talk about 18
synchronic lines,

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.500 align:middle line:84%
nine that are moving
vertically, nine

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.540 align:middle line:90%
that are moving horizontally.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:35.710 align:middle line:84%
The fact that in this map
we have blue and red lines

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:38.090 align:middle line:90%
is just to divide this vertical.

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:39.730 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Red are
vertical and the blue

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:40.750 align:middle line:90%
are the horizontal.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:42.450 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO:
Exactly, exactly.

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And what is interesting
for us also--

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:51.030 align:middle line:84%
see they really serve the
humankind, or a different use

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:52.100 align:middle line:90%
of the humankind.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.720 align:middle line:84%
It is pretty, let's say,
very, very different

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.840 align:middle line:90%
from the classical archeology.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.880 align:middle line:84%
So the classic
archeology said that we

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.370 align:middle line:90%
are the best, more or less.

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:02.702 align:middle line:84%
2014, we are the
best of everything.

00:22:02.702 --> 00:22:03.835 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: We're
the number one.

00:22:03.835 --> 00:22:04.568 align:middle line:90%
We're the number one.

00:22:04.568 --> 00:22:08.350 align:middle line:84%
We're the best in the expression
of technology, resources,

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:10.720 align:middle line:90%
energy, everything, cool.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.350 align:middle line:90%
Well, do you believe so?

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:14.097 align:middle line:90%
Well, I don't really believe so.

00:22:14.097 --> 00:22:14.830 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Nor do I.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:18.720 align:middle line:84%
To see what we are still
doing in terms of destroying

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.780 align:middle line:90%
life, reserves, and everything.

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.010 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Cruelty.

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:24.767 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't really
feel that we are the best.

00:22:24.767 --> 00:22:25.700 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: I don't either.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.920 align:middle line:84%
So there is another
perspective of history

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.930 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't say
that we are the best,

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:33.400 align:middle line:84%
but simply that we
are in one point

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:37.190 align:middle line:84%
of an evolution that in the
past was probably even higher.

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:39.490 align:middle line:90%
And then there was civilization.

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:40.710 align:middle line:90%
There was knowledge.

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:41.610 align:middle line:90%
There was technology.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.680 align:middle line:84%
There was much higher of
what we are using now.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And then unfortunately,
probably,

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:52.510 align:middle line:84%
we restart, also because we know
that life is pretty fragile.

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:54.270 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: So
there's catastrophes.

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Just a piece of
rock that is coming

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.050 align:middle line:84%
from outside that can shoot
the planet will, well, create--

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:02.820 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Wipe out
civilization overnight.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Some little problem-- how
we say, can wash the floor.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.380 align:middle line:90%
All of this happened.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:12.150 align:middle line:84%
So probably we restart also
many times in the history.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:15.930 align:middle line:84%
But looking at the
synchronic lines,

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:19.350 align:middle line:84%
and in particular to the point
where these synchronic lines

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:21.960 align:middle line:84%
touching together,
crossing together,

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.930 align:middle line:84%
we might discover that
exactly at that point,

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:29.990 align:middle line:84%
important civilization,
temples, pyramid, sacred places,

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:34.410 align:middle line:84%
they were always located
exactly in that point, a point

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:37.690 align:middle line:84%
that probably now they are
even not existent anymore.

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the map of our
planet before the great flood,

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:47.750 align:middle line:84%
before this disaster of
10,000, 12,000 years ago

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:50.850 align:middle line:84%
was really changing
the face of the planet.

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:53.130 align:middle line:84%
But the synchronic lines
are still giving us

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:57.510 align:middle line:84%
probably indication of points
that are extremely important

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:00.400 align:middle line:84%
now, and points that
probably were extremely

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.620 align:middle line:90%
important in the past.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:06.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to tell you
that the point that you see

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.580 align:middle line:84%
in Europe nearby,
well, Italy, where

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.470 align:middle line:84%
there are four of these
synchronic lines crossing

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:13.760 align:middle line:90%
is Damanhur.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Damanhur is built in one of
the most important energy

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:21.520 align:middle line:90%
points of the planet.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And the temple-- now
we might understand

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.700 align:middle line:90%
why it's under ground.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Not only because
we're crazy and we

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:32.720 align:middle line:84%
have fun to dig into the rock
during the day or the night,

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:39.290 align:middle line:84%
but because the temple is built
to plug, to connect perfectly,

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:41.910 align:middle line:84%
this incredible
source of energy.

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:44.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's done under ground,
because these energy lines are

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:48.300 align:middle line:84%
going very deep into the
earth or high into the sky

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.990 align:middle line:90%
or under the water.

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:55.300 align:middle line:84%
So like in the past, creating
a structure under ground

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.990 align:middle line:84%
was a way to connect
perfectly in that energy.

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:01.270 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you
have the laboratory,

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:03.130 align:middle line:90%
and you have also the energy.

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:05.770 align:middle line:10%
You have the station, and
you have whatever you need

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:08.120 align:middle line:10%
to make it work, this station.

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Or you have an antenna,
and then you have all

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:15.610 align:middle line:90%
the plugs to give the signal.

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And what is interesting is that
the synchronic lines are, yes,

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:20.700 align:middle line:90%
crossing the entire planet.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:23.820 align:middle line:84%
But then nearby the
polls, they are creating

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.130 align:middle line:90%
a sort of double spiral.

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.840 align:middle line:84%
They're extending
these synchronic lines

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.330 align:middle line:84%
in other sort of
systems, connecting

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:33.380 align:middle line:84%
the other synchronic lines
coming from the other planet.

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And from the Sun, that is
the gate of our system,

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:39.680 align:middle line:84%
they are coming out and then
connecting all the rest.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.100 align:middle line:90%
Like you say, we're not alone.

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:45.840 align:middle line:84%
Or the real highway
for everywhere

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.150 align:middle line:90%
are the synchronic lines.

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:51.280 align:middle line:84%
But what is interesting
for us, and what

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:57.110 align:middle line:84%
is interesting in the
different approach regarding

00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:03.140 align:middle line:84%
this alternative history,
is to see how time--

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.650 align:middle line:90%
let's say it's all connected.

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know that we have
a different idea about time.

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:11.540 align:middle line:84%
We talk about time
like a territory.

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:14.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's always possible
to move in this territory.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.620 align:middle line:90%
We talk about time travel.

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:17.240 align:middle line:84%
We don't talk so much
about time travel.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.360 align:middle line:84%
But yes, for sure,
in our beliefs,

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.270 align:middle line:84%
we believe that time
travel is possible.

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And we also believe that
time could be described

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:31.190 align:middle line:90%
also like a huge wheel.

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:32.470 align:middle line:84%
There's many cultures
that are talking

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.150 align:middle line:90%
about the time as a wheel.

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
many calendars are

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:40.250 align:middle line:84%
so precise to
anticipate events is

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:43.040 align:middle line:90%
because this wheel is moving.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And then it's probably
bringing back some opportunity,

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.460 align:middle line:90%
some occasion.

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:50.430 align:middle line:90%
It takes time.

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:52.150 align:middle line:90%
But they're coming back.

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:55.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm not telling you
that there is destiny.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.550 align:middle line:84%
OK, we can just sit,
and things will happen.

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:59.840 align:middle line:90%
No, unfortunately not.

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:05.060 align:middle line:84%
We have to use our free will,
the power of our choices.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:08.300 align:middle line:84%
So to choose is the
last divine power.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.420 align:middle line:84%
We can guide the future
instead of the choices

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.800 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to
make in our life.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:20.040 align:middle line:84%
But if we know what this will,
what time, is bringing back,

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:25.580 align:middle line:84%
well, it might help to use the
opportunities that are coming.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.820 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: So you know
if midnight's coming,

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.201 align:middle line:90%
you turn on a light.

00:27:29.201 --> 00:27:30.600 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: Yeah,
something like that.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Or if I know that I have a great
opportunity to make some change

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:37.770 align:middle line:84%
or to make happen some
kind of situation,

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:42.640 align:middle line:84%
well, it could be pretty
interesting to know in advance.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And even more-- if I already
make some mistakes in the past,

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:51.880 align:middle line:84%
maybe I don't want to
repeat these mistakes.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.850 align:middle line:84%
So for us, history
is so important

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:55.970 align:middle line:84%
because probably
looking at the past

00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:58.850 align:middle line:90%
is a way to look at the future.

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Looking at what was
going on a long time ago

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:06.290 align:middle line:84%
is like to see what
can happen right now.

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:09.810 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason why we take
so much attention about history

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:14.310 align:middle line:84%
and why we teach so
much about history.

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And in this history, there
are moments that are probably

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:24.230 align:middle line:84%
very important to understand
what is going on now, also

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:25.680 align:middle line:90%
in terms of civilization.

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.870 align:middle line:84%
They probably are
not existing anymore.

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:32.080 align:middle line:84%
But they are still giving us
strong influence in this time,

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.810 align:middle line:90%
in this moment.

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking
now about Atlantis.

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And, well, Atlantis
really [GASPS]

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:42.570 align:middle line:84%
takes the breath away
from many people.

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Because they say, wow,
Atlantis is the dream

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:50.120 align:middle line:84%
of this refined civilization,
of this incredible way of living

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:53.080 align:middle line:90%
together, of creating things.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:58.260 align:middle line:84%
But actually even if everybody
feels Atlantis is true,

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:02.060 align:middle line:84%
in this moment Atlantis
is still not existent.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:06.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a lot of theory
that says, OK, it's Bimini,

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:06.810 align:middle line:90%
Bahamas.

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:11.050 align:middle line:84%
No, it's Sardinia, the
Isle of Sardinia in Italy.

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Or no, it's Santorini in
Greece, or no, it's Cuba,

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:17.750 align:middle line:84%
or no, it's just
down there where

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:19.430 align:middle line:90%
there is the Bermuda Triangle.

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:24.730 align:middle line:84%
So there are many theories, but
actually at the moment, not one

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:29.440 align:middle line:84%
proof, not one proof, even
if we feel deep in our heart

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.041 align:middle line:90%
that Atlantis is real.

00:29:32.041 --> 00:29:33.940 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: But you would
assume that it'd be at a place

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.220 align:middle line:84%
where the two lines
are crossing, right?

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:38.035 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: Yes,
and in another way,

00:29:38.035 --> 00:29:42.580 align:middle line:84%
it seems that at that time,
if we see time as a territory,

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:45.450 align:middle line:84%
so that territory seems
to be disconnected

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:46.330 align:middle line:90%
from this territory.

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:50.410 align:middle line:84%
So they're still not
touching together.

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:54.770 align:middle line:84%
So if we believe that
Atlantis was really

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:57.800 align:middle line:84%
one of the most
important civilizations,

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:04.070 align:middle line:84%
or a civilization that
still, for some reason,

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:09.910 align:middle line:84%
influences what is going on now,
in the Damanhur mission, that

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:13.950 align:middle line:84%
is, for sure, a mission that
is to inspire the world,

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:17.300 align:middle line:84%
to accelerate the spiritual
process for the world, but is

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:22.950 align:middle line:84%
also, if you want, the idea
to create a bridge, a bridge

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:28.970 align:middle line:84%
between time and space, time
and dimension, if all of this

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:33.620 align:middle line:84%
is just the base or, let's
say, the beginning of something

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:35.730 align:middle line:84%
that is a new age,
well actually,

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:37.000 align:middle line:90%
we're already in a new age.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.950 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking
anymore about it.

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:42.040 align:middle line:84%
But in the '70s,
finally, everybody

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:46.580 align:middle line:84%
was talking about the Aquarius
age, the age of the real waking

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:48.950 align:middle line:90%
of the spirituality.

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Ages are 2,000
years, 2,000 years.

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.400 align:middle line:84%
So if we have to reawaken
the spirituality,

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.380 align:middle line:84%
it takes probably some
events to do that.

00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:00.760 align:middle line:84%
So if all of this is true,
and if Damanhur is going there

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:06.460 align:middle line:84%
and is here to be this bridge
between time and space,

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:12.670 align:middle line:84%
well, I have sayings to create
a connection also to that time,

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:14.210 align:middle line:90%
to that time territory.

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:16.705 align:middle line:84%
I'm just trying
to inspire people.

00:31:16.705 --> 00:31:19.970 align:middle line:84%
But inspiring people--
let's image that maybe

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:22.395 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of
the '80s, Falco, Oberto

00:31:22.395 --> 00:31:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Airaudi, the founder,
that is definitely

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.150 align:middle line:90%
a very, very unique person.

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, he
passed last June.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And Falco, since the beginning,
was the one with the memory,

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:40.870 align:middle line:84%
probably the memory of
why he was coming back,

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:42.740 align:middle line:90%
which was his mission.

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And definitely the mission was
Damanhur, creating this place,

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:49.210 align:middle line:84%
creating this
spiritual accelerator.

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:51.180 align:middle line:90%
And alone, it was not possible.

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:54.170 align:middle line:84%
So there was other people
connecting to the Damanhur

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:58.900 align:middle line:84%
project-- different
[INAUDIBLE] that then together

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.950 align:middle line:90%
make possible what we did.

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:04.510 align:middle line:84%
So if Falco is this
person with the memory,

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:07.640 align:middle line:84%
probably also with the memory
of the knowledge regarding all

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:11.150 align:middle line:84%
of these aspects-- so since
the beginning of Damanhur,

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:12.560 align:middle line:90%
we talk about time.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.080 align:middle line:90%
We talk about time territory.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.940 align:middle line:84%
We talk about the possibility
to travel in time,

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:23.340 align:middle line:84%
and also the mission to
reconnect different time

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:27.040 align:middle line:90%
territory with right now.

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:30.355 align:middle line:84%
So at the time, it
was not the first.

00:32:30.355 --> 00:32:32.040 align:middle line:90%
It was not the last.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:37.220 align:middle line:84%
But there was the occasion
to maybe do a time travel.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking about your
fantasy or astral traveling.

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:46.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm really talking about using
a door, a physical door, a time

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:50.710 align:middle line:84%
door, that from this time
you jump in physically,

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:52.040 align:middle line:90%
you disappear.

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And then from another
door, a time door,

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:56.740 align:middle line:84%
in another time,
another territory,

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:59.750 align:middle line:90%
you physically appear.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:00.720 align:middle line:90%
You do what you have to do.

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.240 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: I saw "Terminator."

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.550 align:middle line:90%
The same thing, let's say.

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:07.151 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's many movies
that are pretty inspiring.

00:33:07.151 --> 00:33:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And who knows?
Maybe it's true.

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.660 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's possible.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:14.110 align:middle line:84%
So Falco at the
time was, let's say,

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:16.700 align:middle line:84%
invited to come
back to Atlantis,

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:19.530 align:middle line:84%
to come back to
this civilization.

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Again, it was not
the first time.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:23.275 align:middle line:90%
And it will not be the last one.

00:33:23.275 --> 00:33:25.810 align:middle line:84%
But there is a reason,
or several reasons.

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:31.660 align:middle line:84%
One of them is to
bring back some images,

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:36.340 align:middle line:84%
some pictures, some symbols,
some signs able to do what?

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:41.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, to reawaken inside of
people the memory of Atlantis.

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Because Atlantis here
is still not existing.

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.735 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis is still,
let's say, disconnected.

00:33:46.735 --> 00:33:50.220 align:middle line:84%
So these symbols,
these pictures, they

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:55.840 align:middle line:84%
might help to bring,
let's say, more close

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:59.180 align:middle line:84%
these two different
territories and maybe finally

00:33:59.180 --> 00:33:59.930 align:middle line:90%
to unite them.

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Because can you imagine
if tomorrow someone will

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:05.810 align:middle line:90%
discover where is Atlantis?

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And then they will confirm
that we're not the best,

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:12.179 align:middle line:84%
that the evolution of human kind
is very different from what we

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:15.500 align:middle line:84%
read in the book of
history, that there was

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.250 align:middle line:84%
advanced civilization, advanced
technology, that probably

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:20.009 align:middle line:84%
life is not just coming
from this planet,

00:34:20.009 --> 00:34:22.330 align:middle line:84%
but maybe it's coming
also from another planet.

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:26.360 align:middle line:84%
It will not be a shake in
the conscience of millions,

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.350 align:middle line:84%
maybe billions, of
people on this planet,

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:31.170 align:middle line:84%
will not be maybe one
of these occasions

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:36.355 align:middle line:84%
to accelerate the
evolution, or maybe

00:34:36.355 --> 00:34:40.540 align:middle line:84%
just to move the conscience
to another level.

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:41.620 align:middle line:90%
We believe so.

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
why we are also

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:46.350 align:middle line:84%
looking with a lot of
interest to some research

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:49.050 align:middle line:84%
done in some other
places of the world,

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:50.560 align:middle line:90%
like the Bosnian pyramids.

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.127 align:middle line:90%
You've probably heard about it.

00:34:52.127 --> 00:34:53.560 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Yeah,
we've done a show on it.

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:54.860 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: It's
been years that we

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:56.850 align:middle line:84%
are in contact with Semir,
that is a good friend.

00:34:56.850 --> 00:35:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And also we brought
groups there to see

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.340 align:middle line:84%
that, oh, maybe we have really
to write the books of history.

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:08.770 align:middle line:84%
Anyhow, so if all of this
is true, the problem,

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:10.810 align:middle line:84%
when you do a physical
time travel, is this you

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:12.410 align:middle line:90%
cannot bring anything with you.

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:16.600 align:middle line:84%
You cannot export complexity,
as we say, in this [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:19.001 align:middle line:84%
So you have to go
naked-- nothing.

00:35:19.001 --> 00:35:20.200 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Just
like "Terminator."

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.620 align:middle line:84%
No video camera
as you might have

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.490 align:middle line:90%
done before, a long time ago.

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:27.580 align:middle line:10%
Well, anyhow, so how to
bring back these pictures,

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:31.960 align:middle line:10%
how to make it happen--
so Falco decided then

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:36.020 align:middle line:10%
to invite another person,
a very good friend,

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:38.460 align:middle line:10%
a painter, Dovilio Brero.

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.200 align:middle line:10%
Unfortunately, Dovilio
passed some years ago.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:44.230 align:middle line:10%
But Dovilio is an
incredible painter.

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:50.820 align:middle line:10%
Because he has a sort of memory
that is a sort of human camera.

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:56.350 align:middle line:84%
So he can really paint exactly
what he saw with his eyes,

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:58.810 align:middle line:90%
photographic memory.

00:35:58.810 --> 00:35:59.520 align:middle line:90%
Do you know him?

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.840 align:middle line:90%
Did you know him?

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.850 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I know him in
the past, and pretty

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:05.200 align:middle line:90%
extraordinary artist.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.050 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Yeah,
right, is that his work?

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:08.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes, this is some of his work.

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:09.820 align:middle line:90%
He's great.

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that Dovilio
accepted this invitation.

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And then at the right
time and the right place,

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:20.010 align:middle line:84%
they were jumping, both jumping,
from one of these time doors,

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:23.040 align:middle line:84%
disappearing from this time,
appearing in that time.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:26.180 align:middle line:84%
There was someone that was
waiting for them, and for three

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:30.440 align:middle line:84%
days and three night, spent this
incredible journey to discover

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:34.210 align:middle line:84%
the capitol, the central part
of what we call Atlantis.

00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And then at the right
time and the right place,

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:40.910 align:middle line:84%
disappearing from that time,
jumping from that time,

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and then reappearing
to this time,

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:46.020 align:middle line:84%
and then started to
paint for days and days

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:48.060 align:middle line:84%
trying to remember
all the details

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:50.100 align:middle line:90%
that they saw with their eyes.

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And all of these now
are several paintings.

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And I have to remind you
that the paintings are

00:36:56.710 --> 00:37:01.030 align:middle line:84%
40 or 50 centimeters,
are not so big,

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:05.160 align:middle line:84%
but are incredibly
rich of details.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And the symbology
that are inside

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:13.600 align:middle line:84%
are really like keys, able
really to open the memory,

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:17.450 align:middle line:84%
really able to move
your conscience.

00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Let's move some
consciousness then.

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:20.910 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: Let's
go for the movie.

00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let's move
some consciousness.

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:23.284 align:middle line:84%
Let's come back
to the first one.

00:37:23.284 --> 00:37:25.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry.
JAY WEIDNER: OK, let's go back.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:30.580 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: Just to
see how right in the middle

00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:34.700 align:middle line:84%
of the Atlantic Ocean you see
there are these lines that

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.090 align:middle line:90%
are crossing together.

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:41.580 align:middle line:84%
It seems to give
us some indication

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:44.815 align:middle line:90%
of where probably Atlantis was.

00:37:44.815 --> 00:37:50.270 align:middle line:84%
In Platon, that is one of the
first talking about Atlantis.

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:54.040 align:middle line:84%
It's mentioning about
a huge island right

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.770 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of what we
call the Atlantic Ocean--

00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:58.625 align:middle line:84%
strange name for
an ocean-- right

00:37:58.625 --> 00:38:03.670 align:middle line:84%
in the middle between what
we call Europe and America.

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:06.610 align:middle line:84%
So now we can go
to the next one.

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:08.370 align:middle line:90%
And here we are.

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:12.720 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: This is a
drawing that he drew of a map

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.840 align:middle line:90%
that he saw in Atlantis, right?

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:15.820 align:middle line:90%
CROTALO SESAMO: Exactly.

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:16.940 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: That's amazing.

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:19.520 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: Very
interesting is the, let's say,

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:21.060 align:middle line:90%
physical morphology.

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Because we are on
these tectonic plates.

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:28.000 align:middle line:84%
So we have on the surface
very high, high mountains

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.790 align:middle line:84%
that are sort of
a natural border

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:31.420 align:middle line:90%
between the different regions.

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:33.520 align:middle line:90%
So the two tectonic plates.

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.320 align:middle line:84%
At the same times,
underground we're

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:43.560 align:middle line:84%
going to discover huge, huge
caves, natural empty spaces

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:46.400 align:middle line:84%
that are also the
perfect morphology

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:50.310 align:middle line:84%
to attract these synchronic
lines, these energy lines.

00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:54.220 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, to get
by boat on these islands

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:59.950 align:middle line:84%
is very difficult. Because
there is an ocean and a sea

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:02.030 align:middle line:90%
of cold water and warm water.

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:04.310 align:middle line:90%
So it's always very stormy.

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
there is a lot of wind.

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:10.210 align:middle line:84%
Wind is probably one of
the elements that are more

00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:14.370 align:middle line:84%
present every
moment in Atlantis,

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:18.660 align:middle line:84%
an interesting morphology
that brings this island to be

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:21.470 align:middle line:90%
pretty isolated from the rest.

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why this
civilization was growing

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:27.620 align:middle line:84%
so fast is probably also because
they didn't need to protect

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.570 align:middle line:90%
themselves from all sides.

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:30.660 align:middle line:90%
All the resources were--

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:33.720 align:middle line:84%
Didn't have to worry
about navies and armies.

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Or let's say other ones that
want to invade you or whatever.

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we have more a
politic map here just

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:41.620 align:middle line:90%
to see the different--

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:43.020 align:middle line:90%
These are different provinces?

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:45.830 align:middle line:84%
They're different regions,
regions that are also

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:48.010 align:middle line:90%
connecting to different races.

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:52.510 align:middle line:84%
We might try to imagine that
before, Atlantis was really

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:57.030 align:middle line:84%
a melting pot of
races, different ways

00:39:57.030 --> 00:40:01.220 align:middle line:90%
of thinking, diversity.

00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, diversity is
an element that is

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:05.490 align:middle line:90%
really connecting to evolution.

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And what probably
brings Atlantis

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:11.510 align:middle line:84%
to be such an
important civilization

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:13.960 align:middle line:84%
is the capacity
to bring together

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.770 align:middle line:84%
many different mentalities,
many different races,

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:18.620 align:middle line:90%
many different diversity.

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Well actually, we need
so much right now.

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Because more we divide in
class, color of the skin,

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:26.580 align:middle line:90%
rich and poor, religion.

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:31.230 align:middle line:84%
So the more we divide, the
more we create conflict.

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Only when we bring the effort
to put together this diversity

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:38.780 align:middle line:84%
we are accelerating
the evolution.

00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:42.310 align:middle line:84%
So the aspect of
the diversity is

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:46.620 align:middle line:84%
represented in the
architecture, in the art.

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Art is the representation of
the values of a civilization.

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:57.595 align:middle line:84%
So for example, here are
described the main cities

00:40:57.595 --> 00:40:59.440 align:middle line:90%
of the different region.

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And as you probably
see, all of then

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:08.580 align:middle line:84%
have different symbols or a
different architecture simply

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:10.359 align:middle line:90%
to express this diversity.

00:41:10.359 --> 00:41:11.825 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: So we have
a five pointed star.

00:41:11.825 --> 00:41:14.500 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: Yeah, it's
like five stars, like cross,

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:20.990 align:middle line:84%
like square, half a moon,
hexagon, spiral, or again,

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:27.060 align:middle line:84%
like Platon says, rings,
a huge, huge city based

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:29.780 align:middle line:90%
on rings surrounded by water.

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is really the
capital, the place where

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Falco and Dovilio spent
this incredible journey,

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:39.500 align:middle line:90%
the capital called Atlan.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:42.150 align:middle line:90%
It's right there, you see?

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:43.250 align:middle line:90%
Atlan, that is the capital.

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny because in some
other ancient civilization,

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.860 align:middle line:84%
like the Aztec--
but wait a moment.

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:53.050 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
Atlantis, we talk at least

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:55.730 align:middle line:84%
about more than
20,000, 24,000 years

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:58.290 align:middle line:90%
ago, the beginning of Atlantis.

00:41:58.290 --> 00:42:00.910 align:middle line:84%
At the end of Atlantis,
unfortunately,

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:03.690 align:middle line:84%
it's about the
great flood, let's

00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:05.780 align:middle line:90%
say 10,000, 12,000 years ago.

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:09.910 align:middle line:84%
So we have a long period of time
where we talk about Atlantis.

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:12.020 align:middle line:84%
What we call now
ancient civilization,

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:15.610 align:middle line:84%
Egyptian, Mayas,
Incas, or others,

00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:18.530 align:middle line:84%
well, they're coming
after Atlantis.

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:24.170 align:middle line:84%
But it's nice to know that,
for example, the name Aztec,

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:27.070 align:middle line:84%
it's coming from
one of their myths.

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And in this myth, they talk
about the first man, men coming

00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:35.360 align:middle line:84%
to bring the knowledge,
and then to help

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.100 align:middle line:90%
to create the civilization.

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And these first men, they're
coming from a mythical city

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.876 align:middle line:90%
called Aztlan.

00:42:45.876 --> 00:42:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And then they took from
this myth the name Aztlan.

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:54.120 align:middle line:84%
They change it to
Aztec-- Aztlan, Atlan,

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.407 align:middle line:90%
they seem very similar, eh?

00:42:55.407 --> 00:42:56.340 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Yeah, they are.

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:57.630 align:middle line:90%
Very, very similar.

00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:59.600 align:middle line:90%
This is Atlan.

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:00.900 align:middle line:90%
This is the capital.

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And, well, it's incredible
how Dovilio brought so

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:11.050 align:middle line:90%
many details, so many elements.

00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And every time that I'm
showing this picture,

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:16.860 align:middle line:84%
I have to admit that I'm
always finding something new.

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really sure-- hundreds
and hundreds of times.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And again, not only because
there is symbology that

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:27.270 align:middle line:84%
probably remind us--
pyramids from Egypt

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:30.180 align:middle line:90%
or Nazca or step pyramid.

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:33.045 align:middle line:84%
But again, we have
to remember that all

00:43:33.045 --> 00:43:38.940 align:middle line:84%
of these ancient civilizations
are coming after Atlantis.

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:42.990 align:middle line:10%
So who knows, probably the
pyramid in the Giza Plateau,

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:47.820 align:middle line:10%
that they also prove that
are not about Cheops,

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:49.990 align:middle line:10%
Fifth Dynasty, 3,000--

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:53.090 align:middle line:10%
And Robert Schoch's
research shows

00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:55.060 align:middle line:10%
that the Sphinx is really old.

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:56.150 align:middle line:90%
CROTALO SESAMO: Absolutely.

00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:59.320 align:middle line:84%
They are before what
we call Egyptian.

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:00.870 align:middle line:84%
So they're coming from
another civilization.

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:04.640 align:middle line:84%
So probably after Atlantis
they went to Egypt.

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:05.540 align:middle line:90%
CROTALO SESAMO: Absolutely.

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:10.330 align:middle line:84%
So these are from another
civilization, Atlantis.

00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why there is so
many similarities from culture,

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:16.580 align:middle line:84%
from civilization-- so
far away, just imagine

00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:20.660 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptian, Mayas, or
the Incas, or others--

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:23.510 align:middle line:84%
is because they probably were
coming from the same mother,

00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:26.880 align:middle line:84%
from the same
civilization, Atlantis.

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's weird, or
absolutely normal,

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:34.180 align:middle line:84%
then, to understand why they
knew so well about time,

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:38.200 align:middle line:90%
about stars, about geometry.

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:42.190 align:middle line:84%
They have books of knowledge--
Popol Vuh for the Mayas,

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:44.060 align:middle line:84%
the Book of Death
for the Egyptians,

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:46.780 align:middle line:90%
Bardo Thodol for the Tibetan.

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:50.070 align:middle line:84%
They have more or less
the same [INAUDIBLE],

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:54.890 align:middle line:84%
the same idea about the creation
of the universe, the divinity.

00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:56.190 align:middle line:90%
About life and death.

00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Life and death.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.460 align:middle line:84%
They are so, so attent to
the beyond, to the death.

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:04.540 align:middle line:84%
But not the death
as an end, but as

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:08.240 align:middle line:84%
a way to continue your
process of transformation

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:08.950 align:middle line:90%
into the beyond.

00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:12.120 align:middle line:84%
So they have so
many similarities

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:14.640 align:middle line:84%
that now we might
really understand.

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.190 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: There
has to be a mother

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:17.630 align:middle line:90%
language or a mother culture.

00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:20.190 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: They are
coming from the same mother,

00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:22.870 align:middle line:90%
what we call Atlantis.

00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:26.970 align:middle line:84%
What is now in this
picture is the overview

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:28.610 align:middle line:84%
of the central part,
where there are

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:35.640 align:middle line:84%
the most important places to
describe the Atlantis culture.

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:38.180 align:middle line:90%
Oh, this is pretty interesting.

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:43.110 align:middle line:84%
There's so many, many things
to say about-- number one,

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:45.570 align:middle line:90%
it's about the dimension.

00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Probably you saw over there
a person, an individual.

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.360 align:middle line:90%
So everything's gigantic.

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:57.930 align:middle line:84%
That is really, really
huge for several reasons.

00:45:57.930 --> 00:46:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Number one, because when
you are in a capital,

00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:03.930 align:middle line:84%
you have to be impressed
about the country.

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:06.180 align:middle line:84%
So when you go to Paris,
or you go to Washington,

00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:10.300 align:middle line:84%
or you go to Rome-- wow, you
really feel I'm in a very

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:13.540 align:middle line:90%
powerful and important country.

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:17.310 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, it's
interesting to see how,

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:21.740 align:middle line:84%
in the past, we talk
about human, but human

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:24.600 align:middle line:90%
also in different forms.

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:28.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we talk about human
with this physical body.

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:31.290 align:middle line:84%
But for example, in
many tales in the past,

00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:34.900 align:middle line:90%
there are giant, giant people.

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:37.540 align:middle line:84%
You remember they
are really gigantic.

00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:38.950 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: They
have skeletons.

00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And we already know
that in the past-- well,

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:44.330 align:middle line:90%
not only in the past.

00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:48.094 align:middle line:84%
Some archaeologists found
bones of giant people.

00:46:48.094 --> 00:46:51.851 align:middle line:84%
But officially we don't
know so much about it.

00:46:51.851 --> 00:46:52.550 align:middle line:90%
So who knows.

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this place
was able to host

00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:58.870 align:middle line:84%
many different life
forms, also forms

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:01.710 align:middle line:90%
that probably were pretty big.

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually also church,
cathedral, temple, inside,

00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:08.220 align:middle line:90%
they are really huge.

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:13.491 align:middle line:84%
And not for sure to spend
less money for making-- this

00:47:13.491 --> 00:47:14.190 align:middle line:90%
isn't working.

00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:15.456 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: They
cost a lot of money.

00:47:15.456 --> 00:47:19.000 align:middle line:84%
But if we think about
it, what is a temple?

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.290 align:middle line:90%
What is the church?

00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:23.190 align:middle line:90%
It's the house of god.

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:25.464 align:middle line:84%
Because god is pretty
huge to be fit in.

00:47:25.464 --> 00:47:26.730 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: It sort
of has to be big.

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's just to
joke a little bit.

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:31.500 align:middle line:84%
But it might give us a
different perspective.

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Again, today, I don't
want to convince anyone.

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:40.330 align:middle line:84%
But I'd love really to shift
a bit the way of thinking,

00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:42.490 align:middle line:84%
or the connection
between information

00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:43.600 align:middle line:90%
that maybe we already know.

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:49.010 align:middle line:84%
But now with a different idea,
they might be united, giving

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:51.220 align:middle line:90%
completely different pictures.

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Just to enlarge one
detail, one detail

00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:57.660 align:middle line:84%
that is pretty
interesting, interesting

00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:59.580 align:middle line:84%
to see-- number one, that
there is something that

00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:02.640 align:middle line:90%
is flying high into the sky.

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:07.390 align:middle line:84%
So we talk about a refined
civilization that probably used

00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:08.810 align:middle line:90%
different kind of technology.

00:48:08.810 --> 00:48:13.030 align:middle line:84%
But if they are
true, so they're not

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:15.150 align:middle line:90%
just flying through the sky.

00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:17.715 align:middle line:84%
They probably are
going to the space.

00:48:17.715 --> 00:48:19.280 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Going to the stars.

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:21.410 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: We might
maybe imagine that Atlantis

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:25.860 align:middle line:84%
was not only the most
important civilization

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:26.930 align:middle line:90%
based on the planet.

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:30.030 align:middle line:84%
But maybe it was
also civilization

00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:33.670 align:middle line:84%
in connection with something
bigger, with something larger.

00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Because also the idea that
we are alone-- are you ready?

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Do you have that minimal level
of evolution or conscience

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:45.650 align:middle line:84%
to be ready to be part
of something bigger?

00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:48.460 align:middle line:84%
Because, well, personally I
believe that we're not alone.

00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And if we have to imagine
that we are one of billions

00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:59.410 align:middle line:84%
and billions of planets,
to try to say that we

00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:03.650 align:middle line:84%
are the only one is pretty
weird, almost impossible,

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:05.280 align:middle line:90%
or how come?

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Actually kind of
stupid in a way.

00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:08.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:10.360 align:middle line:84%
But I can really
understand why maybe

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:12.900 align:middle line:90%
they are not contacting us.

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Because, I mean, if
they watch our TV,

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:16.081 align:middle line:84%
probably they will
say, no, thank you.

00:49:16.081 --> 00:49:16.780 align:middle line:90%
We don't want to.

00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:19.720 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: We don't want
anything to do with you guys,

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:20.870 align:middle line:90%
except for Gaiam TV.

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:21.880 align:middle line:90%
No, except for Gaiam.

00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Gaiam TV is one of the
few hopes for the future.

00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:27.750 align:middle line:84%
But if they are coming
to a general TV,

00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:30.450 align:middle line:84%
oh my goodness, why to
connect to this planet?

00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:31.760 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Pretty bad.

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:37.550 align:middle line:84%
So anyhow, let's really imagine
that Atlantis was not only

00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:40.290 align:middle line:84%
connected to the planet, but was
connected to something bigger.

00:49:40.290 --> 00:49:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And who knows, maybe
the same Atlantis

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:49.820 align:middle line:84%
was the capital not only of one
important civilization here,

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:52.690 align:middle line:84%
but maybe it was the capital
of something really, really,

00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:55.080 align:middle line:90%
really, really, really huge.

00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:56.750 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we can talk about empires.

00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:58.840 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want to go so
much on the "Star Wars."

00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:00.206 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Yeah,
don't want to do that.

00:50:00.206 --> 00:50:01.400 align:middle line:90%
But at the same time, why not?

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:04.760 align:middle line:84%
Why not imagine that we could
be part of something really big?

00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
well, this planet,

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:12.760 align:middle line:84%
it is, yes, a little planet
pretty far from other places.

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:13.800 align:middle line:90%
But it's a unique planet.

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:14.990 align:middle line:90%
It's full of life.

00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And life is one of
the most important

00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:18.480 align:middle line:90%
things in the universe.

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And we have such an
incredible variety

00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:23.540 align:middle line:84%
of life, so many
billions of forms of life

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:27.040 align:middle line:84%
that we have, from plants
to animal to human.

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:30.312 align:middle line:84%
And it makes this planet
really, really, really unique.

00:50:30.312 --> 00:50:31.545 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Yeah,
I agree with that.

00:50:31.545 --> 00:50:33.770 align:middle line:84%
So we were probably
more important than what

00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:36.380 align:middle line:90%
we thought until now.

00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Another interesting
picture-- not only because we

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:44.670 align:middle line:90%
have an idea of the arts.

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And the art is this universal
language able to express

00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:52.380 align:middle line:90%
values without translation.

00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:56.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting for
me to bring your attention

00:50:56.390 --> 00:51:00.980 align:middle line:90%
on the symbols on the signs.

00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:06.200 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it, when
we talk about symbology,

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:09.800 align:middle line:84%
we might talk about
archetype language.

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Or I would like to
talk about ancestral

00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:16.090 align:middle line:90%
language, what they are.

00:51:16.090 --> 00:51:22.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, an archetype language
is based on symbols, words,

00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:26.470 align:middle line:84%
sounds, movement with
many different levels

00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:28.110 align:middle line:90%
of interpretation.

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And our symbols that even if
we don't know nothing about it,

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:36.540 align:middle line:84%
they seem to touch
the soul, and then

00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:41.000 align:middle line:84%
brought emotion or feelings
or intuition or memory.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Like when we observe a
mandala-- different symbols,

00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:49.950 align:middle line:84%
different row, different
colors, able to do what?

00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, to rise our
conscience, and then

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:58.240 align:middle line:84%
to open up our conscience
to something higher,

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:03.640 align:middle line:84%
to a state of meditation,
or to receive answer,

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:09.560 align:middle line:84%
or to receive, again,
ideas or memories.

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:10.470 align:middle line:90%
Why does this happen?

00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:14.790 align:middle line:84%
Because inside, we don't
have only a genetic DNA.

00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:17.390 align:middle line:84%
But we have a sort
of spiritual DNA

00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:20.230 align:middle line:84%
based on this
different symbology.

00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And then we talk about
ancestral language.

00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Because probably this is
language not only known here,

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:31.910 align:middle line:84%
but also many
other places, maybe

00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:36.310 align:middle line:84%
many other planets, many other
places where life is going on.

00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:39.640 align:middle line:84%
So they're called ancestral
because they are well-known.

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And they are the common language
for many different life form.

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:45.920 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Almost like
there's a memory in the art

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:47.830 align:middle line:90%
form itself.

00:52:47.830 --> 00:52:49.250 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And then the artist
becomes as channeler.

00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:53.760 align:middle line:90%
It's a medium.

00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And then the person viewing
it is communicating with it.

00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:00.190 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, and the
communication is not just done

00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:04.150 align:middle line:84%
with this, but is done with
this, or is with something

00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:08.840 align:middle line:84%
that is really connecting to
the beyond, to other dimensions,

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:10.790 align:middle line:90%
to other states.

00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:13.400 align:middle line:84%
Because life is not
just what appears.

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:17.020 align:middle line:84%
So art is so important in every
civilization for this reason.

00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And in Atlantis, there is
an extremely refined use

00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:24.910 align:middle line:84%
of this different symbology
that, as you notice,

00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:28.250 align:middle line:84%
are changing the meaning
simply from the perspective

00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:29.610 align:middle line:90%
that you are looking of them.

00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:32.350 align:middle line:90%


00:53:32.350 --> 00:53:37.221 align:middle line:84%
It's also interesting to see
this woman and the hair--

00:53:37.221 --> 00:53:37.920 align:middle line:90%
you see?

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Whew-- just to
remind one more time

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:46.270 align:middle line:84%
that this is a very windy
place, a lot of wind constantly.

00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:54.780 align:middle line:84%
So wind is used in all Atlantis
through this different artistic

00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:58.480 align:middle line:84%
installation, and also
through the shape,

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:02.280 align:middle line:84%
the design of these different
buildings to do what?

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:08.320 align:middle line:84%
To make this wind create
sounds, frequencies, vibrations.

00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:13.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's like to create the
right sound for the place

00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:15.470 align:middle line:90%
where you are in the city.

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Like imagine, you go
in a garden in Boulder,

00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:20.750 align:middle line:90%
and you listen to Bach.

00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:22.370 align:middle line:84%
You go in another
part of the city,

00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:25.940 align:middle line:84%
and then you're listening
to Mozart piano.

00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:30.210 align:middle line:84%
So can you imagine how
refined this civilization was

00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:33.680 align:middle line:84%
and how beautiful it
could be in a place

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:37.080 align:middle line:84%
where everything is
encouraging you and welcoming

00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:40.080 align:middle line:84%
you to be with the
right set of conscience

00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:41.420 align:middle line:90%
regarding where you are.

00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:46.137 align:middle line:84%
So the architecture was made so
that the wind, when it whipped

00:54:46.137 --> 00:54:48.560 align:middle line:84%
around the architecture,
would create different kind

00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:51.660 align:middle line:90%
of hums and whistles.

00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:52.460 align:middle line:90%
CROTALO SESAMO: Exactly.

00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:53.500 align:middle line:90%
Wow, that's great.

00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:55.240 align:middle line:90%
That is really refined.

00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:56.200 align:middle line:90%
That's serious.

00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:58.000 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, why not?
Why not do it now?

00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.170 align:middle line:90%
Now that's impressive.

00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Why not?
Why not?

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about it, that
sound in the ancient tradition

00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:11.950 align:middle line:84%
is mentioned also
to create energy,

00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:14.505 align:middle line:84%
or to create a physical
effect on the matter.

00:55:14.505 --> 00:55:17.010 align:middle line:90%


00:55:17.010 --> 00:55:18.540 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: In the
beginning was the word.

00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:20.740 align:middle line:84%
So there's a sound
at the beginning.

00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:25.410 align:middle line:84%
God is creating everything,
giving names to everything.

00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Names is the frequency,
is the vibration of sound.

00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:32.660 align:middle line:84%
In India, Nada Brahman,
the world is sound.

00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, so everything
is based on sound.

00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Actually, when we arrive here,
the first things that we do

00:55:39.010 --> 00:55:42.630 align:middle line:90%
is-- [SCREAMS].

00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:45.847 align:middle line:84%
And nobody is telling us that
we have to do it like that.

00:55:45.847 --> 00:55:47.680 align:middle line:84%
It's not like the man is
saying, OK, when you come out,

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:49.190 align:middle line:90%
you have to scream.

00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:53.530 align:middle line:84%
No, it's the most
natural way to do what?

00:55:53.530 --> 00:55:56.980 align:middle line:84%
To recall attention, to
recall energy to us, to say,

00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:59.630 align:middle line:90%
hey, oh my goodness, I'm back.

00:55:59.630 --> 00:56:00.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm back again.

00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:04.300 align:middle line:84%
So the sound is the most natural
way to express this power

00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:06.870 align:middle line:84%
of creation that we have.
Why?

00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:10.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, because we believe that
the soul is a piece of god.

00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:12.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a divine spark.

00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:15.020 align:middle line:84%
So actually all
of us we are god.

00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And the process of
the enlightenment

00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:20.150 align:middle line:84%
is not only to bring
the matter to light,

00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:22.610 align:middle line:90%
to become light again.

00:56:22.610 --> 00:56:26.520 align:middle line:84%
But it's also the process
to reawaken your inner god,

00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:30.060 align:middle line:84%
and then to unite yourself
with the bigger one,

00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:33.151 align:middle line:84%
with the conscience to be the
big one and the little one

00:56:33.151 --> 00:56:33.850 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:56:33.850 --> 00:56:35.650 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: And all the
other gods that are with you.

00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:36.350 align:middle line:90%
And all the others.

00:56:36.350 --> 00:56:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Because we are one,
even if it seems

00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:40.160 align:middle line:90%
we like so much to be separated.

00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:42.450 align:middle line:90%
No, this is not the way.

00:56:42.450 --> 00:56:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Yes, very interesting, and we
are really going to the magic.

00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:52.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, magic and technology,
sometimes the border

00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:55.180 align:middle line:90%
is really, whew, very thin.

00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:59.420 align:middle line:84%
How many instruments we're using
now that just 30 or 40 years

00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:01.840 align:middle line:90%
ago they seem to be magic?

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Let's imagine the
smartphones, computers, Wi-Fi.

00:57:06.330 --> 00:57:07.650 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

00:57:07.650 --> 00:57:09.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean for us now it's nothing.

00:57:09.790 --> 00:57:14.280 align:middle line:84%
But 15 years ago, it seems
to be impossible, magic.

00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's a pity, in my opinion,
the fact that what the science

00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:20.440 align:middle line:90%
doesn't prove says is not true.

00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like to
give a huge limitation.

00:57:23.170 --> 00:57:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Well probably what I don't
know is not that it's not true.

00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:30.000 align:middle line:84%
It's simply that I
don't know how it works.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.420 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:34.500 align:middle line:84%
How many things
coming from the past

00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:38.680 align:middle line:84%
now are understandable because
we have the technology?

00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they are describing things
that now we know are true.

00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Because we did it-- like
to fly, to go to space,

00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:49.190 align:middle line:84%
like to transmit
information in the air,

00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:50.960 align:middle line:90%
et cetera and et cetera.

00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:55.760 align:middle line:84%
But probably not at the time
this was absolutely normal.

00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:59.320 align:middle line:84%
So I believe, we believe,
there is a lot of things

00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:00.590 align:middle line:90%
still to discover.

00:58:00.590 --> 00:58:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe we already
discovered it.

00:58:03.930 --> 00:58:06.610 align:middle line:84%
But we have to
open for everyone.

00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:10.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to remind you
that, for example, the Wi-Fi

00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:12.790 align:middle line:90%
was discovered from Tesla.

00:58:12.790 --> 00:58:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And the electricity was
not distributed by rope.

00:58:17.850 --> 00:58:22.060 align:middle line:84%
This was the only way to control
the energy that is distributed

00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:23.590 align:middle line:90%
and then to pay for that.

00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:27.410 align:middle line:84%
But the Wi-Fi also
for electricity

00:58:27.410 --> 00:58:31.200 align:middle line:84%
was discovered already
130, 140 years ago.

00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine
what incredible jump

00:58:34.530 --> 00:58:38.190 align:middle line:84%
could be for the
human kind if access

00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:39.350 align:middle line:90%
to free energy, for example?

00:58:39.350 --> 00:58:40.314 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Almost had it.

00:58:40.314 --> 00:58:41.080 align:middle line:90%
CROTALO SESAMO: Almost.

00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:43.159 align:middle line:90%
Well, hopefully soon.

00:58:43.159 --> 00:58:44.624 align:middle line:84%
-Yep, it's coming back.
-It's coming back.

00:58:44.624 --> 00:58:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Anyhow, so we are talking
about many things.

00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:50.030 align:middle line:84%
But this is a very
impressive picture for me,

00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:51.544 align:middle line:84%
not only again
because we can see--

00:58:51.544 --> 00:58:52.810 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Little
tiny people, yeah.

00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:55.870 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: See the
huge, fantastic dimension,

00:58:55.870 --> 00:59:00.270 align:middle line:84%
but because this is a perfect
integration between art

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:04.820 align:middle line:84%
and practical things,
between architecture,

00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:07.060 align:middle line:84%
and an architecture that
is not just beautiful

00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:09.660 align:middle line:84%
but is also very
useful for people.

00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:13.010 align:middle line:84%
So this is a huge,
incredible statue.

00:59:13.010 --> 00:59:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, it's not
a statue, but it's a palace.

00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:19.620 align:middle line:84%
So inside, it's like
a building with all

00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:23.760 align:middle line:90%
we need for what we have to do.

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And this place is
pretty interesting.

00:59:25.930 --> 00:59:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a sort
of station and university

00:59:30.290 --> 00:59:36.520 align:middle line:84%
at the same time to discover and
research all the time effect,

00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:38.150 align:middle line:90%
all the temporal effect.

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:40.830 align:middle line:84%
Like to imagine the
structure of time,

00:59:40.830 --> 00:59:46.560 align:middle line:84%
the time travel, the possibility
to move into this territory,

00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:50.465 align:middle line:84%
is, again, a technology--
well, probably also

00:59:50.465 --> 00:59:51.770 align:middle line:90%
a very powerful technology.

00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:54.540 align:middle line:84%
So you have really
to use it correctly.

00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:59.040 align:middle line:84%
But in Atlantis, like
in other civilizations,

00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:02.080 align:middle line:84%
this was normal, a
normal technology.

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:02.840 align:middle line:90%
To do what?

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, not to go in the
past for a touristy reason,

01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:08.050 align:middle line:90%
not really for that.

01:00:08.050 --> 01:00:12.220 align:middle line:84%
But in this concept,
time travel is

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:18.350 align:middle line:84%
used to make possible something
in the future, in the present.

01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:23.360 align:middle line:84%
If we believe that all that
happens is a chain of events,

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:26.070 align:middle line:84%
and all these events
are all connected,

01:00:26.070 --> 01:00:29.770 align:middle line:84%
to be in a sort of field, like
many researchers are telling,

01:00:29.770 --> 01:00:32.600 align:middle line:84%
if I'm moving something
from the past,

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:36.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm create an effect
right here now.

01:00:36.130 --> 01:00:40.150 align:middle line:84%
So the reason why
to go back into time

01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:42.530 align:middle line:90%
is to create an effect now.

01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:43.570 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

01:00:43.570 --> 01:00:44.830 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

01:00:44.830 --> 01:00:45.800 align:middle line:90%
It's one vision.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:46.600 align:middle line:90%
It's one logic.

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.847 align:middle line:84%
Again, maybe I'm
totally crazy or I

01:00:48.847 --> 01:00:50.080 align:middle line:84%
didn't sleep so much
yesterday night,

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.580 align:middle line:90%
so OK, I have to go to Gaiam.

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:53.090 align:middle line:90%
I have to invent something.

01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:55.550 align:middle line:90%
But it's extremely fascinating.

01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:57.490 align:middle line:90%
So why to then go to the back?

01:00:57.490 --> 01:01:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Yes, to get information,
to get-- yes, fine.

01:01:00.370 --> 01:01:02.060 align:middle line:90%
But there is something more.

01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:05.530 align:middle line:84%
So the only reason
why to go to the past

01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:08.450 align:middle line:84%
is to create something in
the future, in the present,

01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:10.750 align:middle line:90%
right now.

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:12.370 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
place where they are

01:01:12.370 --> 01:01:14.850 align:middle line:90%
studying all this time effect.

01:01:14.850 --> 01:01:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's also a
station-- not a train

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:21.580 align:middle line:90%
station, but a time station.

01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:22.380 align:middle line:90%
People are coming.

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:25.270 align:middle line:84%
People are going--
pretty fascinating,

01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:26.380 align:middle line:90%
pretty fascinating.

01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
to see the entrance.

01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:32.970 align:middle line:84%
This sacred geometry
is mentioned

01:01:32.970 --> 01:01:39.150 align:middle line:84%
like the door for the dimension,
or the dimension portal.

01:01:39.150 --> 01:01:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting how this
geometry is used in the temple

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:49.760 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt, in Peru, in other
places to connect the beyond,

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.150 align:middle line:90%
to connect the dimension.

01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:53.650 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Even
Masonic has the compass

01:01:53.650 --> 01:01:56.030 align:middle line:90%
that's shaped like that.

01:01:56.030 --> 01:01:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Let's say really like
a door able to connect

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:03.370 align:middle line:84%
to other places, and maybe
also to jump out-- who knows.

01:02:03.370 --> 01:02:07.487 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some civilization, they
may have decided to simply go.

01:02:07.487 --> 01:02:09.320 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: So there might
be some more of these still

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:10.330 align:middle line:90%
here on earth.

01:02:10.330 --> 01:02:11.230 align:middle line:90%
CROTALO SESAMO: Absolutely.

01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:12.200 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Yeah, let's go.

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.320 align:middle line:90%
And they can come back.

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:15.840 align:middle line:90%
Or they can do something else.

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, Mayas, well, the
Maya ones they are at the top

01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:21.870 align:middle line:90%
of the top of the top.

01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:23.950 align:middle line:90%
They disappeared.

01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:25.410 align:middle line:90%
Their cities are empty.

01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:26.910 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's there.

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:30.085 align:middle line:84%
And the archaeologists
don't know how to explain.

01:02:30.085 --> 01:02:32.220 align:middle line:84%
They say, OK, there
was fighting together.

01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:33.490 align:middle line:90%
They killed each other.

01:02:33.490 --> 01:02:34.510 align:middle line:90%
It was disease.

01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:36.560 align:middle line:90%
They died-- not at all.

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:40.260 align:middle line:84%
They might just choose
to say, bye-bye, OK,

01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:41.930 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to play
this game anymore.

01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:43.360 align:middle line:90%
Or it's too risky.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:46.110 align:middle line:84%
We're going another place
or another dimension,

01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:47.230 align:middle line:90%
another place.

01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And also this shape was
using their temple exactly

01:02:53.210 --> 01:02:55.340 align:middle line:90%
for this kind of research.

01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:57.350 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: So are these
people on the stairway just

01:02:57.350 --> 01:02:58.960 align:middle line:90%
coming back from another time?

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.440 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: Well,
this is the entrance.

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.030 align:middle line:90%
But it's not the only place.

01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:04.940 align:middle line:84%
So the building, the
place, is really huge.

01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:09.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting for me
to bring attention on that.

01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Because again, we are connecting
things that probably we

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:15.100 align:middle line:90%
know from other places.

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:16.420 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Whoa.

01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:20.390 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO:
This is a detail.

01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
part of the mystery,

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:25.120 align:middle line:84%
for me, the really
still unknown.

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:30.590 align:middle line:84%
So how Dovilio, thanks
to Falco's help,

01:03:30.590 --> 01:03:32.940 align:middle line:90%
paints all these details.

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:35.930 align:middle line:84%
Because even with
all my fantasy,

01:03:35.930 --> 01:03:39.530 align:middle line:84%
I could not do
something like this.

01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:41.830 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

01:03:41.830 --> 01:03:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a
matter that I like

01:03:43.590 --> 01:03:47.070 align:middle line:84%
it or I don't like it
or give me good feelings

01:03:47.070 --> 01:03:48.670 align:middle line:90%
or less good feeling.

01:03:48.670 --> 01:03:51.630 align:middle line:84%
It's really the complexity
of the elements,

01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:53.960 align:middle line:84%
the game between
form that's then

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.960 align:middle line:90%
transforming in other forms.

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:59.140 align:middle line:84%
I always remind people
that I'm showing

01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:00.840 align:middle line:84%
this picture that
these pictures are

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:03.650 align:middle line:90%
not just beautiful or artistic.

01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:08.770 align:middle line:84%
But these are really
keys, keys able to open--

01:04:08.770 --> 01:04:12.640 align:middle line:84%
open memory, open
intuition, open

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:17.780 align:middle line:84%
something regarding, again,
the memory of our soul journey.

01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:20.630 align:middle line:10%
And if we believe that this
civilization was existing,

01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:25.020 align:middle line:10%
and is probably one of the most
important or the most important

01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:33.170 align:middle line:10%
regarding the process, and then
the human kind, follow after.

01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:34.680 align:middle line:10%
So probably we
crossed this moment.

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:35.980 align:middle line:90%
We crossed this civilization.

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:37.890 align:middle line:90%
We did things here.

01:04:37.890 --> 01:04:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And they're still
trying to talk with us.

01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:44.030 align:middle line:84%
So these symbols,
this picture here,

01:04:44.030 --> 01:04:45.640 align:middle line:90%
are really opening something.

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:49.330 align:middle line:10%
Maybe then tonight in your
dreams they will be expressed.

01:04:49.330 --> 01:04:54.610 align:middle line:10%
Because there's a level that
says, OK, cool, but too crazy.

01:04:54.610 --> 01:04:57.070 align:middle line:10%
And then there is a
moment where inside, maybe

01:04:57.070 --> 01:04:59.680 align:middle line:10%
through the dreams where
everything is possible,

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:02.550 align:middle line:10%
then these memories
are coming out.

01:05:02.550 --> 01:05:04.550 align:middle line:90%
So watch your dreams tonight.

01:05:04.550 --> 01:05:07.660 align:middle line:90%
Because they may be interesting.

01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:09.781 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: That is
truly an amazing picture.

01:05:09.781 --> 01:05:10.480 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.690 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: Yes, there's
a lot of whoa things.

01:05:12.690 --> 01:05:17.120 align:middle line:84%
Because can you imagine to
stand in front of a building?

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Again, look at the
dimension of people.

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:23.480 align:middle line:90%
Wow, it's really gigantic.

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:25.120 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Do we
know what the rope

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:28.350 align:middle line:84%
thing is that the statues have
that they're holding there?

01:05:28.350 --> 01:05:30.630 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: Yes, there's
something interesting there.

01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:32.460 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Yeah, what is that?

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:34.610 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: Well
there, there is something

01:05:34.610 --> 01:05:37.600 align:middle line:90%
that is a sort of airplane.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.300 align:middle line:84%
But don't imagine that
they're using petrol

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:43.990 align:middle line:84%
or they're fracking or they're
doing things like that.

01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:46.830 align:middle line:84%
No, here there is
the use of technology

01:05:46.830 --> 01:05:49.670 align:middle line:90%
that we are still not using.

01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:51.060 align:middle line:90%
I already mentioned the sound.

01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And you know there's a lot of
tales talking about the sound

01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:57.970 align:middle line:90%
creating anti-gravity effect.

01:05:57.970 --> 01:06:01.810 align:middle line:84%
How they build these gigantic
pyramids with this block

01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:05.730 align:middle line:84%
of granite perfectly shaped--
just put it together,

01:06:05.730 --> 01:06:10.240 align:middle line:84%
and not even a little sheet
of paper they can cross them.

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:14.170 align:middle line:84%
How do they do that
with no technology?

01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Or simply imagine 1,000
slaves are pulling, pushing.

01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:20.065 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

01:06:20.065 --> 01:06:21.240 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Yeah, it is crazy.

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:23.200 align:middle line:84%
You need to use
something different.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even now,
with our technology,

01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:28.400 align:middle line:90%
we cannot do the same.

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:32.355 align:middle line:84%
We cannot cut stones
in such a precise way.

01:06:32.355 --> 01:06:33.055 align:middle line:90%
It's impossible.

01:06:33.055 --> 01:06:34.890 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: No, they tried
to build a small pyramid.

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:37.160 align:middle line:84%
I forget the guy,
the Egyptologist.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And he finally had
to get a crane.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.030 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't do it.

01:06:40.030 --> 01:06:41.296 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: No,
he couldn't do it.

01:06:41.296 --> 01:06:42.380 align:middle line:90%
It simply is impossible.

01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:43.680 align:middle line:90%
It was only like 8 feet high.

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.870 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't even a big pyramid.

01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Not big like the one
in the Giza Plateau.

01:06:49.290 --> 01:06:54.350 align:middle line:84%
So we really need to imagine
that there is other technology.

01:06:54.350 --> 01:06:55.424 align:middle line:90%
And sound is one of them.

01:06:55.424 --> 01:06:56.190 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Yes it is.

01:06:56.190 --> 01:06:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Sound is able to create
anti-gravity effect,

01:06:59.050 --> 01:07:03.170 align:middle line:84%
and then to lose weight of
everything, even a piece

01:07:03.170 --> 01:07:05.100 align:middle line:90%
of granite that is 1,000 tons.

01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you can just
lift it with one finger.

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:13.700 align:middle line:84%
But also magnetic field-- well,
it's an interesting technology

01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:16.710 align:middle line:84%
discovered and developed
from the German,

01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:18.350 align:middle line:90%
and then sold from the Chinese.

01:07:18.350 --> 01:07:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And now in China there are many
trains that are, let's say,

01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:25.300 align:middle line:84%
sliding on a carpet
of magnetic field.

01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And they can get
very high speed.

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.250 align:middle line:90%
Maglev, they call it.

01:07:29.250 --> 01:07:31.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes, extremely expensive.

01:07:31.530 --> 01:07:35.820 align:middle line:84%
But it could be one
possible future where it's

01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:40.690 align:middle line:90%
pretty insane to build a road.

01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Because you can just
create a magnetic road

01:07:43.770 --> 01:07:48.690 align:middle line:84%
on many different levels
without moving anything.

01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:50.615 align:middle line:84%
It's a future-- well,
I hope it's a future

01:07:50.615 --> 01:07:52.700 align:middle line:90%
that is coming true very soon.

01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Because we really need it,
not to destroy this planet.

01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:01.360 align:middle line:84%
The building here is an
astronomic observatory--

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:05.520 align:middle line:84%
perfect knowledge about
stars, conservation, movement,

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:08.290 align:middle line:90%
and the effect of them.

01:08:08.290 --> 01:08:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Again, probably Atlantis is
a civilization connecting

01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:16.640 align:middle line:84%
not only to the planet, but
really connected to something

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:17.479 align:middle line:90%
bigger.

01:08:17.479 --> 01:08:21.979 align:middle line:84%
What is interesting in this
painting is the animals.

01:08:21.979 --> 01:08:27.060 align:middle line:84%
You see the pegasus or
others, or the unicorn.

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:31.420 align:middle line:10%
Because probably these are
not just mythological animals,

01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:34.140 align:middle line:10%
but maybe they were really
existing a long time ago.

01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:37.090 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: And that's
pegasus, too, the flying horse.

01:08:37.090 --> 01:08:39.460 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: Exactly, or
also the strong connection

01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:42.140 align:middle line:84%
with some animals,
like dolphins.

01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Because we also believed that
there are other animal forms

01:08:46.050 --> 01:08:50.609 align:middle line:84%
that carry on the human
soul, like dolphins or whales

01:08:50.609 --> 01:08:52.850 align:middle line:90%
or elephants, for example.

01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:54.330 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:56.770 align:middle line:90%
Also you see unicorns.

01:08:56.770 --> 01:09:00.399 align:middle line:84%
But on top, we
finally see the most

01:09:00.399 --> 01:09:04.950 align:middle line:90%
important divinity in the time.

01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:06.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about Poseidon.

01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And Poseidon is holding
the trident that-- remember

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:19.180 align:middle line:84%
the power that Poseidon has
on the sea, on the sea forces,

01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:21.229 align:middle line:90%
on the ocean, on the water.

01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:24.890 align:middle line:84%
The water is another
element extremely connected

01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:28.890 align:middle line:90%
to the Atlantis culture.

01:09:28.890 --> 01:09:30.416 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Blue people.

01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:32.149 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: Blue people--
interesting, this one.

01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:36.859 align:middle line:84%
This picture reminds--
the seven wonders.

01:09:36.859 --> 01:09:38.804 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Ah,
Titan of Rhodes,

01:09:38.804 --> 01:09:40.020 align:middle line:90%
or the Colossus of Rhodes.

01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:42.310 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: The
Colossus of Rhodes.

01:09:42.310 --> 01:09:47.720 align:middle line:84%
In the gate-- and look upstairs,
probably also the airport.

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:49.229 align:middle line:90%
Yes it is.

01:09:49.229 --> 01:09:52.630 align:middle line:84%
The port and the
airport of Atlantis.

01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:57.300 align:middle line:84%
But what is interesting for me
in this painting that is really

01:09:57.300 --> 01:10:01.770 align:middle line:84%
powerful, you can really
perceive a lot of strength

01:10:01.770 --> 01:10:07.650 align:middle line:84%
inside, is these three
different huge palaces

01:10:07.650 --> 01:10:11.080 align:middle line:90%
in the form of humans.

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Well definitely, there are
differences between the three

01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:16.550 align:middle line:84%
of them.
JAY WEIDNER: There certainly is.

01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:17.916 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: The
first one seems to be

01:10:17.916 --> 01:10:20.120 align:middle line:90%
the old one or the ancient one.

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And the last two
are more recent.

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Well actually, there
is a difference,

01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:26.970 align:middle line:84%
about 4,000 years between
the first and the last one.

01:10:26.970 --> 01:10:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And if the last two are
more male and female,

01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:35.800 align:middle line:90%
the first one is a bit weird.

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems to
be a man, or a human,

01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:43.500 align:middle line:84%
but probably more
a humanoid, or I

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:47.000 align:middle line:84%
would jokingly say a
human with problem,

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.550 align:middle line:84%
but really humanoid,
or a little bit alien.

01:10:49.550 --> 01:10:51.380 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Yeah,
maybe a bit alien.

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And that might help
us to really connect

01:10:57.330 --> 01:11:01.850 align:middle line:84%
the history of Atlantis that
at the beginning, who knows,

01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:06.700 align:middle line:84%
maybe is not really, again,
just based on the planet Earth.

01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:08.160 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there was visitors.

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there was another
civilization coming here.

01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:12.720 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: There they
are at the landing.

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Maybe creating
colonies, maybe colonies

01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:18.570 align:middle line:84%
that then at a
certain point they

01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:20.330 align:middle line:84%
decided that they want
to be independent,

01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:23.630 align:middle line:84%
and they become an
independent civilization base

01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:26.330 align:middle line:90%
on the human of this planet.

01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:27.120 align:middle line:90%
And who knows?

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Maybe Atlantis was one of these
colonies becoming independent,

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:36.670 align:middle line:84%
and then not only independent,
but connecting to empires.

01:11:36.670 --> 01:11:41.380 align:middle line:84%
It becomes maybe an empire, too,
and having the capital right in

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:44.930 align:middle line:90%
this planet, right in Atlantis.

01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:50.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's very fascinating that
it might help us to understand

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:53.690 align:middle line:84%
why this planet is also
so important, so crucial

01:11:53.690 --> 01:11:57.850 align:middle line:84%
also for others, for other
intelligence, for other forces,

01:11:57.850 --> 01:11:59.220 align:middle line:90%
for other forms.

01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:01.406 align:middle line:90%
Next-- yes, this is just to--

01:12:01.406 --> 01:12:03.030 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Ah,
they're working on him,

01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:04.130 align:middle line:90%
restoring him or something.

01:12:04.130 --> 01:12:06.470 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: Yes,
they are restoring--

01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:09.330 align:middle line:84%
different kind of
boats, again, moving

01:12:09.330 --> 01:12:12.300 align:middle line:90%
with different kind of energy.

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And in the next one, you
saw there the airplane.

01:12:19.090 --> 01:12:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, it looks like an
airplane that we know.

01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:27.080 align:middle line:90%
You see the nose.

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:28.180 align:middle line:90%
It seems a Concorde.

01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:30.170 align:middle line:90%
Concorde, right.

01:12:30.170 --> 01:12:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Concorde had it
because it was moving

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:34.490 align:middle line:84%
so fast that it had
to have that nose

01:12:34.490 --> 01:12:35.720 align:middle line:90%
to keep it so it wouldn't--

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:36.520 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And the Concorde was
the first airplane

01:12:39.650 --> 01:12:43.460 align:middle line:84%
used for civil
transportation that

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:45.990 align:middle line:84%
was supersonic, so
that was crossing

01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:49.310 align:middle line:90%
the mach, the sound speed.

01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:51.320 align:middle line:84%
Again, sound is
coming back also--

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.930 align:middle line:84%
One hour from Paris
to New York, right?

01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:56.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, yes, it was probably
two or three hours,

01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:01.220 align:middle line:84%
but in any case, great compared
with the eight or nine hours

01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:05.030 align:middle line:90%
that you have to fly now.

01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Oh, here we are now
under the water.

01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Because in the
Atlantis philosophy,

01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:18.770 align:middle line:84%
the surface is for
life, for living.

01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:22.860 align:middle line:90%
So there's no industry.

01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:26.360 align:middle line:84%
There's no places
to produce things.

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:29.930 align:middle line:84%
There's not places
to get resources.

01:13:29.930 --> 01:13:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Because all of them
move in another space.

01:13:33.930 --> 01:13:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And this space is many
times under the water.

01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Because if, in the
surface, it's really

01:13:39.250 --> 01:13:46.380 align:middle line:84%
stormy, very, very deep down,
the water is pretty stable.

01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:51.145 align:middle line:84%
So they created sort of
bubbles where inside they

01:13:51.145 --> 01:13:54.490 align:middle line:84%
are extracting,
producing, transforming,

01:13:54.490 --> 01:13:56.110 align:middle line:90%
doing what they have to do.

01:13:56.110 --> 01:13:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And then through the
different systems,

01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:01.500 align:middle line:84%
like the balloons that
you see over there--

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:02.960 align:middle line:90%
or through this machine.

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:04.660 align:middle line:90%
Look at this machine.

01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:10.440 align:middle line:84%
It might remind us of Jules
Verne and the 20,000 leagues

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:12.150 align:middle line:90%
under the water.

01:14:12.150 --> 01:14:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Who knows, maybe the sea
monster is not a monster.

01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:18.020 align:middle line:84%
But they are, who knows, maybe
ships that were surviving.

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:20.470 align:middle line:84%
There's been reports
of sailors seeing

01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:24.410 align:middle line:84%
ships underneath the water going
back for hundreds of years.

01:14:24.410 --> 01:14:27.360 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: Exactly,
so it's interesting

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:30.060 align:middle line:90%
also to make this connection.

01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Oh yes, just to see the details
of the previous picture--

01:14:35.410 --> 01:14:38.460 align:middle line:84%
you see with the entrance
from these places,

01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:40.880 align:middle line:84%
and then also these balloons
that sometimes they're

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:47.086 align:middle line:84%
using to bring all the
stuff, all the elements,

01:14:47.086 --> 01:14:49.190 align:middle line:84%
on the surface.
-Up to the surface, right.

01:14:49.190 --> 01:14:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Again, we are in
front of a very,

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:54.360 align:middle line:90%
very refined civilization.

01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Even if talking about
Atlantis-- again,

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:01.620 align:middle line:84%
let's say there is a good
side and another side

01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:03.610 align:middle line:90%
that is not pretty good.

01:15:03.610 --> 01:15:07.150 align:middle line:84%
But we're going
to discover soon.

01:15:07.150 --> 01:15:10.650 align:middle line:10%
A garden-- well, it's
strange that they

01:15:10.650 --> 01:15:15.460 align:middle line:10%
decided to make a picture,
a painting, about a garden.

01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:20.850 align:middle line:10%
But probably they do it because
this is not really a garden.

01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:22.860 align:middle line:90%
This is a fake garden.

01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:27.610 align:middle line:84%
There everything is
in metal-- everything,

01:15:27.610 --> 01:15:31.970 align:middle line:84%
even the squirrel, the
serpent, the trees, leaves.

01:15:31.970 --> 01:15:33.810 align:middle line:90%
Everything is done by metal.

01:15:33.810 --> 01:15:35.420 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Why
did they do that?

01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:39.220 align:middle line:10%
CROTALO SESAMO: Well, metal
is one of the materials

01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:44.960 align:middle line:10%
that the Atlantian uses in
an extremely refined way--

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:49.070 align:middle line:10%
not only in this
artistic realization,

01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:52.510 align:middle line:10%
using metals like
gold, but also metals

01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:56.120 align:middle line:10%
also not really coming
from this planet.

01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:58.750 align:middle line:10%
But in this case,
metals are used also

01:15:58.750 --> 01:16:05.730 align:middle line:10%
to form, physical form,
able to catalyze energy,

01:16:05.730 --> 01:16:08.560 align:middle line:10%
able to catalyze intelligence.

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Very similar, or if you want
the same, concept of what we

01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:15.250 align:middle line:90%
talked before-- self, Selfica.

01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:18.260 align:middle line:84%
It's not English. "Self"
comes from ancient language.

01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:20.465 align:middle line:90%
It means "spiral."

01:16:20.465 --> 01:16:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, spiral is
one of the most important

01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:24.890 align:middle line:90%
in sacred geometry.

01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:28.330 align:middle line:84%
So the Selfica is
this ancient knowledge

01:16:28.330 --> 01:16:33.470 align:middle line:84%
that combines the knowledge or
the use of this sacred geometry

01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:35.560 align:middle line:84%
combined with
different materials,

01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:37.240 align:middle line:90%
like metals, and not only.

01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:39.410 align:middle line:84%
So they're able to
catalyze the vital energy,

01:16:39.410 --> 01:16:45.210 align:middle line:84%
transform it, and then donate
many different functions.

01:16:45.210 --> 01:16:47.750 align:middle line:84%
If you want,
Selfica is something

01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:51.710 align:middle line:84%
that can hold or
contain not only energy,

01:16:51.710 --> 01:16:57.120 align:middle line:84%
but an intelligent energy, able
to interact with the owner,

01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:02.440 align:middle line:84%
interact with the environment,
and support what you're doing,

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:04.110 align:middle line:84%
or support your process
of transformational,

01:17:04.110 --> 01:17:08.620 align:middle line:84%
or support your life, or
support some specific function.

01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:11.090 align:middle line:10%
This is a knowledge
that in Damanhur we

01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:15.100 align:middle line:10%
brought back after
many, many, many years--

01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:19.010 align:middle line:10%
pretty unique,
pretty extraordinary

01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:25.050 align:middle line:10%
for the field of research,
and is knowledge that we're

01:17:25.050 --> 01:17:25.980 align:middle line:10%
not the only one to use.

01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:29.770 align:middle line:84%
But in many museums of many
different civilizations,

01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:32.540 align:middle line:84%
we found-- like in the
Egyptian, like the museum

01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:36.800 align:middle line:84%
of the Native Americans,
like for the civilization

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:40.980 align:middle line:84%
before the Viking,
like in Mesoamerica

01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:45.140 align:middle line:84%
in the pre-Maya civilization,
like in Peru-- again,

01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:47.760 align:middle line:84%
same knowledge also
regarding something that

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:51.600 align:middle line:84%
is a connection between
different dimensions

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:54.130 align:middle line:84%
where this intelligence
is recalled

01:17:54.130 --> 01:17:57.610 align:middle line:84%
to be here in something
that could be understood,

01:17:57.610 --> 01:18:01.430 align:middle line:90%
like body basal metals.

01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:04.697 align:middle line:84%
I know that probably this is
opening many other questions.

01:18:04.697 --> 01:18:06.230 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Yeah,
especially since we've only

01:18:06.230 --> 01:18:08.130 align:middle line:84%
got like five minutes
left, and I have a million

01:18:08.130 --> 01:18:09.060 align:middle line:90%
more questions for you.

01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:12.280 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: I know, I know,
so Atlantis gives me the chance

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:15.056 align:middle line:90%
to open so many-- wow.

01:18:15.056 --> 01:18:16.750 align:middle line:90%
So for the next time, let's say.

01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:18.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we'll continue.

01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:21.670 align:middle line:90%
OK, this is pretty amazing.

01:18:21.670 --> 01:18:24.110 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: And
this is something

01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:26.750 align:middle line:84%
very similar to
the King's Valley,

01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:29.400 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptian King's
Valley, so the place

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:34.450 align:middle line:84%
where there are
old kings' tombs.

01:18:34.450 --> 01:18:36.430 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting for me.

01:18:36.430 --> 01:18:41.320 align:middle line:84%
Because this will give us a
little taste of the history

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:43.950 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis that is no
different from the history

01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:49.920 align:middle line:84%
of these last 2,000 years--
a process of kingdom,

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:57.150 align:middle line:84%
battles, races that are
dominant, different kinds

01:18:57.150 --> 01:19:01.750 align:middle line:84%
of evolution approach,
like to cross,

01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:04.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, Genghis
Khan and the Mongolians,

01:19:04.010 --> 01:19:07.690 align:middle line:84%
and then the Roman Empire,
and then Alexander the Great,

01:19:07.690 --> 01:19:08.790 align:middle line:90%
and then Napoleon.

01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:11.230 align:middle line:84%
So there is,
historically speaking,

01:19:11.230 --> 01:19:17.920 align:middle line:84%
a process that then refines
that culture to be what it is.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's the same for Atlantis.

01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:23.880 align:middle line:84%
So in this different tomb, we
really see different character,

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:26.360 align:middle line:84%
different symbology,
different art,

01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:31.040 align:middle line:84%
that gives this taste
of a long history,

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:34.572 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time not
so far from our history.

01:19:34.572 --> 01:19:36.240 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Right,
you know, I think

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:39.820 align:middle line:84%
that's actually a great
place for us to take a pause.

01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
come back next time.

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to continue
from this picture on, all right?

01:19:46.590 --> 01:19:48.640 align:middle line:84%
I want to get into
all of these details.

01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:52.620 align:middle line:84%
This is too important
for us to not go over.

01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:54.347 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
unlock those memories.

01:19:54.347 --> 01:19:55.580 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO:
Fantastic, fantastic.

01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:58.541 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm Jay Weidner, and
you've been watching me and--

01:19:58.541 --> 01:20:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Crotalo.
JAY WEIDNER: Crotalo-- ay.

01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:02.960 align:middle line:90%
This is our third conversation.

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:04.300 align:middle line:90%
We're going to have many more.

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:06.650 align:middle line:10%
As you can tell, he's
a knowledgeable guy.

01:20:06.650 --> 01:20:09.150 align:middle line:10%
And he connects a lot
of things together

01:20:09.150 --> 01:20:10.500 align:middle line:10%
that have not been connected.

01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:11.440 align:middle line:90%
So thanks, man.

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:12.530 align:middle line:90%
Thank you kindly.

01:20:12.530 --> 01:20:15.200 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:17.950 align:middle line:90%
