00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.371 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:12.070 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.540 align:middle line:10%
We're back, and
we're gonna go over

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.320 align:middle line:10%
some of these incredible
paintings that this--

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.180 align:middle line:10%
what was his name again?

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Dovilio Brero, this
painter with Falco

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.120 align:middle line:84%
created after this incredible
journey in Atlantis.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.410 align:middle line:90%
This is not a painting, though.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.570 align:middle line:90%
No, this is not a painting.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.460 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.970 align:middle line:84%
This is the main map
of the synchronic lines.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Because we described
them before,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.750 align:middle line:84%
it's also nice to
have a quick look.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.380 align:middle line:84%
These synchronic
lines are the highway.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.200 align:middle line:90%
Don't forget this.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.860 align:middle line:84%
There are many also different
kinds of energy lines.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.820 align:middle line:84%
But you see, blue lines are to
describe the movement of them

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.110 align:middle line:90%
horizontally and vertically.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And you can imagine, close
to the poles of the planet,

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.420 align:middle line:84%
as with the movement
of a double spiral,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:13.620 align:middle line:84%
they are extending themselves to
all these parts of the galaxy.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.620 align:middle line:10%
And then with the synchronic
lines of the other planets,

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.280 align:middle line:10%
from the gate of the sun,
they are connecting the rest.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.370 align:middle line:84%
So let's say we are not
alone also in this regard.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.580 align:middle line:84%
But what is
interesting is to see

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.750 align:middle line:84%
when they are crossing, when
they're attaching together.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Over there, Europe, Italy, you
see, four synchronic lines.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.460 align:middle line:90%
A lot of lines.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.980 align:middle line:84%
Damanhur, that is Damanhur,
the most important one.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.400 align:middle line:90%
Gotcha.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.470 align:middle line:84%
But there are also many
other interesting points.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.560 align:middle line:84%
One that is probably
for us nice to see

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.770 align:middle line:84%
is right in the middle
of the Atlantic Ocean.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.390 align:middle line:84%
What a strange
name for an ocean.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.960 align:middle line:84%
That part of the
world is the same one

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.630 align:middle line:84%
that Platon described
as the place

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.761 align:middle line:84%
where there was the
big island of Atlantis.

00:02:06.761 --> 00:02:07.460 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was exactly there, a
big, big island, something also

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.150 align:middle line:84%
with a very
interesting morphology.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.150 align:middle line:84%
Because the tectonic
plates brings on top

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.320 align:middle line:84%
to have very high
mountains, but underground

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.960 align:middle line:90%
to have a huge caves.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, Atlantis
was located at a point

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.660 align:middle line:90%
where there was always wind.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Wind is probably one
of the most interesting

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.320 align:middle line:90%
elements of this civilization.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And also it's really, really
difficult to get there by boat,

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.101 align:middle line:84%
because the sea, the
ocean is always very--

00:02:43.101 --> 00:02:45.710 align:middle line:84%
-Rough.
-Yes, really, really rough.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:46.850 align:middle line:90%
So difficult to get there.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And this location that
causes Atlantis to also

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.725 align:middle line:84%
be pretty well isolated
from the rest of the planet,

00:02:54.725 --> 00:03:01.040 align:middle line:84%
it causes this civilization to
grow very fast and very well.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.560 align:middle line:84%
But as you see, well, we could
spend and entire day describing

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.070 align:middle line:84%
the different points
that even there

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.680 align:middle line:90%
are pretty, pretty interesting.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.380 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.450 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at the next one.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Yes, this next one is the
first of the paintings.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, now we're really entering
the paintings of Dovilio Brero.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is describing
the entire island.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.430 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: So this is what the
island looked like from above.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.000 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, exactly.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And I notice a Mesoamerican
facial expression there.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Yes, well, here, we
have to see things

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.250 align:middle line:90%
with a different perspective.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Because Incas, Mayas,
Egyptians, we call

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.690 align:middle line:90%
them ancient civilizations.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Three, four, five,
6,000 years ago.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.730 align:middle line:84%
But Atlantis is a
civilization that, well, we

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.784 align:middle line:84%
can talk about between
22,000 10-- 12,000 years ago.

00:04:01.784 --> 00:04:02.850 align:middle line:90%
Right, end of the last ice age.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So maybe we can also
understand why Egyptian, Mayan,

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Inca and many other
civilizations had this same

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.560 align:middle line:84%
element, the same knowledge
about time, the same

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.470 align:middle line:84%
knowledge about the stars--
-About death.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.089 align:middle line:84%
The same knowledge about
death, the book of--

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:21.230 align:middle line:90%
Pyramids.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Pyramids, architecture,
symbology, cosmogony.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Art's pretty similar, or
we can say almost the same,

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.590 align:middle line:84%
or like civilization
like the Egyptian.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.050 align:middle line:10%
When they appear, I mean,
they're already at the top.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.130 align:middle line:90%
They're already formed.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.160 align:middle line:90%
They have their art.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.360 align:middle line:90%
They have the structure.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And then slowly,
they are going--

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.260 align:middle line:84%
-They get worse.
-Yes.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.150 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that they
appear, they grow old,

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.200 align:middle line:84%
they have the best, and
then they go to disappear.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.540 align:middle line:90%
No, they are already at the top.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same for
many other civilizations.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.590 align:middle line:84%
So these elements, they
may remind of Mesoamerica,

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.621 align:middle line:84%
but actually, they're
coming from Atlantis.

00:05:00.621 --> 00:05:01.320 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Gotcha.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And probably there
was the effect

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.290 align:middle line:84%
on what we can imagine
maybe was a colony

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.240 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis, a colony that
now we call Egyptian, Mayan,

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.200 align:middle line:90%
Inca, and so one.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.671 align:middle line:84%
So it's the father
civilization.

00:05:14.671 --> 00:05:15.370 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.730 align:middle line:84%
The father or the mother,
whatever we wanna say.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.140 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Let's see--

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.610 align:middle line:90%
If we can just come back one--

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:23.510 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Yeah, go back.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.660 align:middle line:84%
 --to the same slide,
it's also interesting

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:32.000 align:middle line:84%
how to see that the different
island-- it's really huge.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.550 align:middle line:84%
It's more or less one
third of what now we

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.875 align:middle line:84%
call Europe-- is divided into
different regions, regions

00:05:38.875 --> 00:05:42.960 align:middle line:84%
that are also connected
to the different races.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.020 align:middle line:84%
The power of Atlantis was
generated from the capacity

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.560 align:middle line:90%
to integrate diversity.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Races that, as I briefly
described before,

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.430 align:middle line:84%
they might come
from this planet,

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.030 align:middle line:84%
but they may also come
from other planets.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.690 align:middle line:84%
But where there is evolution,
where there is richness, where

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.970 align:middle line:84%
there is the possibility
to get the next,

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.830 align:middle line:84%
it's only when we are able
to bring together diversity.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.490 align:middle line:84%
When we start to
separate in race,

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.410 align:middle line:90%
poor, in rich, in religion--

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.440 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Black and white.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.750 align:middle line:84%
In color of the skin, we
start to create conflict,

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.800 align:middle line:84%
because we don't
know each other.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.930 align:middle line:84%
We are not speaking
the same language.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.190 align:middle line:84%
So probably this is an
element that we need so

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.200 align:middle line:90%
much right now on this planet.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Because instead
of separating, we

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.860 align:middle line:90%
really need to integrate again.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.127 align:middle line:90%
Let's maybe go to the--

00:06:43.127 --> 00:06:44.859 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Show the next one?
-OK.

00:06:44.859 --> 00:06:47.640 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: This is a very
close description of Plato.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.130 align:middle line:90%
That is.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.720 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Yeah,
circular rings of water

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.150 align:middle line:90%
around the central capital.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.690 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, exactly.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And where Falco
and Dovilio, they

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.820 align:middle line:84%
spend these three
days and three nights

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.624 align:middle line:84%
is exactly on the last ring,
the central part, the capital.

00:07:01.624 --> 00:07:03.090 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: That's
where the city Atlan is.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.050 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, Atlan.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And again, you see pyramids,
something that might remind

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.870 align:middle line:90%
you of Nazca or other things.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Again, these are simply elements
that are coming from Atlantis,

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.767 align:middle line:90%
and not from that civilization.

00:07:18.767 --> 00:07:19.900 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Makes
complete sense.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And as interesting
as for example,

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.620 align:middle line:84%
a pyramid is in terms
of geometric form

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:30.160 align:middle line:84%
or also architecture, the most
common one all over the world.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.030 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Yes, it is.

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:35.107 align:middle line:84%
You know, I also like
to mention one researcher

00:07:35.107 --> 00:07:35.840 align:middle line:90%
that I know very well.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.210 align:middle line:84%
He's a good friend,
Samuel Bosmanovich.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.390 align:middle line:84%
He is the researcher of
the Bosnian pyramids.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.670 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: We've gone
there, and Regina Meredith has

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:45.800 align:middle line:90%
gone there and done reports.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.460 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's very interesting.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Why are we also following
in Damanhur so much history?

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Because history could
be a key to shift

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.370 align:middle line:90%
the mentality of people.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:59.290 align:middle line:84%
If finally, for example, they
will prove that these pyramids

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:02.480 align:middle line:84%
are coming from 18--
20,000 years ago,

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.930 align:middle line:90%
we have to rewrite completely--

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:05.460 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Everything
has to be rewritten.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.180 align:middle line:84%
 --The history of humankind.
JAY WEIDNER: That's right.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:07.890 align:middle line:90%
Which is good.

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:08.600 align:middle line:90%
We need to do that.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.860 align:middle line:90%
We need to do that.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And because Damanhur has a large
center in Croatia, in Zagreb,

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.190 align:middle line:84%
we have a strong
connection with them.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:19.660 align:middle line:84%
So we have many people that
are going to do volunteer work.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And also we're bringing many
groups to see and to touch,

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.350 align:middle line:84%
to see that
archaeology is not just

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.300 align:middle line:90%
for some, but for everyone.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.086 align:middle line:90%
And there's pyramids in China.

00:08:29.086 --> 00:08:30.300 align:middle line:90%
In China.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.770 align:middle line:84%
There's actually also pyramid
in Milan, near Milan in Italy.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:34.930 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: That's right.

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:35.630 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to the next one.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:38.820 align:middle line:90%
Oh, this is great.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:39.580 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.309 align:middle line:84%
This is great also, because
we don't have to forget

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:43.730 align:middle line:90%
that this is the capital.

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:47.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's like to be in Paris,
or in Rome, or in New York,

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.990 align:middle line:84%
or even if he's not the official
capital of the United States.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.960 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Right.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.880 align:middle line:84%
So everything is done to
impress, to impress the guests,

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.430 align:middle line:90%
impress the visitors.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And what I might bring
your attention to see

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:03.500 align:middle line:90%
is the dimensions.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, just down there
there is an individual.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.430 align:middle line:90%
See this little one over there?

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:11.220 align:middle line:90%
The little one?

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:11.950 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Oh
yeah, right there.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:13.260 align:middle line:84%
That is a person.
JAY WEIDNER: That's a person.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:13.959 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:09:13.959 --> 00:09:16.030 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: So this stuff
is hundreds of feet high.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Try to imagine
how huge this is.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.760 align:middle line:90%
This is gigantic.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Gigantic because it's really
to impress the visitors.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:28.980 align:middle line:90%
And who knows?

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there are many
different kind of visitors,

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.410 align:middle line:90%
with different kind of--

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:35.510 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Aliens.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:36.490 align:middle line:90%
Dimensions.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:37.680 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER:
Dimensional creatures.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.355 align:middle line:84%
Is not sure that, for example,
also, well, the Church,

00:09:41.355 --> 00:09:44.990 align:middle line:84%
the Catholic Church, well,
they are pretty big inside.

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's not because they are
saving on the heater system.

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:52.340 align:middle line:84%
But if you think about
it, what is a temple?

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.430 align:middle line:90%
What is a church?

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.525 align:middle line:90%
It is not the house of God?

00:09:56.525 --> 00:10:01.850 align:middle line:84%
But it seems that this god is
pretty huge, is pretty big.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's just a simple
example, but who knows?

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Also the idea of gods, it
might be completely different.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Image Horus, for
example, the most

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.380 align:middle line:90%
important divinity in Egypt.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.620 align:middle line:84%
In the myth of Horus,
Horus who is he?

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.680 align:middle line:84%
He's the one that is
coming from the sky.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.490 align:middle line:90%
With what?

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:22.830 align:middle line:90%
With a sort of boat.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.050 align:middle line:90%
Sort of boat?

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, for sure, I cannot talk
about a spaceship, because I

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:28.530 align:middle line:90%
don't have that technology.

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:30.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
that this is possible.

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:31.240 align:middle line:90%
So that is a boat.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.010 align:middle line:90%
It's all a boat.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And then it's different,
because he's a god,

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.950 align:middle line:90%
and he has superpowers.

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Because he has all the
power of God in the center.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And he's here to
help me, because he

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.760 align:middle line:84%
will use this knowledge
and this power

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.390 align:middle line:84%
to help me to grow, and
to evolve my civilization.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:49.540 align:middle line:84%
But it is not the same if
I'm going to Australia,

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:53.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm renting a helicopter
because I want to visit

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.640 align:middle line:90%
a village of aborigines.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know anything
about the outside world.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm coming from the
sky with a helicopter.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.210 align:middle line:90%
You're a god.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Who am I?
I'm God.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And then I come out, and I'm
different, because I'm God.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.290 align:middle line:84%
I have actually
four eyes, you see?

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm
dressed differently.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And I have, you know,
superpowerful instrument,

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.340 align:middle line:90%
like, for example, this one.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:20.530 align:middle line:84%
Because with this one, I know
the reality about numbers.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.730 align:middle line:90%
I know the secret of numbers.

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Creating the right sequences,
I can call and talk with all

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.500 align:middle line:90%
the other gods in the universe.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.970 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it like this?

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:34.864 align:middle line:84%
So we might really see
history with different eyes

00:11:34.864 --> 00:11:35.930 align:middle line:90%
and with different perspectives.

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:36.930 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: That's right.

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:37.870 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's see the next one.

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:41.640 align:middle line:90%


00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.890 align:middle line:90%
Is that a person down there?

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:43.840 align:middle line:90%
That is a person.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:48.130 align:middle line:84%
What is interesting here
is to see the symbology.

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:52.100 align:middle line:84%
It's what I mentioned before,
this archetypal language

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:59.970 align:middle line:84%
based on signs, symbols,
vibration, words, movement.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:03.540 align:middle line:84%
It is pretty interesting
to see how we call

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:07.560 align:middle line:84%
them also ancestral language.
JAY WEIDNER: Yes.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.890 align:middle line:84%
This is language that many
different intelligences,

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:14.800 align:middle line:84%
they understand, probably
not only here, again,

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.570 align:middle line:90%
but also outside.

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:21.200 align:middle line:84%
So everything in Atlantis
is done to give a meaning.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Everything is describing
what this place is.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And in many of these places,
they are also creating sound.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:29.830 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:31.540 align:middle line:90%
I told you, a lot of wind.

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:36.400 align:middle line:84%
This wind is used through the
architecture and the design

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.255 align:middle line:90%
to create sound.

00:12:37.255 --> 00:12:38.540 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Like wind chimes.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.040 align:middle line:90%
Yes, but to create a sound--

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.710 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Or wind harps.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Perfect, or let's say to
create the right frequency

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:48.940 align:middle line:84%
for what we're doing in
this part of the city.

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.755 align:middle line:84%
So it's like to imagine
I'm going to the park,

00:12:50.755 --> 00:12:52.170 align:middle line:90%
and I'm listening to Bach.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm going to
another part of the city,

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:56.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm listening to Mozart.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine
something like this,

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.284 align:middle line:90%
something extremely refined.

00:13:00.284 --> 00:13:01.050 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: I love it.

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:02.942 align:middle line:90%
I wish I lived there.

00:13:02.942 --> 00:13:04.600 align:middle line:90%
Next.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.080 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you were already there.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.440 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: I feel
like I was, yes.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.970 align:middle line:90%
Well, don't forget--

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:10.570 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: That's a
a person right there,

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:12.300 align:middle line:90%
walking up the stairs.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.740 align:middle line:84%
So you get the idea of
the scale of this thing.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And again, don't forget
all these pictures

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:21.740 align:middle line:84%
are really keys for
the memory, really

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.020 align:middle line:90%
strong keys for the memory.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:28.510 align:middle line:84%
So if then tonight you will have
strange dreams, you know why.

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:29.650 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Yup.

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:33.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is another
interesting picture.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Not only because
we realize again,

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:40.920 align:middle line:84%
the dimensions that
are really incredible,

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.750 align:middle line:84%
but there are at least three
elements that are interesting.

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:48.070 align:middle line:90%
Number one is this place.

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:49.500 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what does it mean?

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:54.730 align:middle line:84%
It seems like a statue,
because it's full of art.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:58.680 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, this is a
statue that is also a palace.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's a palace in
the shape of a statute.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.270 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
perfect integration

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:06.570 align:middle line:90%
of arts and practical things.

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Art in terms of values,
significant because the art

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.627 align:middle line:84%
is the ambassador of the
values of a civilization.

00:14:14.627 --> 00:14:15.460 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: That's true.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:18.370 align:middle line:84%
If I have to
imagine for a moment

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:23.370 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptians, what I will
have in the back of my mind

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:24.480 align:middle line:90%
is a piece of art.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Because art is really
able to do give meaning

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.080 align:middle line:90%
about that part of the culture.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.420 align:middle line:90%
And the body is also a temple.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:37.400 align:middle line:84%
So making a temple--
a statue of a temple

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.970 align:middle line:90%
seems to make a lot of sense.

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:39.820 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.770 align:middle line:84%
So a statue, but I mean,
all of these is a palace.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:45.950 align:middle line:84%
So the eyes, the
mouth, and everything

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:50.010 align:middle line:84%
are referenced from different
parts of this palace.

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Number two, well, this palace
is connected to all the studies

00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:00.370 align:middle line:90%
into time, the temporal studies.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:05.450 align:middle line:84%
So this is also a station,
one of the main time

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:09.660 align:middle line:90%
stations in this place.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:12.900 align:middle line:84%
It means that Atlantis,
as other civilizations,

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:16.620 align:middle line:84%
they knew exactly how
to do time travel,

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:20.370 align:middle line:84%
and how to create the
connection through time

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.720 align:middle line:90%
to the big pictures.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.270 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Different
parts of the territory.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, different
parts of the territory.

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:29.140 align:middle line:84%
So there, there were
people, intelligence

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.280 align:middle line:84%
or whatever we want to call
them, coming and going,

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.510 align:middle line:84%
part of something
bigger, something

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:40.030 align:middle line:84%
that might also change our
concept about territory.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.950 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Right.

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:45.390 align:middle line:84%
So we might imagine
that from this place

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:48.620 align:middle line:90%
many connections are linked.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:53.936 align:middle line:90%


00:15:53.936 --> 00:15:58.610 align:middle line:84%
To make this probably even more
interesting, you see the shape?

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:00.400 align:middle line:90%
You see the stairs?

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.820 align:middle line:90%
Really gigantic.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.410 align:middle line:84%
The last part, the entrance,
you see the trapezoid?

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:06.550 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Yup.

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:09.560 align:middle line:84%
This, for example, for
the Incas-- Machu Picchu

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.410 align:middle line:90%
is an incredible place.

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:15.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, they were upset
about the trapezoid.

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.050 align:middle line:84%
They were created
everything in trapezoids.

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:19.760 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Every
house, every temple,

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:20.775 align:middle line:90%
everything as trapezoids.

00:16:20.775 --> 00:16:21.980 align:middle line:90%
Know why?

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Because for them, the trapezoid
is the sacred geometry

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:28.710 align:middle line:90%
connecting to the dimension.

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:30.880 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the door
to the dimensions.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.740 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: I see.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And again, another civilization
with the correct knowledge

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:42.620 align:middle line:84%
to be in contact with places
that are not only here.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.310 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Interesting.

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:46.430 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's see another one.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:47.560 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is really full
of elements and details.

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:57.371 align:middle line:84%
And this is also to see how
amazing it was, Dovilio.

00:16:57.371 --> 00:16:58.070 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Really.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Dovilio, thanks also to Falco's
help, brought so many details.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:06.637 align:middle line:90%
And for me, it's mind blowing.

00:17:06.637 --> 00:17:07.770 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: That
is mind blowing.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:10.400 align:middle line:90%


00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:15.420 align:middle line:10%
You cannot even understand
how it's possible in a little

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:23.630 align:middle line:10%
painting to put so many
different elements, symbols,

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:26.849 align:middle line:10%
also symbols that are
transforming themselves,

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:29.810 align:middle line:10%
you see, from a
different perspective.

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:32.900 align:middle line:84%
What you see in one thing
is changed completely

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.410 align:middle line:90%
in another prospective.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the game all the
meaning, as in the spiritual

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:44.540 align:middle line:90%
or the esoteric knowledge.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, you always get what you
are able to get in this moment.

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:54.220 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about esoteric
teaching or esoteric knowledge,

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.800 align:middle line:84%
we talk about a
knowledge that is alive.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:02.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's changing, but it's
also able to change the person,

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:05.050 align:middle line:90%
to transform the person.

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:06.870 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: OK,
let's see another one.

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:08.340 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:12.580 align:middle line:84%
Oh, here there is really a
lot all things, a lot, a lot.

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:15.254 align:middle line:84%
Again, the dimensions
are really impressive.

00:18:15.254 --> 00:18:16.220 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Very impressive.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.380 align:middle line:84%
The little one
compared to-- there

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:24.260 align:middle line:84%
is a palace connecting to
the study of the stars,

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:25.590 align:middle line:90%
like an observatory.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:27.130 align:middle line:90%
Is that Pegasus or?

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:29.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes, like Pegasus.

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.440 align:middle line:90%
Other animals are dolphins.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's imagine
that these are not just

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.870 align:middle line:84%
mythical animals, but
probably animals that were

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:38.780 align:middle line:90%
living in that period of time.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:42.456 align:middle line:84%
And finally, we have also
the description of Poseidon.

00:18:42.456 --> 00:18:46.281 align:middle line:84%
In the little one, we have
Poseidon with a trident.

00:18:46.281 --> 00:18:47.980 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: And he was
the god of Atlantis, right?

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.410 align:middle line:84%
He was the most
important god in the part.

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And the trident was
representing also

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:55.070 align:middle line:84%
the strong connection
with Atlantis

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:58.880 align:middle line:84%
with the energy of
the ocean, of the sea.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very
interesting connection.

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle line:90%
Obelisk.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:10.330 align:middle line:84%
In another culture, we can see
them as here, as in the Celtic,

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:11.940 align:middle line:84%
for example.
JAY WEIDNER: Right.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Natural [INAUDIBLE]
able to amplify

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:17.430 align:middle line:90%
the energies of a place.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have to
remind you that Atlantis

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.490 align:middle line:84%
is perfectly located on
one of the cross points

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:24.460 align:middle line:90%
of the synchronic lines.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.175 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: We're gonna
get to that soon, too.

00:19:26.175 --> 00:19:28.090 align:middle line:84%
We're gonna finish
off with that.

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:29.060 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, you're right.

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:33.200 align:middle line:84%
The obelisk takes telluric
forces and concentrates them.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:38.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, it is not
unusual to see how

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:43.340 align:middle line:84%
some other nation
brought it from Egypt,

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:44.110 align:middle line:90%
exactly the obelisk.

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Oh, Cleopatra's
needle in New York.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And in it's placed in one
of those central zone lines.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And the Metropolitan Museum
is an amazing place to see.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:57.430 align:middle line:90%


00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:58.480 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Yep.
All right.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.450 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to another one.

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:00.540 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.260 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.295 align:middle line:84%
Yes, this is pretty
impressive, eh?

00:20:04.295 --> 00:20:06.240 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: It's like
the Colossus of Rhodes

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.190 align:middle line:90%
a little bit.

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:08.850 align:middle line:90%
The Colossus of Rhodes.

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:11.010 align:middle line:90%
This is the gate.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And if you see on
top of them also not

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:21.400 align:middle line:84%
only the gate or
the port, but also

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.070 align:middle line:84%
you see something
flying in the sky.

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:24.140 align:middle line:90%
So this is also--

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.570 align:middle line:90%
A UFO?

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you're right.
Interesting.

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.610 align:middle line:84%
So this is also
a sort of airport.

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:33.560 align:middle line:84%
Again, statues but
not only statues.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.210 align:middle line:90%
They're a whole palace.

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
about these pictures?

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:41.001 align:middle line:84%
Let's see the first one, and
let's see the other two ones.

00:20:41.001 --> 00:20:41.700 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:46.900 align:middle line:84%
But the first one, that seems
also to be the oldest one.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.840 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty different
from the last two.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.070 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Much
more eroded, yes.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Before the first
and the last one,

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:56.450 align:middle line:84%
there was about 6-- 8,000
years of difference.

00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:00.954 align:middle line:84%
And look, the first
one, it's human.

00:21:00.954 --> 00:21:01.750 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Sort of.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.340 align:middle line:90%
A little bit more.

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:04.994 align:middle line:90%
Or a human with a problem.

00:21:04.994 --> 00:21:06.460 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Yeah, it's
got something going.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.930 align:middle line:90%
Or like a humanoid.

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:11.861 align:middle line:84%
The other two are definitely
more male and female.

00:21:11.861 --> 00:21:12.560 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you remember all
the different pictures

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:19.360 align:middle line:84%
that we saw before,
all the symbology

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.360 align:middle line:84%
is all connected to humans
and animals, animal and human,

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:28.280 align:middle line:84%
no machine, none
anything of that.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.890 align:middle line:84%
That probably can help us
to understand the history

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:36.460 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis before becoming
Atlantis, a history that, as I

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:41.980 align:middle line:84%
mentioned very briefly,
might come from far away,

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:46.050 align:middle line:84%
something that probably
was more or less human,

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:48.190 align:middle line:84%
and then then became human.
Who knows?

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Maybe Atlantis was finally
the first colony that becomes

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:57.620 align:middle line:84%
independent, the first place
that, maybe from a completely

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.660 align:middle line:84%
different story,
becomes something

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:03.320 align:middle line:84%
connected to this planet and
from the humans of this /

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.390 align:middle line:84%
I point out the Vedic
writings from India

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:08.130 align:middle line:84%
describe the original
gods as blue.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:09.890 align:middle line:90%
And that guy's blue.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:10.770 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:13.951 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, you can really
do a lot of connections.

00:22:13.951 --> 00:22:14.650 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Sure.

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And what is amazing
about these pictures,

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.550 align:middle line:84%
or in general about this
topic, is that you can really

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:21.790 align:middle line:84%
connect so many
information that before

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:23.950 align:middle line:90%
seemed to be so separated.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:26.150 align:middle line:90%
And they become so logical.

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this time is so
important, because we're losing

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:31.747 align:middle line:84%
that disparateness, and
we're putting it all together

00:22:31.747 --> 00:22:32.680 align:middle line:90%
finally, for the first time.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.324 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

00:22:34.324 --> 00:22:36.860 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: OK, let's
go to another one.

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yes, the
details, they decided

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:45.730 align:middle line:84%
to describe this garden, because
this is not a real garden.

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:46.730 align:middle line:90%
This is a fake garden.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:50.350 align:middle line:84%
All of this is done with
metals-- everything.

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:51.460 align:middle line:90%
Also, the little [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:52.770 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: So
it's a work of art.

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but also to
describe how refined

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:59.300 align:middle line:84%
their technique connected
to the use of metals was.

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.150 align:middle line:90%
It was really incredible.

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:05.880 align:middle line:84%
But also metals, not only to
create art, but in concept

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.000 align:middle line:84%
that in Damanhur we
call self or selfica.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.260 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't come from English.

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Self comes from an ancient
language and means spiral.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's the capacity to create
instruments able to catalyze

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:21.420 align:middle line:84%
the vital energy,
done with the use

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:25.750 align:middle line:84%
of psychic geometry such as the
spiral and different metals.

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:27.000 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Alchemy.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.520 align:middle line:84%
A sort of alchemy able
to attract intelligence,

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.330 align:middle line:84%
able to attract forces
that then can really--

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:34.360 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: And hold it.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Hold it, but also to help us,
to support us in our process.

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:38.920 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Gotcha.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.760 align:middle line:90%
So this is not just art.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.037 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that connects--

00:23:42.037 --> 00:23:42.870 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: It's sacred.

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:45.350 align:middle line:84%
 --Something that
is really connected,

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:47.009 align:middle line:84%
again, from the beyond.
JAY WEIDNER: Mhm.

00:23:47.009 --> 00:23:48.050 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:50.880 align:middle line:90%
Let's see another one.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Something that is very
similar to the King's

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:55.440 align:middle line:90%
Valley, again, Egypt.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.315 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Yes, it is.

00:23:56.315 --> 00:23:58.220 align:middle line:84%
The place where
they are, the tombs

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:01.655 align:middle line:90%
of all the important kings or--

00:24:01.655 --> 00:24:02.930 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: The giant statues.

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:06.510 align:middle line:84%
Yes, or important figures
connected to the history

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:08.940 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis, that probably
is not, at the beginning,

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:11.090 align:middle line:90%
so far from our history.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:14.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's like crossing
the last 2,000 years,

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:20.360 align:middle line:84%
and then to see the
Roman Empire, and then

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:24.360 align:middle line:84%
all the different
cultures, or civilizations,

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.940 align:middle line:84%
or places that were
leading the world.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:31.810 align:middle line:84%
So here we have examples of
how there were different races

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:35.570 align:middle line:84%
dominating, leading,
creating empires, and then

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:36.940 align:middle line:90%
transforming all of them.

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.760 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: OK, next.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.460 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.030 align:middle line:90%
That's some beautiful art there.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:44.840 align:middle line:90%


00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.890 align:middle line:84%
That is really some
of my favorites.

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:51.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, they are all favorites,
but the last pictures

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:53.920 align:middle line:84%
that we selected are
more connecting, really,

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:58.800 align:middle line:84%
to the spirituality,
to the knowledge,

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.240 align:middle line:90%
to the sacred part of Atlantis.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, there is no
time to talk about everything,

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.070 align:middle line:84%
so let's say we have to
create another appointment.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:11.440 align:middle line:90%
These is a gigantic column.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.200 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Yup.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.020 align:middle line:90%
You see down there?

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:14.550 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: There's a door.
-There's a door.

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:14.710 align:middle line:90%
And there's a--

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:15.870 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: So it's
a temple or something?

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
This underground.

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:21.910 align:middle line:84%
I told you, a very high mountain
and then gigantic caves.

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And there are many different
columns completely covered

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:30.910 align:middle line:84%
in gold that are bringing
us into the most sacred part

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:34.370 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis, where
everything has a meaning,

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:39.460 align:middle line:84%
and everything is
talking inside of us.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:40.160 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: OK.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:40.980 align:middle line:90%
See the next one?

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.400 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Some of the places
of their research,

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:46.780 align:middle line:84%
places that also
Falco and Dovilio

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:50.900 align:middle line:84%
were not allowed to visit, many
different doors were behind it.

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.070 align:middle line:84%
There was the laboratory
where they were studying

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:56.530 align:middle line:90%
all the different lifeforms.

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And this guardian reminds
us that we are not

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.430 align:middle line:90%
allowed to enter in this place.

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this is
the place where

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:09.380 align:middle line:84%
they are studying all
the worlds of the insect,

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.090 align:middle line:90%
and not only that.

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:14.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, lifeforms, again,
that we might imagine coming

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:18.230 align:middle line:84%
from here or from other places.
JAY WEIDNER: Right.

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:21.990 align:middle line:84%
But the next one probably
is-- the next picture.

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:23.190 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Let's
see the next one.

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:28.751 align:middle line:84%
Yes, this is probably
a good end for today.

00:26:28.751 --> 00:26:29.450 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Wow.

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Because this is really,
really impressive.

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:33.210 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: That really is.

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:34.980 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: It reminds
us again of the myth

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:36.910 align:middle line:90%
of the emerald tablets.

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:38.330 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Yup.

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And you see Poseidon.
JAY WEIDNER: Yup.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Poseidon is embracing,
protecting this tablet, where

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:54.010 align:middle line:84%
actually there are described all
the principle codes of the all

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:57.920 align:middle line:84%
the main city of Atlantis,
all the different knowledge,

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.420 align:middle line:90%
all the different technology.

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I have to tell you
what is described there is not

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:11.220 align:middle line:84%
original, because Falco prefers
not to write what they saw,

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.314 align:middle line:90%
because it might be dangerous.

00:27:12.314 --> 00:27:13.180 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: I understand.

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.240 align:middle line:90%
That's very smart.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.600 align:middle line:84%
So this is just
an idea, but it's

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.790 align:middle line:84%
not precise, as
Dovilio is really

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:20.840 align:middle line:90%
excellent at being precise.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:25.060 align:middle line:84%
But what probably you can
really feel is the power.

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:25.760 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Oh yeah.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:31.060 align:middle line:84%
How powerful he is, how intense
the energy of this place is.

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter
if it's in one painting,

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.685 align:middle line:90%
so we can really feel it.

00:27:36.685 --> 00:27:39.430 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:40.640 align:middle line:90%
That is really impressive.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and normally when I'm
teaching these seminars,

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:47.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm showing these
slides, I'm always used

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.310 align:middle line:90%
to saying, well, try to feel.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:54.850 align:middle line:84%
More than understand with your
mind, try to feel the pictures.

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:56.680 align:middle line:90%
Try to feel the signs.

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Try to enter inside
of the symbols,

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.910 align:middle line:84%
because there's
so many meanings.

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:05.350 align:middle line:84%
There's so much energy, and
there's so many memories

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:06.390 align:middle line:90%
that can come back.

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:08.270 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: That's
exactly right.

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:10.204 align:middle line:84%
That's the best
way to enjoy that.

00:28:10.204 --> 00:28:11.770 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: That's why
these are so important.

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure there's,
also, the people

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.390 align:middle line:84%
that are following us, that
are looking at these paintings,

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:17.840 align:middle line:84%
that maybe they
didn't understand,

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.050 align:middle line:84%
or they maybe
think that Damanhur

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:21.230 align:middle line:90%
is a place of crazy people.

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:23.770 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter,
but from that,

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:25.380 align:middle line:90%
they can really get a lot.

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Because again, if
we are whole here,

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:29.820 align:middle line:84%
if we are incarnated
in this time, that

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:33.230 align:middle line:84%
is the time of change, that
is the time of transformation,

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:35.870 align:middle line:84%
it's because, my friends,
we are the good ones,

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:37.900 align:middle line:84%
and in the good time,
in the good place.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:42.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's time to
stand up, and to act.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.460 align:middle line:84%
This is probably the
most important thing

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:45.920 align:middle line:90%
that we have to do.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.720 align:middle line:90%
So don't wait.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Go, believe in your
potential, because there's

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:58.821 align:middle line:84%
really a lot that in this
moment is invest for all of us.

00:28:58.821 --> 00:28:59.520 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: I agree.

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.360 align:middle line:84%
So before we go, let's go
to the Google Earth images,

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.170 align:middle line:84%
so we can really
blow everybody away.

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:06.420 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.460 align:middle line:90%
So this is Google Earth.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.260 align:middle line:84%
This was done in
many, many years

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:13.770 align:middle line:84%
after they went on their
time travel to Atlantis.

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:16.390 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's see the next one.

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:22.830 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, the shape
of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:25.990 align:middle line:84%
is looking very much like--
let's see if we can keep going,

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:28.640 align:middle line:84%
maybe find that painting
at the very beginning.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.710 align:middle line:90%
There's a close up of it.

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:33.100 align:middle line:90%
You can see the shape.

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:34.850 align:middle line:90%
And do one more.

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:35.820 align:middle line:90%
Let's see if we get that.

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.060 align:middle line:90%
There is even better.

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And we can see that
that looks startlingly

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.850 align:middle line:84%
like the painting at
the very, very beginning

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:46.760 align:middle line:90%
of the paintings.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:47.670 align:middle line:90%
Let's see that.

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:48.690 align:middle line:90%
There.

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:50.410 align:middle line:90%
And there it is.

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:53.430 align:middle line:84%
So we can actually go out
to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:55.886 align:middle line:84%
get some scuba diving
equipment, and go down

00:29:55.886 --> 00:29:56.730 align:middle line:90%
and find those temple.

00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:57.650 align:middle line:90%
And enjoy.

00:29:57.650 --> 00:29:59.260 align:middle line:90%
And enjoy.

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, this has really been
a pleasure having you here.

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:02.543 align:middle line:84%
CROTALO SESAMO: Well,
a pleasure for me.

00:30:02.543 --> 00:30:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And you're a great guy,
and your paintings-- well,

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:07.050 align:middle line:84%
not your paintings, the
paintings that you got

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:08.800 align:middle line:90%
are just absolutely mindblowing.

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, I really
hope that is really

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:14.070 align:middle line:90%
an inspiration for many people.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:15.640 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER: Oh, I
think it will be.

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.570 align:middle line:84%
It's really an honor
to be on GaiamTV,

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:21.095 align:middle line:84%
and I would really
love to see that this

00:30:21.095 --> 00:30:22.404 align:middle line:90%
is the first of many others.

00:30:22.404 --> 00:30:23.470 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: I think it will be.

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:25.930 align:middle line:10%
I invite all of you
and all of the people

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:30.270 align:middle line:10%
that are following us to go to
Damanhur to visit our website.

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:33.870 align:middle line:10%
But again, being Damanhur,
being in touch with some kind

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:38.340 align:middle line:10%
of energies is probably
the most amazing contact

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:40.170 align:middle line:10%
with something that
is really probably

00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:41.790 align:middle line:10%
awaiting us for a long time.

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:42.770 align:middle line:90%
JAY WEIDNER: I think so.

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:44.510 align:middle line:90%
Hey, well, thanks so much.
