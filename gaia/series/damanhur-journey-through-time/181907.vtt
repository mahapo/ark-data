00:00:03.444 --> 00:00:24.110 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.580 align:middle line:10%
>> So coming back for a moment
about the concept of time that

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.100 align:middle line:10%
we been talking before, about
the idea of a big sphere.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is obviously
just the pictures,

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.140 align:middle line:84%
just the images that can
help us to understand

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.960 align:middle line:84%
a little bit better this
new concept of time.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Because we can really
imagine like another kingdom,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.840 align:middle line:84%
as we had the kingdom
of the animals,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.730 align:middle line:84%
of the humans, of the plants,
and on their minerals.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.240 align:middle line:84%
So let's imagine really
the kingdom of time.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.350 align:middle line:84%
So at this point, if past
and future doesn't exist

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.160 align:middle line:84%
or it exists only for our
perception in this moment,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.440 align:middle line:84%
let's just try to
imagine that what

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.010 align:middle line:90%
is moving in this territory.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.665 align:middle line:84%
Well, what is moving
is our consciousness.

00:01:11.665 --> 00:01:13.280 align:middle line:90%
What we can imagine is our soul.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.120 align:middle line:84%
But more what we can
really talk about--

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.400 align:middle line:84%
our awareness-- the
consciousness that

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.460 align:middle line:84%
is really telling you
that you are here and now.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.240 align:middle line:84%
But let's try to bond a
little bit more other concept.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.870 align:middle line:84%
So how these old
possible events--

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.700 align:middle line:90%
they are connected?

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.900 align:middle line:90%
Well, our minds.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.180 align:middle line:90%
And I'm Italian.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And in Italy, we say
[ITALIAN SPEECH]..

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.730 align:middle line:84%
That translated in
English, it means

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.500 align:middle line:90%
like the mind is the liar.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.340 align:middle line:84%
That obviously is much more
charming, saying in Italian.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.590 align:middle line:84%
But in this case, we
can really imagine

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.460 align:middle line:84%
that our minds, our memories,
our perception-- it's

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.750 align:middle line:90%
very much, let's say, limited.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So what is past and
future is for us an idea

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.590 align:middle line:84%
or a perception that everything
is bond to cause-effect.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.300 align:middle line:90%
So I have a pen in my hand.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And if I open my hand,
the pen will fall down.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is what our
rational part is telling us.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.230 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Beside this general
concept, I'd love

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.120 align:middle line:84%
to introduce the idea of what
we call the synchronicity.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.640 align:middle line:90%


00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.340 align:middle line:10%
Well, the synchronicity
is part of these eight low

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.030 align:middle line:10%
that in our spiritual physic
are the base of the creation

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.620 align:middle line:10%
of the universe of form.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.420 align:middle line:84%
So everything that is
really bond to the matter.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And the synchronicity
is really one

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.050 align:middle line:84%
of these low that are dealing
a lot of aspect of our life.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the
true energy that bond

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.570 align:middle line:84%
every single event
to the others.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's like to
have a [INAUDIBLE],,

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.680 align:middle line:84%
where every single thing that
is happening in this moment

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.860 align:middle line:84%
is not just a cause-effect, but
is the reaction or the effect

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.080 align:middle line:84%
of whatever is going on in
every single moment of our life

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.320 align:middle line:84%
and in the life of
every other individuals.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.060 align:middle line:84%
It's a concept that
we can also define it

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.940 align:middle line:84%
with the name, the field
that many researcher--

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.500 align:middle line:90%
they've been using.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.980 align:middle line:84%
One more time, imagine
that everything is one

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.220 align:middle line:90%
and we are all one.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.710 align:middle line:84%
That means what happened
in my life is affecting

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.630 align:middle line:84%
not only my life,
but is affecting

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.100 align:middle line:90%
the life of every human being.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's the same
idea of a karma.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Karma in Sanskrit--
it means action.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So if my action are creating
my individual karma,

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.020 align:middle line:84%
positive or negative, or even
the best-- a neutral karma.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.840 align:middle line:84%
So there is also karma as a
human kind on this planet.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.580 align:middle line:84%
That means we are responsible
not only towards the action

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.970 align:middle line:84%
that are referring
to us, but also

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.860 align:middle line:84%
to the action that
are going to influence

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.610 align:middle line:90%
every single human being.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Synchronicity is not positive,
and it's not negative.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.460 align:middle line:84%
In a sort of way,
we might imagine

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.820 align:middle line:84%
that synchronicity
is exactly what

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.290 align:middle line:90%
is a positive events for us.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.030 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you an example.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.810 align:middle line:84%
I might need a pair of
shoes that is number 8.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.100 align:middle line:84%
But I don't have the money in
that moment to buy the shoes.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And mine are broken, so I
really need this pair of shoes.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Let's imagine that exactly
that moment from a van that

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.080 align:middle line:90%
is crossing the road--

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.160 align:middle line:84%
a door is opening and a box with
a pair of shoes with number 8

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.920 align:middle line:84%
is just there falling
in front of me.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Wow, this is perfect,
positive synchronicity.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is probably our
interpretation of all that.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.330 align:middle line:84%
But there is not a positive
or negative synchronicity.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.740 align:middle line:90%
There's always synchronicity.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.620 align:middle line:84%
That means every
single event that

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.420 align:middle line:90%
is happening in our lives--

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are not bad
and are not good.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.400 align:middle line:90%
They are opportunities.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.450 align:middle line:84%
Let me try to express a little
bit better this concept.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And to express this
concept, I need

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.460 align:middle line:84%
to introduce another
of these eight low.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.670 align:middle line:90%
That is what we call complexity.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, don't misunderstand
complexity with complicated.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Complexity for us--
it's everything

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.830 align:middle line:90%
that is linked to evolution.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, the evolution for us
is what I've been briefly--

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.500 align:middle line:84%
described as the process of this
spiritualization of the matter.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.890 align:middle line:84%
In our hands is what is being
called the enlightenment.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.390 align:middle line:84%
Or again, a spiritual
physic is what

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.550 align:middle line:90%
we call also metamorphosis.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's literally to bring
the matter to become light.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.510 align:middle line:84%
To bring the form
to become energy

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.300 align:middle line:84%
is everything that
is born to the idea

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.880 align:middle line:84%
that the form could be
transformed in something

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.770 align:middle line:90%
that we call spirit.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, but complexity-- it's
now very interesting to help us

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.120 align:middle line:84%
to understand how
synchronicity--

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.460 align:middle line:84%
it's bonding all
these different event,

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.150 align:middle line:84%
so we can truly say that
everything that is happening.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So all these events that are
not based on cause-effect,

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.060 align:middle line:84%
but on synchronicity
are guided, are

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.660 align:middle line:84%
drawn to and higher
level of evolution.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.540 align:middle line:84%
So like to imagine that
the universe of form

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.410 align:middle line:84%
is immersed in something that
is literally pulling or pushing,

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.210 align:middle line:90%
if you like.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Everything in a direction
of spiritualize the matter,

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.510 align:middle line:84%
to transform the
matter into light.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.290 align:middle line:84%
So everything is pulled
to become more evolve.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, we are still talking
about a field of possibilities.

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't have
to forget that we

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.630 align:middle line:84%
have a very important
other element

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.170 align:middle line:84%
that we've been introduced
that is called the free will.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.160 align:middle line:90%
And the free will--

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.595 align:middle line:84%
it's obviously the
possibility to evolve,

00:06:48.595 --> 00:06:52.150 align:middle line:84%
or to evolve fast, or also
not to evolve, to stop,

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.460 align:middle line:90%
or even to go back.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.650 align:middle line:84%
So free will is the
power of our choices.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.813 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have to forget that
we are the masters of our life.

00:07:01.813 --> 00:07:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have to forget that
all of these possibility-- they

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.762 align:middle line:84%
could be used in
many different way.

00:07:06.762 --> 00:07:07.720 align:middle line:90%
That's the reason why--

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.020 align:middle line:84%
also in the perception of
the event, something from it

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.970 align:middle line:90%
could be extremely positive.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.060 align:middle line:84%
In the same exactly
situation for another person

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.070 align:middle line:90%
be felt exactly negative.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.530 align:middle line:84%
So synchronicity
is moving events,

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.260 align:middle line:84%
thanks to the
complexity to what we

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.290 align:middle line:84%
call the arrow of complexity,
so the arrow of evolution

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:32.365 align:middle line:84%
that is pulling us to change,
to make transformation

00:07:32.365 --> 00:07:35.020 align:middle line:90%
in our life.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously, I can
welcome this transformation

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.480 align:middle line:84%
and be extremely
happy and excited.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Or I might not be so
happy to change my life.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And if you just think for a
moment, well, with something--

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.240 align:middle line:84%
it's brought in our life
that is not expected.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.910 align:middle line:90%
Do we say yes or we say no?

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.460 align:middle line:84%
It's different when we are
making the change that we want.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.220 align:middle line:84%
So in a certain
way, we feel that we

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.900 align:middle line:84%
have the control
of the changing,

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.130 align:middle line:90%
so that is much better.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:09.280 align:middle line:84%
But what if something
happened and is unexpected?

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.960 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
I couldn't control.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:12.760 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't guide.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.300 align:middle line:90%
And it's just arriving to me.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's say that
generally speaking,

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:18.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm not obviously
talking about you.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.870 align:middle line:84%
But generally
speaking, the people--

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.390 align:middle line:84%
they have a lot of
resistance to the change.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:24.930 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that true?

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe all these different
approach will help you,

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.610 align:middle line:84%
will help us to
approach whatever

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:35.170 align:middle line:84%
is going on in our life with a
different approach that before,

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:35.970 align:middle line:90%
say no.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.600 align:middle line:84%
It might be, well,
let me understand.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.750 align:middle line:84%
Let me find out why this
is happening to me, why

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.220 align:middle line:90%
this is happening-- my life.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.480 align:middle line:90%
What is the meaning?

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.150 align:middle line:84%
What I have really to
transform of myself, even

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:51.230 align:middle line:84%
if I have to admit sometimes
could really be challenging.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.250 align:middle line:90%
But this is life.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And life is exactly
what is happening

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.370 align:middle line:90%
where we plan all the rest.

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.160 align:middle line:90%
It's a nice way to say.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.010 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure that be
aware of this element

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.490 align:middle line:84%
will increase your
synchronicity,

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:06.320 align:middle line:84%
so will increase the
attraction of the events

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.810 align:middle line:84%
that you really need in
this moment of your life,

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.390 align:middle line:84%
to make the step that
is needed in your age,

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:14.640 align:middle line:84%
in your situation, whatever
it is about relationship,

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.250 align:middle line:84%
about family, about
work, about business.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:22.010 align:middle line:84%
So synchronicity and being
able to surf on this stream

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:23.030 align:middle line:90%
of events--

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.800 align:middle line:90%
it's really magic.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.170 align:middle line:84%
It's really like to
make our life magic,

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:31.400 align:middle line:84%
but also to truly guides
our life not from the mind,

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.240 align:middle line:90%
but from the soul.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.310 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Now that we talk
about the mission,

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:44.470 align:middle line:84%
the mission is exactly the
reason why you're here.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.810 align:middle line:84%
The mission is
really what you have

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:48.400 align:middle line:90%
to accomplish in this life.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.670 align:middle line:84%
The mission is what brought
you back in this incarnation.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:54.940 align:middle line:84%
So destiny-- it's a little
bit more static concept like,

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm sitting, and
I'm waiting my destiny.

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Something will
happen in my life.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, we are moving
in a spirituality

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.970 align:middle line:90%
that is really action.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.650 align:middle line:90%
That is we need to move to--

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:08.770 align:middle line:84%
again, accelerate and
attract exactly what

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:12.190 align:middle line:84%
is needed, but not needed
for my ego, for my mind,

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:14.260 align:middle line:84%
for my rational side,
but what I needed

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.700 align:middle line:90%
to accomplish my mission.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.060 align:middle line:90%
The real reason why I'm here.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And it might be that
it's not only to go

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:23.860 align:middle line:84%
to work, to earn money, to
spend more money that you're

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.670 align:middle line:84%
earning and doing the life
that maybe you are doing.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.700 align:middle line:84%
No, there is something
special that is awaiting you.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.010 align:middle line:84%
There is something
special that is really

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:34.270 align:middle line:90%
the reason why you're back.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And discover the mission
is one of the biggest

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.250 align:middle line:84%
step in every life that
obviously also accomplish

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:41.240 align:middle line:90%
the mission.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a very, very big step.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:45.280 align:middle line:10%
But even being
aware of the mission

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.060 align:middle line:10%
will make you close to
understand what it is.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And to give you some hint
of what is the mission,

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.440 align:middle line:84%
well, we can go deeply,
connecting to your soul,

00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.610 align:middle line:84%
so to what makes you happy,
to what makes you, let's say,

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:02.710 align:middle line:84%
feeling good,
feeling pleasurable

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:04.100 align:middle line:90%
about what you're doing.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.400 align:middle line:90%
It's about your passion.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.880 align:middle line:90%
It's about your skill.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.340 align:middle line:90%
It's about your talent.

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.360 align:middle line:84%
So everything that,
if you have it,

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.040 align:middle line:90%
is because, well, you need it.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.160 align:middle line:84%
You need it not just for
fun or not just for hobbies.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.580 align:middle line:84%
But because they could
become your instrument

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.510 align:middle line:90%
to realize your mission.

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:23.950 align:middle line:84%
So let's come back to the
stream of events guided

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:27.730 align:middle line:84%
by the synchronicity and
pull by the complexity,

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.690 align:middle line:90%
pull by the arrow of evolution.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.640 align:middle line:84%
So everything that is
going on is exactly

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.680 align:middle line:90%
guided by these two lows.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.330 align:middle line:90%


00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.480 align:middle line:10%
And the perception
of what's going on--

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.740 align:middle line:10%
it's very important.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.170 align:middle line:10%
And I will try now
to bond the concept

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.495 align:middle line:10%
of the perception with time.

00:11:47.495 --> 00:11:51.180 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:56.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, if time is this
territory, is this huge sphere

00:11:56.030 --> 00:12:00.050 align:middle line:84%
that contain everything,
also the different universe

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:02.420 align:middle line:84%
and everything that
is possible here

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:06.250 align:middle line:84%
and there, well,
let me just try now

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.820 align:middle line:84%
to see how time is
working with synchronicity

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.966 align:middle line:90%
and with complexity.

00:12:11.966 --> 00:12:16.390 align:middle line:10%
So if everything is there, if
time is containing everything,

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.250 align:middle line:10%
what is moving?

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.130 align:middle line:10%
It's moving my consciousness.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.820 align:middle line:10%
It's moving my soul.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:25.480 align:middle line:10%
That means the soul
can contemporary

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.600 align:middle line:10%
live multiple reality.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:33.250 align:middle line:84%
This soul can live contemporary
in many different life forms

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:36.220 align:middle line:84%
at the same exactly
moment, even if it looks

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.080 align:middle line:90%
that in this moment, right?

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking to you.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.240 align:middle line:90%
It looks that you're here.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.370 align:middle line:90%
You're watching me.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:43.820 align:middle line:90%
You're listening my words.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.700 align:middle line:84%
You might have a lot of
thoughts or question mark.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.570 align:middle line:84%
But you feel that you
are in this place.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:54.430 align:middle line:84%
If we can just increase our
perception, our consciousness,

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.130 align:middle line:84%
we might discover that,
well, I'm here now.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.860 align:middle line:84%
But I'm here in many
different places.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm here also in many
different life forms.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:07.490 align:middle line:84%
This is a concept that
many spiritual path that

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:12.940 align:middle line:84%
are talking, the fact that
to increase our experience.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:16.630 align:middle line:84%
Because only through experience
I can bring transformation.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, only here now,
it might not be enough.

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Or it takes really,
really a long path

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.910 align:middle line:84%
to accomplish the enlightenment,
the metamorphosis.

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:29.080 align:middle line:90%
So what I can do?

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Or what is possible
to do for my soul,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.250 align:middle line:84%
for my divine spark,
as we call it?

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.320 align:middle line:84%
The possibility to live
contemporary in other life

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.120 align:middle line:90%
forms.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I can be in
this moment in a dog.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.140 align:middle line:90%
I could be in a plant.

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:43.640 align:middle line:84%
It could be in other
life forms that

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.480 align:middle line:90%
is living down below the ocean.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.160 align:middle line:90%
I could be in a mineral.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:52.730 align:middle line:84%
So I can be and I am in many
of these different life forms.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:53.530 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Because sharing these
different experience

00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:00.490 align:middle line:84%
is increasing my
opportunity to change.

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Even talking about
ancient tradition,

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:07.300 align:middle line:84%
imagine the Native
Americans in their names,

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:11.110 align:middle line:84%
names that are connecting
to different animals--

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:15.910 align:middle line:84%
the wolf, toros, or the
eagle, or the snake.

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, for them was not
just to align themselves

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:20.680 align:middle line:90%
with the spirit of the animal.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.840 align:middle line:84%
But taking their
names was really

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.960 align:middle line:84%
like to share the
experience of that animal,

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:29.280 align:middle line:84%
like really to enter in one
of the animal and doing it

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.700 align:middle line:90%
and be there--

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.290 align:middle line:84%
is the same concept,
if you want,

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:34.450 align:middle line:90%
of our Damanhurian names--

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:39.940 align:middle line:84%
animals, plants, and very
soon, also, minerals.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.020 align:middle line:90%
So different kingdom.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.320 align:middle line:84%
But in this case, these
names are just not a joke.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.120 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that
I'm the rattlesnake,

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.920 align:middle line:84%
because it's funny
to call me Crotalo.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.080 align:middle line:90%
No, it's really a conqueror.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's really
a spiritual step.

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:56.320 align:middle line:84%
where entering and getting a
name of an animal is really

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.660 align:middle line:84%
like to share the
experience of that animal,

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.240 align:middle line:84%
and then of the plants,
and then of the mineral.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:07.060 align:middle line:84%
So I'm extending my possibility
to contain more experience.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.190 align:middle line:84%
So more complexity,
more evolution,

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:11.260 align:middle line:84%
so more possibility
to accelerate

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.930 align:middle line:84%
the transformation of
the matter of myself

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:17.090 align:middle line:90%
into light, into energy.

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:19.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
reserved to avatars.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:21.320 align:middle line:90%
No, you are one of them.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.690 align:middle line:90%
We are all potential avatars.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:25.862 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously, an
avatars is someone

00:15:25.862 --> 00:15:27.320 align:middle line:84%
that already did
the enlightenment,

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.610 align:middle line:90%
already did the metamorphosis.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:32.870 align:middle line:84%
So in a certain way, it's
fully conscious of all of this

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:37.430 align:middle line:84%
in every single moment of
his or her life and probably

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:39.590 align:middle line:84%
the reason why they come
back-- these avatars,

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:41.120 align:middle line:90%
the spiritual masters--

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.660 align:middle line:84%
is to help us to
teach, to show us,

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:48.185 align:middle line:84%
to give example that is possible
to integrate all of these

00:15:48.185 --> 00:15:51.560 align:middle line:84%
in this life, to
make an acceleration,

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.600 align:middle line:84%
to make it happen not
in so many incarnation,

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.510 align:middle line:84%
but maybe in a shorter
period of time.

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:57.530 align:middle line:90%
Because who knows?

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:00.440 align:middle line:84%
Also, the time for the
spiritualization of the matter

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.860 align:middle line:90%
is not unlimited.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.170 align:middle line:90%
So they come back to teach.

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:04.580 align:middle line:90%
They come back to give example.

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:08.690 align:middle line:84%
They come back to encourage
us through prophetical example

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:11.550 align:middle line:84%
to make all of
this accelerating.

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:16.920 align:middle line:84%
So extending our possibility to
be here and at the same time,

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.010 align:middle line:84%
see many different
other life forms.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:22.040 align:middle line:84%
It's an opportunity
of every human being.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.980 align:middle line:90%


00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.370 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason why we
need to bring back respect

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:31.520 align:middle line:84%
to the environment, to the
animals, to the others.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.320 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.010 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my friend, it's very easy.

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.290 align:middle line:84%
If I'm doing something
good towards all

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:38.390 align:middle line:84%
of these different life
forms, in a certain way,

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:41.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing something good
for me, for synchronicity.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.420 align:middle line:84%
But also because I might
be inside of that animal.

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.460 align:middle line:90%
I might be inside of the plants.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.830 align:middle line:84%
People-- that they
have the green thumb

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:51.640 align:middle line:84%
or that they have these amazing
relationship with animals--

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.440 align:middle line:84%
it's probably because they
are just a little bit more

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.690 align:middle line:90%
aware of what I'm telling you.

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:58.230 align:middle line:90%
But everyone could be aware.

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Everybody could have a
green thumb, could really

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.570 align:middle line:90%
speak with the animals.

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:04.819 align:middle line:84%
Because in a certain
way, it's like to speak

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:07.810 align:middle line:90%
with a part of yourself.

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:11.150 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason why
respecting every life form is

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:13.488 align:middle line:84%
one of the principle of
every spiritual research--

00:17:13.488 --> 00:17:16.030 align:middle line:84%
the respect of the environment,
the respect of the other life

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:17.010 align:middle line:90%
forms.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:21.625 align:middle line:84%
So all universal element that
we need so much in our lives

00:17:21.625 --> 00:17:22.425 align:middle line:90%
and in our society.

00:17:22.425 --> 00:17:25.650 align:middle line:90%


00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's come back to these
extension of our consciousness.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.870 align:middle line:84%
This extension is not
only about life forms.

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:36.600 align:middle line:10%
Let's go back to time.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's extend a
little bit this concept.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.720 align:middle line:84%
So what is past
and future for us?

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.240 align:middle line:84%
Past and future, if
they are not existing,

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.750 align:middle line:84%
are this sequence of event,
that the synchronicity is

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:52.040 align:middle line:90%
bonding towards the complexity.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.760 align:middle line:84%
In other-- hence,
everything that I perceive

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.010 align:middle line:84%
as past and future
is the movement

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:02.210 align:middle line:84%
from one point of evolution to
one other point of evolution.

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:05.330 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that in
this case, future

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:12.020 align:middle line:84%
is always more evolve than
from where I came from.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:14.320 align:middle line:84%
So I don't move from a
past and from a future.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.020 align:middle line:84%
But I'm moving from
a level of evolution

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:20.780 align:middle line:84%
to one other level of
evolution that in this case,

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:23.620 align:middle line:84%
it might be more
evolve, we can say.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:27.020 align:middle line:84%
But it's always the
future more evolved

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.500 align:middle line:90%
and the past less evolved.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, we cannot
answer in this way.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.610 align:middle line:90%
They're very fascinating.

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:37.043 align:middle line:84%
And talking about Atlantis,
if it's really true--

00:18:37.043 --> 00:18:38.710 align:middle line:84%
obviously, we believe
that this is true.

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.230 align:middle line:84%
That this civilization
was existent,

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:45.940 align:middle line:84%
and we talk at least about
more than 20,000 years ago.

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, the level of
evolution at the time--

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:53.170 align:middle line:84%
wow, was pretty, pretty
high, was definitely higher

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:54.800 align:middle line:90%
than this one.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.750 align:middle line:84%
So here's a classical example
to say, well, wait a moment.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.580 align:middle line:90%
Not always past.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.710 align:middle line:90%
It means less evolved.

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And future-- it
means more evolved.

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:09.460 align:middle line:84%
Because Atlantis is exactly
the perfect example of the fact

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.430 align:middle line:84%
that in some moments
of this time,

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:16.810 align:middle line:84%
in some places of this time
territory, well, Atlantis--

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:18.310 align:middle line:84%
that is still
existent, because it's

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:20.740 align:middle line:90%
existent in that point of time.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:24.540 align:middle line:84%
It's with a very, very, very
high level of evolution,

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:28.140 align:middle line:84%
obviously, right after the
falling, the destruction

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:32.280 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis, probably created
by this impact of this asteroid

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.510 align:middle line:90%
on the planet Earth.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, from a high
level, we dropped down.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.900 align:middle line:84%
We dropped to a level
that is much lower,

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.870 align:middle line:84%
and that they represent
then the path that

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:46.500 align:middle line:84%
sings the time, probably
10, 12,000 years ago.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.930 align:middle line:84%
The great flood that
could be expressed only

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:51.570 align:middle line:84%
like a consequence of the
shooting of the planet

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:54.300 align:middle line:84%
by the asteroid creating
this gigantic tsunami

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.890 align:middle line:90%
all over the planet.

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, from that
moment on is being

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.760 align:middle line:84%
a path that probably
we've been told

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:03.090 align:middle line:84%
to try to recreate
a level of evolution

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:05.820 align:middle line:84%
that we might imagine is
bringing in the future

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:09.890 align:middle line:84%
to be always more evolved, but
that in a large perspective

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:12.990 align:middle line:84%
is telling us that
is not pretty true.

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.390 align:middle line:84%
So everything is moving
in this direction,

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:17.985 align:middle line:84%
in the direction
of be more evolved.

00:20:17.985 --> 00:20:24.780 align:middle line:84%
But let me add something
even more interesting.

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:27.585 align:middle line:84%
Just recently been
teaching about past lives.

00:20:27.585 --> 00:20:30.210 align:middle line:90%


00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And in this very
fascinating path

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:35.230 align:middle line:84%
where we bring people
really to reawake,

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:39.510 align:middle line:84%
to reconnect with one
of their past life,

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:42.350 align:middle line:84%
there is an interesting research
that we have to do before.

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's really about
the fact that we might

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:47.470 align:middle line:90%
have hundreds of past life, OK?

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:50.770 align:middle line:84%
So now, why I want to
research in past life?

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:51.950 align:middle line:90%
For curiosity?

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:53.920 align:middle line:90%
No, this is not our approach.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.770 align:middle line:84%
For knowing that I was
an important person--

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:59.310 align:middle line:84%
well, this again
could be stick to ego.

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:03.280 align:middle line:84%
No, we are looking to
past lives to find out

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.190 align:middle line:84%
the most important experience
that are connecting

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:08.430 align:middle line:90%
to who I am in this moment.

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:10.500 align:middle line:90%
So I need to have answers--

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.300 align:middle line:84%
instrument to understand
why I have this talent, why

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.540 align:middle line:84%
I like so much this place, why
I don't like these other places,

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.610 align:middle line:84%
why I have this challenging
relationship, why

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm so good to do other things.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So I need to get from
the past the keys

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:25.330 align:middle line:90%
to understand the present--

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:28.660 align:middle line:84%
why I'm here, why I'm
doing what I'm doing,

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:32.890 align:middle line:84%
and why I feel things that
sometimes I cannot answer.

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:34.390 align:middle line:84%
So in the research
of the past life,

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:38.530 align:middle line:84%
we need to have a GPS,
if I can use this term,

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:42.640 align:middle line:84%
to select exactly the
most important lives that

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.980 align:middle line:90%
are affecting me.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is a long work
that tooks at least a month

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:49.300 align:middle line:84%
before the class in
Damanhur from groups

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:52.000 align:middle line:84%
that are specializes in
this research, groups

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.620 align:middle line:84%
that are connecting
to our spiritual way.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And in particular,
the way of the oracle

00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:00.060 align:middle line:84%
is the one in charge
of these things.

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, level after level, we
create literally a passel

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:05.150 align:middle line:90%
of important lives--

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:07.440 align:middle line:84%
four, five, sometimes
even more that

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.440 align:middle line:84%
are really the crucial one,
the one that are really

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:11.980 align:middle line:90%
the pictures of ourself.

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:14.220 align:middle line:84%
But why I'm talking
about past life?

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.690 align:middle line:84%
Because I've been
already talking

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:20.520 align:middle line:84%
about the extension of our
soul in different life forms.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.110 align:middle line:90%
Let's add something more.

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:27.310 align:middle line:84%
This extension is not only
about other life forms,

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:32.800 align:middle line:84%
but is also about me being in
different places of this time

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.210 align:middle line:90%
sphere.

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Me as a soul being contemporary
in many different time

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:45.070 align:middle line:84%
territory where I'm
living my lives.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:49.390 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not talking
anymore about past lives.

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:52.830 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm talking
about lives, life

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:56.800 align:middle line:84%
that contemporary are
going on in this moment.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.880 align:middle line:90%
So it's even more fascinating.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:03.040 align:middle line:84%
So if before I told you,
well, wait a moment.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Every action is not
just towards yourself,

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.100 align:middle line:84%
but they are going to have
an effect on all the others.

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.170 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm adding another layer.

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:13.270 align:middle line:84%
So I'm adding the
fact that whatever

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:15.610 align:middle line:84%
is going on in my
life, in this time

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:18.990 align:middle line:84%
territory, in this moment
that I called the present,

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:23.580 align:middle line:84%
it's also affecting all the
other "past life" that are not

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:28.480 align:middle line:84%
past, but lives simply in
a different time territory.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.210 align:middle line:84%
It is very fascinating,
because also these other lives

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:32.663 align:middle line:90%
are influencing me.

00:23:32.663 --> 00:23:33.580 align:middle line:90%
That's the reason why.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:36.070 align:middle line:84%
When I'm researching
one of these lives,

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:38.240 align:middle line:84%
well, it looks
that a part of me--

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.530 align:middle line:84%
it's coming back from one of
this territory to tell me,

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:44.980 align:middle line:84%
to talk to me, to try
to make me understand,

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.020 align:middle line:84%
to try to give me the
instrument to live

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.220 align:middle line:90%
what I need to live here.

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:50.020 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Because what I'm living
here is affecting also

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:57.370 align:middle line:84%
that life and all the other
lives that I might know or not.

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Because of course, there are
lives with a different-- can

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.930 align:middle line:90%
I say weight?

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:05.860 align:middle line:84%
So they are, let's say, a little
bit more significant in my soul

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.770 align:middle line:84%
journey, that one more
time is the journey

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:10.690 align:middle line:84%
to the spiritualization
of the matter,

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:12.790 align:middle line:84%
is the journey to
the enlightenment,

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:16.410 align:middle line:84%
is the journey to bring
the matter to become light.

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:19.810 align:middle line:10%
And all of these lives-- they
are affecting me and my life,

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:22.840 align:middle line:10%
and my action, and my
thoughts, and what I perceive,

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:29.410 align:middle line:10%
and what I'm dreaming every
single moment of my existence.

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:31.100 align:middle line:90%
Everything is connected.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:32.860 align:middle line:90%
Everything is bond to the rest.

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:34.790 align:middle line:90%
So everything has a meaning.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And one of the elements that the
magician is really able to do

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:43.630 align:middle line:84%
is to constantly giving
meanings and new meanings.

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Significance on top
of other significance.

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:49.390 align:middle line:84%
So I'm trying to tell you
that your life is precious.

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:50.470 align:middle line:90%
It's unique.

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's guided by low
that you can guide, too,

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:56.640 align:middle line:84%
that are telling you, that
are showing you element.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you never
thought about it.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.980 align:middle line:90%
You never even imagine.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:02.860 align:middle line:84%
But they are talking about
something extremely special

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:06.640 align:middle line:84%
that you have to accomplish
in this life, the mission.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.370 align:middle line:90%
My perception are a limitation.

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:12.190 align:middle line:84%
So the perception of what
is a moment is technically--

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:17.490 align:middle line:84%
could be translate in
what is four second.

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happened
every four second?

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Every four second, we have
base on the interaction

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.260 align:middle line:90%
of the eight lows.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.760 align:middle line:10%
And we just mentioned
two of them--

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:33.210 align:middle line:10%
synchronicity and complexity,
but there are many others--

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:38.220 align:middle line:10%
sole atom, time
matrix, synchronicity,

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:43.770 align:middle line:10%
complexity, divinity, falling
of the neutral events,

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:45.990 align:middle line:10%
geometric essence,
and the chaos.

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:48.910 align:middle line:90%


00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:50.740 align:middle line:84%
We are not going to
enter in all of them,

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.800 align:middle line:84%
because this could be
part of another episode.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:58.610 align:middle line:84%
But in the interaction of these
eight low, well, every moment.

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:01.020 align:middle line:84%
So every first
second, what happened?

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:05.830 align:middle line:84%
In this time that we know,
it's with this trunk,

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:07.630 align:middle line:84%
but then with all
these branches.

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:12.520 align:middle line:84%
So every four second, six
different possibilities

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.800 align:middle line:90%
are opening in front of us.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Four possibilities are
literally six time branches.

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.570 align:middle line:84%
We are becoming
more and more aware

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:28.860 align:middle line:84%
that my soul is
something extremely much

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:36.090 align:middle line:84%
more, not only evolve, but with
so many more possibilities.

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:41.760 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm moving in time, in
space, in events, in something

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.120 align:middle line:84%
that I call synchronicity
pulled by the complexity

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.570 align:middle line:84%
with different life
forms and so on, exactly

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:50.640 align:middle line:90%
in every single moment.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:55.260 align:middle line:84%
So trying to remember
events like this one

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.335 align:middle line:84%
or trying to pay attention
in what you're living exactly

00:26:58.335 --> 00:26:59.190 align:middle line:90%
in this moment.

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:01.460 align:middle line:84%
Yes, in this moment
of four second.

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And just try to feel yourself
and to span your consciousness

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.650 align:middle line:84%
in all these different
branches, in all

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.285 align:middle line:90%
these different timeline.

00:27:09.285 --> 00:27:11.100 align:middle line:90%
Is it not exciting?

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:15.350 align:middle line:84%
Because it means that
I, through my free will,

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:18.620 align:middle line:90%
I can guide again my floating.

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:24.260 align:middle line:84%
I can guide in which timeline
I want to be or I desire to be.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:26.810 align:middle line:84%
Or for synchronicity,
I want a guide

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:32.750 align:middle line:84%
to do exactly what my conscious
is telling me is my mission

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:35.210 align:middle line:84%
and what I have to
accomplish in this moment.

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:36.980 align:middle line:90%
So it's a little secret.

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Or it's an understanding that
will make us not only more

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:44.090 align:middle line:84%
aware, but also with a
bigger power, the power

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:47.570 align:middle line:84%
to take the timeline that
you needed in this moment.

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:50.180 align:middle line:84%
But you need it to
accelerate, not to decelerate.

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:54.680 align:middle line:84%
So in this way, my friend, we
can literally guide our life

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:58.380 align:middle line:84%
to make things in a
much shorter time,

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:04.550 align:middle line:84%
in a way that you cannot even
imagine at this point if we are

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:09.230 align:middle line:84%
able to use all the element that
we've been talking until this

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:10.280 align:middle line:90%
moment.

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.190 align:middle line:84%
So we add the fact
that we are constantly

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:17.150 align:middle line:84%
floating between all these
different branches, all

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:18.780 align:middle line:90%
these different trial time.

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:23.067 align:middle line:84%
So these all infinitive
numbers of possibility.

00:28:23.067 --> 00:28:24.400 align:middle line:90%
And this is also very important.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:27.860 align:middle line:84%
I have an unlimited
possibilities in front of me.

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And being able to guide
this is what magic is doing,

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:35.190 align:middle line:84%
is what a magician,
an initiate is doing.

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:37.910 align:middle line:84%
So being able to,
in a certain way,

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:41.000 align:middle line:84%
select the events
that are all there.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Because if this
is the field where

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.490 align:middle line:84%
it's containing everything,
the time sphere,

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:51.170 align:middle line:84%
I can simply select exactly
what I need in the right moment,

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:52.490 align:middle line:90%
in the right time.

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:55.840 align:middle line:90%
