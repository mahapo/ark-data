00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Welcome to
House of Wellbeing.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.330 align:middle line:84%
You are listening to the Career
Confidence Mind Talk Audio.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.400 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.050 align:middle line:84%
But before it
does, I'd just like

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.200 align:middle line:84%
to remind you that the
following audio contains

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.930 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.600 align:middle line:84%
aim to help you reach a
deep level of relaxation.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.270 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.690 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.750 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.130 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.718 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:54.260 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.110 align:middle line:84%
we need to do apart from close
your eyes, relax, and let go.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And really enjoy those peaceful
feelings and all the benefits

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.650 align:middle line:90%
that come with it.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.280 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to take in
a very deep breath, slowly

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.480 align:middle line:84%
inhaling, filling your
lower and upper lungs.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And exhaling again, allowing
your lungs to deflate naturally

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.250 align:middle line:90%
and slowly.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.680 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And once you've done that, I'd
like you to once again take

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.190 align:middle line:90%
in another deep breath.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.806 align:middle line:90%
Fill your lungs.

00:01:36.806 --> 00:01:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready,
allow that breath

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.930 align:middle line:84%
to slowly release, as you
exhale gently and powerfully.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.500 align:middle line:90%


00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And now you can allow your
breathing to return to normal.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.300 align:middle line:90%
Your normal breathing pace.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.930 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.139 align:middle line:84%
Gentle breaths in and out
as you normally would.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:12.070 align:middle line:90%


00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And as you relax, you're
aware of your eyes,

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.260 align:middle line:90%
how comfortable they feel.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.075 align:middle line:84%
Closed and relaxed,
totally at ease.

00:02:20.075 --> 00:02:23.290 align:middle line:90%


00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now to
focus only on my words.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Nothing else bothers
or concerns you at all.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.190 align:middle line:90%
This is your time.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.610 align:middle line:84%
No one needs or wants
anything from you.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.970 align:middle line:90%


00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.430 align:middle line:84%
So putting everything
else aside,

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to draw your attention
to various parts of your body.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And as I draw attention
to that part of your body,

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.210 align:middle line:84%
you can allow each part
to relax and release.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Every muscle, every
nerve, every part of it

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.930 align:middle line:90%
as I refer to it in time.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.850 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.380 align:middle line:84%
So let's first focus
on your fingers

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.580 align:middle line:84%
and on your hands, your
wrists, your forearms

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.620 align:middle line:90%
and your upper arms.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.300 align:middle line:90%


00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And as you think about
that part of your body,

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.840 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to be aware of
any tension in those muscles,

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.745 align:middle line:90%
and concentrate on that tension.

00:03:33.745 --> 00:03:38.090 align:middle line:90%


00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Now you can allow those muscles
to relax and to release.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.330 align:middle line:90%


00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Every nerve, every
fiber in your hands,

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.170 align:middle line:84%
your wrists and
fingers, your arms.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.670 align:middle line:90%


00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Allow that tension
to flow away now,

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:09.810 align:middle line:84%
to drain down, allowing the
muscles to rest and release,

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.855 align:middle line:90%
lengthen, and loosen.

00:04:12.855 --> 00:04:15.960 align:middle line:90%


00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.315 align:middle line:84%
Feel your arms become heavier
as they release completely.

00:04:20.315 --> 00:04:26.730 align:middle line:90%


00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.370 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
concentrate your attention

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:36.540 align:middle line:84%
on your feet, your
ankles, your calves

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:42.090 align:middle line:84%
and your knees, the large
muscles of your thighs.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.830 align:middle line:90%


00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.445 align:middle line:84%
Aware of any tension
in those muscles.

00:04:49.445 --> 00:04:53.140 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And as you concentrate
on them, you

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:06.890 align:middle line:84%
can relax every muscle, every
fiber in your legs and feet,

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:12.010 align:middle line:84%
allowing all of the tension
to fade away now as you

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.010 align:middle line:90%
drift deeper into relaxation.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.060 align:middle line:90%


00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Muscles loosening and
lengthening as muscles

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.030 align:middle line:90%
relax and release now.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.220 align:middle line:90%


00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.850 align:middle line:84%
Legs heavy now as
you relax completely.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:40.860 align:middle line:90%


00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Aware now of your chest,
your lower back muscles,

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:55.240 align:middle line:84%
your stomach muscles, your
upper back and upper chest.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Notice how all the muscles
in this part of your body

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.960 align:middle line:84%
are now becoming more
and more relaxed,

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.800 align:middle line:84%
loosening, and
lengthening as you

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.220 align:middle line:84%
allow the muscles
to release and relax

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.040 align:middle line:90%
and tension drains away now.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:22.180 align:middle line:90%


00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And now allow your
shoulders to sink

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.382 align:middle line:84%
into the frame of your body
as you sink into relaxation.

00:06:29.382 --> 00:06:33.370 align:middle line:90%


00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.085 align:middle line:84%
All the little muscles in
your neck and your scalp.

00:06:36.085 --> 00:06:39.370 align:middle line:90%


00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.580 align:middle line:90%
Aware the tension here.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And now you can
release that tension,

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:51.840 align:middle line:84%
as every part of that muscle,
every part of your body

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.855 align:middle line:90%
becomes more and more relaxed.

00:06:53.855 --> 00:06:56.490 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel each and
every muscle in your body,

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:05.740 align:middle line:84%
now loose and limp as that
comfortable heaviness continues

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:06.540 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:11.900 align:middle line:90%


00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And whilst you're
relaxing in this way,

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.810 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
use your imagination

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.590 align:middle line:84%
to think about a
beautiful summer's day.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.750 align:middle line:90%


00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.300 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to
imagine that you're

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:33.360 align:middle line:84%
floating on a cloud, so
peaceful and so quiet.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.910 align:middle line:90%


00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:42.850 align:middle line:84%
You feel safe and secure,
and you enjoy the serenity

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:48.490 align:middle line:84%
and peace as you
float and drift,

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.550 align:middle line:90%
feeling so comfortable and calm.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:55.570 align:middle line:90%


00:07:55.570 --> 00:08:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And you're completely at ease,
and every muscle and nerve

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:04.900 align:middle line:84%
in your entire
body is completely

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:13.460 align:middle line:84%
relaxed as you go deeper and
deeper into relaxation now.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.320 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if you can allow
yourself to go even deeper now,

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.190 align:middle line:84%
as I count from
one down to three.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:27.180 align:middle line:90%


00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And as I reach the
number three, you

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:37.169 align:middle line:84%
can allow yourself to have
drifted much, much deeper

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:38.250 align:middle line:90%
than you've ever been.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:44.220 align:middle line:90%


00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.290 align:middle line:90%
So one.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Your entire body
completely relaxed now.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Every muscle, every nerve,
every fiber relaxed and at ease.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Your body feeling completely
released and comfortable.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.110 align:middle line:90%
Feeling so heavy now.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.170 align:middle line:90%


00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.220 align:middle line:90%
And two.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.250 align:middle line:90%
Your head feeling so heavy now.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.070 align:middle line:90%
And it's a pleasant feeling.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.520 align:middle line:84%
You feel safe and
secure, and you're

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.540 align:middle line:84%
enjoying this state
of deep relaxation

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.250 align:middle line:84%
as you fall further and
further into relaxation now.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:32.180 align:middle line:90%


00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.230 align:middle line:90%
And three.

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:36.740 align:middle line:84%
You're now deeper
than you've ever been.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:42.350 align:middle line:84%
So deeply relaxed that
every word I utter to you

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:46.460 align:middle line:84%
will sink into your
subconscious mind and create

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:53.240 align:middle line:84%
some powerful changes, as
you sink deeper and deeper.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Mind alert, but body
totally relaxed now.

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:06.500 align:middle line:90%


00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of your chosen
industry or profession,

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:14.240 align:middle line:84%
career confidence
is one skill that's

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.805 align:middle line:84%
essential to succeed
in any field.

00:10:16.805 --> 00:10:20.360 align:middle line:90%


00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.300 align:middle line:84%
For a while now, you've
felt a lack of confidence

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.720 align:middle line:84%
has been holding you
back and preventing you

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.550 align:middle line:84%
from either making valuable
contributions in meetings,

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:38.240 align:middle line:84%
asking questions, challenging
opinions, putting yourself

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.750 align:middle line:84%
forward for additional
responsibilities,

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.690 align:middle line:84%
or showcasing your
expertise in the best light.

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:48.470 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:53.700 align:middle line:84%
You know confident people tend
to work much more happily.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:58.560 align:middle line:84%
They're unafraid of promotion
or taking on new challenges.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:01.305 align:middle line:84%
So you start to do the
following to boost confidence

00:11:01.305 --> 00:11:02.105 align:middle line:90%
in yourself.

00:11:02.105 --> 00:11:05.690 align:middle line:90%


00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:11.510 align:middle line:84%
From now on in, you stop
all negative self talk.

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.690 align:middle line:84%
No one has ever got
better at anything

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:17.120 align:middle line:90%
by beating themselves up.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:22.580 align:middle line:84%
So you talk to yourself kindly,
encouraging your behavior,

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.100 align:middle line:84%
keeping a positive
mindset to help

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.670 align:middle line:90%
you learn much more easily.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Not allowing negative
thinking to enter your head.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Keeping a positive internal
dialogue at all times.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:40.340 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.670 align:middle line:84%
You boost your knowledge,
as knowledge equals power,

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:47.090 align:middle line:84%
and this is a surefire
way of being much more

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:52.750 align:middle line:84%
certain and confident about
what you're suggesting or doing.

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Keeping up with the latest
research, trade press,

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:00.280 align:middle line:84%
insights, cultural
impacts, whatever

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.670 align:middle line:84%
it may be to help you
stay one step ahead

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:07.260 align:middle line:84%
and boost your confidence
and ability in what you do.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.740 align:middle line:90%


00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.710 align:middle line:84%
You start to build
on your strengths,

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.750 align:middle line:84%
as building on your
strengths rather

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:20.980 align:middle line:84%
than your weaknesses helps
you to accept what you already

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:25.840 align:middle line:84%
know, helping to increase your
confidence around something

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.130 align:middle line:90%
you do excellently.

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:30.120 align:middle line:90%


00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:35.790 align:middle line:84%
You learn new skills to enhance
your expertise within your job.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And you may do this
by simply observing

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:43.800 align:middle line:84%
how other successful people do
it, and copying what they do.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Or you may read
or attend seminars

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:49.380 align:middle line:84%
that are designed to
help you hone your skills

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.925 align:middle line:90%
and to become a better worker.

00:12:50.925 --> 00:12:55.190 align:middle line:90%


00:12:55.190 --> 00:13:00.020 align:middle line:84%
You have a newfound
curiosity, asking questions

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:04.550 align:middle line:84%
so you fully understand
what's required of you.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Having clarification
of precisely what's

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:10.550 align:middle line:84%
being asked of you
helps you to eliminate

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:15.860 align:middle line:84%
the chance of messing up and
lowering your confidence.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Having full understanding is how
you keep your confidence high.

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.630 align:middle line:90%


00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps in the past,
you've doubted your ability

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:30.350 align:middle line:84%
to follow an exciting
new venture through.

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:33.550 align:middle line:84%
So now I'd like you to take
a moment to think about some

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:36.915 align:middle line:84%
of your past successes that
you've had in your career.

00:13:36.915 --> 00:13:39.810 align:middle line:90%


00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:44.370 align:middle line:84%
What did success
look like for you?

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:47.190 align:middle line:90%
Did you meet a tight deadline?

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:50.570 align:middle line:90%
Were you successful on a pitch?

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:53.385 align:middle line:84%
Did you manage to turn a
difficult project around?

00:13:53.385 --> 00:13:56.310 align:middle line:90%


00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Did your employer praise
you and one of your ideas?

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Were you successful in
asking for a promotion?

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.750 align:middle line:90%


00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.720 align:middle line:84%
Take a moment now to
visualize and see yourself

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:14.640 align:middle line:84%
being successful, as regularly
recalling successful times

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.880 align:middle line:84%
at work continuously
boosts your confidence.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:22.530 align:middle line:90%


00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:24.660 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
visualize yourself

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.725 align:middle line:84%
thinking about what success
may look like in the future.

00:14:27.725 --> 00:14:31.140 align:middle line:90%


00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:34.140 align:middle line:84%
See and hear yourself
in whatever situation

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:39.660 align:middle line:84%
you hope to achieve in
the short or long term,

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.180 align:middle line:84%
for every one of us
has the right to carry

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.070 align:middle line:90%
our dreams through to fruition.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's your duty to yourself,
for if you don't, you'll

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:53.140 align:middle line:84%
always wonder whether or
not it would have worked,

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.170 align:middle line:84%
and how life could
have been different.

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:57.700 align:middle line:90%


00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:01.440 align:middle line:84%
So see yourself now
achieving your goal,

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.730 align:middle line:84%
and feel how happy that
you've been successful.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.340 align:middle line:90%


00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And you may hear people
praising or congratulating you.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And you hear yourself talking
back in a confident manner.

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Feel your self-confidence
soar, and you

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:25.190 align:middle line:84%
feel that you can
achieve and be anything

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:26.480 align:middle line:90%
you want to be at work.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.460 align:middle line:90%


00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Take a moment now to
soak up this feeling.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:37.730 align:middle line:84%
That feeling of
confidence and happiness,

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:39.530 align:middle line:90%
of being focused and driven.

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:43.840 align:middle line:90%


00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.030 align:middle line:84%
You know what your
future holds, and you're

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:52.210 align:middle line:84%
determined to succeed,
as you ultimately will.

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:55.510 align:middle line:84%
Every day, in every way,
you feel much more confident

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:57.400 align:middle line:90%
in the workplace.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:04.520 align:middle line:84%
More driven, more focused,
ambitious and positive.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.070 align:middle line:84%
You're helping yourself
by simply building

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:11.180 align:middle line:84%
on your strengths,
boosting your knowledge,

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:16.400 align:middle line:84%
thinking positively,
and learning new skills.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.730 align:middle line:84%
You feel in control of your
future, and this pleases you.

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.250 align:middle line:90%


00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And as confidence surges
through every part of your body,

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:31.880 align:middle line:84%
you know you will succeed
because your determination

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:35.750 align:middle line:84%
and motivation to succeed
grow stronger and stronger day

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:36.550 align:middle line:90%
by day.

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:39.440 align:middle line:90%


00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And these hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:44.630 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind,

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.670 align:middle line:84%
and will become more
and more powerful

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:48.370 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:51.530 align:middle line:90%


00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from one to five

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:57.340 align:middle line:84%
to awaken you, and
at the count of five,

00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:00.080 align:middle line:84%
you'll be wide awake,
fully refreshed, alert,

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.470 align:middle line:84%
and feeling fantastic,
bringing back

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:05.990 align:middle line:84%
with you all the
wonderful new feelings.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:07.780 align:middle line:90%
So coming back now.

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:13.359 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:15.869 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:20.000 align:middle line:90%
