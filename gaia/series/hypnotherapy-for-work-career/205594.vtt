00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.480 align:middle line:10%
I'm Sophie, from the
House of Wellbeing.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.570 align:middle line:10%
In our "Work and Career Guided
Meditation and Hypnotherapy"

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.790 align:middle line:10%
series, you'll find
audios to help you

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.020 align:middle line:10%
in your professional life.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And we cover issues
such as releasing stress

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.700 align:middle line:84%
at work, career confidence,
imposter syndrome, creativity,

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.670 align:middle line:84%
powerful public
speaking, improved memory

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.840 align:middle line:84%
and concentration, and
business meeting presence.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.350 align:middle line:84%
All of our audios are slightly
different to meditation alone,

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.550 align:middle line:84%
because we use powerful
therapeutic tools,

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.730 align:middle line:84%
including cognitive
behavioral therapy,

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.790 align:middle line:84%
neurolinguistic therapy,
visualization, and of course,

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.010 align:middle line:90%
hypnotherapy.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.420 align:middle line:10%
It's all of those powerful
tools put together

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.207 align:middle line:10%
that means that our audios
are so powerful and effective,

00:00:48.207 --> 00:00:50.540 align:middle line:10%
because we're able to get rid
of those negative thinking

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.180 align:middle line:10%
patterns once and for
all and change them

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.798 align:middle line:10%
with positive,
empowering suggestions.

00:00:56.798 --> 00:00:58.340 align:middle line:84%
When you listen to
our audios, you'll

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.680 align:middle line:84%
be put into a deep
state of relaxation.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.395 align:middle line:84%
And it's a really
familiar state to you.

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:03.770 align:middle line:84%
It's the same
state of relaxation

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.050 align:middle line:84%
you go into just as
you're falling asleep.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.170 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
hypnagogic state,

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.030 align:middle line:84%
and it's a really natural
and safe feeling to be into.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in that
state of relaxation,

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.025 align:middle line:84%
your brainwaves change
into the theta brain wave.

00:01:17.025 --> 00:01:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
important, because it

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.040 align:middle line:84%
means that any messaging
goes from your conscious mind

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.260 align:middle line:90%
into your subconscious mind.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.020 align:middle line:84%
The reason we want to get
into your subconscious mind

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.540 align:middle line:84%
is because that's where your
permanent thoughts and beliefs

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.530 align:middle line:90%
and memories and habits live.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.560 align:middle line:84%
So by accessing your
subconscious mind,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.410 align:middle line:84%
that's when we can really start
to make those changes once

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.460 align:middle line:90%
and for all.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.390 align:middle line:84%
We can retrain, reframe, and
rewire your thinking patterns,

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.940 align:middle line:84%
creating new neural
positive pathways,

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.610 align:middle line:84%
getting rid of the
negative thinking patterns.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And instead, changing them with
positive, empowering thinking.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.460 align:middle line:84%
We recommend that you
listen to our audios

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.820 align:middle line:84%
is at least four times
to really compound

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.960 align:middle line:90%
that positive messaging.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.600 align:middle line:84%
It's different for everybody,
but do try and listen

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.100 align:middle line:84%
to them at least
four times, and you

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.700 align:middle line:84%
should start to really see and
think and feel those changes

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.440 align:middle line:90%
start to take place.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.217 align:middle line:84%
You can listen to our audios
at any time of day or night,

00:02:11.217 --> 00:02:12.800 align:middle line:84%
but we suggest that
you listen to them

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.210 align:middle line:90%
when you're not too tired.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Because if you fall into
a deep state of sleep

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.610 align:middle line:84%
when you're listening to them,
then your subconscious mind

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.930 align:middle line:90%
just isn't listening.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.700 align:middle line:84%
So try to listen to them
when you're not too sleepy.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.450 align:middle line:84%
So please listen to
the audios when you're

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.890 align:middle line:90%
free from any interruptions.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.598 align:middle line:84%
Don't listen to them
when you're actively

00:02:29.598 --> 00:02:32.690 align:middle line:84%
doing the thing like driving
or operating machinery.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.430 align:middle line:84%
If there's an
emergency and you need

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.110 align:middle line:84%
to wake up and come
out of hypnosis,

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.282 align:middle line:90%
that's absolutely fine.

00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:38.240 align:middle line:90%
It's no problem at all.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious
mind will alert you

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.230 align:middle line:84%
and you'll easily
come out of hypnosis.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.590 align:middle line:84%
It'll be just like waking up
from a nap or from a sleep.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.700 align:middle line:84%
So for now, click on any of the
audios in the series that you

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.440 align:middle line:90%
think are relevant to you.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.860 align:middle line:84%
Find a comfortable position,
whether it's a bed or a chair.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Just relax, let go, and
close your eyes to begin.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.000 align:middle line:90%
