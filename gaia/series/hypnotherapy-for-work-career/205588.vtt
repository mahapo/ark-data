00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to the
House of Wellbeing.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.920 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the
"Powerful Presentation

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.510 align:middle line:84%
on Public Speaking
Hypnotherapy" audio.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.160 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.650 align:middle line:84%
But before it
does, I'd just like

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.930 align:middle line:84%
to remind you that the
following audio contains

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.480 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.345 align:middle line:84%
aim to help you reach a
deep level of relaxation.

00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:35.970 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.420 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.843 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:42.843 --> 00:00:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.080 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.308 align:middle line:84%
will alert you and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:53.308 --> 00:00:54.850 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.370 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.370 align:middle line:90%
relax, lie back, and let go.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And enjoy those peaceful
feelings and all the benefits

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.000 align:middle line:90%
that come with it.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.550 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Make yourself as
comfortable as possible

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.835 align:middle line:84%
and concentrate on
the sound of my voice.

00:01:16.835 --> 00:01:19.580 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And begin by drawing in
a long, slow, deep breath

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.770 align:middle line:90%
in through your nose.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.810 align:middle line:90%
Hold the breath for a moment.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And now, slightly
open your mouth

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.080 align:middle line:84%
and release all the
air from your body

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.770 align:middle line:90%
in a long, low, deep sigh.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And relax, allowing your
lungs to naturally deflate

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.490 align:middle line:84%
as your body sinks into
gentle relaxation now.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.970 align:middle line:90%


00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.050 align:middle line:90%
And you can release any tension.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Relax and let go as I
guide you through a journey

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:12.040 align:middle line:84%
of relaxation, a journey that
you will find very beneficial

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.660 align:middle line:90%
for your overall well-being.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.040 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.950 align:middle line:84%
You're going to start
this calming experience

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.145 align:middle line:84%
by first relaxing your
whole body-mind system.

00:02:24.145 --> 00:02:26.920 align:middle line:90%


00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's true to say that the
simple act of relaxing the body

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.570 align:middle line:84%
and mind has a positive knock-on
effect, because how you think

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.800 align:middle line:90%
determines how you feel.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And how you feel influences
the world around you.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And how you choose
to think today

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.150 align:middle line:84%
affects your decisions
from here on in.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.790 align:middle line:84%
So to make my
assurances your reality,

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.840 align:middle line:84%
let's begin by
focusing your attention

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.240 align:middle line:90%
at the very top of your head.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.090 align:middle line:84%
Tension often starts at
the scalp and the neck.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.320 align:middle line:84%
So mentally and physically,
allow all the muscles

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.940 align:middle line:84%
around the top of your
head to relax now.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.980 align:middle line:90%


00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.840 align:middle line:84%
Letting all the
tension simply dissolve

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.945 align:middle line:84%
as you start to tune into
your body-mind system.

00:03:29.945 --> 00:03:35.120 align:middle line:90%


00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Just let any tension you may
be holding to release now.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Allow your brain to relax,
the left and the right

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.770 align:middle line:84%
lobes of the brain
just releasing.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Such a simple thought, yet so
profound and so significant.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.430 align:middle line:90%
Just letting go completely.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.170 align:middle line:90%


00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Drifting further
and further down.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.810 align:middle line:90%
Nobody wanting anything.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.520 align:middle line:90%
Nobody needing anything.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.230 align:middle line:90%
This is your time to relax.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.950 align:middle line:90%


00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.589 align:middle line:84%
Taking the relaxation
into the face

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:23.610 align:middle line:84%
now, allowing all of your
facial muscles to feel loose.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.290 align:middle line:84%
Feel your brow relaxing,
your forehead smoothing out,

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.495 align:middle line:84%
and the back of
your eyes relaxing.

00:04:31.495 --> 00:04:34.340 align:middle line:90%


00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.690 align:middle line:84%
Tiny muscles around
your eyes and eyelids,

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.950 align:middle line:84%
down into your cheeks and
into your jaw muscles,

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.820 align:middle line:90%
just releasing and letting go.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.830 align:middle line:90%


00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Allowing your
tongue to fall away

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.080 align:middle line:90%
from the roof of your mouth.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And should you find you need
to swallow, just do that

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.930 align:middle line:84%
now and drift down and
down, deeper and deeper

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.060 align:middle line:90%
into blissful relaxation.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.630 align:middle line:90%


00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.390 align:middle line:84%
The more you physically
relax, the more

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.600 align:middle line:90%
you can mentally relax.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And when you can
mentally relax, you

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.780 align:middle line:90%
can think much more clearly.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And when you think more clearly,
your life becomes clearer,

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.750 align:middle line:84%
you make better decisions,
and you're much more

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.055 align:middle line:90%
in control of your days.

00:05:32.055 --> 00:05:36.100 align:middle line:90%


00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.870 align:middle line:84%
So noticing now how
your neck feels.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Relaxing all the little muscles,
letting go of the strain,

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.840 align:middle line:90%
letting go of the tension.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.900 align:middle line:90%


00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.730 align:middle line:84%
Allow that tension that you
may be holding in your shoulder

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.760 align:middle line:90%
to go now.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Feel those shoulders,
both of them,

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.470 align:middle line:84%
sinking into the
frame of your body.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Feel your neck lengthen
as you do this.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.140 align:middle line:90%


00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Feel or imagine all your
cares and worries just

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.240 align:middle line:84%
rolling off your shoulders now
as you take the relaxation down

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:26.500 align:middle line:84%
now into the tops of your
arms, letting any tension you

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.720 align:middle line:90%
may be holding just drain away.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.370 align:middle line:90%


00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And as your awareness flows
down through your upper arms,

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:42.660 align:middle line:84%
into your elbows, all the
muscles in your forearms

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:50.390 align:middle line:84%
relax, right down to your
wrists and into your hands.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:54.155 align:middle line:84%
And way down into the very tips
of your fingers and thumbs.

00:06:54.155 --> 00:06:58.080 align:middle line:90%


00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.770 align:middle line:90%
Your arms are feeling so heavy.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.590 align:middle line:90%
Your body's so comfortable.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.740 align:middle line:90%


00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.280 align:middle line:84%
Nothing whatsoever
to do but just

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.950 align:middle line:84%
relax and enjoy this feeling
of total release now.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:20.920 align:middle line:90%


00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.710 align:middle line:84%
As you let go of all the
tension in those muscles,

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:32.010 align:middle line:84%
you may experience them becoming
calmer and gently releasing.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.950 align:middle line:90%


00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And just tune into the
feeling of simply letting go.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.410 align:middle line:90%


00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.010 align:middle line:84%
As you become aware
of your breathing,

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:53.390 align:middle line:84%
notice that you are now
breathing steadily and slowly,

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.090 align:middle line:90%
rhythmically.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And with each exhale,
you feel yourself just

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:04.420 align:middle line:84%
relaxing even more
deeply, allowing

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:10.010 align:middle line:84%
any tension in the chest area
now to simply drain away.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:13.415 align:middle line:84%
Letting go completely
and totally.

00:08:13.415 --> 00:08:16.480 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Bring awareness into
your stomach now,

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:25.820 align:middle line:84%
and let all your
stomach muscles relax.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And as you do, I
want you to imagine

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:32.470 align:middle line:84%
a pool of sunlight passing
down from the top of your head

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:37.230 align:middle line:84%
down through your face, your
throat, and into your stomach.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:41.159 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:44.310 align:middle line:84%
Visualize this healing
energy passing down

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:49.430 align:middle line:84%
through your throat and
chest and into your stomach.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:53.240 align:middle line:90%


00:08:53.240 --> 00:09:00.540 align:middle line:84%
So see and feel the sunlight
swirling and rotating.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And as the light glows, it
moves and soothes and heals.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And you release and
relax and drift down.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.280 align:middle line:90%
And further down.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.230 align:middle line:90%


00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And in your imagination,
you send the sunlight out

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.640 align:middle line:84%
now to every nerve cell,
bone, muscle, fiber,

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.270 align:middle line:90%
and system of the body.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.440 align:middle line:84%
See it flowing through
the bloodstream

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.365 align:middle line:90%
and leave the light there.

00:09:37.365 --> 00:09:43.120 align:middle line:84%
It knows what to do as
you take the relaxation

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.890 align:middle line:90%
round into your back muscles.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And from your back muscles,
it relaxes those muscles

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:54.300 align:middle line:90%
either the side of the spine.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:10:01.710 align:middle line:84%
Releasing, relaxing,
and just letting go now.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:03.500 align:middle line:90%
Deeper and deeper now.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:08.380 align:middle line:90%


00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.990 align:middle line:84%
As you relax your
waist and the muscles

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:17.290 align:middle line:84%
of your lower stomach, and
down into the pelvic area, all

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:19.210 align:middle line:84%
the way down through
the large thigh

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:24.610 align:middle line:84%
muscles, down through
your knees, your shins

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:31.180 align:middle line:84%
and your calves, just to
allow those areas of the body

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.650 align:middle line:90%
to relax and let go.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:40.040 align:middle line:90%


00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.730 align:middle line:90%
You're so relaxed.

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:45.000 align:middle line:90%
So heavy, so comfortable.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.290 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And now, tune into that
comfortable feeling

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:59.350 align:middle line:84%
as you think on down to
your ankles, into your feet,

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:01.925 align:middle line:84%
right down to the very
tips of your toes.

00:11:01.925 --> 00:11:04.930 align:middle line:90%


00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:10.120 align:middle line:84%
All the muscles of your body
now so beautifully relaxed

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:16.630 align:middle line:84%
and you feel very heavy
and very comfortable.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:21.955 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling centered and
relaxed and fully in control.

00:11:21.955 --> 00:11:27.800 align:middle line:90%


00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.870 align:middle line:84%
If there are any
areas of your body

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:32.960 align:middle line:84%
that still feel
tight or tense, you

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.350 align:middle line:84%
find that you can relax them
simply by giving yourself

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:37.840 align:middle line:90%
permission to do so.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.840 align:middle line:90%


00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.995 align:middle line:84%
And you can now go even deeper
as I count down from 8 to 0.

00:11:45.995 --> 00:11:48.860 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And with every number, you
feel yourself drifting further

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.260 align:middle line:90%
into blissful relaxation.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.550 align:middle line:90%


00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:19.890 align:middle line:84%
So 8, 7, 6, 5, deeper
now, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0.

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Deeply relaxed, letting go of
all the cares and worries, all

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.490 align:middle line:84%
the tension and pressure
and stresses and strains.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:32.110 align:middle line:90%


00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Let them all ease from your
body and ease from your mind.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And allow yourself to drift down
into a deeper, more blissful

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.810 align:middle line:90%
state of creative relaxation.

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:54.080 align:middle line:90%


00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.200 align:middle line:84%
For a while now, you've
been feeling some anxiety

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.830 align:middle line:84%
and worry when you've been
asked to present or deliver

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:01.700 align:middle line:90%
a public speech.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:05.040 align:middle line:90%


00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.910 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you previously
tripped over words

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.160 align:middle line:84%
or felt like the
palms of your hands

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.770 align:middle line:84%
were sweating or a
little bit shaky.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And that adrenaline
is perfectly normal.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.350 align:middle line:84%
But from now on in, you want to
take control of those feelings.

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:24.790 align:middle line:90%


00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:28.420 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if someone
from deep, deep inside of you

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:33.260 align:middle line:84%
has now flipped a
switch, reset a dial,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.360 align:middle line:84%
changed a thermostat
of some kind,

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:40.480 align:middle line:84%
easily allowing you to
become and remain cool, calm,

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:45.100 align:middle line:84%
and collected in your thoughts
and physically pre, post,

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.892 align:middle line:84%
and during presenting or
public speaking moments.

00:13:47.892 --> 00:13:51.830 align:middle line:90%


00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.600 align:middle line:84%
From now on in, presenting
in public speaking

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:58.480 align:middle line:84%
makes you feel calm,
persuasive, determined,

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.670 align:middle line:84%
in control, confident,
and convincing.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.760 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.390 align:middle line:84%
You are able to convey all
your points articulately

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:12.700 align:middle line:90%
and comfortably and with ease.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.930 align:middle line:90%


00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:20.570 align:middle line:84%
Your heart rate, body, and
skin are all calm, soothing,

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:21.980 align:middle line:90%
rhythmic, and balanced.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:25.680 align:middle line:90%


00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:30.730 align:middle line:84%
You release and forgive
all past blockages.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:34.360 align:middle line:84%
Uncomfortable memories
of previous presentations

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:39.080 align:middle line:84%
or public speaking moments
are forgiven now and released.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.500 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.620 align:middle line:84%
You're now moving into a
brighter and more brilliant

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:51.630 align:middle line:84%
future, easily able to
express yourself articulately

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:56.820 align:middle line:84%
with grace, poise, skill,
and ease, whilst easily

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:01.080 align:middle line:84%
generating interest for
all who hear words and gain

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:05.100 align:middle line:84%
from your knowledge, especially
when you have to give a speech,

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.520 align:middle line:90%
whether online or in person.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.520 align:middle line:84%
From now on in, you
feel calm and relaxed.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:15.310 align:middle line:90%


00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:17.260 align:middle line:84%
You give powerful
public speaking

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.585 align:middle line:84%
performances that
captivate your audience.

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:22.760 align:middle line:90%


00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Each person is
there to hear you.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:26.990 align:middle line:84%
They're there to
be your supporter

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:30.400 align:middle line:90%
and willing you to do well.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.730 align:middle line:84%
They want to hear your opinion,
your views, and the information

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:36.090 align:middle line:90%
you pass on.

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:38.140 align:middle line:84%
They're not necessarily
looking at you.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:41.490 align:middle line:84%
They're listening to your
words, interested in what

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:44.040 align:middle line:90%
you have to say.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Your old feelings of
anxiety and nervousness

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:51.600 align:middle line:84%
are now replaced with
excitement and enthusiasm

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.420 align:middle line:84%
as you realize what a
great opportunity this is

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.490 align:middle line:90%
for you and your career.

00:15:55.490 --> 00:16:00.010 align:middle line:90%


00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:02.140 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
imagine that you're

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:05.500 align:middle line:84%
about to give a
presentation or speech.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.780 align:middle line:84%
You feel relaxed
and calm, and you've

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:11.350 align:middle line:90%
prepared well for this day.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:14.880 align:middle line:84%
You've rehearsed and you know
what you're going to say.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.610 align:middle line:84%
You know your
subject matter well.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:20.510 align:middle line:84%
You're an expert in
this field, and that's

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.460 align:middle line:84%
why you've been asked
to talk in front

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.270 align:middle line:90%
of a group of people about it.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And you're excited to
share that information.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:30.440 align:middle line:90%


00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.240 align:middle line:84%
You've been through
your presentation

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.540 align:middle line:90%
repeatedly in your mind.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.340 align:middle line:84%
You have learned
it off by heart,

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.980 align:middle line:84%
because you have vocalized
it over and over again

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:43.730 align:middle line:84%
without notes, so your
script is now firmly embedded

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:47.360 align:middle line:90%
in your subconscious brain.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.820 align:middle line:84%
You feel confident,
excited, and ready.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.250 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:58.300 align:middle line:84%
As you speak, you're perfectly
poised, self-possessed,

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.720 align:middle line:84%
and completely free
in your expression.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:05.069 align:middle line:90%


00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:08.220 align:middle line:84%
You feel at ease, and
you present your ideas

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.520 align:middle line:84%
in a clear, brief,
and direct way.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.569 align:middle line:90%


00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is clear
and your wit is quick.

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Your lips are flexible
and your mouth is moist.

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Your breathing is deep
and from the diaphragm.

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:28.660 align:middle line:90%


00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:32.420 align:middle line:90%
Your hands are poised and calm.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Your gestures flow
spontaneously and freely.

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:40.090 align:middle line:90%


00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:44.135 align:middle line:84%
You speak easily, always giving
a clear picture of the thoughts

00:17:44.135 --> 00:17:44.935 align:middle line:90%
you want to convey.

00:17:44.935 --> 00:17:48.910 align:middle line:90%


00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.700 align:middle line:84%
You're secure and
confident as you speak,

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.760 align:middle line:90%
and you feel relaxed and calm.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.590 align:middle line:90%


00:17:56.590 --> 00:18:00.015 align:middle line:84%
You're totally confident
and perfectly at ease.

00:18:00.015 --> 00:18:03.890 align:middle line:90%


00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And as you begin to talk, you
have the undivided attention

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:08.330 align:middle line:90%
of your audience.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:09.740 align:middle line:90%
And it makes you feel good.

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:14.370 align:middle line:90%


00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:19.620 align:middle line:84%
You speak freely, fluidly,
with a full release

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.180 align:middle line:90%
of your skill and your talent.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:25.440 align:middle line:90%


00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:30.190 align:middle line:84%
As you talk to the audience
in a natural, easy way,

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:33.055 align:middle line:84%
you're aware of just how
powerful your voice sounds.

00:18:33.055 --> 00:18:35.750 align:middle line:90%


00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:39.590 align:middle line:84%
You're talking clearly
and making yourself heard,

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:41.960 align:middle line:84%
but your words seem
to flow as you impart

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.720 align:middle line:84%
the information in the way
you've prepared and rehearsed

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.580 align:middle line:84%
speaking with clarity
and calm confidence.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:52.810 align:middle line:90%


00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Any nerves you had beforehand,
you turn into excitement.

00:18:56.430 --> 00:19:01.880 align:middle line:90%


00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.980 align:middle line:84%
You say to yourself,
I'm excited.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.080 align:middle line:90%
I can do this.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited.

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you jump up
and down to release

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:12.090 align:middle line:90%
some of that adrenaline.

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:14.410 align:middle line:90%
Let it out.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Turn that nervous feeling
into excitement now.

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Use that adrenaline
to your advantage.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Allow yourself to be so
excited to tell your audience

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:29.090 align:middle line:90%
everything that you have to say.

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:35.270 align:middle line:90%


00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Your speech is coming
to a close now,

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.860 align:middle line:84%
so you invite your
audience to ask questions.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:45.330 align:middle line:84%
You welcome these questions
as an even greater opportunity

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.190 align:middle line:84%
to demonstrate how you think
and feel about your subject.

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:52.590 align:middle line:90%


00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:56.610 align:middle line:84%
See yourself now, and you're
at the end of the presentation.

00:19:56.610 --> 00:20:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And you feel a great sense
of pride and achievement

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.460 align:middle line:90%
and satisfaction.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.550 align:middle line:90%
You've done a great job.

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:08.890 align:middle line:84%
You congratulate yourself,
knowing that next time you

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:11.920 align:middle line:84%
do a presentation
or give a speech,

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.820 align:middle line:84%
you will do so with even more
ease, with more confidence,

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:16.955 align:middle line:90%
and with great success.

00:20:16.955 --> 00:20:19.720 align:middle line:90%


00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.370 align:middle line:90%
You are a great presenter.

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:24.090 align:middle line:90%


00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:28.890 align:middle line:84%
You are confident and in control
at all times when presenting.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:32.920 align:middle line:90%


00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.900 align:middle line:84%
If you feel those
nerves arising,

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.880 align:middle line:90%
you turn that into excitement.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Jump up and down before
giving your speech.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.440 align:middle line:90%
Use that adrenaline.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:45.600 align:middle line:84%
Burn it off and use
it when presenting.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.400 align:middle line:84%
The excitement
will show when you

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:51.320 align:middle line:90%
deliver your speech or talk.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:56.543 align:middle line:84%
You are confident and in control
at all times when presenting.

00:20:56.543 --> 00:21:00.000 align:middle line:90%


00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.900 align:middle line:84%

more and more powerful

alert, and feeling
fantastic, bringing back

Eyes open when you're ready.
