00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to
House of Wellbeing.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.610 align:middle line:84%
You are listening to the
"Creativity and Ideas" MindTALK

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.500 align:middle line:90%
audio.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.810 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.370 align:middle line:84%
But before it
does, I'd just like

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.280 align:middle line:84%
to remind you that the
following audio contains

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.980 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.900 align:middle line:90%
aim to cause deep relaxation.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.680 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.110 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.840 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.220 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.582 align:middle line:84%
will alert you and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:51.582 --> 00:00:53.790 align:middle line:84%
But right now, there's
nothing at all you need to do,

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.040 align:middle line:84%
apart from close your
eyes, relax, and let go.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And really enjoy these peaceful
feelings and all the benefits

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.940 align:middle line:90%
that come with it.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.810 align:middle line:84%
Make yourself as
comfortable as possible,

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.225 align:middle line:84%
and concentrate on
the sound of my voice.

00:01:09.225 --> 00:01:11.970 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And begin by drawing in a
long, slow, deep breath,

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.160 align:middle line:90%
in through your nose.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.210 align:middle line:90%
Hold the breath for a moment.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And now, slightly
open your mouth

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.480 align:middle line:84%
and release all the
air from your body

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.170 align:middle line:90%
in a long, low, deep sigh.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And relax, allowing your
lungs to naturally deflate

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.890 align:middle line:84%
as your body sinks into
gentle relaxation now.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.700 align:middle line:90%


00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.770 align:middle line:90%
And you can release any tension.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Relax and let go as I
guide you through a journey

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.800 align:middle line:84%
of relaxation, a journey that
you will find very beneficial

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.460 align:middle line:90%
for your overall well-being.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.810 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.690 align:middle line:84%
You're going to start
this calming experience

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.885 align:middle line:84%
by first relaxing your
whole body-mind system.

00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:18.630 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's true to say that the
simple act of relaxing the body

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.310 align:middle line:84%
and mind has a positive knock-on
effect, because how you think

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.550 align:middle line:90%
determines how you feel.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And how you feel influences
the world around you.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And how you choose
to think today

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.890 align:middle line:84%
affects your decisions
from here on in.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.530 align:middle line:84%
So to make my
assurances your reality,

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.580 align:middle line:84%
let's begin by
focusing your attention

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.960 align:middle line:90%
at the very top of your head.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Tension often starts at
the scalp and the neck.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.040 align:middle line:84%
So mentally and physically,
allow all the muscles

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.730 align:middle line:84%
around the top of your
head to relax now,

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.590 align:middle line:84%
letting all the
tension simply dissolve

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.680 align:middle line:84%
as you start to tune into
your body-mind system.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.850 align:middle line:90%


00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:33.270 align:middle line:84%
Just let any tension you may
be holding to release now.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Allow your brain to relax,
the left and the right

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.530 align:middle line:84%
lobes of the brain
just releasing.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Such a simple thought, yet so
profound and so significant.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Just letting go
completely, drifting

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.280 align:middle line:90%
further and further down.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.530 align:middle line:90%
Nobody wanting anything.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.250 align:middle line:90%
Nobody needing anything.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.980 align:middle line:90%
This is your time to relax.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.690 align:middle line:90%


00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Taking the relaxation
into the face

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:15.350 align:middle line:84%
now, allowing all of your
facial muscles to feel loose.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:21.009 align:middle line:84%
Feel your brow relaxing,
your forehead smoothing out,

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:23.255 align:middle line:84%
and the back of
your eyes relaxing.

00:04:23.255 --> 00:04:26.060 align:middle line:90%


00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Tiny muscles around
your eyes and eyelids,

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.700 align:middle line:84%
down into your cheeks and
into your jaw muscles,

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.680 align:middle line:90%
just releasing and letting go.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.540 align:middle line:90%


00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Allowing your
tongue to fall away

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.820 align:middle line:90%
from the roof of your mouth.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And should you find you need
to swallow, just do that

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.670 align:middle line:84%
now and drift down and
down, deeper and deeper,

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.790 align:middle line:90%
into blissful relaxation.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.360 align:middle line:90%


00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.120 align:middle line:84%
The more you physically
relax, the more

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.360 align:middle line:90%
you can mentally relax.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And when you can
mentally relax, you

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.550 align:middle line:90%
can think much more clearly.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And when you think more clearly,
your life becomes clearer,

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.520 align:middle line:84%
you make better decisions,
and you're much more

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.805 align:middle line:90%
in control of your days.

00:05:23.805 --> 00:05:27.840 align:middle line:90%


00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.360 align:middle line:84%
So noticing now how your
neck feels, relaxing

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.420 align:middle line:90%
all the little muscles.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Letting go of the strain,
letting go of the tension.

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.630 align:middle line:90%


00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Allow that tension that you
may be holding in your shoulder

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.520 align:middle line:90%
to go now.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Feel those shoulders,
both of them,

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.230 align:middle line:84%
sinking into the
frame of your body.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Feel your neck lengthen
as you do this.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.880 align:middle line:90%


00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Feel or imagine all your
cares and worries just

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:11.990 align:middle line:84%
rolling off your shoulders now
as you take the relaxation down

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:18.240 align:middle line:84%
now into the tops of your
arms, letting any tension you

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.520 align:middle line:90%
may be holding just drain away.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.100 align:middle line:90%


00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And as your awareness floats
down through your upper arms,

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.190 align:middle line:90%
into your elbows.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:37.530 align:middle line:84%
All the muscles in your
forearms relax, right down

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:42.120 align:middle line:84%
to your wrists and
into your hands,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.885 align:middle line:84%
and way down into the very tips
of your fingers and thumbs.

00:06:45.885 --> 00:06:49.820 align:middle line:90%


00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.510 align:middle line:90%
Your arms are feeling so heavy.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.390 align:middle line:90%
Your body's so comfortable.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.440 align:middle line:90%


00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.010 align:middle line:84%
Nothing whatsoever
to do but just

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:06.740 align:middle line:84%
relax and enjoy this feeling
of total release now.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:12.650 align:middle line:90%


00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:17.450 align:middle line:84%
As you let go of all the
tension in those muscles,

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:23.780 align:middle line:84%
you may experience them becoming
calmer and gently releasing.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.720 align:middle line:90%


00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And just tune into the
feeling of simply letting go.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:34.140 align:middle line:90%


00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.740 align:middle line:84%
As you become aware
of your breathing,

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:45.070 align:middle line:84%
notice that you are now
breathing steadily and slowly,

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.860 align:middle line:90%
rhythmically.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And with each exhale,
you feel yourself

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:56.170 align:middle line:84%
just relaxing even
more deeply, allowing

00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:01.720 align:middle line:84%
any tension in the chest area
now to simply drain away,

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.200 align:middle line:84%
letting go completely
and totally.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.630 align:middle line:90%


00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Bring awareness into
your stomach now.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And let all your
tummy muscles relax.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And as you do, I
want you to imagine

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:25.800 align:middle line:84%
a ball of sunlight passing
down from the top of your head

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.800 align:middle line:84%
down through your face, your
throat, and into your stomach.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.750 align:middle line:90%


00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Visualize this healing
energy passing down

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:42.830 align:middle line:84%
through your throat and
chest and into your stomach.

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:46.840 align:middle line:90%


00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:54.100 align:middle line:84%
So see and feel the sunlight
swirling and rotating.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:09:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And as the light glows, it
warms and soothes and heals.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And you release and
relax and drift down.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:06.930 align:middle line:90%
And further down.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:11.840 align:middle line:90%


00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And in your imagination,
you send the sunlight out

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:21.220 align:middle line:84%
now to every nerve cell,
bone, muscle, fiber,

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.830 align:middle line:90%
and system of the body.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:28.020 align:middle line:84%
See it flowing through
the bloodstream,

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.200 align:middle line:90%
and leave the light there.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:36.760 align:middle line:84%
It knows what to do as
you take the relaxation

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.480 align:middle line:90%
round into your back muscles.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And from your back muscles,
it relaxes those muscles

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.870 align:middle line:90%
either side of the spine.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:52.940 align:middle line:84%
Releasing, relaxing,
and just letting

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:57.090 align:middle line:90%
go now, deeper and deeper now.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:01.960 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:07.180 align:middle line:84%
As you relax your waist and the
muscles of your lower stomach,

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.900 align:middle line:84%
and down into the
pelvic area, all

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:14.800 align:middle line:84%
the way down through
the large thigh muscles,

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:22.140 align:middle line:84%
down through your knees,
your shins, and your calves,

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:28.125 align:middle line:84%
just to allow all those areas
of the body to relax and let go.

00:10:28.125 --> 00:10:33.480 align:middle line:90%


00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:38.630 align:middle line:84%
You're so relaxed, so
heavy, so comfortable.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.820 align:middle line:90%


00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And now, tune into that
comfortable feeling

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:52.930 align:middle line:84%
as you think on down to
your ankles, into your feet,

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:55.510 align:middle line:84%
right down to the very
tips of your toes.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:58.470 align:middle line:90%


00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:03.600 align:middle line:84%
All the muscles of your body
now so beautifully relaxed.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And you feel very heavy
and very comfortable.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling centered and
relaxed and fully in control.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:21.360 align:middle line:90%


00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.460 align:middle line:84%
If there are any
areas of your body

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.520 align:middle line:84%
that still feel
tight or tense, you

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.940 align:middle line:84%
find that you can relax them
simply by giving yourself

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.255 align:middle line:90%
permission to do so.

00:11:31.255 --> 00:11:35.430 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:39.585 align:middle line:84%
And you can now go even deeper
as I count down from 8 to 0.

00:11:39.585 --> 00:11:42.400 align:middle line:90%


00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And with every number, you
feel yourself drifting further

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:47.890 align:middle line:90%
into blissful relaxation.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:51.130 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:54.210 align:middle line:90%
So 8.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:12:13.440 align:middle line:84%
7, 6, 5, deeper now,
4, 3, 2, 1, and 0.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Deeply relaxed, letting go of
all the cares and worries, all

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.085 align:middle line:84%
the tension and pressure
and stresses and strains.

00:12:23.085 --> 00:12:25.700 align:middle line:90%


00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Let them all ease from your
body and ease from your mind.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And allow yourself to drift down
into a deeper and more blissful

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:39.420 align:middle line:90%
state of creative relaxation.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:45.080 align:middle line:90%


00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, in your
imagination, I'd like

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:49.130 align:middle line:84%
you to imagine that
you're standing

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:54.470 align:middle line:84%
on the top of a hill
on a beautiful island.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's a lovely,
warm, summer's day.

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.990 align:middle line:90%
There's a clear blue sky.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:03.690 align:middle line:90%
Not a cloud in sight.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And the temperature is
just how you like it.

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:09.380 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:13.010 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the gentle
warmth of the sun on your head

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:15.200 align:middle line:90%
and shoulders.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can hear
the sounds of nature

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.825 align:middle line:84%
all around you, making you
feel even more relaxed.

00:13:20.825 --> 00:13:26.390 align:middle line:90%


00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:31.160 align:middle line:84%
The long grass in the
meadow below sways slightly,

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.410 align:middle line:84%
and you can see a
winding path that

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:36.860 align:middle line:84%
disappears into a
small apple orchard,

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.590 align:middle line:90%
just at the bottom of the hill.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.810 align:middle line:90%


00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And just beyond the
orchard, you can

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.200 align:middle line:84%
see the sea, the
sunlight darting off

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.650 align:middle line:84%
the tops of the waves,
and the whole ocean

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:53.360 align:middle line:90%
shimmering and sparkling.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:57.580 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:02.760 align:middle line:84%
You begin to move easily
down the path now,

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:07.290 align:middle line:84%
noticing the grass
springing under your feet,

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:10.710 align:middle line:84%
pushing you encouragingly
towards your destination.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:14.230 align:middle line:90%


00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And you catch the faint smell
of sea air in the breeze

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:24.735 align:middle line:84%
as you get closer to the
ocean now, as you stroll down,

00:14:24.735 --> 00:14:30.780 align:middle line:84%
down the winding path and
you move smoothly and easily.

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And you feel relaxed and
centered and fully in control.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:40.160 align:middle line:90%


00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And you're becoming aware now
of a growing calm within you.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.600 align:middle line:90%


00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.780 align:middle line:84%
You stop to look at the
beautiful flowers growing

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:57.990 align:middle line:84%
each side of the path, their
colors so vivid and bright.

00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And you stand there for a
moment, taking in the view.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:06.920 align:middle line:84%
A feeling of happiness flows
through you, continuing down.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:12.560 align:middle line:90%


00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:19.970 align:middle line:84%
You're aware now of a deep sense
of calmness and tranquility,

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:24.200 align:middle line:84%
right from the top of your
head to the tips of your toes,

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.780 align:middle line:84%
renewing your energy,
feeling wonderful.

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.170 align:middle line:90%


00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:33.200 align:middle line:84%
As you walk, you find
yourself almost floating,

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.425 align:middle line:84%
as though in a dream world,
down towards the orchard.

00:15:36.425 --> 00:15:39.910 align:middle line:90%


00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:44.810 align:middle line:84%
You move with such ease,
with no effort whatsoever.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And in no time,
you find yourself

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.920 align:middle line:84%
drifting through
the fruit trees,

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:56.880 align:middle line:84%
with a lush, cool, green foliage
forming a canopy overhead.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And you see the
sunlight glittering

00:15:59.070 --> 00:15:59.955 align:middle line:90%
through the branches.

00:15:59.955 --> 00:16:04.430 align:middle line:90%


00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And as you stand there, you
feel a glittering sunlight

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:11.660 align:middle line:90%
on your face and neck.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And you feel and
experience it vibrating

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:16.895 align:middle line:84%
throughout your entire
body-mind system.

00:16:16.895 --> 00:16:22.120 align:middle line:90%


00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And as the sunlight moves, it
glows and warms and soothes

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:31.180 align:middle line:90%
and heals your body and mind.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And you release and relax
and move down and down,

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:42.420 align:middle line:84%
taking in another deep breath,
relaxing even more now.

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:47.640 align:middle line:90%


00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.830 align:middle line:84%
You can hear the
sound of the ocean

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:53.070 align:middle line:90%
as you move nearer and nearer.

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And with every
step you take, you

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:59.730 align:middle line:84%
feel more relaxed
and more calm as you

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:03.740 align:middle line:84%
follow that winding path
that leads you downwards.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.089 align:middle line:90%


00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:09.910 align:middle line:84%
You turn a corner
and to your delight,

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:13.465 align:middle line:84%
you find yourself on a
beautiful deserted beach.

00:17:13.465 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:90%


00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:21.230 align:middle line:84%
The beach sweeping away into
a small bay in front of you.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And the ocean is a striking
turquoise blue, pure and clear.

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel the warm
sand underneath your shoes.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And you take your
shoes off and you

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:40.880 align:middle line:84%
start walking lazily across
the beach to the water's edge.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.680 align:middle line:90%


00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.980 align:middle line:84%
You feel the sand
beneath your feet,

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:50.970 align:middle line:84%
and you feel the
sand change from cool

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.710 align:middle line:84%
to moist beneath your feet as
you wander along the shoreline.

00:17:54.710 --> 00:18:00.220 align:middle line:90%


00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.620 align:middle line:84%
As you turn around,
you start to walk up

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:07.060 align:middle line:84%
the beach towards
a grassy mound.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And as you walk up slowly, you
take in the smell of the ocean.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And you hear the
sounds of the water

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.015 align:middle line:90%
hissing over the warm sound.

00:18:18.015 --> 00:18:22.080 align:middle line:90%


00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.410 align:middle line:84%
You reach the mound
now and you sit down,

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.150 align:middle line:90%
making yourself comfortable.

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.980 align:middle line:90%


00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And as you gaze out across
the breathtaking scene,

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:39.640 align:middle line:84%
you watch the waves roll
in and roll out again,

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.910 align:middle line:90%
rhythmically in and out again.

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:48.830 align:middle line:90%


00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:52.130 align:middle line:84%
You play with the sand
through your fingers,

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:55.520 align:middle line:90%
noticing just how good you feel.

00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:00.870 align:middle line:84%
So relaxed now, so relaxed
that you've opened up

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:03.570 align:middle line:84%
your subconscious
mind and you're

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:06.690 align:middle line:84%
ready to start making those
changes you've been wanting

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:08.520 align:middle line:90%
to make once and for all.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.810 align:middle line:90%


00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And you know that rarely do
brilliant ideas appear out

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:16.610 align:middle line:90%
of the blue.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:19.210 align:middle line:90%


00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:25.720 align:middle line:84%
They take time, consideration,
and more than a little effort

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.540 align:middle line:90%
to develop.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.300 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have to
be a creative genius

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:34.290 align:middle line:90%
to come up with them.

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:37.760 align:middle line:84%
You just need to train
yourself to think creatively.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.300 align:middle line:90%


00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, creativity is
just about connecting things.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And the more things we
have to connect with,

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.405 align:middle line:84%
the better our
ideas will become.

00:19:51.405 --> 00:19:55.340 align:middle line:90%


00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:59.960 align:middle line:84%
This means the quality and
quantity of things we consume

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.470 align:middle line:84%
is a crucial factor
in our ability

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.025 align:middle line:90%
to come up with a good idea.

00:20:05.025 --> 00:20:09.580 align:middle line:90%


00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.860 align:middle line:84%
So you start to
pay more attention

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:16.780 align:middle line:84%
to the books, TV shows,
articles, and movies

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:21.700 align:middle line:84%
you consume, the people
you interact with,

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:27.400 align:middle line:84%
the places you visit, and
the experiences that you have

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.880 align:middle line:84%
that you know will influence
the ideas that you generate.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:34.510 align:middle line:90%


00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:38.500 align:middle line:84%
You have a new
curiosity and thirst

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:43.000 align:middle line:84%
to consume yourself with
knowledge and information

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.410 align:middle line:84%
to help fuel your creativity
and to come up with new ideas.

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:52.910 align:middle line:90%


00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And ideas come to us when they
want to, not necessarily when

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:01.610 align:middle line:90%
we want them to.

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you start
to recognize ideas that

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:10.100 align:middle line:84%
pop into your head and
constantly come to you,

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.640 align:middle line:84%
so you can now get in the habit
of acknowledging and capturing

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.900 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Maybe quickly writing
them down, making a note

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.130 align:middle line:90%
so you don't forget them.

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:25.090 align:middle line:90%


00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
these ideas, you

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:30.840 align:middle line:84%
feel confident in
talking about them,

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:36.290 align:middle line:84%
speaking your ideas out loud,
expressing them to people

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:37.790 align:middle line:90%
in your team or in a meeting.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:42.040 align:middle line:90%


00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:46.240 align:middle line:84%
You know their feedback will
help us clarify the idea

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.330 align:middle line:90%
and help to see it in a new way.

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:52.440 align:middle line:90%


00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:58.770 align:middle line:84%
You start to ask more questions,
listening to people's answers,

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:04.480 align:middle line:84%
as this help leads to new ideas,
giving you different angles

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.040 align:middle line:90%
and layers to build upon.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:11.060 align:middle line:90%


00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.550 align:middle line:84%
You know that the
most valuable ideas

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:18.290 align:middle line:84%
are ones that solve
problems for people,

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:22.250 align:middle line:84%
so you start to think about
