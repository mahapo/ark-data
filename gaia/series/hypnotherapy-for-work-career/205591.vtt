00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to
House of Wellbeing.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.100 align:middle line:10%
You are listening to the Memory
and Concentration mind talk

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.790 align:middle line:10%
audio.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.620 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.900 align:middle line:84%
But before it does,
I'd like to remind you

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.730 align:middle line:84%
that the following
audio contains

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.910 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.000 align:middle line:84%
aim to help you reach a
deep level of relaxation.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.850 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.270 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.810 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.860 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.160 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.192 align:middle line:84%
will alert you and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:51.192 --> 00:00:53.400 align:middle line:84%
But right now, there's
nothing at all you need to do,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.610 align:middle line:84%
apart from close your
eyes, relax, and let go.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And enjoy those peaceful
feelings and all the benefits

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.470 align:middle line:90%
that come with it.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.340 align:middle line:90%


00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.610 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now
to make yourself

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.390 align:middle line:84%
as comfortable as
possible and listen

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.695 align:middle line:90%
to the sound of my voice.

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:14.130 align:middle line:90%


00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And as you do so, you may be
aware of other sounds going on

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.000 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.090 align:middle line:84%
But you know that
they're not important.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.730 align:middle line:84%
They don't matter at all,
and you can dismiss them out

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.740 align:middle line:84%
of your awareness and
focus your mind entirely

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.790 align:middle line:90%
on what I'm saying.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.770 align:middle line:90%


00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.000 align:middle line:84%
This is your time, and
you make the most of it.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.770 align:middle line:90%


00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.200 align:middle line:84%
No one needs or wants
anything from you at all.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.670 align:middle line:90%


00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to
take in a deep breath,

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.060 align:middle line:84%
filling your lungs
as much as you can.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.755 align:middle line:90%
And let it out slowly.

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:06.970 align:middle line:90%


00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And again, take in
a long, slow breath.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.650 align:middle line:90%


00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.865 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready,
let it out slowly.

00:02:15.865 --> 00:02:20.660 align:middle line:90%


00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.080 align:middle line:84%
Now you can allow your
breathing to return to normal.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Gentle breaths, in
and out, returning

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.995 align:middle line:84%
to your normal,
gentle, breathing pace.

00:02:35.995 --> 00:02:41.910 align:middle line:90%


00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now to
imagine yourself outside,

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.990 align:middle line:84%
in your favorite
place in nature.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.450 align:middle line:90%


00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a peaceful
tropical beach,

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.795 align:middle line:84%
or it could be a
beautiful garden.

00:02:56.795 --> 00:03:00.120 align:middle line:90%


00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can
imagine lying back

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.295 align:middle line:84%
on a boat, which is sailing
on a tranquil river.

00:03:05.295 --> 00:03:07.890 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.120 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't matter
where you are, as long

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.760 align:middle line:90%
as it feels good to you.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.190 align:middle line:90%


00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.575 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful day.

00:03:17.575 --> 00:03:20.280 align:middle line:90%


00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.400 align:middle line:84%
The sky is a special
shade of blue, so clear.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.610 align:middle line:90%
And it's a warm summer's day.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.410 align:middle line:90%


00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.210 align:middle line:84%
There's a breeze gently
blowing over you,

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.190 align:middle line:84%
and the temperature is
just how you like it.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:48.480 align:middle line:90%


00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And in the sky is
a dazzling sun,

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.030 align:middle line:84%
so bright that you just
want to close your eyes

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.550 align:middle line:84%
and feel the glowing, healing
warmth of the sun on your body.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.650 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly, you find
that you can direct that sun

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.470 align:middle line:90%
over and around your body.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And as you realize
this, you begin

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.659 align:middle line:84%
to direct the light from
the sun over your face.

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:24.850 align:middle line:90%


00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.690 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the healing
warmth of the light

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.060 align:middle line:84%
from the sun over your face,
just relaxing those muscles

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.995 align:middle line:84%
around the eyes, around the
nose and mouth, and your brow.

00:04:37.995 --> 00:04:41.700 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And as you do this, you find
that your facial muscles begin

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.100 align:middle line:90%
to flatten out as they relax.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.080 align:middle line:90%
And you let go completely.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.600 align:middle line:90%


00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.230 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful day.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.730 align:middle line:84%
You move the light from the
sun into the throat area,

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:09.120 align:middle line:84%
feeling the warmth of the light
from the sun in your throat.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.430 align:middle line:90%
Relaxing all the muscles.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.850 align:middle line:90%
Just letting go completely now.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:19.010 align:middle line:90%


00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And the warm sunlight now
moving into your shoulders

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.410 align:middle line:84%
and across your
shoulders, making them

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:35.590 align:middle line:84%
feel loose and limp
and comfortable

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.060 align:middle line:84%
as your shoulders sink into
the frame of your body.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.390 align:middle line:90%


00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:48.980 align:middle line:90%
And you feel so comfortable now.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.305 align:middle line:90%
So relaxed and at peace.

00:05:51.305 --> 00:05:54.820 align:middle line:90%


00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And you let nothing bother
or concern you at all.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.840 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And you direct the light from
the sun down your right arm,

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.820 align:middle line:84%
from the shoulders to
the tips of your fingers.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Your right arm begins
to relax and let go.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.200 align:middle line:90%


00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful feeling
to be here right now.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.690 align:middle line:90%


00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.810 align:middle line:84%
The warmth of the
light from the sun

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.040 align:middle line:84%
penetrates the nerves and bones
and muscles of that right arm.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.900 align:middle line:90%


00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's such a beautiful day.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.860 align:middle line:84%
You move the sun
over to your left arm

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:51.820 align:middle line:84%
and guide the light from the
sun down and up your left arm,

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.190 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your
shoulders all the way down

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.600 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your fingers.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.370 align:middle line:90%


00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:06.120 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the left arm
relaxing, becoming comfortably

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.955 align:middle line:90%
heavy and totally relaxed.

00:07:09.955 --> 00:07:15.430 align:middle line:90%


00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, move that warm light
across and into the chest area.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And relax the chest,
all the muscles there.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.380 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Now down to the stomach,
relaxing your tummy,

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:37.570 align:middle line:84%
down into your hips and your
thighs, over to your right leg.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:41.170 align:middle line:90%


00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:46.130 align:middle line:84%
The light warms the muscles
as you relax your right leg.

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Let it feel comfortable
and heavy now.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.720 align:middle line:90%


00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Now move the light
from the sun down

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.940 align:middle line:84%
your right leg, up
and down from the top

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:00.180 align:middle line:84%
of the hips to the
tips of your toes,

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:04.140 align:middle line:84%
as the right leg
relaxes and you let go.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:10.590 align:middle line:90%


00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's such a beautiful day.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:16.280 align:middle line:84%
You now move the light
into your left leg.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:22.040 align:middle line:84%
You move it up and down the left
leg, from the top of the hips

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.780 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And your left leg relaxes,
releasing tension,

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.350 align:middle line:90%
letting go now completely.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:35.590 align:middle line:90%


00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:42.289 align:middle line:84%
Your whole body is now totally
and completely relaxed,

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:45.050 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your
head all the way down

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:46.460 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:50.380 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And as your body relaxes,
your mind also relaxes.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:59.730 align:middle line:90%


00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And I want you now to
notice that the sun is

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:06.350 align:middle line:90%
setting, going down now.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.840 align:middle line:90%
Deeper and deeper down.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And you're so deeply
relaxed, but still completely

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.495 align:middle line:90%
alert and aware.

00:09:14.495 --> 00:09:17.660 align:middle line:90%


00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.930 align:middle line:84%
You resist the temptation
to fall asleep.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.140 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is thoroughly
relaxed, but you

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.860 align:middle line:90%
stay focused on these words.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:29.270 align:middle line:90%


00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:32.890 align:middle line:84%
So now, I'd like you to
use your imagination.

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And once again, you're in a
wonderful place in nature.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.980 align:middle line:84%
The trees are a
beautiful shade of green.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a stunning day, and the
sun is shining down on you.

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.520 align:middle line:90%


00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:52.360 align:middle line:84%
There's a soft and
gentle breeze in the air,

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.195 align:middle line:84%
making you feel pleasantly
relaxed and calm.

00:09:55.195 --> 00:09:58.760 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:02.050 align:middle line:84%
All around, you can
see trees and plants

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.660 align:middle line:84%
and an array of the
most beautiful flowers

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:08.190 align:middle line:90%
you have ever seen.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.610 align:middle line:90%
So colorful and vibrant.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And you can smell the rich
aroma of these flowers,

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.400 align:middle line:90%
making you feel so peaceful.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.830 align:middle line:90%


00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.650 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else matters right now.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.295 align:middle line:84%
You feel completely
at ease and so calm.

00:10:27.295 --> 00:10:30.450 align:middle line:90%


00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And in the distance, you
can hear the sound of water

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:35.405 align:middle line:90%
flowing slowly and gently.

00:10:35.405 --> 00:10:39.380 align:middle line:90%


00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.770 align:middle line:84%
The sound of water is helping
you to go more and more deeply

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:43.570 align:middle line:90%
relaxed.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:46.450 align:middle line:90%


00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:50.080 align:middle line:84%
You may feel your muscles
loosening more and more,

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.900 align:middle line:84%
relaxing with the beautiful
flowing sound of water.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:57.760 align:middle line:90%


00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Out of curiosity, you decide to
follow the sound of the water.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:03.940 align:middle line:90%


00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And you feel excited about where
it's leading you, knowing deep

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:13.430 align:middle line:84%
within yourself you're going
to a very special place,

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.070 align:middle line:84%
a place where you're
going to create

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:18.340 align:middle line:84%
some positive, wonderful,
long-lasting changes.

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:22.710 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:27.040 align:middle line:84%
As you walk slowly
towards the water,

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:32.050 align:middle line:84%
you can hear the sound of
birds singing in the trees.

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:33.775 align:middle line:90%
You feel totally at ease.

00:11:33.775 --> 00:11:37.650 align:middle line:90%


00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:40.820 align:middle line:84%
As you finally
reach the lake, you

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:45.530 align:middle line:84%
realize it's the most beautiful
vision you've ever seen.

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And you're in awe of the
beauty that surrounds you.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:52.380 align:middle line:90%


00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.860 align:middle line:84%
The vast lake is
filled with a variety

00:11:54.860 --> 00:12:01.940 align:middle line:84%
of colors, rich colors of blues,
turquoise, and light greens.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And it fills your mind and
body with a wave of relaxation.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.500 align:middle line:90%


00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:12.180 align:middle line:84%
You may be becoming more relaxed
with each and every breath

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:20.430 align:middle line:84%
you take, feeling more calm,
more peaceful, and more

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:21.955 align:middle line:90%
relaxed than ever before.

00:12:21.955 --> 00:12:25.720 align:middle line:90%


00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.560 align:middle line:84%
Your mind may be
drifting in and out,

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:34.300 align:middle line:84%
just letting go deeper
and deeper still.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:39.170 align:middle line:84%
You may feel as though your
mind is flowing gently,

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:42.160 align:middle line:84%
flowing gently, like the
lake in your imagination.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.810 align:middle line:90%


00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:49.040 align:middle line:84%
You look into the distance and
you can see a wooden bridge

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.330 align:middle line:90%
leading over the lake.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.130 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.820 align:middle line:84%
You walk towards the bridge,
feeling more and more

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:56.855 align:middle line:90%
deeply relaxed.

00:12:56.855 --> 00:12:59.470 align:middle line:90%


00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:01.230 align:middle line:84%
As you reach the
bridge, you can see

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:04.710 align:middle line:84%
there are 10 steps leading over
to the other side of the lake.

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:08.950 align:middle line:90%


00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:12.640 align:middle line:84%
You slowly start
walking over the bridge,

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.325 align:middle line:90%
counting the steps in your mind.

00:13:14.325 --> 00:13:17.070 align:middle line:90%


00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:28.890 align:middle line:84%
10, 9, deeper and
deeper still, 8, 7,

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:33.550 align:middle line:84%
all the way down
to relaxation now,

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:43.610 align:middle line:84%
6, 5, and 4, drifting off
peacefully and easily,

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:53.530 align:middle line:84%
3, 2, all the way down,
deeply relaxed, and 1.

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:55.750 align:middle line:84%
You see a comfortable
padded chair

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:59.020 align:middle line:84%
and you take a seat,
ready to embrace

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:03.250 align:middle line:84%
the changes to come in your
deep state of relaxation now.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:07.740 align:middle line:90%


00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And you've been
feeling like you want

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:15.330 align:middle line:84%
to improve your memory
and your concentration.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And this mind talk will help you
to create new neural pathways

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.620 align:middle line:84%
to exercise this
part of the brain

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:26.910 align:middle line:84%
and strengthen
your ability here.

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:30.030 align:middle line:84%
The more you listen
to this mind talk,

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:32.880 align:middle line:84%
the more you'll be working
on these neural pathways.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And you'll soon start to
notice significant changes

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:36.760 align:middle line:90%
taking place.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.360 align:middle line:90%


00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Your brain has an incredible
ability to reshape itself,

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:50.500 align:middle line:84%
and this is especially true
when it comes to your memory.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.470 align:middle line:84%
With the right
information and practice,

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:57.280 align:middle line:84%
you can harness the natural
power of neuroplasticity

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.880 align:middle line:84%
to increase your
cognitive abilities,

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:05.080 align:middle line:84%
enhance your ability to
learn new information,

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.900 align:middle line:84%
and improve your
memory significantly.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Every thought or face, name,
or detail that you encounter

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:20.070 align:middle line:84%
is stored in your memory,
just like a computer.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to you to
access that information.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, we know
that the harder we try,

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:29.310 align:middle line:90%
the harder it is to recall.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.960 align:middle line:90%


00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.720 align:middle line:84%
The more you put pressure
on your conscious mind,

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.800 align:middle line:84%
the more the subconscious
takes a backseat.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.610 align:middle line:84%
So from now on, you
have utter confidence

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:46.170 align:middle line:90%
in your subconscious.

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:52.460 align:middle line:84%
It will recall everything you
need it to when you need it to.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:56.955 align:middle line:84%
And your mind is more
powerful than you know.

00:15:56.955 --> 00:15:59.980 align:middle line:84%
You simply need to
know how to use it.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:03.200 align:middle line:90%


00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:08.070 align:middle line:84%
Your mind will always do what
it thinks you want it to do.

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And from now on, you have
faith that your subconscious

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.290 align:middle line:84%
mind will give you any
information or memories

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:14.090 align:middle line:90%
that you need.

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:17.680 align:middle line:90%


00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.790 align:middle line:84%
You have a powerful database
of information in your mind,

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.580 align:middle line:84%
and you can access it
at any time you need it.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.680 align:middle line:90%


00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.900 align:middle line:84%
You can also start
working on building

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.880 align:middle line:84%
that link to the
subconscious mind

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:36.470 align:middle line:84%
and strengthening it,
making it work faster,

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:40.670 align:middle line:84%
using new neural pathways,
and making it even more

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:42.460 align:middle line:90%
reliable than ever before.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.790 align:middle line:90%


00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing you
can do to boost your memory

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:51.105 align:middle line:84%
is to start
exercising your mind.

00:16:51.105 --> 00:16:54.210 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And this must be
something not only

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.650 align:middle line:84%
intellectually
demanding, but also

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:04.460 align:middle line:84%
something that's unfamiliar
and out of your comfort zone.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.839 align:middle line:84%
So to strengthen the brain,
you need to keep learning

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:11.410 align:middle line:90%
and keep developing new skills.

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And in this way,
you'll be creating

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.150 align:middle line:84%
those new neural
pathways, keeping

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:21.410 align:middle line:84%
your mind active and
youthful, alert, and awake.

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:25.540 align:middle line:84%
So it may be something like
learning a new language,

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.960 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps taking up a new
intellectually-challenging

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.350 align:middle line:84%
game, a crossword or
Sudoku, whatever it may be.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:36.220 align:middle line:90%


00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.500 align:middle line:84%
The next thing you can
work on is not only

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:44.420 align:middle line:84%
exercise for your brain health,
but also physical exercise.

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And you know that
physical exercise

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:50.630 align:middle line:90%
helps your brain to stay sharp.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.790 align:middle line:84%
It increases oxygen
to your brain

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:56.300 align:middle line:84%
and enhances the effects
of helpful brain chemicals,

00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:00.800 align:middle line:84%
reducing those harmful
stress hormones.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps most
importantly, exercise

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:07.640 align:middle line:84%
plays an important role
in that neuroplasticity

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.420 align:middle line:84%
by boosting growth
factors and stimulating

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.610 align:middle line:90%
new neural connections.

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:17.220 align:middle line:90%


00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:19.560 align:middle line:84%
You also take care to
make sure that you're

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.980 align:middle line:90%
getting enough sleep.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And there's a big difference
between the amount

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:29.250 align:middle line:84%
of sleep you can get by on
and the amount of sleep you

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:33.150 align:middle line:90%
need to function at your best.

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:37.020 align:middle line:84%
By limiting the amount of
hours of sleep you have,

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:41.430 align:middle line:84%
your memory, creativity,
problem-solving abilities,

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:47.090 align:middle line:84%
and critical thinking
skills are all compromised.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly, sleep is
absolutely necessary for memory

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:58.420 align:middle line:84%
consolidation, with the key
memory-enhancing activity

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:02.870 align:middle line:84%
occurring during the
deepest stages of sleep.

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:05.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's imperative that
you spend long enough

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:07.180 align:middle line:90%
in this deep state of sleep.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.410 align:middle line:90%


00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:15.150 align:middle line:84%
You have confidence and faith in
your ability to remember things

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:17.210 align:middle line:90%
now, to concentrate now.

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:20.490 align:middle line:90%


00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And you also make sure that
when you're reading, listening,

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.340 align:middle line:84%
or doing whatever
it is that you may

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:31.110 align:middle line:84%
want to recall at a later date,
you're paying full attention.

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:34.200 align:middle line:84%
You don't allow your
mind to wander off.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.110 align:middle line:90%
You're focused and mindful.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:40.125 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is alert, and
you're fully concentrating

00:19:40.125 --> 00:19:41.000 align:middle line:90%
on what you're doing.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.320 align:middle line:90%


00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.100 align:middle line:84%
You can't remember something
if you've never learned it,

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:51.460 align:middle line:84%
and you can't learn something
that is encoded to your brain

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:56.050 align:middle line:84%
if you don't pay
enough attention to it.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:20:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And we know that it takes about
eight seconds of intense focus

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:05.230 align:middle line:84%
to process a piece of
information into your memory.

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:08.700 align:middle line:84%
So if you find that
you're easily distracted,

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.770 align:middle line:84%
you pick a quiet
place where you won't

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.410 align:middle line:84%
be interrupted so
your mind can encode

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:16.910 align:middle line:90%
those memories effectively.

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:19.160 align:middle line:84%
When taking information
in, you not only

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.830 align:middle line:84%
pay as much attention
as possible,

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:26.660 align:middle line:84%
but you also involve as
many sensors as possible.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Try to relate information
to colors and textures,

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.870 align:middle line:90%
smells, and tastes.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And this physical act
of rewriting information

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:41.690 align:middle line:84%
can help to imprint all those
memories onto your brain,

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:45.140 align:middle line:84%
even if you're a visual
learner, reading out loud what

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.220 align:middle line:90%
you want to remember.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And if you can recite it
rhythmically, then even better.

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:54.860 align:middle line:90%


00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And lastly, you know that stress
is one of the brain's worst

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:00.660 align:middle line:90%
enemies.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Over time, chronic
stress will destroy

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:06.390 align:middle line:84%
your brain cells and
damage the hippocampus,

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:08.970 align:middle line:84%
the region of the brain
involved in the formation

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:13.740 align:middle line:84%
of new memories and the
retrieval of old ones.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.840 align:middle line:84%
So by listening
to this mind talk,

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:20.160 align:middle line:84%
you're reducing your stress
levels significantly.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.830 align:middle line:84%
You're boosting
those neural pathways

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:25.980 align:middle line:84%
and you're enhancing your mind's
ability to store memories.

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.740 align:middle line:90%


00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:32.340 align:middle line:84%
From now on in, you know
that everything you see,

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:33.480 align:middle line:90%
you remember.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Everything you
feel, you remember.

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:38.925 align:middle line:84%
Everything you
touch, you remember.

00:21:38.925 --> 00:21:41.650 align:middle line:90%


00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:43.600 align:middle line:84%
You can remember,
or you can choose

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:47.950 align:middle line:84%
to forget the things you
don't need to remember,

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:51.130 align:middle line:84%
but you keep that
knowledge within you.

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Your inner mind
records and stores

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:56.890 align:middle line:84%
all the information, like
a computer, available

00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:01.190 align:middle line:90%
there just when you need it.

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And you're becoming
calm and relaxed,

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:07.090 align:middle line:84%
feeling totally and
completely at peace.

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:10.730 align:middle line:90%
Your mind is focused and alert.

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And you find it so easy to
retain all the information

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:17.540 align:middle line:84%
that's necessary for
you, and to forget

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:21.220 align:middle line:84%
the irrelevant,
unimportant things.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:23.740 align:middle line:84%
But in this state of
relaxation, your mind

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:28.450 align:middle line:84%
is receptive and focused, eager
to concentrate and to learn

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:29.320 align:middle line:90%
and to remember.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:33.870 align:middle line:90%


00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And every so often, you
may remind yourself,

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.470 align:middle line:84%
everything I've ever learned
or read, smelt, touched

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:43.140 align:middle line:84%
is recorded in my wonderful
subconscious mind.

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.980 align:middle line:90%


00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.900 align:middle line:90%
You have a wonderful memory.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:51.200 align:middle line:90%
Your mind is focused and alert.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Your concentration
is at its best

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:56.510 align:middle line:84%
because of this
wonderful relaxation

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:58.865 align:middle line:84%
that you're allowing
yourself to drift into.

00:22:58.865 --> 00:23:02.120 align:middle line:90%


00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is there to focus
and to remember, to absorb

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:08.870 align:middle line:84%
and to retain, and
to make available

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:12.740 align:middle line:90%
whatever you need to remember.

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And the concentration
strengthens your mind.

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:21.710 align:middle line:90%
And relaxation eases your mind.

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:26.790 align:middle line:84%
You're alert and
you're ready to learn.

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Ready to exercise your
mind and your memory

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:30.740 align:middle line:90%
and your concentration.

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:33.690 align:middle line:90%


00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And when you focus your mind,
you strengthen your memory.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.420 align:middle line:84%
You remember that everything
you need to remember,

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:46.730 align:middle line:84%
you trust in the power of your
wonderful subconscious mind.

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Memory and concentration
intensify your capacity

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:55.800 align:middle line:84%
to store all those wonderful
subconscious learnings.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.810 align:middle line:84%
All you need to do is
relax and let go and allow

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:03.380 align:middle line:84%
those learnings to be a
wonderful part of you.

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And these hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.720 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind,

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:13.140 align:middle line:84%
and they'll become more powerful
as the days and weeks go by.

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from 1 to 5

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.280 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of 5, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:23.060 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling
fantastic, bringing back

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:25.740 align:middle line:84%
with you all the
wonderful new feelings.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Coming back now with
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:34.660 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:40.000 align:middle line:90%
