00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to the
House of Wellbeing.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.950 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the Business
Meeting Hypnotherapy Audio.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.260 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.080 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the hypnosis will
begin, but before it does,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.620 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to remind you that
the following audio contains

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.310 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic suggestions
that aim to help you reach

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.020 align:middle line:90%
a deep level of relaxation.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.590 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.070 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.670 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.870 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.470 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.000 align:middle line:84%
But right now there's
nothing at all

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.580 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.710 align:middle line:84%
relax, lie back, and
let go, and really enjoy

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.800 align:middle line:84%
those peaceful feelings and all
the benefits that come with it.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.150 align:middle line:90%


00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.060 align:middle line:84%
Make yourself as
comfortable as possible

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.445 align:middle line:84%
and concentrate on
the sound of my voice.

00:01:13.445 --> 00:01:16.180 align:middle line:90%


00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And begin by drawing in
a long, slow, deep breath

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.400 align:middle line:90%
in through your nose.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.420 align:middle line:90%
Hold the breath for a moment.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And now slightly open your
mouth and release all the air

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.380 align:middle line:84%
from your body in a
long, low, deep sigh.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And relax, allowing your
lungs to naturally deflate

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.120 align:middle line:84%
as your body sinks into
gentle relaxation now.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.590 align:middle line:90%


00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And you can release
any tension, relax,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and let go as I guide
you through a journey

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.660 align:middle line:84%
of relaxation, a journey that
you will find very beneficial

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.320 align:middle line:90%
for your overall well-being.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.670 align:middle line:90%


00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.550 align:middle line:84%
You're going to start
this calming experience

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.730 align:middle line:84%
by first relaxing your
whole body mind system.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.500 align:middle line:90%


00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's true to say that the
simple act of relaxing the body

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.180 align:middle line:84%
and mind has a positive knock-on
effect, because how you think

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.430 align:middle line:90%
determines how you feel.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And how you feel influences
the world around you.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And how you choose
to think today

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.770 align:middle line:84%
affects your decisions
from here on in.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.390 align:middle line:84%
So to make my
assurances your reality,

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.430 align:middle line:84%
let's begin by
focusing your attention

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.840 align:middle line:90%
at the very top of your head.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Tension often starts at
the scalp and the neck.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.920 align:middle line:84%
So mentally and physically
allow all the muscles

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.590 align:middle line:84%
around the top of your
head to relax now,

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.440 align:middle line:84%
letting all the
tension simply dissolve

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.545 align:middle line:84%
as you start to tune in
to your body mind system.

00:03:26.545 --> 00:03:31.720 align:middle line:90%


00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Just let any tension you may
be holding to release now.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.430 align:middle line:84%
Allow your brain to relax,
the left and the right

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.400 align:middle line:84%
lobes of the brain
just releasing.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Such a simple thought, yet so
profound and so significant.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.020 align:middle line:90%
Just letting go completely.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.790 align:middle line:90%


00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Drifting further
and further down.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Nobody wanting anything,
nobody needing anything.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.835 align:middle line:90%
This is your time to relax.

00:04:06.835 --> 00:04:10.560 align:middle line:90%


00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Taking the relaxation
into the face

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:20.190 align:middle line:84%
now, allowing all of your
facial muscles to feel loose.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Feel your brow relaxing,
your forehead smoothing out,

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.055 align:middle line:90%
the back of your eyes relaxing.

00:04:28.055 --> 00:04:30.940 align:middle line:90%


00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Tiny muscles around your
eyes and eyelids down

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.550 align:middle line:84%
into your cheeks and
into your jaw muscles,

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.420 align:middle line:90%
just releasing and letting go.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.430 align:middle line:90%


00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Allowing your
tongue to fall away

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.680 align:middle line:90%
from the roof of your mouth.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And should you find you need
to swallow, just do that

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.530 align:middle line:84%
now, and drift down and
down, deeper and deeper

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.620 align:middle line:90%
into blissful relaxation.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.270 align:middle line:90%


00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.000 align:middle line:84%
The more you physically
relax, the more

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.230 align:middle line:90%
you can mentally relax.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And when you can
mentally relax, you

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.380 align:middle line:90%
can think much more clearly.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And when you think more clearly,
your life becomes clearer,

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.380 align:middle line:84%
you make better decisions,
and you're much more

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.650 align:middle line:90%
in control of your days.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.720 align:middle line:90%


00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:84%
So noticing now how
your neck feels,

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:43.270 align:middle line:84%
relaxing all the little muscles,
letting go of the strain,

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.440 align:middle line:90%
letting go of the tension.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.860 align:middle line:90%


00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Allow that tension that you
may be holding in your shoulder

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.390 align:middle line:90%
to go now.

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Feel those shoulders,
both of them,

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.100 align:middle line:84%
sinking into the
frame of your body.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Feel your neck lengthen
as you do this.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.760 align:middle line:90%


00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Feel or imagine all your
cares and worries just

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:16.840 align:middle line:84%
rolling off your shoulders now
as you take the relaxation down

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:23.130 align:middle line:84%
now into the tops of your
arms, letting any tension you

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.350 align:middle line:90%
may be holding just drain away.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.010 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And as your awareness floats
down through your upper arms,

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:39.260 align:middle line:84%
into your elbows, all the
muscles in your forearms

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:47.000 align:middle line:84%
relax, right down to your
wrists and into your hands.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.765 align:middle line:84%
And way down into the very tips
of your fingers and thumbs.

00:06:50.765 --> 00:06:54.700 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.390 align:middle line:90%
Your arms are feeling so heavy.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.160 align:middle line:90%
Your body's so comfortable.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.370 align:middle line:90%


00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Nothing whatsoever
to do but just

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.590 align:middle line:84%
relax and enjoy this feeling
of total release now.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:17.530 align:middle line:90%


00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:22.330 align:middle line:84%
As you let go of all the
tension in those muscles,

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:28.630 align:middle line:84%
you may experience them becoming
calmer and gently releasing.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.580 align:middle line:90%


00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And just tune into the
feeling of simply letting go.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.980 align:middle line:90%


00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.600 align:middle line:84%
As you become aware
of your breathing,

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:50.060 align:middle line:84%
notice that you are now
breathing steadily and slowly,

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.730 align:middle line:90%
rhythmically.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And with each exhale,
you feel yourself

00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:01.040 align:middle line:84%
just relaxing even
more deeply, allowing

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:06.610 align:middle line:84%
any tension in the chest area
now to simply drain away,

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.035 align:middle line:84%
letting go completely
and totally.

00:08:10.035 --> 00:08:13.090 align:middle line:90%


00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:17.720 align:middle line:84%
Bring awareness into
your stomach now,

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:22.430 align:middle line:84%
and let all your
stomach muscles relax.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And as you do, I
want you to imagine

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:29.080 align:middle line:84%
a ball of sunlight passing
down from the top of your head

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.840 align:middle line:84%
down through your face, your
throat, and into your stomach.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.799 align:middle line:90%


00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Visualize this healing
energy passing down

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:45.815 align:middle line:84%
through your throat and
chest and into your stomach.

00:08:45.815 --> 00:08:49.850 align:middle line:90%


00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:57.130 align:middle line:84%
So see and feel the sunlight
swirling and rotating.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And as the light glows, it
warms and soothes and heals.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And you release and relax and
drift down, and further down.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:14.850 align:middle line:90%


00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And in your imagination,
you send the sunlight out

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:24.300 align:middle line:84%
now to every nerve cell,
bone, muscle, fiber,

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.860 align:middle line:90%
and system of the body.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.060 align:middle line:84%
See it flowing through
the bloodstream,

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.580 align:middle line:90%
and leave the light there.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:37.990 align:middle line:90%
It knows what to do.

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:43.510 align:middle line:84%
As you take the relaxation,
round into your back muscles

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:45.250 align:middle line:90%
and from your back muscles.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:50.920 align:middle line:84%
It relaxes those muscles
either side of the spine.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Releasing, relaxing,
and just letting go now.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.070 align:middle line:90%
Deeper and deeper now.

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:04.960 align:middle line:90%


00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.600 align:middle line:84%
As you relax your
waist and the muscles

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:13.900 align:middle line:84%
of your lower stomach, and
down into the pelvic area, all

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.830 align:middle line:84%
the way down through
the large thigh muscles,

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:25.160 align:middle line:84%
down through your knees,
your shins and your calves,

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:31.280 align:middle line:84%
just allow those areas of
the body to relax and let go.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:36.640 align:middle line:90%


00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:41.590 align:middle line:84%
You're so relaxed, so
heavy, so comfortable.

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:44.870 align:middle line:90%


00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And now, tune into that
comfortable feeling

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:55.930 align:middle line:84%
as you think on down to
your ankles, into your feet,

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.540 align:middle line:84%
right down to the very
tips of your toes.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.500 align:middle line:90%


00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:06.660 align:middle line:84%
All the muscles of your body
are now so beautifully relaxed,

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:13.260 align:middle line:84%
and you feel very heavy
and very comfortable.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling centered, and
relaxed, and fully in control.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:24.410 align:middle line:90%


00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.480 align:middle line:84%
If there are any
areas of your body

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.570 align:middle line:84%
that still feel
tight or tense, you

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:32.960 align:middle line:84%
find that you can relax them
simply by giving yourself

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.460 align:middle line:90%
permission to do so.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:38.480 align:middle line:90%


00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And you can now go even
deeper as I count down

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:42.605 align:middle line:90%
from eight to zero.

00:11:42.605 --> 00:11:45.500 align:middle line:90%


00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And with every number, you
feel yourself drifting further

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:50.870 align:middle line:90%
into blissful relaxation.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:54.140 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.140 --> 00:12:06.900 align:middle line:84%
So eight, seven, six,
five, deeper now,

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:16.510 align:middle line:90%
four, three, two, one, and zero.

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Deeply relaxed, letting go of
all the cares and worries, all

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.110 align:middle line:84%
the tension and pressure
and stresses and strains.

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:28.740 align:middle line:90%


00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:34.560 align:middle line:84%
Let them all ease from your
body and ease from your mind.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And allow yourself to drift down
into a deeper, more blissful

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.540 align:middle line:90%
state of creative relaxation.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:49.270 align:middle line:90%


00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:52.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk to you now
about your business meeting

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.860 align:middle line:90%
presence.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:13:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And you may have noticed that
in business meetings recently

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:03.600 align:middle line:84%
you seem to be lacking
some executive presence.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.330 align:middle line:90%


00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.985 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you notice other people
who attract and engage everyone

00:13:10.985 --> 00:13:11.785 align:middle line:90%
in a meeting.

00:13:11.785 --> 00:13:15.070 align:middle line:90%


00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps when they're on a video
call, or walk into a room,

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.840 align:middle line:84%
they have the ability
to command attention,

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.760 align:middle line:90%
leaving everyone wanting more.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.230 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:30.300 align:middle line:84%
It may look like
these people just

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:35.950 align:middle line:84%
get it and have natural
executive presence,

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:38.800 align:middle line:84%
but the truth is this is
something they've developed

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.470 align:middle line:90%
over a long period of time.

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:44.310 align:middle line:90%


00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:49.620 align:middle line:84%
So you, too, start to
work on how you show up,

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:55.460 align:middle line:84%
starting by making sure that
before you start a meeting,

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:58.340 align:middle line:90%
you stop for a quick second.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.990 align:middle line:90%
Compose yourself.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:03.450 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Slow down so you feel
centered, calm, relaxed,

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.625 align:middle line:90%
prepared, and composed.

00:14:10.625 --> 00:14:14.770 align:middle line:90%


00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.830 align:middle line:84%
You have thought in advance
about the questions your boss

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:22.010 align:middle line:84%
or colleagues may be
asking in the meeting,

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and you've prepared some
well-thought-out responses,

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:29.030 align:middle line:84%
ensuring you're not
caught off guard

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:32.900 align:middle line:84%
and you can remain cool, calm,
and collected at all times.

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:37.430 align:middle line:90%


00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:40.175 align:middle line:84%
Your body language is
open and you look engaged.

00:14:40.175 --> 00:14:43.790 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:47.720 align:middle line:84%
You make sure that you maintain
solid eye contact with everyone

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.150 align:middle line:90%
in the room or on a video call.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.960 align:middle line:90%


00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And this not only makes
you more personable,

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:57.480 align:middle line:90%
but portrays confidence.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.380 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:06.660 align:middle line:84%
You speak up in meetings,
speaking clearly, firmly,

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.960 align:middle line:84%
and loudly enough for
people to hear you.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.730 align:middle line:90%


00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:14.620 align:middle line:84%
You are confident in
what you're saying.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:17.180 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.100 align:middle line:84%
You know you can
have an opinion,

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.100 align:middle line:84%
and your ideas and opinions
are worthy of hearing.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:25.510 align:middle line:90%


00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:27.760 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if
people agree with you.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.065 align:middle line:84%
You're not seeking to
get everyone's approval.

00:15:30.065 --> 00:15:33.510 align:middle line:90%


00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Not everyone will agree with
everything you think and say.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:41.910 align:middle line:84%
You simply want to share
your thoughts and ideas,

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:46.520 align:middle line:84%
input into the meeting,
and have a voice.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is important to
you and your development.

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:53.340 align:middle line:90%


00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:57.300 align:middle line:84%
However, you're not afraid
of silence in meetings.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.340 align:middle line:84%
You're not interested
in filling the silence

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.860 align:middle line:90%
with unnecessary ramblings.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.170 align:middle line:84%
You're more interested
in leaving people

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:08.070 align:middle line:84%
with something that will make
them think, listen, and feel.

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:10.730 align:middle line:90%


00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:14.220 align:middle line:84%
You know that people may forget
what you did or what you said,

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.700 align:middle line:84%
but people will never forget
how you make them feel.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:22.000 align:middle line:90%


00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.650 align:middle line:84%
You make other
people in the room

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:28.110 align:middle line:84%
feel special by
listening to them.

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:30.870 align:middle line:90%
You don't hog the conversation.

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:35.510 align:middle line:84%
You don't speak over
others or interrupt.

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And when someone
is talking to you,

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:41.180 align:middle line:84%
you maintain eye contact and
nod or respond appropriately.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:45.410 align:middle line:90%


00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:48.080 align:middle line:84%
You take time to think
about your response,

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.840 align:middle line:84%
and when you're ready, you
confidently land your points

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.770 align:middle line:84%
clearly, calmly,
and articulately.

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:58.620 align:middle line:90%


00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.050 align:middle line:84%
You stop any negative
comments, and you

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:04.490 align:middle line:90%
stop censoring yourself.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:07.130 align:middle line:84%
You automatically
speak out more often.

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:10.890 align:middle line:90%


00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:13.920 align:middle line:84%
It's important that you
share your thoughts and ideas

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.520 align:middle line:84%
without over-editing them
or limiting your expression.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.609 align:middle line:90%


00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:23.579 align:middle line:84%
This helps you come across
as a leader and more

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:25.500 align:middle line:84%
of an influential
person overall.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:30.650 align:middle line:90%


00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:32.660 align:middle line:84%
In your preparation
for your meeting,

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:36.440 align:middle line:84%
you think about one point
or topic from the agenda

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.390 align:middle line:90%
that you know you can address.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:43.110 align:middle line:84%
You think about a topic
that's important to you,

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:45.820 align:middle line:84%
and you prepare in advance
thoughts and opinions

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.850 align:middle line:84%
so you're ready to
add to the discussion.

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:52.030 align:middle line:90%


00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:55.090 align:middle line:84%
For more spontaneous meetings
where you haven't had time

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:58.360 align:middle line:84%
to prepare, you take
your time to listen

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:03.730 align:middle line:84%
to what's being discussed,
digest the information,

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:06.640 align:middle line:84%
tap into your extensive
knowledge and information

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.630 align:middle line:84%
pool in your subconscious
mind, and use your experience

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:13.020 align:middle line:84%
to have input into
the conversation.

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:17.630 align:middle line:90%


00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:24.500 align:middle line:84%
You're more alert, confident,
calm, relaxed, focused,

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.090 align:middle line:84%
and engaged in
meetings at all times.

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:32.360 align:middle line:90%


00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.910 align:middle line:84%
If you ever feel you
need more information

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:40.760 align:middle line:84%
before you can speak up, you
simply ask more questions.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.740 align:middle line:84%
You probe deeper
into what others

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:46.160 align:middle line:84%
are saying by asking questions
to help give you more clarity

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:51.660 align:middle line:84%
and understanding, thus helping
you to feel more engaged

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.000 align:middle line:84%
and to be more of an
active participant.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.980 align:middle line:90%


00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:00.210 align:middle line:84%
You believe in yourself
and your ideas.

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:03.130 align:middle line:90%


00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Your ideas are no
less valid than those

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:08.700 align:middle line:84%
of other people in
the meeting, so you

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:14.040 align:middle line:84%
don't allow any self-doubt
to creep into your mind.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.350 align:middle line:84%
You no longer adjust
your viewpoint

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:19.510 align:middle line:90%
to suit the needs of others.

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:23.350 align:middle line:84%
You simply believe in
your thoughts and ideas,

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.570 align:middle line:84%
giving you lots of
self-confidence.

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:28.890 align:middle line:90%


00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And this, in turn, helps you to
share your thoughts and ideas

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.500 align:middle line:90%
much more easily now.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:38.210 align:middle line:90%


00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:42.990 align:middle line:84%
You are full of self-confidence
and control now.

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:44.820 align:middle line:84%
You're not striving
to be perfect,

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.970 align:middle line:84%
to know all the
answers in meetings.

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:49.750 align:middle line:84%
You're there because
your opinion matters.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.480 align:middle line:90%


00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:56.050 align:middle line:84%
You no longer feel intimidated
by more confident or louder

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:58.071 align:middle line:90%
people on the call or in a room.

00:19:58.071 --> 00:20:00.720 align:middle line:90%


00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Just because people
speak louder,

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.630 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't necessarily mean
they're making more sense

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:09.780 align:middle line:90%
or that they're right.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.800 align:middle line:84%
You are impactful and
have presence in meetings.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.110 align:middle line:84%
You champion yourself
and acknowledge

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.170 align:middle line:84%
what you bring and
contribute to the table.

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:22.930 align:middle line:90%


00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.030 align:middle line:84%
When someone else
speaks up in the meeting

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:28.780 align:middle line:84%
and your view is contrary,
you don't automatically

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.940 align:middle line:84%
think that you are
wrong and they're right.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:33.190 align:middle line:90%
This is simply not true.

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.710 align:middle line:84%
Your experiences,
thoughts, and opinions

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:38.380 align:middle line:84%
are not only valid
and worthwhile,

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:41.690 align:middle line:84%
but prove to be exactly what
other people need to hear.

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:45.370 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:48.510 align:middle line:84%
You speak without
hesitation, and not

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:52.920 align:middle line:84%
just when you have
something important to say.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.570 align:middle line:90%
You no longer censor yourself.

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:56.670 align:middle line:84%
You have total
freedom of expression

00:20:56.670 --> 00:21:00.120 align:middle line:84%
and love pushing yourself
out of your comfort zone.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.290 align:middle line:90%


00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:09.290 align:middle line:84%
You're more alert, confident,
calm, relaxed, focused,

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:12.350 align:middle line:84%
and engaged in meetings
at all times now.

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:17.560 align:middle line:90%


00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.440 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you find yourself
actually looking forward

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.420 align:middle line:90%
to business meetings.

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And your desire to improve
your meeting skills

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:28.570 align:middle line:84%

opinion, question, or idea,

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:10.700 align:middle line:90%

People are listening
and interested in what

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.840 align:middle line:90%

sounds and feels.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.170 align:middle line:90%


00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:41.990 align:middle line:84%

embedded in your
subconscious mind,

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:56.880 align:middle line:84%
and they'll become
more and more powerful

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.470 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:02.640 align:middle line:90%

to awaken you.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of five, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:14.420 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling fantastic,
bringing back with you now

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:16.920 align:middle line:90%

So coming back now with one,
two, three, four, and five.

Eyes open when you're ready.
