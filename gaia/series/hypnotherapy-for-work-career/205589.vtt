00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Welcome to
House of Wellbeing.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.170 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the
"Releasing Stress" mind talk

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.490 align:middle line:90%
audio.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.410 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.000 align:middle line:84%
But before it
does, I'd just like

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.940 align:middle line:84%
to remind you that the
following audio contains

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.540 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic suggestions
aimed to help you reach

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.490 align:middle line:90%
a deep level of relaxation.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.520 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.880 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.483 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:40.483 --> 00:00:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.470 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.580 align:middle line:84%
will alert you and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.790 align:middle line:84%
But right now, there's
nothing at all you need to do,

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.830 align:middle line:84%
apart from close your
eyes, relax, and let go.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And really enjoy the peaceful
feelings and benefits

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.150 align:middle line:90%
that come with it.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.830 align:middle line:84%
In this deep and special
sleep, your subconscious mind,

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.400 align:middle line:84%
for your safekeeping,
monitors everything

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.930 align:middle line:90%
that's happening around you.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.490 align:middle line:90%


00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.560 align:middle line:84%
So these suggestions, because
they're for your benefit,

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.472 align:middle line:84%
go directly to your subconscious
mind, where they're accepted.

00:01:27.472 --> 00:01:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And these thoughts become
established, firmly fixed,

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:41.190 align:middle line:84%
deeply in your
inner mind, embedded

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.600 align:middle line:84%
so these suggestions remain
with you long after you

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.760 align:middle line:84%
open your eyes, helping you to
change those things you want

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.690 align:middle line:90%
to change for your own sake.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And these new thoughts
help you begin to change

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.595 align:middle line:90%
the things you want to change.

00:02:01.595 --> 00:02:04.380 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.919 align:middle line:84%
And these changes allow you to
enjoy your life more and more.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:13.190 align:middle line:90%


00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And I want you now to
imagine that you're

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.950 align:middle line:84%
checking your body to ensure
you've become totally relaxed.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.570 align:middle line:90%


00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.670 align:middle line:84%
As your muscles relax, just
let your mind relax also.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.340 align:middle line:90%


00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Beginning with your
feet, feel your toes.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Stretch them and feel
the texture of what

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.850 align:middle line:90%
your feet are resting on.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.640 align:middle line:90%


00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And now, begin to
tighten your calves

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.510 align:middle line:90%
and allow them to relax now.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.350 align:middle line:90%


00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Allow that relaxation to
spread past your ankles,

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.630 align:middle line:84%
up your calves to the
back of your knees.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.160 align:middle line:90%


00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And feel those muscles
easing, resting comfortably.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.310 align:middle line:90%


00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.486 align:middle line:84%
Now, the large muscles
of your thighs.

00:03:23.486 --> 00:03:24.870 align:middle line:90%
Pull them tight.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.920 align:middle line:90%


00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.425 align:middle line:84%
Be aware of those
large muscles tensing.

00:03:30.425 --> 00:03:34.600 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.000 align:middle line:90%
And now, relax those muscles.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.095 align:middle line:90%
Feel them lengthen.

00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:42.960 align:middle line:90%


00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And resting comfortably,
feel your legs

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:56.090 align:middle line:84%
as they sink even deeper
as you relax even more.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.880 align:middle line:90%


00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.895 align:middle line:84%
And notice how rhythmic
your breathing is becoming.

00:04:01.895 --> 00:04:05.150 align:middle line:90%


00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.330 align:middle line:90%
Now, your stomach muscles.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.755 align:middle line:90%
Pull them together gently.

00:04:09.755 --> 00:04:13.060 align:middle line:90%


00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And now, let them expand
and relax comfortably.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.490 align:middle line:90%


00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Your shoulders and back
muscles, flex your shoulders.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Feel those muscles
pull across your back.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.340 align:middle line:90%


00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And now, let your
shoulders slouch

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.425 align:middle line:90%
as you relax the muscles.

00:04:38.425 --> 00:04:41.350 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And notice how your spine
sinks deeper into your chair

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.360 align:middle line:90%
as you relax even more deeply.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And notice how easy and regular
your breathing has become.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.200 align:middle line:90%


00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, your fingertips
and fingers.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.760 align:middle line:90%
Clench them now.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.855 align:middle line:90%
Feel the tension.

00:05:12.855 --> 00:05:16.270 align:middle line:90%


00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.080 align:middle line:90%
And now, allow them to relax.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.350 align:middle line:90%


00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Allow the relaxation
to spread up your arms,

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.470 align:middle line:90%
all the way up to your neck.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.690 align:middle line:90%


00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And make sure your
neck is comfortable,

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.885 align:middle line:84%
with your head in
an easy position.

00:05:38.885 --> 00:05:42.480 align:middle line:90%


00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.250 align:middle line:90%
Tighten up your neck muscles.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.340 align:middle line:90%


00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, let those columns
of muscles loosen.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.380 align:middle line:90%


00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.720 align:middle line:84%
As the muscles relax
and you allow your neck

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:06.950 align:middle line:84%
to sink into the cushions
into a comfortable position,

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.640 align:middle line:84%
your facial muscles are flat
and stretched comfortably

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.590 align:middle line:90%
across your face.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.255 align:middle line:90%
Squeeze up your face.

00:06:15.255 --> 00:06:16.055 align:middle line:90%
Feel the tension.

00:06:16.055 --> 00:06:18.660 align:middle line:90%


00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And now, relax those
muscles and feel them

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:29.560 align:middle line:84%
lengthening and softening,
relaxing more than ever before.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:37.120 align:middle line:90%


00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.280 align:middle line:84%
You can now feel the air
temperature against your skin,

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.000 align:middle line:84%
and it feels smooth
and comfortable.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.120 align:middle line:90%


00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And now, you can
allow the relaxation

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.890 align:middle line:84%
to spread onto your scalp,
knowing that you're relaxed

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:01.050 align:middle line:84%
throughout your body,
from the top of your head

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.710 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:07.340 align:middle line:90%


00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:15.395 align:middle line:84%
Your body is now loose and
limp and heavy and relaxed.

00:07:15.395 --> 00:07:20.670 align:middle line:90%


00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.330 align:middle line:84%
Notice how your body
is sinking deeper

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.730 align:middle line:84%
into relaxation
as your breathing

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:31.950 align:middle line:90%
becomes more regular and easy.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:36.380 align:middle line:90%


00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'll
count slowly from 1 to 10.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And with each number, you
drift deeper and deeper

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.340 align:middle line:90%
into peaceful relaxation.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.510 align:middle line:90%


00:07:50.510 --> 00:08:19.070 align:middle line:84%
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, and 10.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.030 align:middle line:90%
Now feeling deeply relaxed.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:24.090 align:middle line:90%


00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And you find it easy to
focus your attention.

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.709 align:middle line:84%
And you imagine
things very clearly.

00:08:31.709 --> 00:08:34.710 align:middle line:90%


00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.330 align:middle line:84%
I want you to
imagine that you're

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.539 align:middle line:84%
standing on a balcony which
has steps leading down

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:40.820 align:middle line:90%
to a beautiful garden.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.140 align:middle line:90%


00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And as you look
into that garden,

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:50.950 align:middle line:84%
you see it's surrounded
with lovely trees,

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:55.840 align:middle line:84%
ensuring the garden is private,
secluded, and peaceful.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.570 align:middle line:90%


00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:04.930 align:middle line:84%
There are flowerbeds
set in the lovely lawn.

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And further along
is a waterfall,

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.525 align:middle line:90%
flowing into a stream.

00:09:10.525 --> 00:09:14.710 align:middle line:90%


00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:19.280 align:middle line:84%
You listen to the
sound of the water.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.580 align:middle line:84%
As you look around
you, you see the trees.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.210 align:middle line:90%


00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And you hear a faint sound
of a bird in the distance,

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:36.130 align:middle line:84%
adding to the feeling
of deep relaxation

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:37.960 align:middle line:90%
through your entire being.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:43.220 align:middle line:90%


00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.670 align:middle line:84%
If you look more
closely, you'll see

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:51.200 align:middle line:84%
that there are five steps
leading down to the garden,

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.210 align:middle line:84%
and then a small path that
leads to the waterfall.

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:58.880 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, we'll
walk down the steps.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And with each step, you
go deeper and deeper

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:08.770 align:middle line:90%
into relaxation.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:12.060 align:middle line:90%


00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.240 align:middle line:90%
So let's begin.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.700 align:middle line:84%
As you put your foot
on the first step,

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:23.410 align:middle line:84%
you feel yourself going
deeper into relaxation.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Down onto the
second step, as you

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:30.680 align:middle line:84%
feel your foot firmly
placed onto the step,

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:35.110 align:middle line:84%
you feel a wonderful relief
as you drift even deeper

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:36.580 align:middle line:90%
into relaxation now.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:40.270 align:middle line:90%


00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:45.760 align:middle line:84%
Down onto the third step,
feeling wonderfully free

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.730 align:middle line:90%
and so, so relaxed.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:53.570 align:middle line:84%
As your foot reaches
for the fourth step,

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:57.580 align:middle line:84%
another wave of relaxation
drifts through your whole body.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.090 align:middle line:90%


00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Down onto the fifth step
now, feeling even more deeply

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:07.210 align:middle line:90%
relaxed than ever before.

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:11.230 align:middle line:90%


00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And now, as you find yourself
standing on the lawn,

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:19.810 align:middle line:84%
you see a little way
ahead a waterfall.

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:22.330 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.315 align:middle line:84%
And you listen to the water
as it gently splashes.

00:11:25.315 --> 00:11:28.390 align:middle line:90%


00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:33.730 align:middle line:84%
You can notice the birds singing
in the distance and the sound

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:37.670 align:middle line:90%
of the trees gently swaying.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And a little to the side is
a comfortable garden bench.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:45.360 align:middle line:90%


00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.200 align:middle line:84%
You notice the
color of the bench.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.290 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'd like
you to walk over to the bench

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:58.640 align:middle line:90%
and sit down on the bench.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And now, you sit down,
and you're surprised

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:03.260 align:middle line:90%
at just how comfortable it is.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.160 align:middle line:90%


00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
even more relaxed.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:12.960 align:middle line:90%


00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.470 align:middle line:84%
As you sit down on the bench,
you take a deep breath.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe out, you
feel a wave of relaxation

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:25.990 align:middle line:84%
go through your
whole body, relaxing

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:30.940 align:middle line:90%
every muscle, every nerve.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:36.320 align:middle line:84%
As you breathe in, you
breathe in positive thoughts.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe out, you
breathe out negative thoughts,

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:46.355 align:middle line:84%
leaving room for more positive
thoughts on this journey ahead.

00:12:46.355 --> 00:12:50.790 align:middle line:90%


00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And you know that
if you're stressed,

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:84%
whether by your job or
something more personal,

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:02.520 align:middle line:84%
the first step to feeling
better is to identify the cause

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:07.500 align:middle line:84%
and to take control of the
situation, as doing nothing

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.450 align:middle line:84%
will only make your
problems worse.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:12.170 align:middle line:90%


00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:16.490 align:middle line:84%
So today, we're going to take
control back into your life

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:19.880 align:middle line:84%
by making some
changes immediately

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.670 align:middle line:84%
that will help you manage
and overcome your stress.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:26.280 align:middle line:90%


00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.770 align:middle line:84%
You start by
becoming more in tune

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.085 align:middle line:84%
with what situations seem to
cause you the most stress.

00:13:32.085 --> 00:13:36.640 align:middle line:90%


00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:42.080 align:middle line:84%
You take notice of your
feelings, your environment,

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.450 align:middle line:84%
including the people and
circumstances involved

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:47.425 align:middle line:90%
and how you reacted.

00:13:47.425 --> 00:13:50.550 align:middle line:90%


00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:53.460 align:middle line:84%
As you start to take
note and find patterns

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.580 align:middle line:84%
amongst your
stresses, this helps

00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:00.060 align:middle line:84%
you put in place
responses and reactions

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.215 align:middle line:90%
to help you cope better.

00:14:01.215 --> 00:14:05.050 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:08.010 align:middle line:84%
So instead of trying to
fight stress with fast food

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.230 align:middle line:84%
or alcohol or
smoking, for example,

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:13.290 align:middle line:84%
you start to make more
healthy choices when

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:15.015 align:middle line:90%
you feel any tensions rise.

00:14:15.015 --> 00:14:17.860 align:middle line:90%


00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.530 align:middle line:84%
You avoid substances that
feel like they give you

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:22.870 align:middle line:90%
that short-term fix.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:25.930 align:middle line:84%
When in fact, you
know in the long term,

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:28.825 align:middle line:84%
they'll only enhance and
build on your stress levels.

00:14:28.825 --> 00:14:33.440 align:middle line:90%


00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:37.470 align:middle line:84%
You exercise more
regularly, realizing

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:39.830 align:middle line:84%
this is a great
stress buster for you.

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:42.600 align:middle line:90%


00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps sometimes,
you may decide

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:48.960 align:middle line:84%
to use techniques such as
meditation, deep breathing

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:53.130 align:middle line:84%
exercises, mindfulness,
and listening

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.595 align:middle line:84%
to mind talks helping you
to melt away the stress.

00:14:56.595 --> 00:15:00.950 align:middle line:90%


00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you choose to do, you
find that the physical activity

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:10.910 align:middle line:84%
is beneficial to keeping you
feeling calm and in control.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.585 align:middle line:84%
And you do it more often,
to reap the rewards.

00:15:13.585 --> 00:15:16.900 align:middle line:90%


00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:21.130 align:middle line:84%
You identify any wellness
initiatives at work

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.400 align:middle line:84%
that you can tap into, helping
you to continuously put

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.330 align:middle line:90%
yourself first.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:30.020 align:middle line:90%


00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And the physical exercise will
lead to better quality sleep,

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.580 align:middle line:84%
building healthy sleep habits
by limiting your caffeine

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.930 align:middle line:84%
intake late in the day
and minimizing stimulating

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:47.700 align:middle line:84%
activities, such as computer
or phone or television use

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:48.630 align:middle line:90%
late at night.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:52.280 align:middle line:90%


00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:56.900 align:middle line:84%
To avoid the negative
effects of stress or burnout,

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.690 align:middle line:84%
you start to learn to
switch off from work

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.780 align:middle line:84%
by having periods of
time when you're neither

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:06.290 align:middle line:84%
engaging in
work-related activities

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:07.810 align:middle line:90%
nor thinking about work.

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:11.570 align:middle line:90%


00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:15.200 align:middle line:84%
You learn to disconnect
from time to time,

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.350 align:middle line:84%
in a way that fits your
needs and preferences.

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:21.720 align:middle line:90%


00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:26.220 align:middle line:84%
You establish work-life
boundaries for yourself,

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.710 align:middle line:84%
and you create a rule
not to check emails

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:32.780 align:middle line:84%
from home after a certain
time in the evening,

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.720 align:middle line:84%
and not checking nor answering
your phone if you're out

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.825 align:middle line:90%
with friends and family.

00:16:36.825 --> 00:16:41.580 align:middle line:90%


00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Your work-life balance
is important to you

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:49.190 align:middle line:84%
and it gives your mind
the break and space

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:53.620 align:middle line:84%
it needs to recharge and take
time out from a busy day.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.640 align:middle line:90%


00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:02.010 align:middle line:84%
You use your holidays, taking
time off to relax and unwind.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And you come back
feeling reinvigorated

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:07.785 align:middle line:84%
and ready to perform
at your best.

00:17:07.785 --> 00:17:10.900 align:middle line:90%


00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:15.510 align:middle line:84%
When you feel your workload
starting to get too much,

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:18.270 align:middle line:84%
you have an honest
and open conversation

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:21.380 align:middle line:90%
with your line manager.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.440 align:middle line:84%
Not to play out a list of
complaints, but rather for you

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.950 align:middle line:84%
to come up with an
effective plan for managing

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:31.940 align:middle line:84%
the stresses you've identified
so that you can perform

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:35.370 align:middle line:84%
at your best in
your job, ultimately

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:39.160 align:middle line:84%
benefiting not only yourself,
but the business, too.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:43.490 align:middle line:90%


00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And as you start to make these
small changes and take control,

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:56.060 align:middle line:84%
you start to feel empowered,
finding solutions for yourself,

00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:00.680 align:middle line:84%
knowing that you can
control any situation calmly

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.370 align:middle line:90%
and effectively.

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And this satisfies you,
giving you confidence.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And this confidence gets
stronger and stronger day

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:11.130 align:middle line:90%
by day.

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:15.140 align:middle line:90%


00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:18.570 align:middle line:84%
You know that you have a
network of colleagues, friends,

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:21.320 align:middle line:84%
and family that you
can rely on, that you

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:25.070 align:middle line:84%
can talk to, that can
help you to see things

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:28.430 align:middle line:84%
in a different way
to help you relax,

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:32.270 align:middle line:84%
find solutions to any problems
or stresses you may have.

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:35.590 align:middle line:90%


00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:38.050 align:middle line:84%
You also start to
help others more, too,

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:42.610 align:middle line:84%
realizing that helping people
who are in a situation worse

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:47.100 align:middle line:84%
than your own helps you to put
your problems into perspective.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:51.300 align:middle line:90%


00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:56.040 align:middle line:84%
You feel stronger and more
resilient, more positive,

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.610 align:middle line:84%
more capable, much
more in control

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:04.050 align:middle line:84%
and more confident
than ever before.

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And this, in turn, helps you
to prioritize your workload,

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:12.030 align:middle line:84%
concentrating only on
the tasks that need

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:15.760 align:middle line:90%
your attention immediately.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.740 align:middle line:84%
You're not distracted
by things that

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:21.130 align:middle line:84%
can be resolved another
day, helping you

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:24.130 align:middle line:90%
to work smarter, not harder.

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And to concentrate on
things that you can control,

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:29.675 align:middle line:84%
not things that are
out of your control.

00:19:29.675 --> 00:19:34.680 align:middle line:90%


00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:39.420 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you're beginning
to not only believe in yourself,

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:43.470 align:middle line:84%
but to know who you truly
are, as someone worthwhile,

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:45.420 align:middle line:90%
someone deserving to be here.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Your powerful and
dynamic subconscious mind

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:52.860 align:middle line:84%
now creating clever pathways,
methods, and strategies

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:57.870 align:middle line:84%
to break down the barriers that
have stressed you in the past,

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:01.650 align:middle line:84%
and to move you forward,
feeling whole and complete.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Feeling calm,
balanced, and restored.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:08.935 align:middle line:84%
In control, relaxed,
and stress-free.

00:20:08.935 --> 00:20:13.270 align:middle line:90%


00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:15.310 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:18.520 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind,

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.470 align:middle line:84%
and they'll become
more and more powerful

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:24.710 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count from 1 up to 5

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:28.450 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:32.300 align:middle line:84%
At the count of 5, you'll be
wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.380 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling
fantastic, bringing back

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:38.360 align:middle line:84%
with you all the
wonderful new feelings.

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.250 align:middle line:90%
Coming back now.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:44.440 align:middle line:90%
So 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.220 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:52.000 align:middle line:90%
