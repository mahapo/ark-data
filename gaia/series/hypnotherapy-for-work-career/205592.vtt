00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Welcome to
House of Wellbeing.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.390 align:middle line:84%
You are listening to
the "Imposter Syndrome"

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.030 align:middle line:90%
MindTALK audio.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.190 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.780 align:middle line:84%
But before it
does, I'd just like

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.750 align:middle line:84%
to remind you that the
following audio contains

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.360 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.630 align:middle line:84%
aim to help you reach a
deep level of relaxation.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.230 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.350 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.520 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.380 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.130 align:middle line:84%
will alert you and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.690 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.650 align:middle line:84%
you need to do, apart from
close your eyes, relax, and let

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.010 align:middle line:84%
go, and really enjoy those
peaceful feelings and all

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.270 align:middle line:90%
the benefits that come with it.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.500 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now
to make yourself

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.560 align:middle line:90%
as comfortable as possible.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And listen to the
sound of my voice.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.030 align:middle line:90%


00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And as you do so, you may be
aware of other sounds going on

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:21.450 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.960 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.020 align:middle line:84%
But you know that
they're not important.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.960 align:middle line:90%
They don't matter at all.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And you can dismiss them
out of your awareness

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.680 align:middle line:84%
and focus your mind
entirely on what I'm saying.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.690 align:middle line:90%


00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.690 align:middle line:84%
This is your time, and
you make the most of it.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.690 align:middle line:90%


00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.060 align:middle line:84%
No one needs or wants
anything from you at all.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.630 align:middle line:90%


00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to
take in a deep breath,

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.550 align:middle line:84%
filling your lungs
as much as you can.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.650 align:middle line:90%
And let it out slowly.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.870 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And again, take in
a long, slow breath.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.600 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready,
let it out slowly.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.600 align:middle line:90%


00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Now you can allow your
breathing to return to normal.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Gentle breaths in
and out, returning

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.890 align:middle line:84%
to your normal,
gentle breathing pace.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.880 align:middle line:90%


00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now
to imagine yourself

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.885 align:middle line:84%
outside and your
favorite place in nature.

00:02:49.885 --> 00:02:53.360 align:middle line:90%


00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a peaceful
tropical beach,

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.650 align:middle line:84%
or it could be a
beautiful garden.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.060 align:middle line:90%


00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can
imagine lying back

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.830 align:middle line:84%
on a boat, which is sailing
on a tranquil river.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.030 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't matter
where you are, as long

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.490 align:middle line:90%
as it feels good to you.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.110 align:middle line:90%


00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.660 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful day.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.230 align:middle line:90%


00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:30.460 align:middle line:84%
The sky is a special
shade of blue, so clear.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.460 align:middle line:90%
And it's a warm summer's day.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.220 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.050 align:middle line:84%
There's a breeze gently
blowing over you,

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.790 align:middle line:84%
and the temperature is
just how you like it.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:51.420 align:middle line:90%


00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And in the sky is
a dazzling sun,

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.930 align:middle line:84%
so bright that you just
want to close your eyes

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.430 align:middle line:84%
and feel the glowing, healing
warmth of the sun on your body.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.590 align:middle line:90%


00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly, you find
that you can direct that sun

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.420 align:middle line:90%
over and around your body.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.589 align:middle line:84%
And as you realize
this, you begin

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:23.545 align:middle line:84%
to direct the light from
the sun over your face.

00:04:23.545 --> 00:04:27.780 align:middle line:90%


00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.530 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the healing
warmth of the light

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.950 align:middle line:84%
from the sun over your face,
just relaxing those muscles

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.855 align:middle line:84%
around the eyes, around the
nose and mouth and your brow.

00:04:40.855 --> 00:04:44.580 align:middle line:90%


00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And as you do this, you find
that your facial muscles

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.010 align:middle line:84%
begin to flatten
out as they relax,

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.050 align:middle line:90%
and you let go completely.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.490 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.120 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful day.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.620 align:middle line:84%
You move the light from the
sun into the throat area,

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.000 align:middle line:84%
feeling the warmth of the light
from the sun in your throat.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Relaxing all the muscles, just
letting go completely now.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.850 align:middle line:90%


00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And the warm sunlight now
moving into your shoulders

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and across your
shoulders, making them

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:38.560 align:middle line:84%
feel loose and limp
and comfortable

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.950 align:middle line:84%
as your shoulders sink into
the frame of your body.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.320 align:middle line:90%


00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.780 align:middle line:90%
And you feel so comfortable now.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.180 align:middle line:90%
So relaxed and at peace.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.730 align:middle line:90%


00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And you let nothing bother
or concern you at all.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.750 align:middle line:90%


00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And you direct the light from
the sun down your right arm,

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.255 align:middle line:84%
from the shoulders to
the tips of your fingers.

00:06:13.255 --> 00:06:15.760 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.110 align:middle line:84%
The right arm begins
to relax and let go.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.170 align:middle line:90%


00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful feeling
to be here right now.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.610 align:middle line:90%


00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.700 align:middle line:84%
The warmth of the
light from the sun

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.870 align:middle line:84%
penetrates the nerves and bones
and muscles of the right arm.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:40.790 align:middle line:90%


00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.470 align:middle line:90%
And it's such a beautiful day.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.780 align:middle line:84%
You move the sun
over to your left arm

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:54.670 align:middle line:84%
and guide the light from the
sun down and up your left arm,

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:59.080 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your
shoulders all the way down

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.490 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your fingers.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.270 align:middle line:90%


00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:07.450 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the
left arm relaxing,

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:12.795 align:middle line:84%
become comfortably heavy
and totally relaxed.

00:07:12.795 --> 00:07:18.340 align:middle line:90%


00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, move that warm light
across and into the chest area.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.060 align:middle line:90%


00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And relax the chest and
all the muscles there.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.310 align:middle line:90%


00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Now down to the stomach,
relaxing your tummy,

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:40.502 align:middle line:84%
down into your hips and your
thighs, over to your right leg.

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:44.120 align:middle line:90%


00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:49.080 align:middle line:84%
The light warms the muscles
as you relax your right leg.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Let it feel comfortable
and heavy now.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.640 align:middle line:90%


00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And move the light from the
sun down your right leg,

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:03.160 align:middle line:84%
up and down from the top of the
hips to the tips of your toes,

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.216 align:middle line:84%
as the right leg
relaxes and you let go.

00:08:07.216 --> 00:08:13.410 align:middle line:90%


00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a beautiful
day, you now move the light

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.200 align:middle line:90%
into your left leg.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.930 align:middle line:84%
You move it up and down the left
leg, from the top of the hips

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:26.670 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And your left leg relaxes,
releasing tension,

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:34.530 align:middle line:90%
letting go now completely.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:38.500 align:middle line:90%


00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Your whole body is now totally
and completely relaxed,

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.930 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your
head all the way down

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.355 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:08:49.355 --> 00:08:53.280 align:middle line:90%


00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And as your body relaxes,
your mind also relaxes.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.620 align:middle line:90%


00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And I want you now to
notice that the sun is

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.240 align:middle line:90%
setting, going down now.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.760 align:middle line:90%
Deeper and deeper down.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And you're so deeply
relaxed, but still completely

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.400 align:middle line:90%
alert and aware.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.540 align:middle line:90%


00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.810 align:middle line:84%
You resist the temptation
to fall asleep.

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is thoroughly
relaxed, but you

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:27.760 align:middle line:90%
stay focused on these words.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:32.170 align:middle line:90%


00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.790 align:middle line:84%
So now, I'd like you to
use your imagination.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And once again, you're in a
wonderful place in nature.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:44.890 align:middle line:84%
The trees are a
beautiful shade of green.

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:47.840 align:middle line:84%
It's a stunning day, and the
sun is shining down on you.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.420 align:middle line:90%


00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:55.260 align:middle line:84%
There's a soft and
gentle breeze in the air,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.065 align:middle line:84%
making you feel pleasantly
relaxed and calm.

00:09:58.065 --> 00:10:01.670 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:05.800 align:middle line:84%
All around, you can see
trees and plants and an array

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:11.100 align:middle line:84%
of the most beautiful
flowers you have ever seen,

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.520 align:middle line:90%
so colorful and vibrant.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And you can smell the rich
aroma of these flowers,

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.170 align:middle line:90%
making you feel so peaceful.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:24.750 align:middle line:90%


00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.570 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else matters right now.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.410 align:middle line:84%
You feel completely
at ease and so calm.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.400 align:middle line:90%


00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And in the distance, you
can hear the sound of water

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.280 align:middle line:90%
flowing slowly and gently.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.300 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.600 align:middle line:84%
The sound of water is helping
you to go more and more deeply

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.400 align:middle line:90%
relaxed.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.270 align:middle line:90%


00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:53.000 align:middle line:84%
You may feel your muscles
loosening more and more,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.795 align:middle line:84%
relaxing with the beautiful
flowing sound of water.

00:10:55.795 --> 00:11:00.700 align:middle line:90%


00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.105 align:middle line:84%
Out of curiosity, you decide to
follow the sound of the water.

00:11:04.105 --> 00:11:06.900 align:middle line:90%


00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And you feel excited about where
it's leading you, knowing deep

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:16.380 align:middle line:84%
within yourself you're going
to a very special place,

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:17.990 align:middle line:84%
a place where you're
going to create

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.240 align:middle line:84%
some positive, wonderful,
long-lasting changes.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.700 align:middle line:90%


00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:29.990 align:middle line:84%
As you walk slowly
towards the water,

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:34.950 align:middle line:84%
you can hear the sound of
birds singing in the trees.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:36.814 align:middle line:90%
You feel totally at ease.

00:11:36.814 --> 00:11:40.530 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.710 align:middle line:84%
As you finally
reach the lake, you

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:48.450 align:middle line:84%
realize it's the most beautiful
vision you've ever seen.

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And you're in awe of the
beauty that surrounds you.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.290 align:middle line:90%


00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.770 align:middle line:84%
The vast lake is
filled with a variety

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:04.820 align:middle line:84%
of colors, rich colors of blues,
turquoise, and light greens.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And it fills your mind and
body with a wave of relaxation.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:11.400 align:middle line:90%


00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:15.080 align:middle line:84%
You may be becoming more relaxed
with each and every breath

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:23.330 align:middle line:84%
you take, feeling more calm,
more peaceful, and more

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:24.855 align:middle line:90%
relaxed than ever before.

00:12:24.855 --> 00:12:28.640 align:middle line:90%


00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Your mind may be
drifting in and out,

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.705 align:middle line:84%
just letting go, deeper
and deeper still.

00:12:34.705 --> 00:12:37.250 align:middle line:90%


00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:42.080 align:middle line:84%
You may feel as though your
mind is flowing gently,

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.030 align:middle line:84%
flowing gently like the
lake in your imagination.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:48.740 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.940 align:middle line:84%
You look into the distance and
you can see a wooden bridge

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.220 align:middle line:90%
leading over the lake.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.070 align:middle line:90%


00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:58.760 align:middle line:84%
You walk towards the bridge,
feeling more and more

00:12:58.760 --> 00:12:59.745 align:middle line:90%
deeply relaxed.

00:12:59.745 --> 00:13:02.380 align:middle line:90%


00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:04.110 align:middle line:84%
As you reach the
bridge, you can see

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:07.830 align:middle line:84%
there are 10 steps leading over
to the other side of the lake.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:11.870 align:middle line:90%


00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:15.560 align:middle line:84%
You slowly start
walking over the bridge,

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.215 align:middle line:90%
counting the steps in your mind.

00:13:17.215 --> 00:13:20.000 align:middle line:90%


00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:31.810 align:middle line:84%
10, 9, deeper and
deeper still, 8, 7,

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:36.460 align:middle line:84%
all the way down
to relaxation now,

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:46.600 align:middle line:84%
6, 5, and 4, drifting off
peacefully and easily,

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:56.480 align:middle line:84%
3, 2, all the way down,
deeply relaxed, and 1.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.720 align:middle line:84%
You see a comfortable
padded chair

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.910 align:middle line:84%
and you take a seat,
ready to embrace

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:06.090 align:middle line:84%
the changes to come in your
deep state of relaxation now.

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:09.030 align:middle line:90%


00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And for a while
now, you may have

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.710 align:middle line:84%
been feeling like you're a
fraud and everyone is not

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:17.620 align:middle line:90%
convinced by your abilities.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.530 align:middle line:90%


00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:22.270 align:middle line:84%
You may have felt
like you've been

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:29.420 align:middle line:84%
faking it or winging it, working
things out as you go along.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.760 align:middle line:90%
Thinking, have people noticed?

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.540 align:middle line:90%
Or am I going to get found out?

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:37.550 align:middle line:90%


00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And the first step to feeling
better about this situation

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:46.150 align:middle line:84%
is to realize that a
lot of other people

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.960 align:middle line:84%
also suffer from
exactly the same thing.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.530 align:middle line:90%


00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Everyone at some
point in their lives

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:58.440 align:middle line:84%
feel like they, too, aren't
good enough or talented enough

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.280 align:middle line:90%
at something.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.580 align:middle line:90%


00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And when you feel
like a fraud, it's

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:09.325 align:middle line:84%
in relation to some perfection
that never actually exists.

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:13.050 align:middle line:90%


00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:18.230 align:middle line:84%
So you start to let
go of perfection now

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:21.950 align:middle line:84%
and thinking you must know and
be the best at everything you

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:27.320 align:middle line:84%
do, helping you feel
like less of a failure.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:32.670 align:middle line:90%


00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:36.105 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is that
nobody is perfect.

00:15:36.105 --> 00:15:40.470 align:middle line:90%


00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:42.770 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
people who will tell you

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:43.955 align:middle line:90%
that they know the answers.

00:15:43.955 --> 00:15:47.260 align:middle line:90%


00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is that
these people don't always

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.820 align:middle line:90%
know the answers.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes,
they're winging it.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they give things
to try and work things

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:57.090 align:middle line:90%
out as they go along.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:00.160 align:middle line:90%


00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And instead of worrying about
what you can and can't do,

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:10.950 align:middle line:84%
you start to think
about your successes,

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:14.610 align:middle line:84%
for we feel like frauds when
we're unable to internalize

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:15.690 align:middle line:90%
our successes.

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:18.360 align:middle line:90%


00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.480 align:middle line:84%
So take a moment now
to think about tasks

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:30.100 align:middle line:84%
you've completed well, past
successes in your life,

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.280 align:middle line:84%
things that you've achieved
that you're proud of.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.820 align:middle line:90%


00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And you know that you've been
given an opportunity at work

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:44.400 align:middle line:84%
that others want, or you
wouldn't be in the role

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.360 align:middle line:90%
that you're in now.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.320 align:middle line:90%


00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And you're doing a
great job, and start

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:56.800 align:middle line:84%
to see that people think
very highly of you.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.770 align:middle line:84%
You feel at ease and
at peace with yourself

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:01.090 align:middle line:90%
and your abilities now.

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:05.180 align:middle line:90%


00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Reminding yourself of all
your previous successes

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.750 align:middle line:84%
helps you to also
remember the nice things

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.849 align:middle line:90%
people have said about you.

00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:19.930 align:middle line:84%
Thanking you, complimenting
you, praising you,

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:22.819 align:middle line:90%
and seeking your advice.

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:25.339 align:middle line:84%
Listening to you and
following your lead.

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:29.320 align:middle line:90%


00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.020 align:middle line:84%
Reminding yourself
of those nice words

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.820 align:middle line:90%
helps your confidence to soar.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:39.420 align:middle line:90%


00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Your past successes
and compliments

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:45.090 align:middle line:84%
increase your
self-confidence threefold

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:47.670 align:middle line:84%
as you say to
yourself repeatedly,

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:49.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing a great job.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.580 align:middle line:90%


00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And now, instead of
comparing yourself

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:58.900 align:middle line:84%
to others, as you know that
no two people are the same

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.560 align:middle line:84%
and no one else is
perfect, you believe

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.870 align:middle line:84%
that your own
knowledge and expertise

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.510 align:middle line:90%
is unique to only you.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:09.050 align:middle line:90%


00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:12.680 align:middle line:84%
So you stop comparing
yourself to others,

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.440 align:middle line:84%
knowing that you
yourself have everything

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:22.430 align:middle line:84%
you need to complete any task,
and you do your job well.

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:28.540 align:middle line:84%
You start to forgive and allow
yourself to make more mistakes.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:33.600 align:middle line:84%
You know that being wrong
doesn't make you a fake.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.290 align:middle line:84%
The best football
teams inevitably lose,

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:40.640 align:middle line:90%
so you stop glorifying failure.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.000 align:middle line:90%
It's OK to be wrong.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And you don't let mistakes
knock your confidence.

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Instead, you put it down to
a great learning experience

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:50.780 align:middle line:90%
and you move on.

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:53.950 align:middle line:90%


00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:59.210 align:middle line:84%
You start to accept who you are
and what you can offer people,

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:04.660 align:middle line:84%
feeling self-assured and
confident in your abilities.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Giving everything a
try, as you know you're

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:11.905 align:middle line:84%
not an imposter for trying
something that might not work.

00:19:11.905 --> 00:19:14.830 align:middle line:90%


00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And as you take on
board everything

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:22.830 align:middle line:84%
that's said to you today, you
change your internal dynamic,

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.530 align:middle line:84%
keeping your thoughts
positive about yourself

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and your abilities,
stopping yourself the minute

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:35.860 align:middle line:84%
you hear your internal
dialogue becoming negative.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:38.560 align:middle line:84%
You keep your thoughts
positive about yourself

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.020 align:middle line:90%
and about your abilities.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.680 align:middle line:90%


00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:48.870 align:middle line:84%
You know that negative thinking
has no benefit in your life.

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:52.370 align:middle line:84%
It serves you no purpose
at all, so you let it go.

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:55.530 align:middle line:90%


00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And when I click my fingers,
count to 3, and say "now,"

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:04.330 align:middle line:84%
you'll let go of any negative
thinking you have of yourself.

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:07.620 align:middle line:90%

Now.

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:12.585 align:middle line:84%
Let go of all those negative
thoughts about yourself.

00:20:12.585 --> 00:20:17.320 align:middle line:90%


00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:22.000 align:middle line:84%
From now on in, you're
confident, ambitious, relaxed,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.185 align:middle line:90%
focused, and driven.

00:20:23.185 --> 00:20:26.200 align:middle line:90%


00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.510 align:middle line:84%
You accept your
strengths and weaknesses,

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:32.920 align:middle line:84%
as you know that you're
doing a great job.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.280 align:middle line:84%
You reward yourself
for your successes

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:40.480 align:middle line:84%
and you move on quickly
from any mistakes.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.340 align:middle line:84%
You know that your
future's bright,

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:45.310 align:middle line:84%
and you have lots of
successes coming your way.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And this pleases you and
fills you with confidence.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.420 align:middle line:90%


00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.310 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:56.040 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and will become more
and more powerful

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.510 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from 1 to 5

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:06.410 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of 5, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.770 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling
fantastic, bringing back

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:14.700 align:middle line:84%
with you all the
wonderful new feelings.

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:15.620 align:middle line:90%
Coming back now.

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:21.200 align:middle line:90%
So 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.950 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:30.000 align:middle line:90%
