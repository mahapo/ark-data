00:00:03.976 --> 00:00:13.916 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.916 --> 00:00:17.910 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Ooh, it's bright up here.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.270 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Well, good
morning, everyone.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.480 align:middle line:84%
I hope that you are
enjoying yourselves.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And I have a feeling
that this has

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.205 align:middle line:84%
been a very mind-expanding
conference so far.

00:00:30.205 --> 00:00:31.005 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, I hope that we will add to
that mind-expansion experience

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.370 align:middle line:90%
here today.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.820 align:middle line:84%
Just to give you a little
bit about my background.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.220 align:middle line:84%
As you heard, I have
a PhD in Physics.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And as I was immersing
myself into the world

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.040 align:middle line:84%
of left-brain science and
doing 80 hours of physics

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.970 align:middle line:84%
a week between research
and study and testing

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.270 align:middle line:84%
and all of the
graduate school grind,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.200 align:middle line:84%
I found myself thrown from
having a life of diversity

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.440 align:middle line:84%
prior into a life
of only one thing.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
left-brain science.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And that put me into a state
of feeling like something

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.600 align:middle line:90%
got really thrown off balance.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like something
is really missing.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm not feeling happy.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.500 align:middle line:90%
I found myself depressed.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.440 align:middle line:10%
And that set me on a
search, and that search

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.110 align:middle line:10%
was what's going to restore the
sense of meaning and well being

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.670 align:middle line:10%
and balance back into my life.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.040 align:middle line:10%
And that search
ultimately led me

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.960 align:middle line:10%
to rediscovering the importance
of a form of metaphysics

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.120 align:middle line:10%
or spirituality as
something deeper

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.530 align:middle line:10%
that brings the meaning into why
we even do all of this science

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.180 align:middle line:10%
and research and so forth.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I dove in
to the world of--

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.750 align:middle line:84%
anywhere where we could
find that intersection

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.270 align:middle line:84%
between science and
consciousness, science

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.360 align:middle line:90%
and spirituality.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And as a scientist, one of the
things that really inspires us

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.800 align:middle line:84%
is to try and really
understand the deeper

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.070 align:middle line:90%
mysteries of the universe.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.200 align:middle line:90%
How does the universe work?

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.880 align:middle line:90%
How did it come to be?

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And who are we in relationship
to everything else

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.140 align:middle line:90%
that is around us?

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And also, how can
we understand things

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.280 align:middle line:90%
at the most fundamental level?

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.760 align:middle line:10%
That quantum level, the
most basic ingredients

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.210 align:middle line:10%
of how this universe works, how
creation happens, and so forth.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.760 align:middle line:10%
And so the further
I went into science,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.170 align:middle line:10%
the more I realized that there
is such a beauty, a harmony,

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.470 align:middle line:10%
to how this universe is
built. And there's so many

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.360 align:middle line:10%
things that it's like
everything was so finely tuned.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.010 align:middle line:10%
It was almost too perfect
not to be intelligent.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.380 align:middle line:10%
So there was this
intelligence that I

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.280 align:middle line:10%
kept seeing throughout
the creation, the design

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.470 align:middle line:10%
of our universe,
that to me, it just

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.520 align:middle line:10%
reinforced that there
is something beyond,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.110 align:middle line:10%
something purposeful.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.400 align:middle line:10%
Not just information, but
purposeful information

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.010 align:middle line:10%
that has gone into the
creation of this universe.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.770 align:middle line:10%
And then as I explore deeply
into the ancient wisdom

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.680 align:middle line:10%
teachings-- and in particular,
I found my resonance

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.760 align:middle line:10%
in the Western traditions
of hermetics and alchemy

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.780 align:middle line:10%
and the Kabbalistic teachings
and the Western mystery school

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.550 align:middle line:10%
tradition--

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.950 align:middle line:10%
there was, again,
this depth that I

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.320 align:middle line:10%
found around the
creation of the universe.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And I found that these
ancient wisdom teachings

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.480 align:middle line:84%
were reflecting to us the same
teachings and the same concepts

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.090 align:middle line:84%
that modern science
was coming around

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.840 align:middle line:84%
to again but from a
technological and theoretical

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.160 align:middle line:90%
and scientific perspective.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.930 align:middle line:84%
But the ancient
wisdom teachings had

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.710 align:middle line:90%
that for thousands of years.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.030 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, what else do
they know that could guide us?

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.590 align:middle line:10%
Because we are on the
precipice of a great leap

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.830 align:middle line:10%
technologically,
societally, but also

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.210 align:middle line:10%
within human consciousness.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.340 align:middle line:10%
We are on this precipice
of a great leap.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.020 align:middle line:10%
And we need to make that
leap because if we don't, you

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.000 align:middle line:10%
can see the way the
world's been going.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.710 align:middle line:10%
And it's getting more and
more chaotic and destructive.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.670 align:middle line:10%
But great chaos sometimes
precedes great growth.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.490 align:middle line:10%
So we are right
at this precipice.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:20.269 align:middle line:10%
And I have believed and
felt for a long time,

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.460 align:middle line:10%
I've been doing this
work now with bridging

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.890 align:middle line:10%
the science and the
spiritual for over 20 years.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And we need the wisdom to
come back in to guide us.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.170 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, we can be making these
technological advancements.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.740 align:middle line:10%
But if we don't have the
wisdom for how to apply it

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.860 align:middle line:10%
in a way that really serves
the greater good of the whole,

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.890 align:middle line:10%
then we will go on a
course of self destruction

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.770 align:middle line:10%
rather than making that
leap into the potential

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.750 align:middle line:10%
that we have as a human race.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.900 align:middle line:84%
So with this
presentation-- and I

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.690 align:middle line:84%
have a lot to cover in
a little bit of time.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.270 align:middle line:84%
Now you can find a
lot of these teachings

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.940 align:middle line:84%
and I dive deeper
into it on my show

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.950 align:middle line:84%
on Gaia TV called
"Mystery Teachings."

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.420 align:middle line:84%
There's four
seasons worth of it,

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.360 align:middle line:84%
and we cover a broad
array of topics.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And also, you might find me on
some of the other shows on Gaia

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:09.780 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Now some of what I
want to explore here

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.260 align:middle line:84%
really is, we've been
talking a lot about history,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.350 align:middle line:90%
ancient history and the past.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.000 align:middle line:84%
But I'd like to talk
about who are we now,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.180 align:middle line:84%
and what is the potential of
what we're here to become?

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.370 align:middle line:90%
And, yes, where do we come from?

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.980 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
where do we come from even

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.330 align:middle line:90%
beyond this physical.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.580 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into
some of the metaphysical,

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.230 align:middle line:90%
and I'll define what that means.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.810 align:middle line:10%
But these are some of the
most important questions

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.790 align:middle line:10%
that the ancient
mysteries teach us

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.050 align:middle line:10%
that we should be asking
ourselves is, who are we?

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.850 align:middle line:10%
What are we?

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.120 align:middle line:10%
What is our potential?

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.963 align:middle line:10%
What is our purpose?

00:05:45.963 --> 00:05:46.880 align:middle line:10%
Where do we come from?

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.010 align:middle line:10%
Where are we going and why?

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.640 align:middle line:10%
Why are we here?

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And when we can come to know
the answers to these questions

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.120 align:middle line:84%
and the deeper
answers because they

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.580 align:middle line:84%
have many, many
different answers,

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.280 align:middle line:84%
then we can start
tapping into an awakening

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.655 align:middle line:90%
that potential that's within us.

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And so in this
presentation, I'll

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.040 align:middle line:84%
be sharing with you
some of the wisdom that

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.870 align:middle line:84%
comes from the hermetic
teachings, which is over,

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.040 align:middle line:84%
at least 8,000 years, goes
back to Thoth and Hermes

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.030 align:middle line:90%
Trismegistus.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'll also be
sharing with you

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.830 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of what's called
the Universal Hermetic Ray

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.680 align:middle line:84%
kabbalah from the
Mystery School Teachings.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And we'll explore our relation
to the Galactic sourcing

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.270 align:middle line:84%
from a different level,
from a different dimension.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Now first of all, when
it comes to metaphysics,

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.650 align:middle line:84%
we have to also talk
about something that

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.570 align:middle line:90%
is beyond the physical, right?

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.160 align:middle line:90%
We could call it spiritual.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.110 align:middle line:84%
We could call it
a divine source.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.790 align:middle line:90%
There is some intelligence.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.760 align:middle line:84%
That intelligence that
is behind the universe

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.140 align:middle line:84%
or beyond the
physical dimension.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.600 align:middle line:10%
So when I talk
about it here though

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.130 align:middle line:10%
from a hermetic
perspective, it's

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.150 align:middle line:10%
not going to be about religion.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:58.490 align:middle line:10%
This is not about the God forms
that we've been sharing here

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.510 align:middle line:10%
that maybe weren't really gods
but extraterrestrial or other

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.620 align:middle line:10%
beings, maybe humans.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:09.020 align:middle line:10%
They-- this is a
universal source.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.100 align:middle line:10%
It's more abstract.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.070 align:middle line:10%
It is beyond what
we often think about

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.960 align:middle line:10%
in our religious traditions.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:23.340 align:middle line:10%
And hermetic-- the original word
hermetic actually means pure.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.140 align:middle line:90%
It means pure.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.390 align:middle line:84%
So when something is
hermetically sealed,

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:27.980 align:middle line:90%
it is-- nothing gets in.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.450 align:middle line:90%
It's unpolluted.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:34.550 align:middle line:84%
It remains very pure and
nondogmatic and unpolluted.

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:39.260 align:middle line:10%
So we want to work with
this hermetic idea of what

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.920 align:middle line:10%
are those universal principles
that transcend the dogma, that

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.890 align:middle line:10%
transcend the religion,
transcend culture,

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:50.575 align:middle line:10%
transcend even just one
human interpretation or way

00:07:50.575 --> 00:07:51.450 align:middle line:10%
of thinking about it.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:55.080 align:middle line:10%
We can see it written all
over nature and the universe.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to
metaphysics, what is it?

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.920 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's beyond the physical.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.060 align:middle line:90%
Meta, meaning beyond.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.415 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes also
meaning in between.

00:08:04.415 --> 00:08:07.400 align:middle line:84%
If you think of what is in
between the particles that

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.790 align:middle line:84%
make up the atoms of our
being, well, it's empty space.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.910 align:middle line:84%
But within that empty
space is the quantum field.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And that is where we
can find that bridge

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.400 align:middle line:84%
between the physical and the
metaphysical or the spiritual.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.700 align:middle line:84%
So metaphysics is
really the science

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.370 align:middle line:84%
of the inward and essential
nature of things--

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.620 align:middle line:84%
this is the original
meaning of it--

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.960 align:middle line:84%
or the study of the
first causes of things.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.990 align:middle line:84%
So it is beyond just
talking about spiritual.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:37.700 align:middle line:84%
It's about really
talking about how

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.289 align:middle line:90%
is it-- how did it all begin?

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:43.320 align:middle line:84%
What is the essence of
what we are made of?

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And in all the ancient
spiritual traditions

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.030 align:middle line:84%
and metaphysical traditions,
they say, know thyself, right?

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.830 align:middle line:10%
Above the doors of all
the ancient mystery

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:55.940 align:middle line:10%
schools were the words know
thyself or thine own self thou

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.390 align:middle line:10%
must know, because
they believed that we

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:04.220 align:middle line:10%
are the microcosm that is a
reflection of the macrocosm.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.200 align:middle line:10%
If we were made in the
image of the divine

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:12.830 align:middle line:10%
or if we have a holographic
replication of the universe

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.620 align:middle line:10%
within us, which indeed
we do, and the more you

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:20.150 align:middle line:10%
study our essence and we
have more cells in our body,

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.800 align:middle line:10%
for example, than there
are stars in the universe,

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.920 align:middle line:10%
we are cosmic beings within us.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.840 align:middle line:84%
We're even made
of that stardust.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And so the reflection of the
whole universe is within us.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.842 align:middle line:84%
So the more we come
to know ourselves,

00:09:33.842 --> 00:09:35.300 align:middle line:84%
the more we will
know the universe.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:39.140 align:middle line:84%
The more we know who we really
are at an essential level.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.560 align:middle line:84%
The more we can understand
the divine source.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And so here we want
to know ourselves.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.210 align:middle line:84%
So this brings us to those
questions again-- who am I?

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:49.010 align:middle line:90%
Where am I?

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.040 align:middle line:90%
What am I?

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.030 align:middle line:90%
Where do I come from?

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.370 align:middle line:90%
Where am I going?

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:58.070 align:middle line:10%
And so in the hermetic
teachings, now this--

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:00.110 align:middle line:10%
some of these quotes that
I'll be giving to you

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:01.130 align:middle line:10%
are from The Kybalion.

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.320 align:middle line:10%
Now The Kybalion was not
published that long ago,

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:08.120 align:middle line:10%
but the teachings themselves
are of an oral tradition

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.230 align:middle line:10%
that is very ancient.

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:11.660 align:middle line:10%
And these universal
principles they talk about,

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:15.080 align:middle line:10%
the hermetic
principles, are just--

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.190 align:middle line:10%
they're scientific, as well
as ancient mystery teachings.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And they say the
very first principle

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.670 align:middle line:90%
is that the All is mind.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And so in the
hermetic teachings,

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.070 align:middle line:90%
they say the source is the All.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.740 align:middle line:84%
They don't anthropomorphize
it or make it

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:35.570 align:middle line:84%
into some human-like being
or some god-like figure

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:37.040 align:middle line:90%
like you see in the pantheons.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.260 align:middle line:84%
They say it's just
the All, right?

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And the All is mind, or we could
say the All is intelligence.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:44.130 align:middle line:90%
It is consciousness.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.530 align:middle line:90%
It is eternal.

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And this mind, this All, creates
universes within its own mind,

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.100 align:middle line:90%
within its own mentality.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And there are
millions and millions

00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:00.560 align:middle line:84%
of such universes within
the mind of the All.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Now millions and
millions of universes,

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:06.680 align:middle line:84%
to me as a physicist, this is
talking about the multiverse.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.830 align:middle line:84%
This is talking
about the many worlds

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:11.960 align:middle line:84%
interpretation of
quantum physics

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.640 align:middle line:84%
that there are so
many universes.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.980 align:middle line:84%
They're not just this universe
that we're talking about.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.390 align:middle line:90%
There are many.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:18.840 align:middle line:90%
So then who are we?

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.640 align:middle line:90%
What are we?

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.715 align:middle line:84%
Where do we fit within
this mind of the All?

00:11:22.715 --> 00:11:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Or we could say that we
are also part of that.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.250 align:middle line:84%
We are one with that, because
everything that comes to be,

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:29.914 align:middle line:90%
comes from that--

00:11:29.914 --> 00:11:34.520 align:middle line:84%
that Intention, that
original intention.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And so this intelligent energy,
eternal essence, eternal being,

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:44.940 align:middle line:84%
pure awareness,
these are other ways

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.440 align:middle line:90%
that we can talk about this.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.390 align:middle line:90%
Who we are is that.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.280 align:middle line:84%
We are not these
physical bodies.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.060 align:middle line:84%
So these bodies are
like rental vehicles.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Our intelligence, our
pure awareness, spirit,

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:00.990 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want
to call it came here

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.990 align:middle line:84%
through eons and eons
and eons of journey

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:07.590 align:middle line:84%
and is here on this Earth
for a short experience.

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And we pick up these rental
vehicles called bodies.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Who cares who
engineered these bodies.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:14.640 align:middle line:84%
They're just here
for us to borrow them

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.520 align:middle line:84%
for an amount of time so that
we can have an experience here

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.020 align:middle line:90%
at this dimension.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
understand that there

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:26.010 align:middle line:84%
is so much more going on
than just the physical.

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.680 align:middle line:90%
And so where are we, right?

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:32.170 align:middle line:84%
We might get the impression
that we are here,

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:35.650 align:middle line:84%
that we're here in this physical
body, we're here in this room.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.280 align:middle line:10%
But in the hermetic
teachings, they

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:43.740 align:middle line:10%
say that you are dwelling in
the infinite mind of the All.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.200 align:middle line:10%
And your possibilities
and opportunities

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.900 align:middle line:10%
are infinite in
both time and space.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.850 align:middle line:10%
Infinite, right?

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.620 align:middle line:84%
So let's start
stretching our mind

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:56.700 align:middle line:84%
to those infinite possibilities
beyond just what we perceive

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.590 align:middle line:84%
with these limited
rental vehicles

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:01.740 align:middle line:84%
called bodies, because
these are very limited.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Just as an example, you
have what we see, right?

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.840 align:middle line:84%
What we see in the
visible light spectrum.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.230 align:middle line:84%
That rainbow
spectrum that we see,

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:17.280 align:middle line:84%
that is 1% of the
electromagnetic spectrum

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.690 align:middle line:84%
that our scientists
are even aware of.

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.890 align:middle line:84%
So our eyes detect 1% of the
electromagnetic spectrum.

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Now we know that there's
other things there.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.290 align:middle line:84%
For example, how
many of you have

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:30.640 align:middle line:90%
cell phones in your pockets?

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.260 align:middle line:90%
Everybody here, yeah?

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.400 align:middle line:90%
Probably.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, and we know that
those cell phones pick up

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.530 align:middle line:84%
their signals from
the satellites.

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And then we've got the
Wi-Fi and all of this.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And so all of these
waves of energy,

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:45.430 align:middle line:90%
these are happening all--

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.380 align:middle line:84%
we're bathed in these
energies, right?

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.430 align:middle line:90%
But we don't see them.

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:49.780 align:middle line:90%
We don't necessarily feel them.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Some people maybe do, but
our cell phones pick them up.

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:56.170 align:middle line:84%
So we know that there
are broader ranges.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:14:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And yet in that 1% of the
visible light spectrum,

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:03.370 align:middle line:84%
your eyes perceive it, but
does your conscious mind

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:04.270 align:middle line:90%
register it?

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:05.070 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Maybe 5% to 10% of
your conscious mind

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.665 align:middle line:90%
will register that.

00:14:09.665 --> 00:14:11.290 align:middle line:84%
So now we're talking
that you're seeing

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:14.720 align:middle line:84%
0.1% of the physical
reality around you.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.010 align:middle line:90%
0.1%.

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:20.330 align:middle line:84%
So can you really say
seeing is believing?

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:21.770 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:23.780 align:middle line:90%
And then we filter, right?

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Because our subconscious
mind filters so much

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:28.430 align:middle line:84%
of the information
that's coming in.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's just talking
about the visible light.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.420 align:middle line:90%
Then we have the sound spectrum.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:36.790 align:middle line:84%
We have the spectrum of what we
feel, smell, and taste, and so

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:37.590 align:middle line:90%
forth.

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:40.390 align:middle line:84%
So our five senses, they're
here to help us experience

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:41.390 align:middle line:90%
this physical dimension.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:44.870 align:middle line:84%
But they are by no
means helping us

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:47.030 align:middle line:84%
perceive the totality
of what's going on

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:49.110 align:middle line:90%
in this great universe.

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:52.120 align:middle line:90%
So are we alone?

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:55.870 align:middle line:84%
This is another question that
has been asked many, many times

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:57.010 align:middle line:90%
throughout history.

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:59.710 align:middle line:10%
And in the hermetic
teachings, they

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:03.460 align:middle line:10%
say that there are
beings that even

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.070 align:middle line:10%
in our own little
solar system, there

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:09.020 align:middle line:10%
are regions and plains
of life higher than ours

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:12.130 align:middle line:10%
and beings who, compared to
which we earthbound mortals,

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:17.380 align:middle line:10%
are as the mere slimy lifeforms
that dwell on the oceans bed

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:18.850 align:middle line:10%
when compared to man.

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:21.160 align:middle line:10%
There are beings that
have powers and attributes

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.440 align:middle line:10%
higher than man
has ever conceived

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.300 align:middle line:10%
of the gods possessing.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.490 align:middle line:10%
So, no, we're not alone.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.310 align:middle line:10%
But is that it, or are we
just like these slimy little

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:33.100 align:middle line:10%
lifeforms compared to these
great beings that are out there

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.690 align:middle line:10%
in the realms of the universe?

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:38.620 align:middle line:10%
Well, not yet, not quite, no.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.880 align:middle line:10%
Because they also
say, yet we also--

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.820 align:middle line:10%
these beings were just
as us and even lower.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.120 align:middle line:10%
And we will be even as
they and higher still

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.010 align:middle line:10%
because this is our destiny--

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:53.410 align:middle line:10%
to become even greater, right?

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:58.180 align:middle line:10%
And because of this, Hermes
says that human beings

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:01.030 align:middle line:10%
are a great wonder,
a living thing

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.730 align:middle line:10%
to be even worshipped
and honored.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And we change our
nature into a god's.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:11.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's saying that this immense
possibility and potentiality

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:12.670 align:middle line:90%
is within us.

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And modern science is starting
to discover and rediscover

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.330 align:middle line:84%
this immense possibility
and potentiality within us.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And in the ancient traditions,
the mystery schools

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.540 align:middle line:84%
were all about, how do we
tap in to that potential?

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.240 align:middle line:84%
How do we awaken that
godlike nature within us?

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.250 align:middle line:90%
How do we master ourselves?

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:32.418 align:middle line:84%
And this is not about
hiding your light, guys.

00:16:32.418 --> 00:16:34.210 align:middle line:84%
This is about learning
to shine your light,

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:37.090 align:middle line:84%
learning to master all
the different dimensions

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.340 align:middle line:90%
and elements and aspects of you.

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.460 align:middle line:84%
Because when you do,
you become godlike,

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.070 align:middle line:84%
and nothing will get in
your way at that point.

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:49.520 align:middle line:84%
You can become a human who is
like a superhuman, let's say.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.320 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.650 align:middle line:10%
This is called the hero's
journey in the union tradition

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:57.740 align:middle line:10%
or like Joseph
Campbell talked about.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.323 align:middle line:10%
And so Hermes also--

00:16:59.323 --> 00:17:00.490 align:middle line:10%
I don't have the quote here.

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.280 align:middle line:10%
But Hermes also says
that humans were

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:09.660 align:middle line:10%
ordained to become greater
or better than the gods

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:10.770 align:middle line:10%
with a little g.

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:12.930 align:middle line:10%
And that's because we
have these two natures.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:17.190 align:middle line:10%
We have this immortal and this
mortal, this eternal essence,

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:19.589 align:middle line:10%
the spiritual essence,
and this physical essence.

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:21.119 align:middle line:10%
And because of
those two natures,

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:23.130 align:middle line:10%
we actually are
here on a journey

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:27.240 align:middle line:10%
of discovering how to
transcend that duality,

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.450 align:middle line:10%
how to learn from
the opposite poles,

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:35.190 align:middle line:10%
how to become even greater
by spanning the full spectrum

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:37.500 align:middle line:10%
of possibilities and densities.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.960 align:middle line:90%
And so how do we do that, right?

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.970 align:middle line:90%
Ordained in this sense.

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.720 align:middle line:84%
We were ordained to become
greater is initiated.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.190 align:middle line:90%
Ordained means to be initiated.

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
the mystery school

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:52.960 align:middle line:84%
traditions initiated and trained
people how to tap into that.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.200 align:middle line:84%
So this is where
I find that things

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.800 align:middle line:84%
like personal alchemy and
the Kabbalistic tradition

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.920 align:middle line:84%
can come in, because they give
us a sense of, what can we do?

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.690 align:middle line:90%
How do we do it?

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:08.370 align:middle line:10%
It's very-- the
Kabbalistic tradition--

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:10.260 align:middle line:10%
the Kabbalah means to receive.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.110 align:middle line:10%
It refers to an oral
tradition, but the word also

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:16.230 align:middle line:10%
can be to accept and to reveal.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.200 align:middle line:10%
And so it is these ancient
mysteries that are revealed,

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.450 align:middle line:10%
these wisdom teachings
that are revealed

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.830 align:middle line:10%
to us about who we are.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:26.280 align:middle line:84%
It is ultimately
the study of life

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.340 align:middle line:84%
itself and how we
can master this life.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:37.240 align:middle line:10%
Now, in the oral tradition, see,
so many of the ancient wisdom

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.100 align:middle line:10%
teachings were not handed--

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.960 align:middle line:10%
they were not inscribed.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.360 align:middle line:10%
Some of the stories might
have been inscribed,

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.650 align:middle line:10%
but most of them were
not written down.

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:47.380 align:middle line:10%
They were passed down orally.

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:49.630 align:middle line:10%
And the things that
were written down,

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:52.780 align:middle line:10%
you had to have the oral
tradition, the oral teachings,

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:56.920 align:middle line:10%
to decode and understand those
things that were written.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.530 align:middle line:10%
So much of the
ancient traditions

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:03.280 align:middle line:10%
were an oral passing on
of stories, mythologies.

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.830 align:middle line:84%
But the word myth,
the original meaning--

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:10.600 align:middle line:84%
now today we think of myth as a
false story, like a fairy tale.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.330 align:middle line:84%
But the original
meaning of the word myth

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:16.180 align:middle line:84%
was a story told
by word of mouth

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:20.050 align:middle line:84%
that was considered
to be sacred and true.

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:21.280 align:middle line:90%
Sacred and true.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not scientifically
factual and the way

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:26.380 align:middle line:90%
we think of it today.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:30.130 align:middle line:84%
But mythologies are
the legends that

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:34.040 align:middle line:84%
deliver universal teachings to
us that are sacred and true.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.210 align:middle line:90%
And we need to study them.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:37.150 align:middle line:10%
We need to know them,
understand them,

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:40.180 align:middle line:10%
because they help
us understand life

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.190 align:middle line:10%
and our potential
and our journey

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.410 align:middle line:10%
and what we're here for.

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And so the Tree of Life is
one of the central glyphs

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:49.240 align:middle line:90%
of the Kabbalistic system.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, I work with
the Kabbalistic system

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.020 align:middle line:84%
in a nonreligious,
nondogmatic sense.

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.770 align:middle line:84%
So we work with it
from a place of how

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:59.620 align:middle line:84%
is this something we can
understand universally.

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And the Tree of Life is
like this organizing system.

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:04.630 align:middle line:84%
They say it's this
mother geometry

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:07.000 align:middle line:84%
of all sacred geometries
that all of the universe

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.720 align:middle line:84%
is built on, that we are--
it is also a blueprint of us.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.290 align:middle line:90%
It is a blueprint of creation.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:15.680 align:middle line:84%
It is a blueprint of
our very own DNA, right?

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.490 align:middle line:10%
It is the structure that
our DNA winds itself around.

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:21.010 align:middle line:10%
And that is something I also
talk about in my Mystery

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:22.930 align:middle line:10%
Teaching series on Gaia.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And in the
Kabbalistic tradition,

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:29.660 align:middle line:84%
there are many different
versions of the creation story.

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.163 align:middle line:90%
And I'd like to share with you--

00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:32.830 align:middle line:84%
I was asked to share
with you, actually,

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:35.980 align:middle line:84%
a little bit about something
from the Sefer Yetzirah.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.680 align:middle line:10%
The Sefer Yetzirah is
the Book of Formation.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:41.200 align:middle line:10%
And it's one of the
first Kabbalistic books

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.190 align:middle line:10%
that was committed to writing,
whereas the tradition itself

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:47.740 align:middle line:10%
is an ancient
tradition that's oral.

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:51.340 align:middle line:84%
But here, we had the
first written text

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:55.090 align:middle line:84%
that we know of today
is the Sefer Yetzirah.

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:57.520 align:middle line:10%
Probably written down around
the first century and then

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:01.850 align:middle line:10%
passed down orally, but it's
much more ancient than that.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:04.520 align:middle line:90%
And it is a very short book.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:08.420 align:middle line:84%
It's literally just
30 pages worth.

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:10.950 align:middle line:90%
But it is like a codex.

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:15.390 align:middle line:84%
It is encoded, and it talks
about numbers and letters

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:19.890 align:middle line:84%
and sounds and how these were
used to form the universe.

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:25.620 align:middle line:84%
It talks about how the divine
source created space itself.

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:29.940 align:middle line:10%
A container in which creation
could happen and how then

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.670 align:middle line:10%
these letters and
numbers and sounds

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.430 align:middle line:10%
were the essential
ingredients or building blocks

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.390 align:middle line:10%
that would form all things.

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to share with
you a little bit about this.

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And so one thing that we
need to establish first

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.680 align:middle line:84%
is, in the
Kabbalistic tradition,

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.290 align:middle line:84%
there are actually many
different names used

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:51.090 align:middle line:90%
to refer to the divine.

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Many names of God,
you could say.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.460 align:middle line:84%
But in the-- all
of those are more

00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:00.300 align:middle line:84%
like different aspects of
the divine-- their qualities,

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:03.720 align:middle line:84%
their emanations
from the one source.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:07.350 align:middle line:10%
And that one source that
they ultimately look back to

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.210 align:middle line:10%
is the Ein Sof.

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:12.690 align:middle line:10%
And the Ein Sof or the
Ein Sof means infinite,

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:14.520 align:middle line:10%
limitless without end.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.938 align:middle line:10%
It is the infinite source,
and it is beyond our universe.

00:22:17.938 --> 00:22:19.480 align:middle line:10%
And everything we
could say about it,

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.240 align:middle line:10%
we could say exactly
the opposite as well,

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.160 align:middle line:10%
because everything that comes
to be comes from that source.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.720 align:middle line:10%
So it's very difficult
to define and talk about

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.980 align:middle line:10%
because it is so beyond what our
human brains will conceive of.

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And yet from that
source, they talk

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.770 align:middle line:90%
about these emanations, these--

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:40.813 align:middle line:84%
like extensions or
aspects or rays of light

00:22:40.813 --> 00:22:41.730 align:middle line:90%
that come out from it.

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:43.740 align:middle line:90%
And they talk first about 10.

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.570 align:middle line:90%
The 10 emanations.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:48.600 align:middle line:84%
The 10-- you can think
of as these rings

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.030 align:middle line:84%
of energy coming out
concentrically or different

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:53.160 align:middle line:90%
density levels or dimensions.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.260 align:middle line:84%
But they also look
at this and arrange

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:58.140 align:middle line:84%
those 10 on the Tree of
Life, which are the 10

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.240 align:middle line:90%
circles or the 10 spheres.

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.250 align:middle line:84%
But the Sefer
Yetzirah starts off

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:07.410 align:middle line:84%
by saying in 32 mysterious
paths of wisdom.

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:12.840 align:middle line:10%
Did Jah or God or Ein
Sof engrave its name

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.460 align:middle line:10%
in three Sepharim--

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.410 align:middle line:10%
numbers, letters, and sounds.

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, what are these numbers,
letters, and sounds, right?

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.510 align:middle line:84%
So they say there
are 10 numbers.

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:23.490 align:middle line:90%
10 are the ineffable Sephiroth.

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:28.170 align:middle line:84%
22 are the letters, the
foundation of all things.

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:29.790 align:middle line:10%
And I like to
define this for you

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:31.740 align:middle line:10%
in more-- from a
scientific place.

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So the numbers are like
pure frequency, pure energy.

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And the letters are more
like information patterns,

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:43.560 align:middle line:90%
archetypes, that are more--

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:48.240 align:middle line:84%
a movement, a transition of
energy from one pure energy

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.470 align:middle line:90%
to another pure energy.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:52.810 align:middle line:10%
You have a transitional
process that happens.

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:56.070 align:middle line:10%
And it's a relationship
between those pure states.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And then the sounds are like
the expressions of these numbers

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:03.810 align:middle line:84%
and letters out in a form
that literally shapes matter.

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Now one way of
conceiving of this

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:09.765 align:middle line:84%
is to think of a
broadcasting station.

00:24:09.765 --> 00:24:11.855 align:middle line:84%
In the days when
we had the radio

00:24:11.855 --> 00:24:13.230 align:middle line:84%
and you're tuning
into the radio,

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:16.792 align:middle line:84%
you're tuning into
the TV station, and--

00:24:16.792 --> 00:24:18.750 align:middle line:84%
there might be some people
in the audience that

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:23.353 align:middle line:84%
remember the days where you
had-- what was it, 4 channels

00:24:23.353 --> 00:24:24.270 align:middle line:90%
that you could access?

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:29.890 align:middle line:84%
You had the BBC 1,
BBC 2, IT, IGTV.

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:30.690 align:middle line:90%
Someone--

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:31.490 align:middle line:90%
>> ITV.

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, ITV.

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And then channel 4
came along, right?

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And you have to play
around with the antenna,

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.300 align:middle line:90%
and you got to dial it in.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And we all remember
the days where

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:45.840 align:middle line:90%
you had to dial the radio in.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.490 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes you get static.

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:49.157 align:middle line:84%
And other times you
go, oh, there it is.

00:24:49.157 --> 00:24:51.670 align:middle line:84%
There's that clear
channel right there.

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:54.610 align:middle line:84%
So these numbers,
letters, and sounds--

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:55.410 align:middle line:90%
the source.

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:58.410 align:middle line:84%
You can think of the source
as that central broadcasting

00:24:58.410 --> 00:24:59.700 align:middle line:90%
station.

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And the numbers are
like the channels.

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:07.050 align:middle line:84%
Those channels are dialed into
a particular frequency of energy

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:08.550 align:middle line:90%
that is put out.

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.160 align:middle line:84%
The letters are
like the information

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:15.250 align:middle line:84%
that is being carried
upon that channel.

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:18.960 align:middle line:10%
And then the sounds are like
when you have the receiver that

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:22.770 align:middle line:10%
can tune in to that station and
hear-- you can hear the music,

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:27.780 align:middle line:10%
or you can then perceive
the images on the screen,

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:30.180 align:middle line:10%
transitions it into a
way that we can perceive

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:31.810 align:middle line:10%
in this physical density level.

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:33.040 align:middle line:90%
So this is how they work.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.610 align:middle line:84%
But this is all
energy, ultimately.

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:38.400 align:middle line:84%
So these numbers,
letters, and sounds

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.050 align:middle line:90%
form everything in the universe.

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the
divine source uses.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Energy, patterns of movement,
and archetypal energy

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.620 align:middle line:84%
or information that's
contained within them,

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.050 align:middle line:84%
and then the sounds that
literally shape matter.

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Now if you want a really,
really good exploration

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.700 align:middle line:84%
of how sound shapes
matter, I highly

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.430 align:middle line:84%
encourage you to check out
Sounds of Creation on Gaia.

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:02.490 align:middle line:84%
It's this wonderfully
done new season

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:04.530 align:middle line:84%
or new series that
they have created

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:06.570 align:middle line:90%
around the power of sound.

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's come back
to the 22 letters

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:10.780 align:middle line:90%
as the foundation of all things.

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And they say in
the Sefer Yetzirah

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:17.040 align:middle line:84%
that the divine formed,
weighed, and composed

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:21.390 align:middle line:84%
with these 22 letters everything
that would be created.

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And everything
that shall ever be

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.610 align:middle line:84%
has been-- is created
with these 22 letters.

00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:30.090 align:middle line:10%
So different combinations,
different interactions

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:33.210 align:middle line:10%
of these waves come
together and form

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:38.670 align:middle line:10%
different holographic
patterns that then are

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:40.830 align:middle line:10%
expressed into our universe.

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ways that we
talk about it in Kabbalah

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:46.260 align:middle line:90%
is that the rays--

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:49.630 align:middle line:84%
or sorry, the letters are
like a ray, a ray of energy.

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:51.900 align:middle line:84%
So you could think again of
that broadcasting station.

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.870 align:middle line:84%
So here's a particular
frequency or channel

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:56.040 align:middle line:90%
that you can tune into.

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:56.860 align:middle line:90%
That is a ray.

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:59.760 align:middle line:84%
But in a physics perspective,
we could think of the rays

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.860 align:middle line:90%
as like the string theory.

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:06.750 align:middle line:84%
The strings themselves that
the universe vibrates upon.

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:08.850 align:middle line:84%
So these are not just
letters like we think

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:11.100 align:middle line:90%
about in our language today.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:16.800 align:middle line:84%
These ancient letters were
volumes worth of information

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.480 align:middle line:90%
in one letter.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was an essence
that was captured

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:24.060 align:middle line:84%
in the pattern of the
movement of that letter.

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And so they're building
blocks for creation.

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:28.780 align:middle line:84%
They are-- they have
purpose to them.

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:29.580 align:middle line:90%
They have function.

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:31.710 align:middle line:84%
They have volumes
of information.

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:34.380 align:middle line:84%
They have a vibration,
a unique essence.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Every letter has
a unique essence.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Every ray has a unique
purpose and form and function.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Now we can arrange
these 22 letters.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:45.900 align:middle line:10%
Here, you see them
arranged on octahedron.

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:49.080 align:middle line:10%
And isn't it interesting
that sometimes those UFOs

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:52.470 align:middle line:10%
that appear in this
form, sometimes they

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:54.510 align:middle line:10%
come in this form
of an octahedron?

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:57.720 align:middle line:84%
We can also arrange these
22 letters on a sphere.

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.507 align:middle line:84%
You saw the Tree
of Life earlier.

00:27:59.507 --> 00:28:01.090 align:middle line:84%
We can arrange it
on the Tree of Life.

00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:03.090 align:middle line:84%
So the Kabbalistic
tradition works

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:05.010 align:middle line:84%
with many different
sacred geometries,

00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:08.920 align:middle line:84%
but all of them, ultimately,
are formed by these 22 letters.

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:12.580 align:middle line:84%
We also have the form of a
cube and how the letters are--

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:16.160 align:middle line:84%
and this cube here is
the original container

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:16.960 align:middle line:90%
for creation.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:22.630 align:middle line:84%
It talks about how God sealed
the six directions to create

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:26.660 align:middle line:84%
that container into which
the universe would be built.

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:28.840 align:middle line:10%
So these are full of
intelligent energy.

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:32.690 align:middle line:90%
And that space itself--

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:34.760 align:middle line:84%
spacetime-- the
fabric of spacetime

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.040 align:middle line:84%
itself was created
by these letters.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Now these, where
do they come from?

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going to move
away a little bit here

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.983 align:middle line:84%
from the Sefer
Yetzirah, and I'm going

00:28:41.983 --> 00:28:44.210 align:middle line:84%
to share with you a
Kabbalistic creation story.

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:45.720 align:middle line:10%
This is all oral tradition.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.170 align:middle line:84%
So this is not something
that you'll necessarily

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:49.130 align:middle line:90%
find in the book.

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:50.240 align:middle line:90%
Elements of it, you will.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.850 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to share with
you some of the oral tradition

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:53.660 align:middle line:90%
that I have.

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And this also relates
to how do these 22

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.410 align:middle line:90%
letters come to form us.

00:28:58.410 --> 00:28:59.730 align:middle line:90%
How does this relate to us?

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what,
ultimately, this is all about.

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:06.300 align:middle line:10%
So in the beginning or before
the beginning, we should say,

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:10.920 align:middle line:10%
I like to compare the ends of
the source to a blank canvas.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.640 align:middle line:90%
Everything in nothing.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.440 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.240 align:middle line:84%
It's infinite potentiality,
yet nothing is there.

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And in order for creation
to come into being,

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:23.220 align:middle line:84%
first, the space had to be
created for those somethings

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:24.520 align:middle line:90%
to come to be.

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And so the very first act that
this source, this Ein Sof,

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:31.470 align:middle line:84%
did was to contract, to
withdraw from a space

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:32.530 align:middle line:90%
because it's everywhere.

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:33.960 align:middle line:90%
So it had to withdraw.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:38.070 align:middle line:10%
And it created this
infinitesimally small vacuum--

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:41.280 align:middle line:10%
a little space, a
little tiny dot,

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.010 align:middle line:10%
a reference point at the center.

00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And that reference
point was a vacuum.

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:49.380 align:middle line:84%
It was suddenly a space where
the Ein Sof, the source,

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.180 align:middle line:90%
withdrew from.

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:56.310 align:middle line:84%
But there is nowhere that that
infinite source cannot be.

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:59.260 align:middle line:10%
So the moment that it
withdraws from that space,

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.550 align:middle line:10%
these infinite energy
from the multiverse

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:06.250 align:middle line:10%
starts to rush in
and fill that space.

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:09.990 align:middle line:10%
And so it then has
this infinite rush--

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:12.810 align:middle line:10%
or they actually talk
about 144,000 rays

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:15.300 align:middle line:10%
coming in from the
multiverse, energies

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:21.330 align:middle line:10%
from beyond filling into this
empty void to fill the vacuum.

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:23.400 align:middle line:84%
But then you have
this infinite energy

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:26.550 align:middle line:84%
being stuffed into this
infinitesimally small space.

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And it cannot contain anymore,
and then it explodes out.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And that is when we
then have the Big Bang.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And so this big-- this moment
where all of that energy

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:40.290 align:middle line:84%
came together, all of those rays
of creation from the multiverse

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:43.290 align:middle line:84%
came together, it
forms something

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:46.290 align:middle line:84%
that we call in metaphysics--
or in the mystery school

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:49.260 align:middle line:84%
tradition, we call it
the Great Central Sun.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:51.240 align:middle line:90%
It's where all of it is one.

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:54.750 align:middle line:84%
In Physics, we call it now
the original singularity,

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:59.550 align:middle line:84%
the unified field
before the expansion.

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And in the Sefer
Yetzirah, it actually

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:07.500 align:middle line:84%
calls it the celestial dragon,
the great celestial dragon.

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And they say it is placed
over the universe like a king

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:11.340 align:middle line:90%
upon its throne.

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And here at this
Great Central Sun

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:16.470 align:middle line:84%
are contained all the blueprints
for the whole universe

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:17.740 align:middle line:90%
within it.

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.730 align:middle line:84%
But it's not just
the physical universe

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:22.920 align:middle line:84%
that will come to be all
the stars and the planets

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:24.900 align:middle line:84%
and spacetime
itself and so forth.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:28.200 align:middle line:84%
It is also the
metaphysical blueprints,

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.330 align:middle line:90%
the spiritual blueprints.

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And we are our original
self because we also

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:37.620 align:middle line:90%
come from that eternal essence.

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:38.700 align:middle line:90%
We are there, too.

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:40.920 align:middle line:84%
Our true-- what we might
call our true self,

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:46.320 align:middle line:84%
our original self, resides
here at the Great Central Sun.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.630 align:middle line:90%
And so we can symbolize.

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:52.110 align:middle line:84%
This, actually, is an
eye image from NASA

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:53.940 align:middle line:84%
that shows, from the
perspective of Earth,

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:57.000 align:middle line:84%
the entire visible
known universe.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And-- but we'll demonstrate
with this image here

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:06.090 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual and
physical blueprints

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:08.460 align:middle line:84%
being contained within
this Great Central Sun.

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.110 align:middle line:90%
And we are there, too, right?

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:12.180 align:middle line:84%
This is the home of
our original self.

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:14.640 align:middle line:84%
So again, you are not
this physical body.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.470 align:middle line:90%
The who am I is not this.

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:20.820 align:middle line:84%
It is that infinite
eternal intelligent being.

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And it is-- its home is
the Great Central Sun.

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:25.060 align:middle line:90%
Its home base.

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:27.210 align:middle line:84%
So we can now think of
the Great Central Sun

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:31.470 align:middle line:84%
as that broadcasting station
that sends from the multiverse

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:33.210 align:middle line:90%
out into our universe.

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:34.720 align:middle line:90%
And it sends out.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.130 align:middle line:84%
So here we are at the
Great Central Sun and--

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:39.700 align:middle line:90%
and we are these--

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:41.760 align:middle line:84%
all one-- it's all a
oneness, but there's

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:45.030 align:middle line:84%
all these blueprints and
holographic imprinting

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:48.180 align:middle line:84%
of the potentialities
there within it.

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And you yourself works with
these rays, these 22 building

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:58.560 align:middle line:90%
blocks and archetypal energies.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.590 align:middle line:10%
And then everything,
ultimately, is going

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:03.150 align:middle line:10%
to be built on these things.

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:08.070 align:middle line:10%
So your self, your true
self, sends out broadcasting.

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:11.730 align:middle line:10%
It's like you're the DJ at
the broadcasting station,

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:13.800 align:middle line:10%
and you've got 22
different stations

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.480 align:middle line:10%
that you're broadcasting
out into the universe.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:20.430 align:middle line:10%
So you send out these
emanations or these rays.

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:23.370 align:middle line:10%
And so-- and each one
of them is one of the--

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:25.020 align:middle line:10%
has a different theme, right?

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.850 align:middle line:84%
One of the 22
different archetypes

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:29.220 align:middle line:84%
that are related to
these Hebrew letters.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:31.463 align:middle line:84%
And these go out
into the universe.

00:33:31.463 --> 00:33:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And they don't
just come to Earth.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:35.850 align:middle line:84%
They go out to other star
systems, other planetary

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:37.530 align:middle line:90%
places, and so forth.

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:38.820 align:middle line:90%
And they're sent out.

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And wherever they
land and connect

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:44.700 align:middle line:84%
to a physical celestial
body, they broadcast there.

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And they-- so you have 22
emanations out there somewhere

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:49.720 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And so in a way, our
true self is exploring.

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:56.280 align:middle line:84%
It's not just like
broadcasting information

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:58.050 align:middle line:90%
in a one-way system.

00:33:58.050 --> 00:33:59.940 align:middle line:90%
It's a two-way system.

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:02.380 align:middle line:84%
It's like its tentacles,
it's reaching out,

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:06.510 align:middle line:84%
trying to explore the universe
through these 22 rays,

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:08.489 align:middle line:84%
through these 22
different emanations.

00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, each
one of those rays

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:13.530 align:middle line:84%
has its own intelligence,
its own consciousness,

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:15.540 align:middle line:90%
its own beingness.

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:21.210 align:middle line:84%
So your true self actually
has 22 galactic emanations,

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:24.189 align:middle line:84%
galactic beings, galactic
lives on 22 different stars

00:34:24.189 --> 00:34:24.989 align:middle line:90%
and planets.

00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:30.480 align:middle line:84%
So now we can think of, OK,
these extraterrestrials, maybe

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:34.179 align:middle line:90%
they're related to us.

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:39.100 align:middle line:84%
Not just biologically
but metaphysically.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.929 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we are connected to them.

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:43.270 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's why
they visit us, too.

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Maybe-- just
something to consider.

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:47.469 align:middle line:90%
But this isn't all.

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Not only do you have
22 emanations out there

00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:53.199 align:middle line:84%
from the Great Central Sun out
into the universe exploring.

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Maybe one of them is on
Sirius, and maybe one of them

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:59.970 align:middle line:84%
is out on Jupiter, and maybe
one of them is out at--

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:02.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't know,
Arcturus or something.

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And then they all reflect
their light back to each other

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:07.893 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:35:07.893 --> 00:35:09.310 align:middle line:10%
So in the Sefer
Yetzirah, it talks

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:13.150 align:middle line:10%
about aligning the
22 around the sphere

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:15.550 align:middle line:10%
and connecting every one
with every other one.

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:20.500 align:middle line:10%
And it forms this image here
that we call the 231 gates.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.860 align:middle line:10%
So these all-- they
receive their light

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.440 align:middle line:10%
from the Great Central
Sun at the center.

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:29.020 align:middle line:10%
But then they also
reflect their light

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:30.888 align:middle line:10%
back to the Great
Central Sun, as well as

00:35:30.888 --> 00:35:32.680 align:middle line:10%
back to all the others
that their light can

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:33.730 align:middle line:10%
be reflected to.

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:36.160 align:middle line:10%
And it forms this
interconnected,

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:42.070 align:middle line:10%
quantumly-entangled web
of information that is--

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:46.240 align:middle line:10%
like quantum entanglement
happens, its instantaneous flow

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:50.650 align:middle line:10%
of information that
happens across nonlocally.

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:52.940 align:middle line:10%
Space and time don't limit it.

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:55.870 align:middle line:10%
And so this mandala
that we see here,

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:58.270 align:middle line:10%
the sacred geometric
image, is something

00:35:58.270 --> 00:36:02.740 align:middle line:10%
that is very central
in the Sefer Yetzirah.

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:06.970 align:middle line:10%
And it says these 231
gates of knowledge.

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:08.770 align:middle line:10%
So you take the
22 Hebrew letters,

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:11.560 align:middle line:10%
you align them
around the sphere,

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.260 align:middle line:10%
and arrange them all
together where they

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:15.850 align:middle line:10%
connect with every other one.

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And these are
gates of knowledge.

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:22.990 align:middle line:84%
So your true self is out
there gathering knowledge

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:26.670 align:middle line:84%
from the cosmos
through the archetypes,

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:31.350 align:middle line:84%
through the rays of creation,
the foundation of all things.

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And then they reflect
back to each other.

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And so we have these
quantumly-entangled galactic

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.160 align:middle line:90%
lives.

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:42.510 align:middle line:84%
How many of you have ever
felt a sense of connection

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:45.060 align:middle line:84%
to galactic beings
and maybe even

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:50.160 align:middle line:84%
had a dream or a past-life
recall or something

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.870 align:middle line:84%
where it was like, I was
out there from the stars

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:53.670 align:middle line:90%
at one point.

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:56.170 align:middle line:84%
How many of you have ever had
that kind of an experience?

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:56.970 align:middle line:90%
Few of you?

00:36:56.970 --> 00:36:58.290 align:middle line:84%
I think more of you
probably then are

00:36:58.290 --> 00:36:59.460 align:middle line:90%
willing to raise your hands.

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:00.510 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Because you may not
remember it yet.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.090 align:middle line:90%
But as you awaken, you will.

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:07.590 align:middle line:10%
And that's probably
why you're here,

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:10.080 align:middle line:10%
why you're even interested
in topics like what you're

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.850 align:middle line:10%
hearing about this weekend.

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:13.950 align:middle line:10%
So here we are.

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:18.330 align:middle line:10%
One of these 22 emanations
is here on Earth.

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And so let's come-- let's
come down to Earth now.

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And here we have these rays
of light coming to us from all

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:29.460 align:middle line:84%
these other star systems
that our true self

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:31.650 align:middle line:90%
has some galactic emanation on.

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And they're all feeding
information to us here

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:37.050 align:middle line:90%
on planet Earth.

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And so Earth is receiving all
these broadcasting stations

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.940 align:middle line:84%
from the universe as well,
and there's information

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:46.560 align:middle line:90%
contained within that.

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.110 align:middle line:90%
And our-- what we can call--

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:52.200 align:middle line:84%
for lack of a better
term, we're going

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.630 align:middle line:84%
to call it our higher
self to distinguish it

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:57.025 align:middle line:84%
from our true self that's
on the Great Central Sun.

00:37:57.025 --> 00:37:58.650 align:middle line:84%
We're going to call
it our higher self.

00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:02.725 align:middle line:84%
Now our higher self is here,
overseeing our experience

00:38:02.725 --> 00:38:03.600 align:middle line:90%
on this Earth, right?

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.840 align:middle line:84%
So it is the ray that comes
from the Great Central Sun

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.860 align:middle line:90%
to this Earth.

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And then, also, it's
receiving information

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:13.140 align:middle line:84%
from the other 21
planets or stars

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:15.510 align:middle line:84%
that your other
emanations are on.

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And so your higher
self is here overseeing

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:21.720 align:middle line:84%
all these experiences of
our self here on Earth.

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Now it then takes all that
information from those other 22

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:31.660 align:middle line:84%
archetypes and then emanates it
onto this Earth plane as well.

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is where it starts to
get trippy if it's not already

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:36.960 align:middle line:90%
trippy for you.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:40.650 align:middle line:10%
[CHUCKLES] It's going
to get more because now

00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:44.520 align:middle line:10%
your higher self isn't
just overseeing you.

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:49.840 align:middle line:10%
Your higher self is overseeing
22 versions, 22 parallel lives.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:54.930 align:middle line:10%
Each of those parallel lives
is over-- like kind of colored

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:56.520 align:middle line:10%
by a different archetype.

00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:00.270 align:middle line:10%
Like you could be the
scientists in one parallel life,

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:02.430 align:middle line:10%
you could be the king
or the queen in another,

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:05.550 align:middle line:10%
you could be the bum on
the street in another,

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:08.850 align:middle line:10%
you could be a drug
addict in another.

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:13.470 align:middle line:10%
You have all these different
archetypal lives that you're

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:14.910 align:middle line:10%
living out here just on Earth.

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:17.775 align:middle line:84%
And every one of
those other 22--

00:39:17.775 --> 00:39:21.870 align:middle line:84%
21 planets or star systems that
you're in also have 22, right?

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:24.120 align:middle line:84%
So now we have 22
times 22, and you

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:27.000 align:middle line:84%
have this factorial
combination of all

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.950 align:middle line:84%
these different experiences
that are happening.

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:33.690 align:middle line:84%
So one way of thinking
about this is like a movie.

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:36.000 align:middle line:90%
You have this cineplex.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.807 align:middle line:84%
And in that cineplex, there's
22 different theaters going on,

00:39:38.807 --> 00:39:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and each one of them is
playing a different movie.

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that I do talk

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:45.960 align:middle line:84%
about as well in my Mystery
Teaching series in season 1.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And in this-- so you have 22
different movies going on.

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:53.550 align:middle line:10%
Now your higher self is in
the central control room

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:57.690 align:middle line:10%
that is playing the
different movies and so forth

00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:01.800 align:middle line:10%
and watching them all
at once and redirecting.

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:06.210 align:middle line:84%
It's a live interactive movie
versus just a static movie.

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:10.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's redirecting and
directing and sending out

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:11.490 align:middle line:90%
this information.

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:14.130 align:middle line:84%
But you, your
personality, is sitting

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:15.510 align:middle line:90%
in one of those theaters.

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And you're watching
yourself on that screen,

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:20.610 align:middle line:84%
and you're getting very
caught up in the drama,

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:23.770 align:middle line:84%
that particular character is
going through in that movie.

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:26.680 align:middle line:10%
You know how we can do that
sometimes when we go to a movie

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.890 align:middle line:10%
and we get really
caught up in the--

00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:30.690 align:middle line:10%
we know it's a
character on screen.

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:34.290 align:middle line:10%
But we emote with them,
we might root for them,

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:37.140 align:middle line:10%
we might despise them
depending on the character.

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like we got so
focused on just watching

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:45.300 align:middle line:84%
this one movie that we forgot
that we're at the movie

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:47.400 align:middle line:90%
theater for a time.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And you also forgot that
you are both the director

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:52.410 align:middle line:84%
and the main actor
of that movie.

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:55.830 align:middle line:90%
And you forgot your lines.

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:58.890 align:middle line:84%
So we forgot the script, but
we already wrote it here.

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes
because of that, we

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:05.790 align:middle line:84%
get a bit blinded by
our getting caught up

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:08.160 align:middle line:84%
in the drama of
this physical life.

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And it can be a
bit scary at times

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:11.880 align:middle line:90%
because we forgot the lines.

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:15.360 align:middle line:10%
And so we-- because
of this blinding

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:21.100 align:middle line:10%
of our multidimensionality,
we get into the situation

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.900 align:middle line:10%
where we think, this
is it right here.

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:25.900 align:middle line:84%
This is all there is
to me, but this is not.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:30.010 align:middle line:84%
This is the most minuscule
part of who you are.

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And what we need to do is get
back into that control room

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:36.940 align:middle line:84%
where we can remember
and start to see

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:39.610 align:middle line:84%
the many parallel lives
that are happening,

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:41.650 align:middle line:90%
the many archetypal experiences.

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And could it be possible
that if this is happening

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:48.880 align:middle line:84%
all simultaneously-- and
their timelines could be now,

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:51.490 align:middle line:84%
they could be past,
they could be future.

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:53.050 align:middle line:84%
From the higher
self's perspective,

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:55.840 align:middle line:90%
the timeline isn't so important.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And could it be
then that maybe what

00:41:57.850 --> 00:42:01.000 align:middle line:84%
some people call past-life
recalls could be some of these?

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.780 align:middle line:84%
They could be emanations,
parallel lives,

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:08.560 align:middle line:84%
and where our higher self
and then our true self

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:12.280 align:middle line:84%
is having these infinite
experiences in the universe

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.810 align:middle line:90%
all at once.

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Now when we can start to get
into the movie central control

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.150 align:middle line:84%
room and get into that
perspective of the higher self,

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:26.710 align:middle line:84%
see all the 22, the goal is
to then merge them into one.

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:28.600 align:middle line:10%
And when we say
merge them into one

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.760 align:middle line:10%
is to live a
multidimensional life.

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.590 align:middle line:90%
Like you start to wake up.

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:37.120 align:middle line:84%
You in this one life, you become
all of those 22 archetypes.

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:40.300 align:middle line:84%
You become more
like the superhero.

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:43.840 align:middle line:84%
You become more
multitalented, diverse.

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:46.420 align:middle line:10%
You start doing many
different things,

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:49.000 align:middle line:10%
living 10, 22 lives in one.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And you start having a really
fun, adventurous, and exciting

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.830 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:55.750 align:middle line:84%
Very empowered,
knowing that you're

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:57.550 align:middle line:90%
the center of your creation.

00:42:57.550 --> 00:43:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And this begins a
journey, an adventure.

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:03.280 align:middle line:90%
They call it the hero's journey.

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.500 align:middle line:90%
It's merging the 22 into one.

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's something I share
in a form or a version of it

00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:12.010 align:middle line:84%
in season 4 of
Mystery Teachings.

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:15.370 align:middle line:10%
Now when we move on
from this journey,

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:17.320 align:middle line:10%
the hermetic teachings
say that you shall then

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:21.670 align:middle line:10%
go on and on to higher and
still higher plains for eons

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:26.050 align:middle line:10%
upon eons of time because
this universe is your home.

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:29.050 align:middle line:10%
And you shall explore
its furthest reaches

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:30.740 align:middle line:10%
before the end of time.

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:32.690 align:middle line:10%
So this life isn't it.

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:35.740 align:middle line:10%
This is just one stop on
a journey through eternity

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:40.510 align:middle line:10%
to rediscovering our infinite
potential and multiple

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:41.980 align:middle line:10%
opportunities.

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:45.310 align:middle line:10%
Now one of the
points to this all

00:43:45.310 --> 00:43:50.360 align:middle line:10%
is that we already
are galactic beings,

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:53.660 align:middle line:10%
and we don't need to be in
so much awe of like, them

00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:54.890 align:middle line:10%
out there.

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:57.800 align:middle line:10%
One of the greatest beings
in the entire universe

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:01.770 align:middle line:10%
to be in awe of
is right in here.

00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And you just need
to remember that.

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:06.260 align:middle line:90%
Just tap into that.

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:09.380 align:middle line:84%
The most important
place to focus is here.

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:13.100 align:middle line:10%
So how do we re-awaken to
our galactic potential?

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:16.730 align:middle line:10%
How do we re-awaken to that
fullness, the awareness

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:18.870 align:middle line:10%
of who we really are?

00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:21.650 align:middle line:10%
So it is a journey
of many steps,

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:25.370 align:middle line:10%
and it begins with
one step at a time.

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:28.370 align:middle line:10%
And this is something that
I really work with people on

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:30.930 align:middle line:10%
is, how do we wake into that?

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And I've been mostly doing
a lot of my work in the US,

00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:35.990 align:middle line:90%
but I travel around the world.

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:39.290 align:middle line:84%
But I have just recently
relocated to the UK

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:40.489 align:middle line:90%
in the heart of Yorkshire.

00:44:40.489 --> 00:44:41.289 align:middle line:90%
Yay.

00:44:41.289 --> 00:44:42.089 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:44:42.089 --> 00:44:45.780 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:48.870 align:middle line:84%
So now the-- leading
many, hopefully,

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:51.660 align:middle line:84%
workshops and experiences
and hands-on training.

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Because it's one thing
to read it in a book

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:56.130 align:middle line:84%
or to see it on TV,
but it's another thing

00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:59.020 align:middle line:84%
to immerse yourself in the
direct experience of it.

00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:03.300 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to give you a little
taste of an experience now.

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is a part
of something that--

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:08.880 align:middle line:84%
it's ultimately all
about, knowledge is great.

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.560 align:middle line:84%
But if you can't
apply it to your life

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:12.390 align:middle line:84%
to make a positive
difference in your life,

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:13.710 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't serve you.

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:15.810 align:middle line:84%
Might be interesting,
but it doesn't serve you

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:18.390 align:middle line:84%
if it doesn't make a
positive impact in your life,

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:19.840 align:middle line:90%
to improve your life.

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So I want to give you
an experience so you

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:25.140 align:middle line:90%
can taste the energy of it.

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:26.220 align:middle line:90%
You can taste it.

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:27.840 align:middle line:10%
And this is something
of how we can

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.120 align:middle line:10%
start to awaken to our
multidimensionality

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:33.210 align:middle line:10%
and start merging those
22 archetypes back

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:37.500 align:middle line:10%
into our awareness in
the center of being now.

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:40.280 align:middle line:84%
So to do this, I'm
going to invite

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:46.280 align:middle line:84%
you to look at this image on
the screen of the 231 gates.

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Try to open up
your body position.

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Uncross your legs,
put your hands--

00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:58.010 align:middle line:84%
maybe palm up on
your lap, and just--

00:45:58.010 --> 00:46:00.650 align:middle line:84%
we're going to do an
open-eye meditation.

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:04.040 align:middle line:10%
And the place you want
to look to on this glyph

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:13.570 align:middle line:10%
is to the center point, the
very center of this image.

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:16.140 align:middle line:10%
And as you look at this
image and you become aware

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:23.560 align:middle line:10%
of the center, just focus
on your breathing as well.

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:26.710 align:middle line:84%
Breathing in through
the nose, breathing out

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:33.580 align:middle line:84%
through the mouth, and
bring your attention

00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:36.570 align:middle line:90%
to the stillness at the center.

00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:39.880 align:middle line:90%


00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:46.920 align:middle line:10%
And you can allow your
gaze to soften while still

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:49.590 align:middle line:10%
focusing on the center point.

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:55.890 align:middle line:84%
You're taking the whole image
in through an open view,

00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:56.745 align:middle line:90%
a soft view.

00:46:56.745 --> 00:46:59.450 align:middle line:90%


00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And you might see, as you
do it, that it becomes,

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:08.540 align:middle line:84%
from a two-dimensional
flat image to taking

00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:14.650 align:middle line:84%
on multiple dimensions-- three
dimensions, four dimensions.

00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:18.520 align:middle line:10%
And yet even as
that image becomes

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:25.070 align:middle line:10%
dynamic and alive
and multidimensional,

00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:28.660 align:middle line:10%
the stillness, the
central reference point

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:29.460 align:middle line:10%
is at the center.

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:32.370 align:middle line:10%


00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:38.010 align:middle line:10%
And as you focus on your in
breath and your out breath,

00:47:38.010 --> 00:47:43.270 align:middle line:10%
you can also expand the
pause between the breaths.

00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:46.080 align:middle line:10%
Bring your awareness
and your tension

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:50.770 align:middle line:10%
to that moment of stillness,
the pause between the in

00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:53.110 align:middle line:10%
breath and the out breath.

00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:57.380 align:middle line:90%


00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:10.070 align:middle line:10%
Extend the pause and notice
the silence between the words.

00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:16.300 align:middle line:90%


00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Even just for a
moment, access at still

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:25.415 align:middle line:90%
point at the center of being.

00:48:25.415 --> 00:48:44.340 align:middle line:90%


00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:47.970 align:middle line:10%
In the Sefer Yetzirah we work
with the numbers, the letters,

00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:50.320 align:middle line:10%
and the sounds.

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:56.580 align:middle line:10%
So from that place of
the center of stillness,

00:48:56.580 --> 00:49:00.820 align:middle line:10%
continuing to hold that
focus on that center,

00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:06.220 align:middle line:10%
we're going to
tone a sacred word,

00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:09.490 align:middle line:10%
the hermetic Kabbalistic
mystery tradition.

00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:12.220 align:middle line:10%


00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:14.770 align:middle line:10%
That word is tetragrammaton.

00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:17.530 align:middle line:84%
So holding your
focus on the center,

00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:20.530 align:middle line:84%
we're going to tone this word
three times all together.

00:49:20.530 --> 00:49:21.370 align:middle line:90%
Breathing in.

00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:23.735 align:middle line:90%
[BREATHS IN]

00:49:23.735 --> 00:49:25.630 align:middle line:90%
(SINGING) Tetragrammaton.

00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:35.440 align:middle line:90%


00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:36.695 align:middle line:90%
This is a word of creation.

00:49:36.695 --> 00:49:37.495 align:middle line:90%
One more time.

00:49:37.495 --> 00:49:43.120 align:middle line:84%
[BREATHS IN] (SINGING)
Tetragrammaton.

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:52.000 align:middle line:90%


00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:52.900 align:middle line:90%
And again.

00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:56.155 align:middle line:84%
[BREATHS IN] (SINGING)
Tetragrammaton.

00:49:56.155 --> 00:50:07.265 align:middle line:90%


00:50:07.265 --> 00:50:09.265 align:middle line:84%
And for good measure,
let's do it one more time.

00:50:09.265 --> 00:50:15.184 align:middle line:84%
[BREATHS IN] (SINGING)
Tetragrammaton.

00:50:15.184 --> 00:50:24.400 align:middle line:90%


00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:27.205 align:middle line:84%
I'll continue to hold
that focus on the center.

00:50:27.205 --> 00:50:30.040 align:middle line:90%


00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And imagine or let it be
as though this sphere forms

00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:39.630 align:middle line:90%
an energy field around you.

00:50:39.630 --> 00:50:44.420 align:middle line:90%


00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:46.730 align:middle line:84%
It's like a sphere and
you were at its center.

00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:49.470 align:middle line:90%


00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:55.425 align:middle line:84%
Then that sphere begins to
move and rotate clockwise

00:50:55.425 --> 00:50:56.225 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:50:56.225 --> 00:50:58.980 align:middle line:90%


00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:01.500 align:middle line:84%
The sound, the
vibrations, set it--

00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:02.745 align:middle line:90%
sets it into motion.

00:51:02.745 --> 00:51:05.490 align:middle line:90%


00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And it takes on not only
the form of a sphere,

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:15.400 align:middle line:84%
but a torus, a toroidal
flow, that rotates.

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:19.000 align:middle line:90%
And it turns in upon itself.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.290 align:middle line:90%
Visualize this.

00:51:20.290 --> 00:51:22.780 align:middle line:10%
Imagine this
happening around you.

00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:23.620 align:middle line:90%
Feel it.

00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:27.130 align:middle line:90%


00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And this view here is as
if you're looking down

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.365 align:middle line:90%
upon yourself from above.

00:51:31.365 --> 00:51:39.000 align:middle line:90%


00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.750 align:middle line:10%
And then it can be as
if you're looking now

00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:44.940 align:middle line:10%
from within, looking out.

00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:48.510 align:middle line:10%
And you have layers
upon layers upon layers

00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:51.480 align:middle line:10%
of this toroidal
flow circulating

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:57.810 align:middle line:10%
through the space
around you, bringing you

00:51:57.810 --> 00:52:03.770 align:middle line:10%
into more and more awareness
of your multidimensionality.

00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:07.700 align:middle line:90%


00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:11.000 align:middle line:10%
And this toroidal
flow is the same flow

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:16.790 align:middle line:10%
that we see happening around our
globe with the magnetic lines,

00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:21.290 align:middle line:10%
around our solar system,
around our galaxy,

00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:24.810 align:middle line:10%
around our universe.

00:52:24.810 --> 00:52:29.250 align:middle line:10%
So we truly are the microcosm
within the macrocosm.

00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:31.820 align:middle line:10%


00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:37.220 align:middle line:10%
We are connected to
the whole universe.

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:42.050 align:middle line:10%
You are the multidimensional
galactic being.

00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:45.320 align:middle line:90%


00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:49.220 align:middle line:10%
Feel that in your
heart, in your center.

00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:52.910 align:middle line:90%


00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Breathe it in, and just let that
seed of light and possibility

00:52:57.970 --> 00:53:02.560 align:middle line:84%
awaken within you
to remind your soul

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:07.000 align:middle line:84%
the truth of who you
are, the greatness that

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:13.150 align:middle line:84%
is within you, the wonder
and the magnificence that

00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:16.600 align:middle line:84%
is waiting to be
discovered inside of you.

00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:20.770 align:middle line:90%


00:53:20.770 --> 00:53:23.530 align:middle line:90%
So I believe my time is up.

00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:26.410 align:middle line:84%
