00:00:14.123 --> 00:00:17.710 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.510 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.790 align:middle line:84%
First of all, thank you
everyone for coming.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.660 align:middle line:10%
I've heard some stories
of some crazy travel

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.330 align:middle line:10%
times and everything
just to get here,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.720 align:middle line:10%
rerouted trains and rerouted
airplanes and everything else,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.410 align:middle line:10%
and you still came.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.035 align:middle line:84%
So give yourselves
a round of applause.

00:00:34.035 --> 00:00:37.310 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.500 align:middle line:10%
So tonight, we're going to talk
about evidence of the Atlantis

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.510 align:middle line:10%
and the Anunnaki and
the civilizations

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.880 align:middle line:10%
in our solar system.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I
want to clear first.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Anunnaki and
Atlanteans are really,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.630 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, the
same exact people,

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.370 align:middle line:84%
and that's Billy
Carson's opinion.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.395 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that's
a stated fact anywhere.

00:00:57.395 --> 00:00:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes, if
something is my opinion,

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.070 align:middle line:90%
I'll let you know.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.600 align:middle line:84%
If something's been recorded
in ancient tablets, or texts,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.740 align:middle line:84%
or science information that's
been registered in real science

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.480 align:middle line:84%
journals, I'll tell
you that as well.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.780 align:middle line:84%
But my personal opinion is the
Anunnaki are the Atlanteans,

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.280 align:middle line:84%
and so what I'm
going to try to do

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.270 align:middle line:84%
tonight is establish for you
some circumstantial evidence

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.880 align:middle line:84%
that will prove that this
culture was not only here

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.210 align:middle line:84%
but they were also not only
interplanetary civilization

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.420 align:middle line:84%
but they were also an
intergalactic civilization.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of people
always want to ask, well,

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.020 align:middle line:90%
where was Atlantis?

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Was it this ring city
in the Atlantic Ocean?

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.810 align:middle line:90%
Was it in Greece?

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.440 align:middle line:90%
Was it in the Mediterranean?

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.240 align:middle line:90%
Where was it?

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And my answer is
Atlantis is everywhere.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.260 align:middle line:84%
We are all standing
and sitting on Atlantis

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.030 align:middle line:90%
at this exact moment.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.280 align:middle line:90%
Atlantis was this entire planet.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.590 align:middle line:10%
The ring city, in
my opinion, was

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.362 align:middle line:10%
just one of many
capitals on Earth,

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:54.320 align:middle line:10%
and that's what we're
going to go over tonight.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.653 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to talk a little
bit about the Enuma Elish,

00:01:56.653 --> 00:01:59.210 align:middle line:84%
The Seven Tablets Of
Creation, to start off.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.820 align:middle line:10%
And what you need to understand
is that the Enuma Elish

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.620 align:middle line:10%
is an ancient cuneiform group
of tablets that really talk

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.660 align:middle line:10%
about the creation
of our solar system,

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.270 align:middle line:10%
the very, very beginnings
of the whole thing,

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.830 align:middle line:10%
how we even got here.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.440 align:middle line:10%
And this was copied
over and over again on

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.960 align:middle line:10%
to, actually, stone
tablets that go

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.070 align:middle line:10%
back, in my opinion, hundreds
of thousands of years,

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.653 align:middle line:10%
OK, hundreds of thousands,
not 8,000, not 6,000,

00:02:25.653 --> 00:02:26.570 align:middle line:10%
hundreds of thousands.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.220 align:middle line:10%
These are recopies
after the recopies.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.410 align:middle line:10%
Somebody sits
there with a stylus

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.050 align:middle line:10%
and rewedges in
all these cuneiform

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.630 align:middle line:10%
texts into new stones,
over and over again,

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.210 align:middle line:10%
to make sure that the
next generations to come

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.192 align:middle line:10%
have a copy of this story.

00:02:40.192 --> 00:02:42.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of people have heard
about the Sumerian tablets,

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.130 align:middle line:84%
and they've also heard about
Zecharia Sitchin I think

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Zecharia Sitchin was one
of the greatest researchers

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.387 align:middle line:84%
probably ever, and the reason
why is because he did something

00:02:51.387 --> 00:02:52.470 align:middle line:90%
a lot of people didn't do.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.320 align:middle line:84%
He went and put his
effort into trying

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.900 align:middle line:84%
to put the pieces of
the puzzle together.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.222 align:middle line:84%
What the thing that got
misconstrued with him is people

00:02:59.222 --> 00:03:00.680 align:middle line:84%
thought he was the
only person that

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.150 align:middle line:90%
can decipher these tablets.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.578 align:middle line:90%
That's false.

00:03:03.578 --> 00:03:05.120 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
Zecharia Sitchin

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.300 align:middle line:84%
didn't decipher or
interpret any tablets.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.870 align:middle line:84%
What he did was he took
existing translations

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.190 align:middle line:84%
that already existed and put
together his own stories.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, later on in
his life, he was vilified,

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.920 align:middle line:84%
and it was said that he
was the only person that

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.450 align:middle line:84%
can read them when nobody knew
what these things actually

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.020 align:middle line:90%
said.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.720 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at his books,
he gives you his source almost

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.897 align:middle line:90%
at every paragraph.

00:03:28.897 --> 00:03:30.980 align:middle line:84%
So the reason why I bring
this up in the beginning

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.563 align:middle line:84%
is so that people
who are sitting here

00:03:32.563 --> 00:03:34.910 align:middle line:84%
with this precognition of
Zecharia Sitchin, maybe

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.880 align:middle line:84%
this whole thing is just a
made up hoopla of some stone

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.430 align:middle line:84%
tablets, I'm here to tell
you this stuff was translated

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.800 align:middle line:90%
before he was even born.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.450 align:middle line:90%
Before he was born.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.190 align:middle line:84%
EA Speiser, King, all these
people translated this long

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.920 align:middle line:90%
before he was even on Earth.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.200 align:middle line:84%
So these translations are
ancient, in my opinion,

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.840 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking
about 1700 and 1800s,

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.520 align:middle line:84%
the tablets were
already translated.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.460 align:middle line:10%
So just wipe that
misrepresentation

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.466 align:middle line:10%
out of your brain as
I go through this.

00:04:04.466 --> 00:04:05.780 align:middle line:10%
These are the actual tablets.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.260 align:middle line:10%
These are the Enuma Elish,
the Seven Tablets of Creation.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.460 align:middle line:10%
What you'll find is that the
Bible is mostly this text right

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.260 align:middle line:10%
here.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.690 align:middle line:10%
Dividing the water from
the Genesis is mostly here.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.170 align:middle line:10%
Dividing separating the waters
from the waters, the creation

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.360 align:middle line:10%
of man in our
image, all of that,

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.890 align:middle line:10%
really, in the creation of
the Earth, the solar system,

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.130 align:middle line:10%
it's all in these
tablets right here.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.720 align:middle line:90%
It's a real amazing story.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.500 align:middle line:84%
Even the then preceding
enslavement of mankind

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.050 align:middle line:84%
is also in these texts
as well, and the reason

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.460 align:middle line:84%
for the enslavement
is there as well.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're wondering
how can you be sure

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.543 align:middle line:84%
that these texts are
accurate because Billy

00:04:44.543 --> 00:04:45.960 align:middle line:84%
is up here talking--
we don't even

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.543 align:middle line:84%
know if he knows
what these texts say.

00:04:47.543 --> 00:04:52.410 align:middle line:10%
Anybody can go to the CDLI,
online Cuneiform Digital

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.270 align:middle line:10%
Library.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.960 align:middle line:10%
It's hosted by UCLA, and you
can actually translate the stone

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.250 align:middle line:10%
tablets for yourself.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.710 align:middle line:10%
You can take a tablet
off the virtual shelf,

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.738 align:middle line:10%
and drop it into an
online translator,

00:05:03.738 --> 00:05:05.280 align:middle line:10%
and read it for
yourself, and come up

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.630 align:middle line:10%
with your own conclusion.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.400 align:middle line:10%
What you'll find
just, like I did,

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.895 align:middle line:10%
is that after
many, many decades,

00:05:10.895 --> 00:05:12.270 align:middle line:10%
really, of reading,
and studying,

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.940 align:middle line:10%
and researching these tablets,
all the different people

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.740 align:middle line:10%
that have researched them
have a very similar story,

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.800 align:middle line:10%
not the exact story but
the fundamental basis.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.400 align:middle line:84%
The foundation of the
story is always the same.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.370 align:middle line:84%
People from somewhere
else came to this planet,

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.620 align:middle line:84%
began to work on this
planet and create

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.060 align:middle line:90%
a breakaway civilization.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And then, at some point, they
engaged the existing hominid

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.840 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, genetically
tinkered with us,

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.780 align:middle line:84%
and turned this into a
worker slave for them

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.190 align:middle line:90%
for a period of time.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Now we're just like an
abandoned seed colony here,

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:44.850 align:middle line:90%
and we're just hanging out.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to find our
way, but there's hope for us.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:49.650 align:middle line:90%
There's hope yet.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.500 align:middle line:84%
So the Enuma Elish
of this is, really--

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.120 align:middle line:84%
it's really what's originally
Akkadian, Akkadian cuneiform

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.110 align:middle line:90%
text.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And these tablets,
they were at the--

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.570 align:middle line:84%
the Library of Ashurbanipal
is where they were discovered.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.150 align:middle line:84%
The Atrahasis is also
another amazing text.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.410 align:middle line:10%
This is also another account
written at another time also

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.360 align:middle line:10%
telling the similar
story of beings coming

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.330 align:middle line:10%
from another place, and
coming here to Earth,

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.745 align:middle line:10%
and engaging mankind.

00:06:19.745 --> 00:06:21.120 align:middle line:10%
Now what's
interesting about this

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.400 align:middle line:10%
and what really is important
about this is to understand,

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.150 align:middle line:10%
in this time frame
when these tablets were

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.720 align:middle line:10%
been copied and created,
people didn't have time

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.750 align:middle line:10%
to become George Lucas.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.640 align:middle line:84%
They weren't inspired
by George Lucas

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.750 align:middle line:84%
to create these incredible
sci-fi movies on tablets.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.420 align:middle line:84%
These people were
describing specifically

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.300 align:middle line:84%
what they were told to write
by their God, or their Lord,

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.670 align:middle line:84%
or their master, or
they were writing

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.738 align:middle line:84%
what they were experiencing
themselves at that time.

00:06:47.738 --> 00:06:50.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know if you've ever
seen how to write cuneiform.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.100 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very tedious.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.340 align:middle line:84%
You don't really have time to
sit there, and take out a stone

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.710 align:middle line:84%
tablet, and start wedging
in all this text just

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.640 align:middle line:84%
to make up an
incredible sci-fi story.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.550 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, what
they wrote was probably

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.660 align:middle line:84%
as close to the truth as
we're possibly going to get.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And we know that Uranus,
which is a planet that's

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.550 align:middle line:84%
in our solar
system, was affected

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.830 align:middle line:84%
by a gravitational
object that came

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.590 align:middle line:84%
through the solar system, which
is why it's tilted on its side.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.870 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if you knew
that, but Uranus doesn't have

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.700 align:middle line:10%
an equatorial orbit this way.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.790 align:middle line:10%
It's actually tilted and
almost flipping end over end,

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:24.880 align:middle line:10%
on its side.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.380 align:middle line:10%
And the reason why
this is important

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.340 align:middle line:10%
because, in the Enuma
Elish and the Atrahasis,

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.180 align:middle line:10%
it talks about an actual
planet or something

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:37.200 align:middle line:10%
large coming through our
solar system in ancient times,

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.480 align:middle line:10%
talking about millions of
years ago, and affecting

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.520 align:middle line:10%
the gravitational
fields and also

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.130 align:middle line:10%
the orbits of all the planets
and moons in our solar system.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.000 align:middle line:10%
And so now we know this
is true because science,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.890 align:middle line:10%
they teach you this in
astrophysics classes

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:50.830 align:middle line:10%
in college.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.910 align:middle line:10%
Something huge was
gravitationally captured

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:56.490 align:middle line:10%
by our solar system
and came through just

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:57.750 align:middle line:10%
like these stone tablets say.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.240 align:middle line:84%
So when the stone tablets
start backing up information

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.250 align:middle line:84%
that modern science is
just now finding out,

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.260 align:middle line:84%
I have to think that they're
probably as close to the truth

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.700 align:middle line:90%
as we're possibly going to get.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.220 align:middle line:84%
We know that something
giant came through here,

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.110 align:middle line:84%
and actually over
several passes,

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.360 align:middle line:84%
which took thousands
of years, it

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.420 align:middle line:84%
started yanking and yanking
and yanking until Uranus

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.130 align:middle line:90%
flipped on its side.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.490 align:middle line:10%
Now, a lot of people know
this as the Milky Way galaxy,

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:23.400 align:middle line:10%
and you can see where
the sun is actually

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.930 align:middle line:10%
showing you exactly
where you are

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:26.310 align:middle line:10%
right here in one of these--

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:30.660 align:middle line:10%
in the suburbs of the Milky
Way, a nice, quiet area, just

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.210 align:middle line:10%
far away from the
galactic equator for us

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:37.672 align:middle line:10%
to have a nice,
quiet area of space,

00:08:37.672 --> 00:08:39.630 align:middle line:10%
where there's not a lot
of catastrophe going on

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:40.470 align:middle line:10%
consistently.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.570 align:middle line:10%
Stars are moving at
a very decent speed

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.270 align:middle line:10%
around the Galactic equator
whereas, if you were closer in,

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.130 align:middle line:10%
your star would move
much faster, which

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.350 align:middle line:10%
would age you much faster.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.080 align:middle line:10%
But what's interesting
is how did we get here.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.120 align:middle line:10%
Scientists know that
we're not from here,

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.530 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going to read the
science article to you,

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:56.820 align:middle line:10%
just a couple of sentences.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.010 align:middle line:10%
It says, imagine the
shock of growing up

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.770 align:middle line:10%
in a loving family with people
who call you mom and dad

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:04.650 align:middle line:10%
and then suddenly learning
that you were actually adopted.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:05.970 align:middle line:10%
This happens in real life.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.110 align:middle line:10%
How can this be?

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.770 align:middle line:10%
Using volumes of data from
the Two-Micron All Sky Survey

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.950 align:middle line:10%
in 2MASS infrared
mode, a major project

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.680 align:middle line:10%
to survey the sky
in infrared light

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.630 align:middle line:10%
let the University
of Massachusetts

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.390 align:middle line:10%
and the astronomers are now
answering this huge question

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.850 align:middle line:10%
that have baffled
scientists for decades,

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.940 align:middle line:10%
proving that our own Milky
Way galaxy is consuming one

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.070 align:middle line:10%
of its neighbors in
a dramatic display

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.710 align:middle line:10%
of ongoing Galactic cannibalism.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.560 align:middle line:84%
The study published in the
"Astrophysical Journal"

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.950 align:middle line:84%
is the first step to map the
full extent of the Sagittarius

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:41.070 align:middle line:84%
galaxy and show it
visually in vivid detail

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:45.100 align:middle line:84%
and how its debris wraps around
and passes through our Milky

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:45.900 align:middle line:90%
Way.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Sagittarius is 10,000
times smaller in mass,

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.140 align:middle line:84%
and so it's getting stretched
out, torn apart, and gobbled up

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.390 align:middle line:90%
by the bigger Milky Way.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.430 align:middle line:10%
So if you ever go at
night watching, the night

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.340 align:middle line:10%
sky in a nice area with
no light pollution,

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.650 align:middle line:10%
and you look up at
the sky, and you

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:05.040 align:middle line:10%
see that giant band of stars
whipping across, and you go,

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.660 align:middle line:10%
man, that's the Milky
Way, guess what?

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.650 align:middle line:10%
You've been wrong
the whole time.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:09.750 align:middle line:10%
It's not the Milky Way.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.700 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is all
the-- science books

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.500 align:middle line:10%
have already been rewritten.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.820 align:middle line:10%
They've already been rewritten.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.730 align:middle line:10%
It's the Sagittarius
dwarf galaxy.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:19.240 align:middle line:10%
Why is this important?

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.240 align:middle line:10%
Because right where
the Sagittarius dwarf--

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.870 align:middle line:10%
not the Sagittarius
constellation, the Sagittarius

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:27.780 align:middle line:10%
Dwarf Galaxy, right where it
actually merges and meets,

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:28.920 align:middle line:10%
there's a little tiny dot.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.630 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if you can see it,
a little tiny yellow dot, where

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.570 align:middle line:10%
it meets and is being
swallowed up by the Milky Way.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:35.820 align:middle line:10%
That's where we are.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Also now know by doing a reverse
calculation of the trajectory

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:42.870 align:middle line:84%
of this Sagittarius
merger that we,

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:46.920 align:middle line:84%
this solar system that we're in,
didn't come from the Milky Way.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.080 align:middle line:90%
We are actually aliens here.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.820 align:middle line:84%
We don't even belong
in this galaxy.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.368 align:middle line:90%
So do aliens exist?

00:10:53.368 --> 00:10:54.660 align:middle line:90%
They're all sitting right here.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:55.920 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.540 align:middle line:90%
We're the aliens.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.600 align:middle line:84%
So the Sagittarius
Dwarf is another galaxy

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.450 align:middle line:84%
that's being consumed
gravitationally in merging in

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:04.860 align:middle line:90%
with the Milky Way.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And exactly at the point where
it meets is where we are.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.620 align:middle line:10%
Now, what's
interesting about that,

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.590 align:middle line:10%
in the astrophysical
books, you discover

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.170 align:middle line:10%
that, in the early creation
of this solar system,

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.570 align:middle line:10%
there were all kind of
rogue planets and rogue

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:21.570 align:middle line:10%
suns flowing through here,
wreaking havoc and creating

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:22.980 align:middle line:10%
disasters and everything else.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:24.780 align:middle line:10%
Guess what the Enuma Elish says?

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.870 align:middle line:10%
The same exact thing.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:30.720 align:middle line:10%
Again, ancient tablets,
thousands of years

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.990 align:middle line:10%
old, modern science tells
you the same exact story.

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:38.290 align:middle line:10%
It's the same exact story.

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:40.560 align:middle line:10%
So we had a planet
named Tiamat back then.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.740 align:middle line:10%
Tiamat was this massive
planet, four to six times

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.560 align:middle line:10%
larger than the Earth, a
water-bearing planet with land

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.533 align:middle line:10%
and, in my opinion,
most likely life.

00:11:48.533 --> 00:11:49.950 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest
theories that I

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:53.550 align:middle line:84%
have when you talk about
these miners that go

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:56.505 align:middle line:84%
into these deep shafts, and
depending on how many layers

00:11:56.505 --> 00:11:58.380 align:middle line:84%
down, you can tell how
many millions of years

00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.533 align:middle line:90%
back you're going in time--

00:11:59.533 --> 00:12:01.200 align:middle line:84%
three million years,
four million years.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.110 align:middle line:84%
500 million years,
they found a vase.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:06.120 align:middle line:84%
200 million years,
they found a hammer.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.130 align:middle line:84%
They're finding all
these tools and vases

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:10.290 align:middle line:84%
and all these
incredible anomalies

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:13.380 align:middle line:84%
at hundreds of millions
of years and back in time,

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:17.250 align:middle line:84%
depending on the depth of
the anomaly in the shaft.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.260 align:middle line:84%
How can that be if human
beings have only really

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:23.970 align:middle line:84%
been Homo sapiens and creating
tools for maybe 200,000 years?

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:26.460 align:middle line:84%
If you want to stretch it
to maybe almost a million,

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:27.640 align:middle line:90%
OK, you can do that.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.330 align:middle line:84%
But where did these
anomalies come from?

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:34.260 align:middle line:10%
In my opinion-- so Tiamat,
in the ancient text,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:38.430 align:middle line:10%
it was actually colliding
with another moonlit

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.370 align:middle line:10%
of another planet that was
orbiting a brown dwarf star.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:43.980 align:middle line:10%
When it collided with
Tiamat, it blew up,

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.330 align:middle line:10%
blew into giant pieces.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.340 align:middle line:10%
That is what your
asteroid belt comes from.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:50.680 align:middle line:84%
The asteroid belt, you have
Mercury, Venus, Earth, and then

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.480 align:middle line:90%
you have Mars.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.070 align:middle line:10%
And then, you have
another planet,

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.050 align:middle line:10%
which nobody talks
about, called Ceres--

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:57.820 align:middle line:10%
C-E-R-E-S. That's
another planet.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.060 align:middle line:84%
It has more fresh water on
it than Earth, by the way.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Then after Ceres, you have
the asteroid belt, OK?

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.440 align:middle line:10%
The asteroid belt is
a exploded planet.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.480 align:middle line:10%
It was Tiamat in ancient times.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.680 align:middle line:10%
The ancient said this.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.263 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is interesting
because Earth

00:13:12.263 --> 00:13:15.060 align:middle line:10%
didn't exist yet at the
time that Tiamat was here.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.790 align:middle line:10%
They said that Tiamat
was so beautiful

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.400 align:middle line:10%
that the glow from the
sun reflecting on it

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.590 align:middle line:10%
rivaled the sun's glory.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:24.515 align:middle line:10%
How could they know that?

00:13:24.515 --> 00:13:26.640 align:middle line:10%
How could they know that,
if the Earth wasn't here?

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.590 align:middle line:84%
What perspective do they
see this planet from?

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:30.590 align:middle line:84%
What planet did they
look at it from?

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:31.390 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:32.820 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting is
that was a statement that

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.180 align:middle line:90%
was made in the text.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.910 align:middle line:90%
And so, Tiamat exploded.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:39.390 align:middle line:10%
A giant chunk of it swung
away with all the water.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:41.520 align:middle line:10%
This is where the water is
divided from the waters.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.760 align:middle line:84%
It really coalesced back
into what we now have

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.560 align:middle line:90%
called Qi, which is the Earth.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.150 align:middle line:10%
We are a part of another planet.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.780 align:middle line:10%
That's why when you dig
into this planet, millions

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:52.770 align:middle line:10%
of layers--

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.800 align:middle line:10%
in the past layers down,
you discover anomalies

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.880 align:middle line:10%
that shouldn't be there.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Because, in my opinion,
this is Billy-- now,

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.150 align:middle line:84%
this is another Billy
Carson hypothesis.

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:04.170 align:middle line:10%
Those anomalies were when we
were part of another planet.

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:08.130 align:middle line:10%
Those are artifacts from
Tiamat that we're uncovering.

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:10.270 align:middle line:84%
You never heard anybody
talk about this before.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.250 align:middle line:90%
That's my whole theory.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:15.130 align:middle line:10%
So I'm working on a show
about this right now.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:19.500 align:middle line:84%
So you see you have the way
that our solar system is set up,

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.970 align:middle line:84%
and you have the asteroid
belt right there between Mars

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:22.770 align:middle line:90%
and Jupiter.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Right after Mars is a little
tiny planet called Ceres.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Like I said,
hardly-- it's hardly

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.950 align:middle line:90%
on any star maps or anything.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:31.200 align:middle line:10%
But that, right there, that
what you're looking at,

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.700 align:middle line:10%
what they call the
hammered bracelet

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:34.620 align:middle line:10%
in the Bible and other
texts, the ancients

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.540 align:middle line:10%
have known about it for eons.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:42.510 align:middle line:10%
That is actually remnants of
Tiamat, an exploded planet.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:47.040 align:middle line:10%
And this right here is actually
a NASA image from nasa.gov.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.620 align:middle line:10%
It shows the path of
a brown dwarf star.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.390 align:middle line:10%
You can see it in
the lower corner,

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.370 align:middle line:10%
passing through
our solar system.

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:58.230 align:middle line:10%
Now, this brown dwarf star,
they have now actually found it,

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.090 align:middle line:10%
label it a planet to
not call it a star.

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:01.680 align:middle line:10%
They call it Planet 9.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.080 align:middle line:10%
It actually orbits in a very
strange elliptical orbit.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.960 align:middle line:10%
It orbits our sun now
every 4,200 years,

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.370 align:middle line:10%
as the orbit has
changed over time.

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:13.680 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting, it has six
little planets orbiting it.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.240 align:middle line:90%
Six little planets orbiting it.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.400 align:middle line:84%
It's another solar system
in our solar system.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.090 align:middle line:84%
So we don't live in a
solar system with one sun.

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:23.360 align:middle line:84%
We live in a binary
solar system.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And so, as scientists at
NASA and other space agencies

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.730 align:middle line:84%
started to research the
skies, and they launched

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:31.920 align:middle line:84%
the wise telescope, they started
to find out and realize, wow,

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.300 align:middle line:90%
wait a minute.

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Trinary and binary stars are
more common than solar systems

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:38.730 align:middle line:90%
with single stars.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And where are all these
weird anomalies coming from?

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:44.820 align:middle line:84%
They notice that Neptune
and Saturn switched places.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Because something came through
gravitationally huge and made

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:48.510 align:middle line:90%
it switch orbits.

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.010 align:middle line:10%
We know this because
we can actually

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:52.750 align:middle line:10%
rewind the orbiting clock
with a computer simulation

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:54.630 align:middle line:10%
and find out all
the original orbits.

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:55.960 align:middle line:10%
So they know that happened.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:59.160 align:middle line:10%
We know that something
passed by so abrupt,

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:03.860 align:middle line:10%
it caused mercury to slow
down its spin on its axis.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.990 align:middle line:84%
One Mercury day
is 60 Earth days.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:08.918 align:middle line:84%
That's how slow it
spins on its axis.

00:16:08.918 --> 00:16:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
about mercury today

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:11.890 align:middle line:90%
if I can get to that slide.

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:14.310 align:middle line:10%
It's an important slide
to get to, all right?

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:16.530 align:middle line:10%
This is where the
astronomer came forward

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.060 align:middle line:10%
on this actual clip here.

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:20.460 align:middle line:10%
This is a screenshot of it.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.850 align:middle line:10%
And he said, astronomers
discovered dwarf planet

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:24.875 align:middle line:10%
at 7.5 billion
miles from the sun.

00:16:24.875 --> 00:16:27.000 align:middle line:10%
Now, what they don't say
on that little line there,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.640 align:middle line:10%
in the actual clip,
the astronomer

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.720 align:middle line:10%
says that it's orbiting its
own star, a brown dwarf star.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.670 align:middle line:10%
What is a brown dwarf star?

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:37.540 align:middle line:10%
A brown dwarf is a failed star.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a very small star,
but it has the same mass

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:42.550 align:middle line:90%
as our yellow sun.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:44.580 align:middle line:84%
So as gravitationally,
it's just as heavy,

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:48.690 align:middle line:84%
and it creates something called
gravitational waves as the two

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:50.460 align:middle line:90%
suns tug on each other.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Back about 12 years ago,
I started digging deep

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.290 align:middle line:84%
into astronomy, and
I got really heavily

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.870 align:middle line:84%
into it I started buying
really nice telescopes, right?

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And I started
scanning the skies,

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.862 align:middle line:84%
and I started studying
the procession

00:17:00.862 --> 00:17:02.580 align:middle line:90%
of the equinoxes for myself.

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And as I started studying the
procession of the equinox,

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:07.530 align:middle line:84%
the movement of the stars of
constellations across the sky,

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:09.450 align:middle line:90%
I noticed something interesting.

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Based on the calculations,
the procession

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.420 align:middle line:84%
should have been
in about 27 years.

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.530 align:middle line:84%
But based on my one or
two-month calculation,

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:18.220 align:middle line:84%
if I projected it
into the future,

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.498 align:middle line:90%
it was about 25,000 years.

00:17:20.498 --> 00:17:21.790 align:middle line:90%
I did this over and over again.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:22.707 align:middle line:90%
I said, wait a minute.

00:17:22.707 --> 00:17:24.900 align:middle line:84%
What can cause
procession to slow down?

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.250 align:middle line:90%
How is this possible?

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.030 align:middle line:84%
How can a procession
actually slow down?

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And so, I started looking
to all kinds of theories

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:30.900 align:middle line:84%
from ancient texts
and everything else,

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.200 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't find anything.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.440 align:middle line:10%
And then, one day, I
was looking at something

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.510 align:middle line:10%
about orbital mechanics.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:39.263 align:middle line:10%
And I found that when stars
are orbiting each other,

00:17:39.263 --> 00:17:40.680 align:middle line:10%
they speed up, and
they slow down.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.580 align:middle line:84%
They speed up, and
they slow down,

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.290 align:middle line:84%
so they can create
breakaway speed.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:44.250 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, wow.

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:46.830 align:middle line:10%
So then, I looked into
gravitational assist

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:49.680 align:middle line:10%
with technology, how we used to
launch satellites and send them

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.628 align:middle line:10%
to deep space like
the Voyager missions,

00:17:51.628 --> 00:17:52.920 align:middle line:10%
and we would do the same thing.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.240 align:middle line:84%
We would create this
breakaway speed,

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.650 align:middle line:84%
and we would take off and
create these angles in space.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.950 align:middle line:84%
So we can get our
probes deep into space.

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, what
if our sun is orbiting

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:03.910 align:middle line:90%
something that's creating this?

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I dug and
found that we actually

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.480 align:middle line:84%
have a brown dwarf
orbiting us, but it's not

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.410 align:middle line:90%
like it's mainstream news.

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:14.310 align:middle line:84%
But if you go into the science
books, it's actually there.

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.010 align:middle line:84%
They hide everything
in plain sight.

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:18.770 align:middle line:84%
So what's interesting
during this time

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:20.420 align:middle line:90%
and a few million years ago?

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:24.320 align:middle line:84%
The Anunnaki had this race
of beings called the Igigi.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:28.790 align:middle line:10%
They're mentioned in the
Enuma Elish and the Atrahasis.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:33.560 align:middle line:10%
And also, what's interesting
is the word, the name Anunnaki

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:37.160 align:middle line:10%
and Nibiru in the older
version of the Enuma Elish,

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.137 align:middle line:10%
those words those names
are actually in the text.

00:18:40.137 --> 00:18:42.470 align:middle line:10%
So for some people that were
saying all of this-- nobody

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:44.840 align:middle line:10%
can ever find these
names, in a newer version

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:49.640 align:middle line:10%
of the Enuma Elish, Marduk,
also known as Amun-Ra,

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.250 align:middle line:10%
he wants to be the one
that destroyed Tiamat,

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:55.940 align:middle line:10%
so he changed the name
Nibiru to his name Marduk.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.200 align:middle line:10%
His name is in the Bible.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.910 align:middle line:10%
His name is in the Jewish Torah.

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:00.920 align:middle line:10%
He's a very popular
guy, but also

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.020 align:middle line:10%
a very evil and brutal guy, OK?

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.200 align:middle line:10%
But these Igigi were
doing a lot of the work

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.210 align:middle line:10%
when they created this
breakaway civilization.

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:09.028 align:middle line:10%
They came here.

00:19:09.028 --> 00:19:10.820 align:middle line:10%
They founded this planet
was a great planet

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:14.420 align:middle line:10%
to start a civilization,
to build and live on.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.430 align:middle line:84%
They actually worked
this planet themselves.

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.490 align:middle line:84%
They actually didn't
even use human beings

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:21.600 align:middle line:84%
or our hominid
cousins at that time.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.300 align:middle line:90%
They weren't Homo sapiens yet.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.960 align:middle line:90%
But these Igigi people.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.770 align:middle line:84%
These were like the working
level class Anunnaki,

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:30.110 align:middle line:84%
and they were doing the
trenching, and the digging,

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:33.170 align:middle line:84%
and the making the canals,
and all this stuff, mining

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:34.022 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:19:34.022 --> 00:19:35.480 align:middle line:84%
They started getting
tired of this.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.660 align:middle line:84%
They were working on Earth,
and they were working on Mars.

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Mars, as we know, has
a damaged atmosphere.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.940 align:middle line:84%
After Tiamat had exploded,
part of that debris

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.700 align:middle line:84%
hit Mars, which is why one
side of Mars is charred,

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.740 align:middle line:90%
and one side of smooth.

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.810 align:middle line:90%
And then, actually, Tiamat--

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:55.058 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Mars shifted on its
axis and had a pole shift,

00:19:55.058 --> 00:19:57.350 align:middle line:84%
which created a whole global
flood there and everything

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:58.220 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.030 align:middle line:90%
It started healing.

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:01.837 align:middle line:84%
The planet itself started
healing, but what's interesting

00:20:01.837 --> 00:20:03.920 align:middle line:84%
is these people were up
there, mining and working,

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.660 align:middle line:84%
but they said the
conditions were harsh.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.970 align:middle line:84%
They complained to
Enki, Enlil, and Anu,

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.670 align:middle line:84%
who are the Kings of
Earth, pretty much.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And their calls for
help were ignored.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Like hey, we need
some-- we need a break.

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:17.840 align:middle line:90%
We need a vacation.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.760 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest complaints,
they didn't have any women.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's a tough
complaint, man.

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.920 align:middle line:90%
I feel for them.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Listen, man, you know, I'm out
here, sweating, and it's dry.

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:30.960 align:middle line:84%
I got no water, and
there's no women.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.820 align:middle line:10%
So they came to
Earth and said, look,

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.450 align:middle line:10%
we got we got to get some women,
and we got to get some rest.

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:37.117 align:middle line:84%
So they came to Earth,
and they actually

00:20:37.117 --> 00:20:38.480 align:middle line:90%
encircled the camp of--

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.950 align:middle line:90%
this is in the Enuma Elish.

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:43.070 align:middle line:84%
They encircled the camp
of Enki, Enlil, and Anu,

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:46.440 align:middle line:84%
and they found that their guards
let them know that, hey, we've

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.240 align:middle line:90%
been encircled.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.280 align:middle line:84%
We've been, basically,
boxed in here.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And there was a call to
go for war against them.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And they started
negotiating to try

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.970 align:middle line:84%
to not have this war, because
they were more Igigi than them.

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:02.152 align:middle line:90%
And Enki makes a decision.

00:21:02.152 --> 00:21:03.110 align:middle line:90%
He says, you know what?

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:04.590 align:middle line:90%
I have an idea.

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:06.770 align:middle line:84%
There's an existing
being on this planet.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:10.220 align:middle line:84%
We can add our essence to it--
that's a genetic modification--

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.248 align:middle line:84%
and we can get them to do the
work, have them do the load,

00:21:13.248 --> 00:21:15.540 align:middle line:84%
work the load, do the labor,
do the heavy labor for us,

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.760 align:middle line:90%
do the toil.

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And so, that decision
was made and agreed upon,

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:20.090 align:middle line:90%
and it happened.

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And then, those Igigi,
they took some women.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:23.990 align:middle line:90%
They did that.

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:25.530 align:middle line:84%
They took some women and
took them back with them.

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:27.260 align:middle line:10%
So that's where the
sons of God made it

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.420 align:middle line:10%
with the daughters of men.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.320 align:middle line:10%
And now, we have the situation.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.640 align:middle line:10%
We've been fully engaged
on this planet, OK?

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.500 align:middle line:10%
But at some point,
there was a catastrophe.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.170 align:middle line:10%
And this is where
Thoth comes into play.

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:41.000 align:middle line:10%
Thoth is an Atlantean
priest king.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.785 align:middle line:10%
The Egyptians know
him as Hermes--

00:21:44.785 --> 00:21:46.160 align:middle line:10%
or the Greeks know
him as Hermes.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.452 align:middle line:10%
The Egyptian know him as Thoth.

00:21:47.452 --> 00:21:50.500 align:middle line:10%
Djehuty to the Africans.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.990 align:middle line:10%
He's basically one of
the most, at the time,

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:54.740 align:middle line:10%
the most intelligent
people on the planet.

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.900 align:middle line:10%
He taught languages
to everybody.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.880 align:middle line:10%
And what happened is
there was a great flood

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.770 align:middle line:10%
before he went on this mission.

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:03.440 align:middle line:10%
And after this great
flood, his father Enki,

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.270 align:middle line:10%
who was also known as
Thoth, and told him,

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:08.180 align:middle line:10%
go back to the land of
the hairy barbarians

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.100 align:middle line:10%
and rebuild civilization.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.515 align:middle line:10%
In other words, he didn't
say that civilization

00:22:12.515 --> 00:22:13.640 align:middle line:10%
needed to be started there.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.070 align:middle line:84%
They had already raised
everybody up to a high level.

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:18.890 align:middle line:84%
They had already
created, basically,

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:22.370 align:middle line:84%
almost heaven on Earth by
those labor between the Igigi

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:23.460 align:middle line:90%
and the humans.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And then, they had
this big catastrophe.

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And the mission that
Enki sent him on

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:29.230 align:middle line:84%
was to bring back
civilization to the planet

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:30.230 align:middle line:90%
after this global flood.

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Whatever this catastrophe was,
it's not really truly clear

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.520 align:middle line:84%
exactly what it was,
but it did happen.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.250 align:middle line:90%
So he gets into his ship.

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:39.440 align:middle line:84%
It says, he gets into the
great ship of the master.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.970 align:middle line:90%
It didn't say he sailed out.

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Instead, he rolls into the sky
until the planet disappeared,

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.180 align:middle line:84%
until he got to the place
that he was basically

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:48.583 align:middle line:90%
his destination for his mission.

00:22:48.583 --> 00:22:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And then, he said he saw
the great temple coming out

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:52.130 align:middle line:90%
of the mud beneath him.

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:53.870 align:middle line:84%
That means the
thing is in the sky.

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:56.660 align:middle line:10%
And he descended on
the land of Khem.

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:59.157 align:middle line:10%
When he descended down to the
ground, he opened his doors.

00:22:59.157 --> 00:23:01.490 align:middle line:10%
All this what I'm telling you
is in my book, "Compendium

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:02.493 align:middle line:10%
of the Emerald Tablets."

00:23:02.493 --> 00:23:04.160 align:middle line:10%
And this exact quote
that I'm giving you

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.230 align:middle line:10%
comes from the "Emerald
Tablets of Thoth,"

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:09.470 align:middle line:10%
which is an ancient text that
dates back over 36,000 years.

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:10.910 align:middle line:10%
He drops his door down.

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:13.280 align:middle line:10%
Him and his crew
come out of the ship.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.810 align:middle line:10%
All he cares the
hairy barbarians

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:17.270 align:middle line:10%
came to attack him with
cudgels and spears.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:19.130 align:middle line:10%
And he said, he
raised his staff,

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:20.990 align:middle line:10%
and he sent out a
ray of vibration,

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:23.780 align:middle line:10%
striking him still as fragments
of stone in the mountain.

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:28.100 align:middle line:84%
He froze them in place with a
beam weapon, 36,000 years ago.

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.980 align:middle line:10%
High tech weaponry, 36--
that didn't injure them,

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.320 align:middle line:10%
didn't kill them, but
stop them from attacking.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.820 align:middle line:10%
We have something
similar right now.

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:37.280 align:middle line:10%
It's called the active denial
system in the military.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.710 align:middle line:10%
If you look at military
active denial system,

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:42.308 align:middle line:10%
we have a device that
sends out a beam.

00:23:42.308 --> 00:23:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And so if somebody is coming
to attack an area, rioters

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.598 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, they can
send a beam at you

00:23:46.598 --> 00:23:48.890 align:middle line:84%
that will make you stop, make
you think you're on fire,

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.770 align:middle line:84%
make you vomit, make you
sick, make you scream,

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:53.198 align:middle line:84%
make you have
voices in your head.

00:23:53.198 --> 00:23:54.740 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
Active Denial System.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And we have the same
exact technology now,

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:58.513 align:middle line:84%
we just rediscover
what they already had.

00:23:58.513 --> 00:23:59.930 align:middle line:10%
And what's interesting
is he said,

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:02.420 align:middle line:10%
then he built the Great Pyramid.

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:03.890 align:middle line:10%
He claimed to have built--

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:06.170 align:middle line:10%
not with his own hands.

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:09.590 align:middle line:10%
But he was the master
architect for this structure

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:10.670 align:middle line:10%
on planet Earth.

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And then, told us, once they
rebuilt the land of Khem, which

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:18.080 align:middle line:84%
is Egypt before it was called
Egypt, then he told his crew,

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.330 align:middle line:84%
he said to them, now,
go around the planet

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:22.250 align:middle line:90%
and duplicate what we did here.

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:24.230 align:middle line:84%
This is why, when you
look at this planet,

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:26.060 align:middle line:84%
no matter where you
go, you're going

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:27.980 align:middle line:90%
to find similar structures.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:29.540 align:middle line:84%
The similar
construction techniques,

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.760 align:middle line:90%
the same type of tool markings.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.860 align:middle line:84%
You're going to find the
same types of pyramids,

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:34.970 align:middle line:90%
all the similarities.

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:35.990 align:middle line:90%
Because why?

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:38.660 align:middle line:90%
You had one master architect.

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And this was the mission
that Thoth was on.

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:43.850 align:middle line:84%
He was the master
architect-- post-alluvial,

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:47.060 align:middle line:84%
he was the master architect
that rebuilt life and rebuilt

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.220 align:middle line:90%
civilizations on this planet.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.390 align:middle line:90%
And who was Thoth?

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:54.770 align:middle line:90%
He was a Atlantean Priest-King.

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:57.068 align:middle line:10%
What's interesting about
him, that I love about him,

00:24:57.068 --> 00:24:58.610 align:middle line:10%
is that the fact
that he didn't claim

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:01.250 align:middle line:10%
to have been an actual god.

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:04.490 align:middle line:10%
Where some of his relatives,
they actually said,

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:06.260 align:middle line:10%
you know what, yeah, I'm god.

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.772 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, bow to me.

00:25:07.772 --> 00:25:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Bring me these
sacrifice-- you know

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:10.910 align:middle line:90%
what the sacrifice was before?

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:13.100 align:middle line:10%
Because they had to eat, man.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.080 align:middle line:10%
They're not going to
go kill no animals.

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:16.250 align:middle line:10%
Bring me the sacrifices.

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:17.960 align:middle line:10%
So people would kill the
animals and bring it to them.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:18.953 align:middle line:10%
That's how they ate.

00:25:18.953 --> 00:25:21.120 align:middle line:10%
And so with Thoth, when
they would drop to his feet,

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.020 align:middle line:10%
he would say, rise,
I'm a son of Atlantis.

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:25.980 align:middle line:10%
That's what he would say.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.410 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm a son of Atlantis.

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:30.890 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes he would call
himself the Son of Man

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:33.890 align:middle line:84%
just like you sure did in
the Bible, the Son of Man.

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:37.010 align:middle line:84%
Not the Son of God,
but the Son of Man.

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:38.510 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Hermes was known to the Greeks
as the "Master of all arts

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and sciences, perfect
in all crafts,

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.170 align:middle line:84%
Ruler of the Three Worlds,
Scribe of the Gods,

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:46.820 align:middle line:90%
and Keeper of the Book of Life."

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.190 align:middle line:84%
What's the Book of Life,
what's the Akashic Records?

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:50.090 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:52.550 align:middle line:10%
We now know in quantum
physics and quantum mechanics

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.630 align:middle line:10%
that there is an
actual Book of Life.

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:56.302 align:middle line:10%
It's called the Akashic Records.

00:25:56.302 --> 00:25:58.010 align:middle line:10%
So every thought that
you think right now

00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:59.090 align:middle line:10%
is actually leaving your brain.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:01.670 align:middle line:10%
We know this for a fact, because
we can capture your thoughts

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:03.380 align:middle line:10%
and send them to a computer.

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.690 align:middle line:84%
We can even see the
images in your head now,

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:06.710 align:middle line:90%
we can create images.

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:08.450 align:middle line:10%
We can tell you to
think of an image,

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.492 align:middle line:10%
and we can actually capture
what that image would

00:26:10.492 --> 00:26:12.710 align:middle line:10%
be from your thoughts and
put it on a computer screen

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:14.750 align:middle line:10%
just like that old
movie, "Minority Report."

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:16.670 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, it's real
science now, right?

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:17.840 align:middle line:10%
Look it up.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:18.780 align:middle line:10%
Interesting.

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.260 align:middle line:10%
So the Book of Life is
real because every thought

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.690 align:middle line:10%
you've thought since
you were actually born

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:26.540 align:middle line:10%
exist in space time,
just like the radio

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.040 align:middle line:10%
waves from the "I
Love Lucy" show

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.540 align:middle line:10%
from 1950, 1960,
going out into space.

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.420 align:middle line:10%
If you can tune into that, you
can watch the movie no matter

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:35.980 align:middle line:10%
how far away you are in space.

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:37.510 align:middle line:10%
Same exact thing
with your thoughts.

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:39.310 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes you think you
get an original thought,

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:40.893 align:middle line:10%
you're just downloading
and entangling

00:26:40.893 --> 00:26:42.790 align:middle line:10%
with somebody
else's information.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:44.410 align:middle line:10%
He was the "First
intelligencer,"

00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:47.170 align:middle line:10%
was regarded by the ancient
Egyptians as the embodiment

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:48.375 align:middle line:10%
of the Universal Mind.

00:26:48.375 --> 00:26:50.500 align:middle line:10%
And it's impossible to
extricate historical records

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:52.840 align:middle line:10%
from the man and the mass
legendary accounts which

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.020 align:middle line:10%
attempt to identify him with
the Cosmic Principle of Thought.

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:57.945 align:middle line:84%
But he was a real
person in my opinion.

00:26:57.945 --> 00:26:59.320 align:middle line:84%
I believe that he
really did walk

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.820 align:middle line:84%
and he really did
do what he'd done.

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:03.010 align:middle line:84%
He's been known all
around the planet.

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:08.200 align:middle line:84%
In Africa, Djehuty, Thoth, and
the Mesoamerica, Quetzalcoatl,

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.677 align:middle line:84%
Lord Pakal,
Kukulkan, Viracocha--

00:27:11.677 --> 00:27:12.760 align:middle line:90%
all these different names.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:14.218 align:middle line:84%
Primarily, a lot
of these names are

00:27:14.218 --> 00:27:17.718 align:middle line:84%
talking about the same person
over different periods of time.

00:27:17.718 --> 00:27:19.510 align:middle line:84%
So here I am standing
in the King's Chamber

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:20.810 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Pyramid.

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And so now we're going
to talk a little bit more

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:27.140 align:middle line:84%
about circumstantial evidence
and how it adds up to a case.

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:29.950 align:middle line:10%
So here, you see me
standing next to the stone

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:33.790 align:middle line:10%
box that's inside of the King's
Chamber of the Great Pyramid.

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:37.480 align:middle line:10%
Now this stone box, in my
opinion, is not a sarcophagus.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:40.720 align:middle line:10%
Because I'm 6'4" and I can't
fit in this box without bending

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.800 align:middle line:10%
my knees.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:45.160 align:middle line:10%
So if I can't fit in this
box, why make a box this tiny?

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.560 align:middle line:10%
Could the-- is it that the
pharaoh was that small?

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.410 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:49.210 align:middle line:10%
I'm not sure.

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:51.970 align:middle line:10%
But it doesn't make sense when
all the other sarcophagus are

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:54.910 align:middle line:10%
massive and this one
is smaller than me.

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:55.960 align:middle line:10%
Interesting.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.360 align:middle line:10%
And what's great about this
is you can actually see,

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.650 align:middle line:10%
a corner of this has
been snapped off.

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:02.680 align:middle line:10%
And if you look across
the room, if you actually

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.810 align:middle line:10%
get a chance to go with
Egypt with me, which

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:06.690 align:middle line:10%
I'm going this October
with 70 people,

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:09.190 align:middle line:10%
if you're in that trip, maybe
the next one in the next year,

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:11.380 align:middle line:10%
you'll see where this
thing impacted the wall

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:12.550 align:middle line:10%
across the room.

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:16.625 align:middle line:10%
A huge energy spike happens
right at the point of this box.

00:28:16.625 --> 00:28:18.250 align:middle line:10%
Now, what's interesting
about this box,

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:22.390 align:middle line:10%
it's the same exact dimensions
as the Ark of the Covenant,

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:23.950 align:middle line:10%
pretty interesting.

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:28.810 align:middle line:84%
My hypothesis, not
any fact, if you

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:31.630 align:middle line:84%
look into the biblical tale
of the Ark of the Covenant

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:34.360 align:middle line:84%
and you understand what kind
of power it actually housed--

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.250 align:middle line:84%
and there have been
attempts to reproduce

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:38.750 align:middle line:84%
the Ark, which were
successful in modern science,

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:39.550 align:middle line:90%
at a University.

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:41.175 align:middle line:84%
One doctor created--
scientists created

00:28:41.175 --> 00:28:43.750 align:middle line:84%
it and it put up so much power,
they had to shut it down.

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:46.515 align:middle line:84%
So it actually,
scientifically, was sound.

00:28:46.515 --> 00:28:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Underneath the
Great Pyramid used

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:49.930 align:middle line:84%
to be aquifers of
water, running water,

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:52.870 align:middle line:90%
underneath the crystal granite.

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you run water under
magnetized crystal granite,

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.840 align:middle line:84%
you create something called
physiostatic electricity, which

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.780 align:middle line:84%
then rises up into
the pyramid structure.

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:04.390 align:middle line:10%
Some of that water
pass was purposely

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:07.000 align:middle line:10%
flowed, in my opinion,
into the Queen's Chamber

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.840 align:middle line:10%
to create a hydrogen extractor,
or electrolysis for hydrogen,

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:14.680 align:middle line:10%
to separate hydrogen
from the H2O.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.150 align:middle line:84%
That's a communication
device which

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:17.210 align:middle line:90%
I'll talk about in a minute.

00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:18.585 align:middle line:84%
The rest of it
then would flow up

00:29:18.585 --> 00:29:21.400 align:middle line:84%
into the Grand Gallery
which would create-- which

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.020 align:middle line:84%
had these resonating chambers
which these resonating rods are

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:24.820 align:middle line:90%
now missing.

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.160 align:middle line:84%
You can see the slots going
up into the King's Chamber.

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.610 align:middle line:90%
They're gone now.

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And then, that energy
would then be stepped up

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:34.000 align:middle line:84%
inside the King's Chamber and
then pushed up through the apex

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.850 align:middle line:84%
and then sent out as
wireless power around Egypt.

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:39.250 align:middle line:84%
An obelisk would then
collect that energy,

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:41.540 align:middle line:84%
that ambient energy,
and channel it.

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And if you had a djed
with a cable on it,

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.850 align:middle line:84%
you can connect it
to a light bulb,

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:48.910 align:middle line:84%
you can connect it to your
electroplating machines,

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:50.560 align:middle line:84%
or wherever you needed
electricity for,

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.720 align:middle line:90%
and you had wireless power.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's also interesting
is you can see here

00:29:55.090 --> 00:30:00.640 align:middle line:84%
the speed of light in a
vacuum, 299,792,458 meters

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.700 align:middle line:84%
per second, which is
pretty interesting seeing

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.400 align:middle line:84%
that the [STUTTERS] geographic
coordinates, I'm sorry,

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.090 align:middle line:90%
are 29.979248 North.

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:13.750 align:middle line:10%
So how can the speed of
light, in meters per second,

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:16.090 align:middle line:10%
equal the actual
geographic location

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:19.900 align:middle line:10%
of the Grand Gallery leading
into the King's Chamber?

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's because we had
meters in ancient times.

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Meters were not discovered
more recently as we thought.

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:30.550 align:middle line:84%
They were only
rediscovered, or the person

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:35.470 align:middle line:84%
that rediscovered them went
and found some of this--

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:37.960 align:middle line:90%
protocuneiform.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:43.720 align:middle line:84%
This is a protocuneiform
metric system dating back prior

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.010 align:middle line:90%
to Mesopotamia.

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And this was found
actually in Mesoamerica.

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:54.620 align:middle line:84%
So what in the world is
protocuneiform metric system

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.727 align:middle line:84%
being discovered in
the Americas when

00:30:56.727 --> 00:30:58.310 align:middle line:84%
we know that Sumeria
is supposed to be

00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:01.280 align:middle line:84%
the cradle of civilization,
all the way in Mesopotamia,

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.540 align:middle line:90%
coming out of Iraq?

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:03.690 align:middle line:90%
Pretty interesting.

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:07.610 align:middle line:84%
So the metric system is
ancient, it's super ancient.

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:10.898 align:middle line:84%
So the people who try to
debunk the fact that it's just

00:31:10.898 --> 00:31:12.440 align:middle line:84%
a coincidence that
the speed of light

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:15.320 align:middle line:84%
is the same geographic
location as the Grand Gallery,

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.212 align:middle line:84%
you can debunk the
debunkers with the fact

00:31:17.212 --> 00:31:18.920 align:middle line:84%
that we already had
in the metric system.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
well known, it's

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:21.980 align:middle line:90%
just that nobody has found it.

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:26.070 align:middle line:10%
But I found it years ago,
and I talk about it a lot.

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:27.335 align:middle line:10%
So what is the power here?

00:31:27.335 --> 00:31:29.210 align:middle line:10%
Let's talk about more
circumstantial evidence

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:32.300 align:middle line:10%
that these beings came here
with advanced knowledge.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.550 align:middle line:10%
I looked into the mathematics
in the Great Pyramid,

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:38.000 align:middle line:10%
and I found a lot of
incredible correlations.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.650 align:middle line:10%
You can calculate
a lot of things

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:41.400 align:middle line:10%
based on the structure itself.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.090 align:middle line:10%
So what Thoth, that he took
this pyramid and he said,

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:45.570 align:middle line:10%
I want it for the future.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:47.840 align:middle line:84%
I want this to be a time
capsule of knowledge.

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.628 align:middle line:84%
And what I want to do is I want
to take all this information,

00:31:50.628 --> 00:31:52.170 align:middle line:84%
the information
about all this stuff,

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:54.950 align:middle line:84%
and I want to compile it
into the actual building

00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:56.070 align:middle line:90%
structure itself.

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:58.100 align:middle line:10%
So that in a future
time, which is now,

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:02.570 align:middle line:10%
mankind can decipher it and
realize how incredibly we were,

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:05.240 align:middle line:10%
and that this came from
advanced knowledge.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:08.030 align:middle line:10%
The mean distance to the
sun is half the length

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:11.240 align:middle line:10%
of the diagonal of the base
times 10 to the sixth power,

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.670 align:middle line:10%
it would give you the
average distance to the sun.

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:15.680 align:middle line:10%
You can calculate the
distance to the sun

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.800 align:middle line:10%
from the Great Pyramid.

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.030 align:middle line:10%
The mean distance to the sun.

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:20.197 align:middle line:10%
You can also do it this way.

00:32:20.197 --> 00:32:22.510 align:middle line:10%
The height of the pyramid
times 10 to the ninth power

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:24.550 align:middle line:10%
represents the mean
radius of the Earth

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:27.280 align:middle line:10%
and the orbit around the
sun, or Astronomical Unit.

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.298 align:middle line:10%
You can measure the AU.

00:32:28.298 --> 00:32:30.340 align:middle line:84%
The AU is the distance
from the Earth to the sun.

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And you can multiply
that out, and depending

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:34.220 align:middle line:84%
on how many AUs you
have, it will tell you

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:37.900 align:middle line:84%
how far you are away from
the sun in the solar system.

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:40.850 align:middle line:10%
You can also calculate the
mean distance to the moon.

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:44.050 align:middle line:10%
The length of the Jubilee
passage times 7 times 10

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:47.410 align:middle line:10%
to the seventh power is the
main distance to the moon.

00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:48.880 align:middle line:10%
That's incredible.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.100 align:middle line:10%
The sun's radius
can be calculated.

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.750 align:middle line:10%
Twice the perimeter
of the bottom

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:55.360 align:middle line:10%
of the granite coffer times
10 to the eighth power

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:58.240 align:middle line:10%
is the sun's mean radius.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.890 align:middle line:10%
I mean, how can they know this?

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:03.370 align:middle line:10%
How can they know that
this 427,316 miles

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:06.160 align:middle line:10%
is the radius of the sun
from standing on Earth,

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.660 align:middle line:10%
looking up at the sky?

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.070 align:middle line:90%
The Earth's polar radius.

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:11.320 align:middle line:84%
The Sacred Cubit times
10 to the seventh power

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.870 align:middle line:84%
equals the polar
radius of the Earth.

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:16.000 align:middle line:10%
That's the Earth's
orbit, polar radius

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.820 align:middle line:10%
is going-- it's pole the
pole this way, not this way.

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:20.530 align:middle line:10%
But they can
calculate it this way.

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:23.020 align:middle line:10%
It's all built into
the Great Pyramid.

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:24.100 align:middle line:10%
The Earth's polar radius.

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:28.300 align:middle line:10%
The pyramid embodies a
scale ratio of 1/43,200.

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:32.350 align:middle line:10%
So the pyramid itself is a
scale of the Earth's size.

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:36.820 align:middle line:10%
You scale the pyramid, you
scale Earth down by 43,200--

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:40.360 align:middle line:10%
432 Hertz, that's the
resonant frequency that's

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.820 align:middle line:10%
best to listen to music,
you scale it down,

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:45.370 align:middle line:10%
what do you get to that
radius, that ratio?

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:46.900 align:middle line:90%
You get the size of the Earth.

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:49.000 align:middle line:84%
So as you take the
Great Pyramid of Giza

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.360 align:middle line:84%
and you take it and
scale it up 43,200 times,

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.370 align:middle line:84%
you get the size of the
planet Earth itself.

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:55.570 align:middle line:90%
And guess what, guys.

00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:56.783 align:middle line:90%
It's a sphere.

00:33:56.783 --> 00:33:58.450 align:middle line:84%
All right, just in
case you didn't know.

00:33:58.450 --> 00:33:59.920 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:03.350 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.987 align:middle line:90%


00:34:03.987 --> 00:34:05.570 align:middle line:10%
I know this is a lot
of math, but what

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:08.120 align:middle line:10%
I'm trying to prove to you here
is circumstantial evidence.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.812 align:middle line:10%
These beings had
advanced knowledge.

00:34:09.812 --> 00:34:12.020 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is why I wrote
the "Black Knight Satellite"

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:13.250 align:middle line:10%
documentary.

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:15.139 align:middle line:84%
Because in order to
get these calculations,

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:16.991 align:middle line:90%
you need a satellite in orbit.

00:34:16.991 --> 00:34:18.949 align:middle line:84%
You can't do this without
a satellite in orbit.

00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:21.170 align:middle line:10%
And this satellite has been in
orbit for a long time, because,

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:21.970 align:middle line:10%
why?

00:34:21.970 --> 00:34:24.110 align:middle line:10%
This satellite was the
All-Seeing Eye of Enlil.

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Enlil knew what was going on
in the planet at all times.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.989 align:middle line:84%
He knew population centers, he
knew the size of populations,

00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:33.788 align:middle line:84%
he knew the size of crops on the
planet, on a planetary scale.

00:34:33.788 --> 00:34:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And when people would act up
or the people got too loud

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.239 align:middle line:84%
in one area, or they
started acting too wild,

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:39.697 align:middle line:84%
he would just say,
call the humans.

00:34:39.697 --> 00:34:41.572 align:middle line:84%
And he would send somebody
to spray something

00:34:41.572 --> 00:34:43.260 align:middle line:84%
on their fields to
kill all their crops,

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:45.679 align:middle line:84%
sounds like Chemtrails
in ancient times.

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:47.708 align:middle line:10%
We had the Chemtrails
already, sorry.

00:34:47.708 --> 00:34:49.250 align:middle line:84%
They came through
and wiped them out.

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:52.219 align:middle line:84%
They would just kill people
off to control the populations.

00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:54.409 align:middle line:84%
But this All-Seeing Eye,
how did he have this?

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:56.929 align:middle line:84%
This is the Eye of Sauron
in the "Lord of the Rings."

00:34:56.929 --> 00:34:58.310 align:middle line:90%
Well, the Eye actually exists.

00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:00.350 align:middle line:84%
There's actually a
Sumerian cylinder scroll

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:02.450 align:middle line:84%
that depict two beings
talking to each other,

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:05.060 align:middle line:84%
using this technology,
with wings in the sky.

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:07.190 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, that
is the Black Knight.

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Also, we discovered
that the constellation,

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:14.900 align:middle line:84%
the Bootes constellation,
is actually Enlil's.

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:17.090 align:middle line:84%
He owns the Bootes
Constellation.

00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:19.820 align:middle line:84%
The Mesopotamian gods
attribute the ownership

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:21.830 align:middle line:84%
of the Bootes
Constellation, where

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:23.900 align:middle line:90%
Epsilon is located, to Enlil.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:26.010 align:middle line:90%
What's interesting about that?

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you look at
the Bootes Constellation,

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.190 align:middle line:84%
there's actually a giant void
in there, of empty space.

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:34.220 align:middle line:84%
So much empty space,
it's an enormous void,

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:36.500 align:middle line:84%
there's not even
dust in this space.

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Michio Kaku was quoted
as saying that by--

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:42.505 align:middle line:84%
after observing this
constellation, him

00:35:42.505 --> 00:35:43.880 align:middle line:84%
and other theoretical
physicists,

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:47.900 align:middle line:84%
it appears to be a cloaked
advanced civilization.

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:49.980 align:middle line:84%
A cloak advance-- now,
why is that important?

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:51.620 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's important
because of this.

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.030 align:middle line:10%
The Black Knight
satellite signal

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:55.160 align:middle line:10%
that's been decoded
by individual people

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:59.360 align:middle line:10%
multiple times over the years,
over the course over 100 years,

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.010 align:middle line:10%
all come up with
the same conclusion.

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:04.340 align:middle line:84%
It's giving us the location
of the Bootes Constellation.

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:07.820 align:middle line:84%
So we have an Anunnaki god
on Earth, engaging mankind,

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:10.657 align:middle line:84%
building civilizations
here, which are now gone,

00:36:10.657 --> 00:36:12.740 align:middle line:84%
but there's a satellite
still orbiting this planet

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:15.290 align:middle line:84%
in a polar orbit, which you
would need a polar orbit

00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:16.467 align:middle line:90%
to make these calculations.

00:36:16.467 --> 00:36:18.050 align:middle line:84%
The other thing you
have to understand

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:19.342 align:middle line:90%
is what the polar orbit can do.

00:36:19.342 --> 00:36:24.423 align:middle line:90%
So the Earth itself is massive.

00:36:24.423 --> 00:36:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're in
an equatorial orbit,

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:27.992 align:middle line:84%
you can't capture
the entire planet.

00:36:27.992 --> 00:36:29.450 align:middle line:84%
But when you go
into a polar orbit,

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:30.700 align:middle line:90%
you can make this calculation.

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:34.310 align:middle line:10%
The pyramid, the Great
Pyramid, is the average height

00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:36.890 align:middle line:10%
of the landmass on
Earth, the average height

00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:39.540 align:middle line:10%
of the peaks of the landmass
on Earth, the average height.

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:41.180 align:middle line:10%
Now, you can't do
this just by sitting

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:42.763 align:middle line:10%
in one place in the
middle of a desert

00:36:42.763 --> 00:36:44.360 align:middle line:10%
and figure out how high this is.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.620 align:middle line:10%
So what do you need?

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:49.250 align:middle line:10%
A satellite that can actually
scan the planet this way as it

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:50.480 align:middle line:10%
spins on its axis.

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And as it spins, you're
scanning for topographical data.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.640 align:middle line:84%
You're calculating, you're
counting every single peak

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:59.960 align:middle line:84%
and hill and mountaintop on the
entire planet, which we can do

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.970 align:middle line:90%
today, we've already done it.

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, you'll have to
divide that by the height,

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:08.450 align:middle line:84%
you get the average height,
by the number of mountains

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:09.950 align:middle line:84%
and hills to get
the average height.

00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:11.210 align:middle line:90%
And then, what you'll get?

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:13.080 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're going to build the
Great Pyramid to this height.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.960 align:middle line:84%
This is the average height
of all the land mass.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.543 align:middle line:84%
Then you have-- then
the Great Pyramid

00:37:16.543 --> 00:37:18.530 align:middle line:84%
is built at the center
of land mass on Earth.

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Not the center of the Earth,
but the center of land mass.

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.660 align:middle line:10%
Not the center of Earth,
the center of land--

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:26.810 align:middle line:10%
to do that, another polar
orbiting satellite is needed.

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:28.850 align:middle line:84%
You need to be able to
see everything on Earth,

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:32.240 align:middle line:84%
calculate all the mass of land
and where to put that pyramid,

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.880 align:middle line:84%
boom right there,
that's where it goes.

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.580 align:middle line:84%
Another reason now,
Giorgio Tsoukalos

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:41.120 align:middle line:84%
had brought up the other
day the Piri Reis map

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.940 align:middle line:84%
and how it was put together,
and how it shows Antarctica

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:46.370 align:middle line:90%
when there was no ice.

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:49.020 align:middle line:84%
What's also interesting
about the Piri Reis map--

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:50.570 align:middle line:84%
if you look at
the Piri Reis map,

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:53.210 align:middle line:84%
in order to create that map
the exact way it's laid out

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:55.370 align:middle line:84%
and the angle that it's
drawn on the paper,

00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:56.960 align:middle line:84%
on the parchment
and everything, you

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:00.140 align:middle line:84%
have to have a satellite
pointing down over Cairo.

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the perspective
in order to create the map.

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:05.240 align:middle line:84%
So the Piri Reis
map, whoever drew it,

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.820 align:middle line:84%
their perspective
for laying it out

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:10.850 align:middle line:84%
was directly over
Cairo, from the sky.

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:13.345 align:middle line:84%
Again, potentially, the
Black Knight satellite.

00:38:13.345 --> 00:38:14.720 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, it was
a lot of things

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.310 align:middle line:84%
that were correlating and
linking to this thing,

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:18.102 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I did
a documentary on that.

00:38:18.102 --> 00:38:20.100 align:middle line:84%
That's why you have to
watch this documentary.

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:22.058 align:middle line:84%
So the Great Pyramid has
a lot of calculations.

00:38:22.058 --> 00:38:26.060 align:middle line:84%
The precise definition
of the royal cubit

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:28.820 align:middle line:84%
as it relates to the Earth, the
size and shape of the Earth,

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:30.350 align:middle line:84%
the mass and
density of the Earth

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:33.020 align:middle line:84%
is all calculated in there,
the gravitational constant,

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:36.860 align:middle line:84%
the escape velocity from
Earth to obtain an orbit.

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:41.810 align:middle line:84%
What is the main reason
for the 33rd degree masons?

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:43.730 align:middle line:90%
The main reason is not to--

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:46.560 align:middle line:84%
everybody thinks that there
is some kind of crazy thing.

of traveling in space.

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:05.440 align:middle line:90%
Why do I say that?

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:08.820 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to travel
33 times the speed of sound

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:11.040 align:middle line:84%
to escape Earth's gravity
to get into space.

00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:16.545 align:middle line:84%
If you travel 32, 31, 30,
you're not going to escape.

00:39:16.545 --> 00:39:17.670 align:middle line:90%
There's no escape velocity.

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:19.587 align:middle line:84%
You have to travel 33
times the speed of sound

00:39:19.587 --> 00:39:20.940 align:middle line:90%
to escape into space.

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:23.790 align:middle line:10%
That's why the runway in
Florida at the Space Coast

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:26.930 align:middle line:10%
is runway number 33.

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:29.240 align:middle line:10%

we have a case here.

don't get me wrong.

00:40:30.942 --> 00:40:33.710 align:middle line:84%
were wiser than us, probably
spiritually wiser, probably

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:36.590 align:middle line:84%
had larger pineal glands,
maybe even larger skulls,

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:40.190 align:middle line:84%
maybe more in tune with each
other, telepathic and all that,

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:41.690 align:middle line:90%
in tune with nature.

00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:43.730 align:middle line:84%
I think we lost a lot
of that capability

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:47.030 align:middle line:90%
after the genetic tinkering.

00:51:23.385 --> 00:51:26.750 align:middle line:10%
they also admitted to oxygen and
magnetic fields and everything

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:27.550 align:middle line:10%
else.

00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:31.930 align:middle line:10%
This is a very huge 4-mile
wide anomaly on Mars.

00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:35.000 align:middle line:10%
And don't forget, Cairo
literally means "City of Mars."

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.315 align:middle line:10%
That's what Cairo means.

00:51:36.315 --> 00:51:38.440 align:middle line:10%
And so they knew exactly
what they were doing there

00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:40.600 align:middle line:10%
when they named it Cairo.

00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is the IRSO
satellite image of Mars.

00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:46.900 align:middle line:84%
So the Indian Space
Agency sent back

00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:48.790 align:middle line:84%
an image when they
raised $3 million

00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:50.230 align:middle line:90%
to send a satellite to Mars.

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:53.110 align:middle line:84%
The first image that
came back was this image.

00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:55.780 align:middle line:84%
That's Mars before they
had to put their called,

00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:57.820 align:middle line:84%
quote, unquote,
"False color" on it.

00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:00.078 align:middle line:84%
They sent back the real
color, the true color image.

00:52:00.078 --> 00:52:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And as you can see, it
has light scattering

00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:04.860 align:middle line:84%
in the atmosphere
with a blue sky.

00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:09.650 align:middle line:10%
That's one of our great guys
here, Neville Thomas Tompkins.

00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:12.260 align:middle line:10%
He actually-- he's one of
the greatest guys for putting

00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:16.070 align:middle line:10%
together all these actual
stitched images that we

00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:17.510 align:middle line:10%
use to find these anomalies.

00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:20.840 align:middle line:10%
And this is also Martine Grainey
who's done a phenomenal job.

00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.280 align:middle line:10%
A lot of her anomalies are here.

00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:24.710 align:middle line:10%
And we've been on a
lot of news shows.

00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:27.650 align:middle line:10%
And so a couple things I
want to go through real quick

00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:28.530 align:middle line:10%
and show you a few.

00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Here's an anomaly that clearly
doesn't look like a rock to me.

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And so Martine found,
she's in our group.

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:36.920 align:middle line:84%
This obviously has
geometry to it.

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:38.653 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a
dilapidated structure.

00:52:38.653 --> 00:52:40.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying
that that's what it

00:52:40.070 --> 00:52:41.378 align:middle line:90%
is, I'm saying it looks like.

00:52:41.378 --> 00:52:43.170 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm not there,
and we're not there.

00:52:43.170 --> 00:52:46.520 align:middle line:84%
But what we can say is, to us,
it doesn't look like a rock.

00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:47.930 align:middle line:90%
Here's another amazing anomaly.

00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Some may say it's
pareidolia, some

00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:53.338 align:middle line:84%
may say it looks like a
carving on the surface.

00:52:53.338 --> 00:52:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Here's another carving on the
surface that mysteriously looks

00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:58.980 align:middle line:90%
like another carving of a face.

00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:00.230 align:middle line:90%
Here's an object that's there.

00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:02.147 align:middle line:10%
I don't know how blurry
it is, but this object

00:53:02.147 --> 00:53:05.430 align:middle line:10%
is standing upright and it's
got something in front of it.

00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:07.110 align:middle line:10%
We don't know
exactly what it is,

00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:09.560 align:middle line:10%
but it's very interesting,
that's all I could tell you.

00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:11.850 align:middle line:10%
So we cataloged it.

00:53:11.850 --> 00:53:13.260 align:middle line:90%
This is on Mars.

00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:14.900 align:middle line:90%
This is also on Mars.

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:16.520 align:middle line:90%
Pretty interesting, right?

00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:17.430 align:middle line:90%
A strange anomaly.

00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:18.230 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:19.102 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:53:19.102 --> 00:53:20.810 align:middle line:84%
But all you can do is
correlate something

00:53:20.810 --> 00:53:22.990 align:middle line:84%
that you might
have seen on Earth.

00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:24.070 align:middle line:90%
Another strange anomaly.

00:53:24.070 --> 00:53:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this is why they
called Mars the god of war.

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:28.840 align:middle line:84%
It looks like it might be
something that could be used

00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:30.528 align:middle line:90%
in that, but we don't know.

00:53:30.528 --> 00:53:31.570 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a cylinder.

00:53:31.570 --> 00:53:35.190 align:middle line:84%
It looks like some type
of a tool, potentially.

00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's crazy
about Mars, you

00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:41.000 align:middle line:84%
see all kinds of faces, African
face, that's an African face.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.860 align:middle line:84%
You see Native
American Indigenous

00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:46.910 align:middle line:84%
faces on Mars carved into
the side of hillsides.

00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:49.580 align:middle line:10%
You see Caucasian faces on Mars.

00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:51.830 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about a planet
that had all races on it

00:53:51.830 --> 00:53:55.110 align:middle line:10%
at one time in the distant
past, maybe even now.

00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:56.920 align:middle line:84%
We see remnants
of something here,

00:53:56.920 --> 00:54:00.360 align:middle line:84%
which looked like it
might be an old statue,

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:03.640 align:middle line:84%
or it could be a deceased
person, we don't know.

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.918 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:54:05.918 --> 00:54:07.840 align:middle line:84%
A piece of broken--
what looks like broken

00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:09.430 align:middle line:90%
concrete with geometry in it.

00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:11.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm hypothesizing
it it's concrete,

00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:14.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying it's concrete,
I'm just hypothesizing.

00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:18.220 align:middle line:10%
More of these strange faces
that appear all over the place.

00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:21.740 align:middle line:10%
Djed, here's a djed from
the-- djed from Egypt,

00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:22.660 align:middle line:10%
from the land of Khem.

00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:25.092 align:middle line:10%
They're laying out in the open.

00:54:25.092 --> 00:54:26.640 align:middle line:10%
You know these djeds, right?

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:28.223 align:middle line:10%
You've seen them in
your neighborhood.

00:54:28.223 --> 00:54:30.165 align:middle line:10%
They're your
electrical system here.

00:54:30.165 --> 00:54:32.220 align:middle line:10%
The same thing
from the Egyptians.

00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:34.290 align:middle line:10%
It captures electrical
energy and you

00:54:34.290 --> 00:54:36.990 align:middle line:10%
use it to light light
bulbs and everything else.

00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:39.150 align:middle line:10%
It's rediscovered technology.

00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:43.320 align:middle line:10%
Here's about a 4-foot
storey Egyptian statue

00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:47.070 align:middle line:10%
carved into the side
of Victoria crater.

00:54:47.070 --> 00:54:48.315 align:middle line:10%
And these are your cousins.

00:54:48.315 --> 00:54:50.700 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:53.370 align:middle line:10%
We don't know who these
are or what they are

00:54:53.370 --> 00:54:56.100 align:middle line:10%
or where they came from,
but it's pretty interesting

00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:58.757 align:middle line:10%
that they do look like somebody.

00:54:58.757 --> 00:54:59.557 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:54:59.557 --> 00:55:00.750 align:middle line:10%
Interesting.

00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:01.890 align:middle line:10%
But they're there.

00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:03.830 align:middle line:90%
Pretty interesting.

00:55:03.830 --> 00:55:06.410 align:middle line:84%
Here's a statue that made
it onto "Ancient Aliens."

00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:08.540 align:middle line:84%
This statue actually made
it onto "Ancient Aliens"

00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:12.470 align:middle line:84%
about four or five years ago,
not sure which episode it was.

00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:14.030 align:middle line:90%
We discovered that.

00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:16.767 align:middle line:10%
And here's something, and
this would be last one.

00:55:16.767 --> 00:55:18.350 align:middle line:10%
You ever heard of
the god of war Mars?

00:55:18.350 --> 00:55:21.450 align:middle line:10%
Well, here's what looks like
to be a battle tank with a gun

00:55:21.450 --> 00:55:22.250 align:middle line:10%
turret on the back.

00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:23.930 align:middle line:10%
You can see the
shadow on the back.

00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:25.310 align:middle line:10%
What's that doing there?

00:55:25.310 --> 00:55:27.560 align:middle line:10%
That's the last image
sent by the Spirit rover

00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:31.803 align:middle line:10%
before it accidentally blew up,
or they say, it went offline.

00:55:31.803 --> 00:55:34.220 align:middle line:10%
But that was the last image
that was sent by Spirit rover,

00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:34.980 align:middle line:10%
all right?

00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:36.355 align:middle line:10%
OK, that's my time
tonight, guys.

00:55:36.355 --> 00:55:38.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to abuse it.

00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:38.870 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:40.420 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:41.220 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:41.950 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:42.730 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate you, guys.

00:55:42.730 --> 00:55:43.620 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:45.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:51.000 align:middle line:90%
