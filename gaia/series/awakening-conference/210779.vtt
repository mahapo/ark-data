00:00:08.982 --> 00:00:11.477 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:13.972 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:16.380 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.230 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take
you on a ride today.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:28.080 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to take you on a
espionage, counterintelligence,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.800 align:middle line:10%
some might call disinformation
ride with Paul Bennewitz.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.750 align:middle line:10%
That's a little humor
I always like to start

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.600 align:middle line:10%
my presentations off with.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.700 align:middle line:10%
But we're going to talk about
this guy, Paul Bennewitz.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.090 align:middle line:10%
It's probably one of
the most known about,

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.400 align:middle line:10%
secret government operations
that I was involved with,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.530 align:middle line:10%
and the operation was called
Operation Seven Lambs,

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.348 align:middle line:10%
and we'll explain
that in a little bit.

00:01:01.348 --> 00:01:02.890 align:middle line:84%
First of all, about
me, I'm not going

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.050 align:middle line:84%
to go into great
details about myself.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.350 align:middle line:10%
Most of you know who I
am and what I've done.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.040 align:middle line:10%
But I come from a
military family.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.610 align:middle line:10%
My father was in the Air Force.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.220 align:middle line:84%
He retired 33
years as a colonel.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.580 align:middle line:84%
He was a pilot before he
became an intelligence officer.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Father was shot down in
Korea, and after that, he

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:27.750 align:middle line:90%
didn't fly again.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.080 align:middle line:90%
But he went into intelligence.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.300 align:middle line:84%
He didn't delve into
this game or this enigma

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.340 align:middle line:90%
of UFO activities.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.850 align:middle line:84%
He was what we call a positive
intelligence collector.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.060 align:middle line:84%
He did that for his entire
time other than the time

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.800 align:middle line:90%
he spent as a pilot.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.700 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, my uncle,
my dad's brother, Major Edward

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Doty, was in fact, a Project
Blue Book investigator.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.920 align:middle line:84%
Some of you will probably
know about the Lonnie Zamora

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.910 align:middle line:84%
incident in Socorro,
New Mexico, in 1964.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.970 align:middle line:84%
My uncle investigated
that as Project Blue Book.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.495 align:middle line:84%
And then there's my
cousin, Richard L. Doty.

00:02:14.495 --> 00:02:16.870 align:middle line:84%
He was an operations officer
for the Central Intelligence

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.770 align:middle line:90%
Agency.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.080 align:middle line:90%
He's retired now, also.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And then David, who was
Defense Intelligence Agency.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.080 align:middle line:84%
So I came from somewhat of
an intelligence background,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.740 align:middle line:84%
and one of the questions
I'm asked all the time

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.890 align:middle line:84%
was did they recruit
you into intelligence

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.450 align:middle line:84%
because my father, my uncle,
and cousins were there?

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know,
honestly speaking,

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.660 align:middle line:84%
I was never told
that I was, but there

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.050 align:middle line:84%
were a lot of hints passed
along during my career

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.516 align:middle line:84%
that you're here
because of your family.

00:02:59.516 --> 00:03:00.420 align:middle line:90%
OK, who am I?

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.630 align:middle line:84%
I served in active duty,
United States Air Force.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.700 align:middle line:84%
I was in again, in
something specialized

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.880 align:middle line:84%
during my enlisted
days in the Air Force,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.730 align:middle line:90%
just 4 and 1/2 years.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.440 align:middle line:84%
I also was in the National Guard
for a short period of time.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.260 align:middle line:90%
I got out.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.940 align:middle line:84%
I went to college, and then
I went back in, recruited in,

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.450 align:middle line:90%
to the intelligence community.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Now a lot of people
don't realize

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.710 align:middle line:84%
that in the United
States, there's

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.450 align:middle line:90%
various intelligence agencies.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.950 align:middle line:84%
But if you go into intelligence
or counterintelligence,

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.900 align:middle line:84%
counterespionage, you're
trained in one particular place,

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and that's the Intelligence
Operations Course.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And you go through a
lot of training, a lot

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.210 align:middle line:90%
of vast amount of training.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.710 align:middle line:10%
I was talking to
some people earlier

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.270 align:middle line:10%
about some of the stupid things
they did to us to test us, test

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.180 align:middle line:10%
our abilities to concentrate
on a particular matter

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.910 align:middle line:10%
without going to pieces.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.153 align:middle line:84%
And my particular
class was 60 candidates

00:04:06.153 --> 00:04:07.320 align:middle line:90%
that went through the class.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Only 18 of us made
it out of there.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.430 align:middle line:90%
So it wasn't easy.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.290 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't anything like SEAL
training or anything like that,

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.790 align:middle line:90%
but it was still tough.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.030 align:middle line:84%
I stayed and I retired in
what we call, in the States,

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.135 align:middle line:90%
as combined, government service.

00:04:24.135 --> 00:04:25.770 align:middle line:90%
You serve so many times.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.210 align:middle line:84%
Your military can count
against civilian service.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.100 align:middle line:84%
I also worked for a
short period of time

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.350 align:middle line:84%
as an investigator for
New Mexico State Police.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And then I went to
work for Dr. Puthoff,

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.440 align:middle line:84%
at the Institute for Advanced
Studies in Austin, Texas.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.260 align:middle line:84%
A lot of that information that
we gathered during that time

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:52.190 align:middle line:84%
period, I can relate back to
the subjects of UFOs or reverse

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.130 align:middle line:90%
engineering.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.760 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, that
was a private company,

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.840 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to talk
about this a little bit.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a private company, and
there's proprietary safeguards.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.770 align:middle line:84%
So I can't talk and
disclose everything

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.170 align:middle line:90%
I did during that time period.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And since then, I've worked
for a number of film companies.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.240 align:middle line:84%
I've been on the air
a number of times.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2017, I
started working for Gaia.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.650 align:middle line:84%
I have approximately
25 episodes on Gaia.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:25.610 align:middle line:90%
I want to thank Gaia.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.290 align:middle line:90%
I want to thank Vitaly.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.830 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank this
wonderful crowd out here.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.200 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I spoke to a
lot of people out here,

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.940 align:middle line:10%
and it's a fantastic event.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.065 align:middle line:10%
And I'm glad you're here.

00:05:38.065 --> 00:05:42.580 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's delve
into Paul Bennewitz.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:48.860 align:middle line:84%
This operation, I ran, and there
were others involved in this.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.830 align:middle line:10%
Once you hear and
see this, you would

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.900 align:middle line:10%
swear this is a movie plot
or a script for a movie.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.570 align:middle line:10%
I don't think there's
anybody out there, eh, maybe

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.830 align:middle line:10%
Steven Spielberg or maybe Sid
Goldberg, my boss, out here

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.320 align:middle line:10%
in the crowd, might be able
to write a script like that.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.350 align:middle line:84%
But it has a little
bit of everything.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:18.110 align:middle line:84%
It contains espionage, sabotage,
abductions, alien abductions,

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:24.560 align:middle line:84%
and other strange phenomena,
which you probably won't even

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.530 align:middle line:90%
believe when I get into it.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:33.020 align:middle line:84%
It includes real contacts,
absolutely real proven contacts

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.830 align:middle line:84%
that Paul Bennewitz
had with ETs,

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and that will be
discussed in a little bit.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.190 align:middle line:84%
But anyways, most
of this information

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.740 align:middle line:90%
hasn't been released.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.300 align:middle line:90%
Some of it has.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:53.290 align:middle line:84%
I've given this presentation
several years ago,

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.500 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't have a
lot of the details

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.280 align:middle line:90%
because it was still classified.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:05.630 align:middle line:84%
In 2019, the Air Force and the
Defense Intelligence Agency

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.720 align:middle line:84%
released a lot of information
about Paul Bennewitz.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.390 align:middle line:10%
Unfortunately, most
of those are redacted,

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.220 align:middle line:10%
and I'm sure some
of you researchers

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.440 align:middle line:10%
out here can relate to that.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.720 align:middle line:10%
You get a document from the
Central Intelligence Agency

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.390 align:middle line:10%
or Air Force or something
and most of it's blacked out.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.600 align:middle line:84%
This one was but you
can fill in the blanks

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.680 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of these things,
and I try to do that.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.300 align:middle line:90%
OK, who was Bob Bennewitz?

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.020 align:middle line:90%


00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.530 align:middle line:90%
He was born in California.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:38.330 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.810 align:middle line:84%
He was born in
California, in 1927.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.310 align:middle line:84%
He grew up, and at the age of
14, he moved to New Mexico.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.530 align:middle line:10%
His father was a miner.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.780 align:middle line:10%
A lot of mining going
on in New Mexico

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.060 align:middle line:10%
back in those days,
uranium mining.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.980 align:middle line:10%


00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:00.540 align:middle line:10%
At the age of 17,
he wandered away.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.210 align:middle line:10%
Paul wandered away,
went to California,

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:06.060 align:middle line:10%
and joined the United
States Coast Guard.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.540 align:middle line:10%
This is during World War
II, and Paul actually

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:15.565 align:middle line:10%
saw actions in and around the
Pacific in the Coast Guard.

00:08:15.565 --> 00:08:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Few people realize
that the Coast Guard

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:20.400 align:middle line:84%
was, in fact, a
combat organization

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.990 align:middle line:90%
attached to the Army during war.

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:24.930 align:middle line:90%
And so Paul saw action there.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.900 align:middle line:10%
Paul attended college, got
a Bachelor's of Science

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:31.710 align:middle line:10%
in engineering, went on
and got a master's degree.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.659 align:middle line:10%
And then he started
his own laboratory

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:35.580 align:middle line:10%
in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.190 align:middle line:10%
It's called Thunder
Scientific Laboratories.

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:43.919 align:middle line:10%
It's right outside the
gate, one of the main gates

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:46.780 align:middle line:10%
to Kirtland Air Force Base.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:51.400 align:middle line:10%
He managed to get a contract to
make temperature and humidity

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.500 align:middle line:10%
sensors for submarines.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Paul's interest in UFOs
began in New Mexico.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.520 align:middle line:84%
He took his family on a trip to
northern New Mexico, a camping

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.820 align:middle line:90%
trip.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Him and his family saw a
UFO, not just one, but many.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And Paul's story
about this, I wish

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.500 align:middle line:84%
I could tell you all of it,
but I have limited time.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Paul started reading
everything he could about UFOs.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:22.020 align:middle line:84%
What they were,
where they came from.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Paul joined MUFON, CAUS,
all the other UFO groups.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.612 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he was the Director
of Operations for MUFON

00:09:30.612 --> 00:09:32.070 align:middle line:84%
in New Mexico for
a number of years

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.080 align:middle line:90%
before this incident happened.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.485 align:middle line:84%
Now Paul lived in
Southeast Albuquerque,

00:09:38.485 --> 00:09:41.590 align:middle line:90%
in the area called Four Hills.

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And Four Hills is adjacent to
the perimeter of Kirtland Air

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:46.808 align:middle line:90%
Force Base.

00:09:46.808 --> 00:09:48.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show you a
map here in a little bit.

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And Paul's house was
right on the perimeter.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, inside this base,
directly in view of Paul,

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.470 align:middle line:84%
was the largest
nuclear weapons storage

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.050 align:middle line:90%
in the world, Manzano Base.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.660 align:middle line:84%
It was called Manzano
Weapons Storage Area,

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:11.730 align:middle line:84%
but in actuality, it was a
nuclear weapon storage area.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:14.930 align:middle line:84%
The billet in the '50
dug it out of a mountain,

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:18.110 align:middle line:84%
and they put together both
the fission and the fusion

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:21.670 align:middle line:84%
nuclear weapons
inside that mountain.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Paul was also a camera
buff, amateur photographer.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.635 align:middle line:84%
He saw some things
flying around Kirtland.

00:10:29.635 --> 00:10:30.760 align:middle line:90%
Didn't know what they were.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:35.240 align:middle line:84%
So he set up his camera out
on his patio, brand new AE-1

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.040 align:middle line:90%
camera.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.807 align:middle line:90%
This is in 1979.

00:10:38.807 --> 00:10:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Some of the older
people here probably

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.610 align:middle line:84%
can remember what
a Canon AE-1 is.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And other electronic
gathering and devices.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.710 align:middle line:90%
Now he was a scientist.

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:56.200 align:middle line:84%
So he knew how to collect
signals, frequencies,

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.280 align:middle line:84%
radiation,
electromagnetic waves,

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.950 align:middle line:84%
and he had all these
monitors out on his patio.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:09.660 align:middle line:84%
He directed his camera and the
equipment towards the base, not

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.360 align:middle line:84%
necessarily Manzano
but just the base.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:17.590 align:middle line:84%
Also inside this base was a
very, very extremely sensitive

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:19.890 align:middle line:90%
area.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:22.920 align:middle line:84%
It was called the
Starlight Complex.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:27.390 align:middle line:84%
Starlight Complex was a
National Security Agency,

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:30.090 align:middle line:84%
that's another intelligence
agency in the United

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:34.260 align:middle line:84%
States, that collected
signal intelligence

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:40.020 align:middle line:84%
and electronic intelligence
for the intelligence community.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.740 align:middle line:10%
They had a special
laser out there

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.860 align:middle line:10%
at that base in that complex.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.060 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to talk
about that in a bit

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.860 align:middle line:10%
and exactly what that did.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.590 align:middle line:10%
Paul started collecting
all these strange signals.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:58.910 align:middle line:10%
Started photographing these
strange lights and objects

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:03.710 align:middle line:10%
that were flying around the
base, both around the runway--

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:05.510 align:middle line:10%
now, Kirtland Air
Force Base shares

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:08.555 align:middle line:10%
a runway with Albuquerque
International Airport.

00:12:08.555 --> 00:12:11.468 align:middle line:84%
Or I like to say Albuquerque
International Airport

00:12:11.468 --> 00:12:13.010 align:middle line:84%
shares the runway
with the Air Force,

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:16.940 align:middle line:84%
because the Air Force
had priority control

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.440 align:middle line:90%
over of the airstrip.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't know what
to do with this stuff.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.330 align:middle line:84%
So he went to a retired
military person.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.340 align:middle line:84%
He told his military
person, hey,

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:33.330 align:middle line:84%
I saw all these strange
things flying around the base.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.410 align:middle line:90%
What do you think I should do?

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And this colonel says, I
think you should report it.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:47.310 align:middle line:90%
So and that's what Paul did.

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Paul eventually contacted
Lieutenant Colonel Ernie

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:51.630 align:middle line:90%
Edwards.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:54.270 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Edwards was the
commander of the security

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:57.300 align:middle line:90%
force guarding Manzano Base.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And Paul says,
listen, I've collected

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:04.380 align:middle line:84%
all these photographs, all
these electronic signals

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.670 align:middle line:90%
from the base.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:07.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a spy.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm a loyal American.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:12.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm a veteran, and I'm
afraid that there's

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:16.370 align:middle line:90%
a danger to national security.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:21.900 align:middle line:84%
So he came out to the base,
talked to Colonel Edwards.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Edwards saw everything
he had and Ernie Edwards said,

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:34.680 align:middle line:90%
my god, this is amazing.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.200 align:middle line:84%
So immediately, he
called me on the phone.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.950 align:middle line:84%
I was a counterintelligence
officer for the base.

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:43.530 align:middle line:84%
He said, you got
to come down here.

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:47.370 align:middle line:84%
You got to look at what I
just got from this guy that

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:48.720 align:middle line:90%
lives right outside the base.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.200 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:49.710 align:middle line:90%
I went down.

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:50.850 align:middle line:90%
I looked at everything.

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.940 align:middle line:90%
I said, wow, this is amazing.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:58.200 align:middle line:84%
So I knew, looking at
the photographs of what

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.720 align:middle line:90%
Paul initially photographed.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, at Kirtland, there's a
research and development entity

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:10.283 align:middle line:84%
or unit called the Air
Force Weapons Laboratory,

00:14:10.283 --> 00:14:12.450 align:middle line:84%
and they were testing all
sorts of different things,

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.250 align:middle line:90%
high-energy lasers.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And at that time,
and this is 1979,

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:25.130 align:middle line:84%
'80s, was a highly
classified drone program.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.190 align:middle line:84%
So I took one look
at the pictures,

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:28.565 align:middle line:84%
and I was the
counterintelligence

00:14:28.565 --> 00:14:30.020 align:middle line:90%
of the base.

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.490 align:middle line:90%
I knew what was going on.

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:38.950 align:middle line:84%
So I did a report, send
it up to headquarters,

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:44.620 align:middle line:84%
and headquarters was fascinated
by what this guy was doing.

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.710 align:middle line:84%
But they were also very
concerned about it.

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:54.110 align:middle line:84%
So I get a message back saying
you need to interview this guy,

00:14:54.110 --> 00:15:00.110 align:middle line:84%
and we need to see what
he has and investigate it.

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:03.620 align:middle line:10%
Now, in the government, in
the United States government

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.510 align:middle line:10%
and especially in the
intelligence community,

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:10.910 align:middle line:10%
we didn't do anything
without an operational plan.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.090 align:middle line:10%
Now people who have been in
the military or in government,

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:15.530 align:middle line:10%
you know what I'm talking about.

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.220 align:middle line:90%
You got to have a plan.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And so the plan came
down from headquarters.

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And so they told me go
out and interview him.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Collect as much
information as you can.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.160 align:middle line:90%
And so I did.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:29.960 align:middle line:90%
I called him.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.100 align:middle line:90%
I introduced myself.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.040 align:middle line:90%
I said, here's what I need.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.944 align:middle line:90%


00:15:36.944 --> 00:15:41.502 align:middle line:84%
Can you make time for
me to interview you?

00:15:41.502 --> 00:15:42.710 align:middle line:90%
He said, yeah, sure, come on.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.540 align:middle line:90%
So I went over to his lab.

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.040 align:middle line:90%
I sat down with him.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:51.360 align:middle line:84%
He showed me what he had, and
I accepted everything he had.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I took everything
that he gave me.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And I said, wow,
that's fascinating,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.770 align:middle line:84%
but why are you
doing this, Paul?

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Why are you photographing
things on the base?

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:06.080 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm concerned.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm a veteran.

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm a loyal American.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:14.240 align:middle line:84%
I have a-- it's called an
industrial security clearance

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.870 align:middle line:84%
with the government,
making humidity sensors

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.840 align:middle line:84%
and temperature sensors for
submarines and spacecrafts.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm concerned that there's
there's danger to the base.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:28.390 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, and then
he started telling me

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:33.850 align:middle line:84%
about all his past history
about investigating

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:37.780 align:middle line:90%
cattle mutilations, UFOs.

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:40.270 align:middle line:90%
He was a member of MUFON.

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.790 align:middle line:84%
He talked about all
these things to me.

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:46.050 align:middle line:10%
And I just sat there
and listened to Paul.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:51.840 align:middle line:10%
And Paul had met,
in another realm,

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.020 align:middle line:10%
we're going to--
hopefully, I'll get to--

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:58.710 align:middle line:10%
of another incident that
happened involving an abduction

00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:59.880 align:middle line:10%
incident.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, he talked to a woman
by the name of Tamara Lancroft.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.680 align:middle line:10%
She was an intelligence officer,
a civilian intelligence officer

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:12.030 align:middle line:10%
for the 650th MI, which
is a military intelligence

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:13.650 align:middle line:10%
unit on Kirtland.

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And their primary mission was
protecting nuclear material,

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:20.670 align:middle line:90%
nuclear weapons.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:22.940 align:middle line:84%
He also had contact
with Gabe Valdez.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.609 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of you know
who Gabe Valdez is,

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:28.370 align:middle line:84%
and if you don't know, he
was a New Mexico State police

00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:30.120 align:middle line:84%
officer, who lived in
northern New Mexico.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And he was the first person
that came upon and investigated

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:37.490 align:middle line:90%
cattle mutilations.

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.380 align:middle line:90%
He was the very, very first one.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.210 align:middle line:84%
He did very, very
detailed reports.

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:47.470 align:middle line:84%
He got the FBI and everybody
else involved in this.

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And then Paul told me
about Myrna Hansen.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.510 align:middle line:90%
Myrna Hansen was an abductee.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:18:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And she was abducted, and he
was working with Leo Sprinkle

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:03.130 align:middle line:90%
regarding her.

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, after I spoke to
Paul, gathered all the videos

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:12.550 align:middle line:84%
and photographs, I went back
and sat down with my supervisor.

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And he says, OK, you need to
do a very detailed report.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:21.700 align:middle line:84%
We need to send this up to
headquarters, which I did.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And headquarters says they
want more information.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:32.450 align:middle line:84%
The operational plan came down
and said, you need to go out,

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:35.120 align:middle line:84%
and we need to conduct a
counterintelligence operation

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.070 align:middle line:90%
against Paul Bennewitz.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that sounds
pretty horrible, right?

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And in your words,
that meant Rick Doty

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:49.610 align:middle line:84%
was going to go out and run
a disinformation campaign

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:51.770 align:middle line:90%
against Paul Bennewitz.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.870 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's exactly what I did.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:56.495 align:middle line:10%
That's the mission.

00:18:56.495 --> 00:18:58.190 align:middle line:10%
I was given the mission.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:03.680 align:middle line:10%
I did what I was told to
do, and I'll show you later

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.490 align:middle line:10%
that I was commended for it.

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:10.720 align:middle line:10%
But here's the difference.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.580 align:middle line:10%
Paul was a true
believer in UFOs.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:20.110 align:middle line:10%
He was thoroughly convinced that
what he was taking pictures of

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:22.500 align:middle line:10%
were, in fact, UFOs.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.413 align:middle line:10%
I knew they were drones.

00:19:24.413 --> 00:19:25.830 align:middle line:10%
The only thing I
didn't know about

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:29.400 align:middle line:10%
was the electronic signals
that Paul was collecting.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.630 align:middle line:10%
Where is that coming from?

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, what Paul tapped
into was, at that time

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:41.600 align:middle line:84%
and it's not classified anymore,
was a highly classified program

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.860 align:middle line:84%
that the United States had
to blind Soviet satellites

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:48.950 align:middle line:90%
coming over the United States.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:50.840 align:middle line:84%
The NSA had a high-energy
laser that they

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.750 align:middle line:84%
could shoot up in
the air, hit the lens

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:57.110 align:middle line:84%
of the Soviet satellite,
and blind them

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:59.210 align:middle line:84%
so the Soviets
couldn't take pictures

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:00.590 align:middle line:90%
of what was on the ground.

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:03.560 align:middle line:84%
We had one at different
locations in the United States,

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.280 align:middle line:84%
including Kirtland, Area 51, and
other places around the United

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.600 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:13.600 align:middle line:84%
Paul was detecting the
frequency used by that laser.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.600 align:middle line:84%
Now at the time, I wasn't
fully briefed into this,

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.710 align:middle line:90%
but that's what he was doing.

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:22.480 align:middle line:84%
But I was told to go out,
collect everything I can,

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:26.260 align:middle line:84%
and convince Paul that
what he was seeing

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:30.790 align:middle line:84%
was, in fact, refers
and not obviously,

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:31.810 align:middle line:90%
a classified program.

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:35.050 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't brief him into that.

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:37.100 align:middle line:90%
We get deeper.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:42.020 align:middle line:84%
So I go out to Paul, and
I tell him, Paul, I said,

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.750 align:middle line:90%
what do you think it is?

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.630 align:middle line:90%
And Paul says, well, it's UFOs.

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:48.310 align:middle line:90%
I know it's UFOs.

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:50.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm adamant about it.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:54.970 align:middle line:84%
I said, do you think that the
signals are also from UFOs?

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:57.220 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:00.490 align:middle line:84%
A side note here, Paul knew
about Dulce, New Mexico.

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:02.380 align:middle line:90%
He was up there many times.

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:03.520 align:middle line:90%
Paul was a private pilot.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.302 align:middle line:84%
Took pictures up
there, came back,

00:21:06.302 --> 00:21:08.260 align:middle line:84%
and we'll talk about that
in a little bit, too.

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, you
know what, Paul?

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.440 align:middle line:90%
I think you're right.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.460 align:middle line:90%
I think you're right.

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:20.320 align:middle line:84%
I think what you're
seeing are exactly UFOs.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.530 align:middle line:84%
Now you can believe
me if you want.

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:27.600 align:middle line:84%
That's the only convincing I had
to do to Paul Bennewitz for him

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.880 align:middle line:90%
to believe that there were UFOs.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.440 align:middle line:90%
My job was finished.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.730 align:middle line:90%
I convinced him.

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.260 align:middle line:90%
He's thinking it's UFOs.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.370 align:middle line:90%
I knew it wasn't UFOs.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:43.490 align:middle line:90%
OK, this is where things change.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, my job
was to convince him--

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.820 align:middle line:90%
disinformation, you call it.

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.790 align:middle line:84%
We call it counterintelligence--
that what he was seeing

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:54.890 align:middle line:90%
was UFOs.

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Paul invited myself
and another agent.

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And Jerry Miller,
now Jerry Miller,

00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:59.890 align:middle line:90%
I haven't really talked about.

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:03.440 align:middle line:84%
Jerry Miller was a former
Project Blue Book investigator.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.990 align:middle line:84%
He came up with me
and interviewed Paul.

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:09.860 align:middle line:84%
I came out to the house, at
Paul's house, at his lab,

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:11.250 align:middle line:90%
and he was a scientist.

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:12.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a scientist.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.090 align:middle line:90%
My background isn't in science.

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:15.590 align:middle line:84%
So I had to bring
somebody that knew

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:19.220 align:middle line:84%
what they were looking at as
far as signals and so forth.

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, we went out one night
to Paul's house for dinner.

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And I had another agent with me
by the name of Steve and Jerry

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.000 align:middle line:90%
Miller.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.410 align:middle line:84%
After dinner, we went into
a room off the dining room.

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:34.625 align:middle line:90%
There's a couch.

00:22:34.625 --> 00:22:36.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm sitting on a couch.

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.640 align:middle line:90%
Steve's sitting next to me.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.800 align:middle line:84%
Jerry's sitting over
here in a lounge

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.590 align:middle line:90%
chair and then Paul Bennewitz.

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:45.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm facing a wall, just a wall.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.690 align:middle line:84%
There's just a
picture on the wall.

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And during our
conversation, it's

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:53.810 align:middle line:84%
just a casual conversation
about weather and nothing

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:55.970 align:middle line:90%
to do with the subject matter.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:57.440 align:middle line:10%
And while I'm
looking at the wall,

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.600 align:middle line:10%
in the lower, left-hand
corner of the wall,

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:04.720 align:middle line:10%
I see this pulsating light.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.830 align:middle line:90%
And I'm watching this.

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:08.840 align:middle line:90%


00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's moving,
but it's not moving

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:13.850 align:middle line:90%
other than just that corner.

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, Steve, next to me,
jabs me, and says, look.

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.400 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking at this thing.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And I look over at Jerry, and
the first thing Jerry Miller--

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:28.730 align:middle line:84%
now, Jerry is a seasoned
UFO investigator.

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:33.640 align:middle line:90%
Jerry says, points to his watch.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Now at first, I didn't really
understand what he was saying.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:41.830 align:middle line:84%
But I caught on later that
he said, look at the time.

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Make sure we are not
going to miss any time.

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:48.160 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, this orb
moved up and around

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:53.470 align:middle line:84%
and all around the wall,
all around the room.

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And as it was in the
middle-- now at first,

00:23:55.990 --> 00:24:00.580 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was a light, a
beam from a light behind me.

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:02.230 align:middle line:90%
But there was a hutch behind me.

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:04.450 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking all
over for some kind

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:06.740 align:middle line:84%
of flashlight or something,
and I couldn't find it.

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:11.140 align:middle line:84%
But when it came out in a
three-dimensional shape,

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:13.280 align:middle line:90%
I knew it wasn't a light.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, how the
heck did he do this?

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm thinking Paul's doing this.

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:20.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking over at Paul, and
Paul's just staring at it.

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:23.920 align:middle line:84%
He's not making eye
contact with anybody.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:28.500 align:middle line:84%
As it moves around the
room, I'm looking at Jerry.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking all around, waiting
for somebody to say anything.

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:35.670 align:middle line:84%
About that time, Paul's wife
comes out from the kitchen

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:38.190 align:middle line:84%
through the dining room,
and she has a tray.

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:39.240 align:middle line:90%
We were having coffee.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.040 align:middle line:10%
She was going to get
more coffee to us.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.900 align:middle line:10%
And she stopped and
looked up, and she

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.920 align:middle line:10%
said, oh, our friend is back.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.170 align:middle line:10%
And that kind of broke the ice.

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:50.360 align:middle line:10%
The object then
went exactly back

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.600 align:middle line:10%
to where it came
from and disappeared.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:57.800 align:middle line:10%
Now what did we just see?

00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.570 align:middle line:10%
I immediately confronted Paul.

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:00.800 align:middle line:10%
I'm a straight shooter.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.570 align:middle line:10%
I'm good at interrogation.

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:05.480 align:middle line:10%
I said, Paul, what
have you just done?

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:08.030 align:middle line:10%
Paul says, I haven't
done anything.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:10.490 align:middle line:10%
I was convinced
Paul was doing this.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:12.050 align:middle line:10%
Jerry was, too.

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:13.895 align:middle line:10%
Jerry said, you know what?

00:25:13.895 --> 00:25:16.083 align:middle line:10%
What we just seen is--

00:25:16.083 --> 00:25:17.750 align:middle line:10%
you got to tell us
how you did it, Paul.

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:18.550 align:middle line:10%
I didn't.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:19.490 align:middle line:10%
I didn't do anything.

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:24.220 align:middle line:10%
So Paul allowed us to
bring Jerry's equipment in.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.390 align:middle line:10%
We scanned the house.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:26.260 align:middle line:10%
We checked.

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:28.180 align:middle line:10%
We couldn't figure
out how it happened.

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:33.470 align:middle line:10%
But that is an incident
that I will never forget,

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:37.780 align:middle line:10%
and that kind of changes the
course of our investigation.

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:41.510 align:middle line:84%
I went back, and I did a
very, more detailed report.

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And plus, I added
all the information

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:47.440 align:middle line:84%
that we collected
during our investigation

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.060 align:middle line:90%
at Paul's residence.

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:55.000 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't find anything
that would indicate or prove

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.100 align:middle line:84%
or any kind of equipment that
would have generated such orb.

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, against a wall,
I can understand it

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:05.030 align:middle line:84%
because we actually
duplicated that.

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:08.410 align:middle line:84%
But when it flew out in
a three-dimensional--

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:10.900 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the room, we
don't know how he did that.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:16.480 align:middle line:84%
But we were then convinced,
after thorough investigation,

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.110 align:middle line:84%
that what happened
in Paul's house

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:24.270 align:middle line:84%
was, in fact, not
connected to Paul,

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:28.260 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't connected
to anything that we did.

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:31.310 align:middle line:90%
So who did that?

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So what we did then was
we kind of changed tones

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:37.640 align:middle line:90%
in the investigation.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:43.300 align:middle line:84%
We thought, well,
OK, maybe, maybe Paul

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.860 align:middle line:90%
is telling the truth.

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:55.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, Paul had a computer and
the computer that Paul had,

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:59.910 align:middle line:84%
he was collecting strange
characters, almost

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:03.870 align:middle line:84%
like Chinese characters
or Egyptian hieroglyphs,

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:05.850 align:middle line:90%
on his computer.

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And we photographed
these things.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:13.540 align:middle line:84%
He also, and we'll go
into this in a little bit,

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:16.000 align:middle line:84%
a figure appeared
on his monitor.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.460 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is back in 1980.

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:23.820 align:middle line:90%
No color computer monitors.

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:28.340 align:middle line:84%
They were very crude back
then compared to today.

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:31.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's a
black-and-white monitor.

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:35.810 align:middle line:84%
The image that came on, and I'm
going to show you this image,

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:37.922 align:middle line:90%
is color.

00:27:37.922 --> 00:27:38.755 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:27:38.755 --> 00:27:41.290 align:middle line:90%


00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Now we also have espionage
involved in this and sabotage,

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:53.940 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not going to get
into great details on that

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:59.670 align:middle line:84%
because it didn't relate
to Paul's UFO connections.

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:06.500 align:middle line:10%
What I want to go into now
is what Paul was doing,

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:10.760 align:middle line:10%
what Paul was collecting
on his monitor,

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:16.460 align:middle line:10%
and what Paul saw
and did later on.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:20.420 align:middle line:10%
As this case
progressed, we realized

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.910 align:middle line:10%
that there's a
possibility, and we

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:27.920 align:middle line:10%
sat in a secure room,
the bubble, we called it,

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.440 align:middle line:10%
and with people coming
down from headquarters,

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.260 align:middle line:10%
high-ranking officials
coming down from headquarters

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:36.260 align:middle line:10%
and the Defense Intelligence
Agency and the Air Force

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:37.340 align:middle line:10%
Intelligence.

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.260 align:middle line:10%
And we're sitting
around a table talking

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:43.420 align:middle line:10%
about what just happened.

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:47.600 align:middle line:10%
Paul was invited out to
the base, and he came out

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.530 align:middle line:10%
and he gave a demonstration
to all these top-ranking--

00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:55.250 align:middle line:10%
in fact, the people
in this room,

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:58.970 align:middle line:10%
other than myself, who
was just a Special Agent,

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:01.420 align:middle line:10%
were at least a colonel.

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:05.410 align:middle line:10%
We had five generals,
and we had some GM,

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:10.660 align:middle line:10%
which is civilian equivalent
to generals, GM16s and 17s.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:12.490 align:middle line:90%
He gave a presentation.

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:15.860 align:middle line:90%
They all scratched their head.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:18.620 align:middle line:90%
How does he do this stuff?

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, how is he doing that
and what did he collect?

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Number one, as I
told you earlier,

00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:30.820 align:middle line:90%
Paul tapped into NSA signals.

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:37.220 align:middle line:90%
And he unwittingly did this.

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:40.850 align:middle line:84%
He didn't do it to collect
espionage material.

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:44.070 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know what
he was collecting.

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:47.910 align:middle line:10%
While we were running our
operation, unbeknownst to us,

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:51.090 align:middle line:10%
the National Security
Agency was running

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:53.160 align:middle line:10%
their own investigation.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.740 align:middle line:84%
There was an incident that
happened out at Paul's house.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:59.880 align:middle line:84%
We were out of Paul's house,
myself and this other agent.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And we were searching
around the house,

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.460 align:middle line:90%
looking at different things.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:06.990 align:middle line:90%
And we were up in his--

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:11.970 align:middle line:84%
he had a large window that
looked out into the street

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:13.170 align:middle line:90%
from his bedroom.

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And as I looked
across the street,

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:16.410 align:middle line:84%
and it was a rainy
night in Albuquerque.

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:20.710 align:middle line:84%
I see this red light in
this window, on and off.

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And I asked Paul, I said,
who lives over there, Paul?

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:23.820 align:middle line:90%
Paul says, nobody.

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:24.540 align:middle line:90%
It's vacant.

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:26.082 align:middle line:84%
I said, somebody is
over there, Paul.

00:30:26.082 --> 00:30:27.980 align:middle line:90%
Look at that red light.

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.690 align:middle line:90%
He goes, wow.

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:34.160 align:middle line:84%
So myself and the other
agent, we were federal agents.

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.700 align:middle line:90%
We have guns.

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.115 align:middle line:90%
And so we went over there.

00:30:37.115 --> 00:30:39.785 align:middle line:84%
And before I left, I called
Albuquerque Police Department.

00:30:39.785 --> 00:30:41.180 align:middle line:90%
I had contacts down there.

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:44.030 align:middle line:84%
I said, hey, can you send
a patrol car out here?

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:46.400 align:middle line:84%
We got a situation, maybe
a breaking and entering

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.220 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:48.020 align:middle line:90%
So they did.

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:49.910 align:middle line:84%
They sent a couple of
officers out there.

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:51.000 align:middle line:90%
We went over.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.452 align:middle line:84%
We confronted the two
people that came down.

00:30:53.452 --> 00:30:54.660 align:middle line:90%
What are you guys doing here?

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:56.330 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we rented this place.

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:57.620 align:middle line:90%
What company do you work for?

00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:00.930 align:middle line:90%
We work for Avis Rental Car.

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:03.390 align:middle line:84%
You work for Avis
Rental Car, and you're

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:06.540 align:middle line:84%
taking pictures of
Paul Bennewitz's house

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:07.380 align:middle line:90%
from up there?

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:08.180 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:10.170 align:middle line:90%
You can't even see his cars.

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Did he rent a car and
not turn it back or what?

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:13.950 align:middle line:90%
And they wouldn't talk.

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:15.270 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't
really tell us much.

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:16.687 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't allow
us in, either.

00:31:16.687 --> 00:31:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Because the Albuquerque
Police officers--

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:23.220 align:middle line:84%
and this is civilian
jurisdiction, not federal--

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:26.110 align:middle line:84%
said, we want to come and
look at what you got in there.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:28.790 align:middle line:84%
They said, no, not
without a warrant.

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:32.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, after this happened, the
next day, I went out to NSA,

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:34.160 align:middle line:90%
and I know the guy.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.170 align:middle line:90%
His name is Ferguson.

00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:37.920 align:middle line:84%
He's the chief of
security out there.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And I said, listen,
you got two options.

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:43.460 align:middle line:84%
You tell me what you're
doing against Paul Bennewitz,

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:45.680 align:middle line:84%
or I'm going to come out
here with a federal warrant

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.810 align:middle line:90%
and search your files.

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And he said, OK, let
me get you briefed in.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:51.930 align:middle line:90%
And he tells me the story.

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:53.690 align:middle line:84%
I said, you guys are
investigating Paul

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:54.800 align:middle line:90%
and you didn't tell us?

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.990 align:middle line:84%
That's interfering with
a federal investigation.

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:58.230 align:middle line:90%
That's against the law.

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:02.960 align:middle line:84%
He said no, no, no, we're not
doing it for criminal matter.

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.870 align:middle line:84%
We're just doing it to
collect what he has.

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:08.145 align:middle line:90%
Well, they did.

00:32:08.145 --> 00:32:11.420 align:middle line:90%


00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:14.730 align:middle line:84%
They continued, and we're going
to get into what they did.

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:17.820 align:middle line:90%


00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Another incident that happened
which solidified our beliefs

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:27.510 align:middle line:84%
that Paul really had contact
with extraterrestrials, Paul

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:28.920 align:middle line:84%
was a pilot, like
I said earlier.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.030 align:middle line:90%
Paul flew a plane.

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:32.070 align:middle line:90%
He had a plane, a Cessna 180.

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:34.770 align:middle line:90%
He flew it up to Dulce.

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:38.610 align:middle line:84%
He had with him, in the
right seat, a photographer

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:41.850 align:middle line:90%
that worked at his laboratory.

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:43.522 align:middle line:84%
And this guy was an
expert photographer,

00:32:43.522 --> 00:32:44.730 align:middle line:90%
and he had a camera with him.

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:46.105 align:middle line:84%
And they were
going to photograph

00:32:46.105 --> 00:32:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Dulce Base, or at least
the top of the mountain,

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.890 align:middle line:90%
the top of Archuleta Peak.

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:52.912 align:middle line:84%
Now we all know what's supposed
to be there and the legend

00:32:52.912 --> 00:32:54.120 align:middle line:90%
there and so forth and so on.

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.370 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could go into
that, but I don't have time.

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, as they were
flying back over Red River,

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:03.200 align:middle line:84%
New Mexico, which is
in northern New Mexico,

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Paul had an encounter
with a UFO, a huge UFO.

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:13.450 align:middle line:84%
This thing was so huge,
you could have probably

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:16.480 align:middle line:90%
put 10 Cessna 180s in there.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:21.080 align:middle line:84%
A Cessna 180 is a
single-engine plane.

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And ironically, this
UFO came right up,

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and the right wing of Paul's
sat on top of that, the UFO,

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:34.280 align:middle line:84%
as if, Paul thought
that they were trying

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.312 align:middle line:90%
to make some kind of contact.

00:33:36.312 --> 00:33:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, the
photographer was over here,

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:45.250 align:middle line:84%
after he probably had to change
his pants, took pictures.

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:48.420 align:middle line:90%
And he took a lot of pictures.

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And so when Paul got back
to his office, he called me.

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.660 align:middle line:84%
He said, got to come over
here and see these pictures.

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:55.703 align:middle line:90%
I said, pictures of what?

00:33:55.703 --> 00:33:57.120 align:middle line:84%
He said, you just
got to come over

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.930 align:middle line:90%
here and see these pictures.

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:00.400 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And Paul had his own laboratory,
photo lab So I went over there,

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:06.940 align:middle line:84%
and I sat down,
and he showed me.

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:10.520 align:middle line:90%
He had 8-by-10s, 10-by-12s.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.582 align:middle line:90%
He had them all over his desk.

00:34:12.582 --> 00:34:13.540 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking at him.

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:15.290 align:middle line:84%
I say, where did you
get these from, Paul?

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:17.469 align:middle line:90%
He said, I took them.

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Jason, who is a
photographer, took them.

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.000 align:middle line:90%
I said, where?

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.889 align:middle line:84%
He said, over northern
Mexico, near Red River.

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:28.080 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well can
we get the negatives?

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.250 align:middle line:90%
I need to send them back.

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:30.050 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:31.560 align:middle line:90%
Paul gave me the negatives.

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:34.739 align:middle line:84%
We sent them back
to headquarters.

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:39.260 align:middle line:84%
They analyzed them, and
now we're convinced.

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:42.230 align:middle line:84%
We're convinced
that Paul Bennewitz,

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:51.320 align:middle line:84%
of Thunder Scientific, has
got into a very touchy area.

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:55.739 align:middle line:84%
Now, at this point,
the Air Force

00:34:55.739 --> 00:35:03.690 align:middle line:84%
had to admit, not to him,
of course, to themselves

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:06.240 align:middle line:84%
that Paul Bennewitz
was, in fact, in contact

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.810 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials.

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, Paul called me one
night, about midnight.

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:22.760 align:middle line:90%
The phone rings.

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:23.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm not married back then.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.270 align:middle line:84%
In those days, I didn't
have a social life.

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:30.510 align:middle line:84%
But I'm living in my
apartment, and the phone rings.

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:34.540 align:middle line:84%
I pick it up, and Paul
is very hysterical.

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:36.430 align:middle line:84%
He says, you got
to get over here.

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:38.110 align:middle line:90%
You got to get over here.

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:39.010 align:middle line:90%
Please.

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:39.920 align:middle line:90%
Please, Richard.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.420 align:middle line:84%
I said whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:42.760 align:middle line:90%
Calm down, Paul.

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:46.000 align:middle line:84%
I said, if you got an
emergency, somebody breaking in

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.800 align:middle line:84%
or something, you
need to call 911.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.630 align:middle line:90%
Call the Albuquerque Police.

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:50.950 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, no.

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:52.382 align:middle line:90%
It's what's on my computer.

00:35:52.382 --> 00:35:53.590 align:middle line:90%
You got to come and see this.

00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:55.390 align:middle line:90%
You got to come and see this.

00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:56.740 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh, OK, you know?

00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:00.400 align:middle line:84%
So I get dressed I call
another agent, Virginia,

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.420 align:middle line:90%
a female agent.

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And I say, hey,
get dressed, and we

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:06.190 align:middle line:84%
got to go out to Paul
Bennewitz's house.

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:09.270 align:middle line:90%
So I'm thinking, Paul is--

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:12.410 align:middle line:90%


00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:15.340 align:middle line:84%
he was already not--
he wasn't in very good

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:16.240 align:middle line:90%
physical condition.

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:19.450 align:middle line:90%
Paul was a chain smoker.

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:20.710 align:middle line:90%
He had high blood pressure.

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:22.630 align:middle line:90%
He had kidney problems.

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:27.730 align:middle line:84%
He drank probably five or six
quarts of Coca-Cola a day,

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:32.370 align:middle line:84%
plus probably 10 or
12 cups of coffee.

00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:33.800 align:middle line:84%
He had a lot of
medical problems.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.980 align:middle line:84%
I was afraid that
he was going to have

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:39.350 align:middle line:90%
some kind of medical episode.

00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:42.465 align:middle line:84%
So we get to his house, and
Paul, says you got to come up.

00:36:42.465 --> 00:36:44.090 align:middle line:84%
I said, whoa, whoa,
whoa, first of all,

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:47.480 align:middle line:84%
Paul, I want you to sit
down here, right here,

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.100 align:middle line:90%
and calm down.

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:50.540 align:middle line:90%
He was sweating.

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:54.050 align:middle line:84%
He was almost hysterical,
despondent in some ways.

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Virginia had been a medic in
the United States military

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:01.950 align:middle line:84%
before she came
into intelligence.

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:04.267 align:middle line:10%
And so I said, check
him out, make sure

00:37:04.267 --> 00:37:05.850 align:middle line:10%
he's not going to
have a heart attack.

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:07.500 align:middle line:90%
And so she did.

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:08.700 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:11.600 align:middle line:84%
Once he was calmed down, I
said, let's go see what you got.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.560 align:middle line:90%
He went upstairs.

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.645 align:middle line:90%
He said, look.

00:37:13.645 --> 00:37:16.180 align:middle line:90%


00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:19.135 align:middle line:10%
And this is what
was on the computer.

00:37:19.135 --> 00:37:19.935 align:middle line:90%
That picture.

00:37:19.935 --> 00:37:23.070 align:middle line:90%


00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:27.110 align:middle line:10%
I looked at that thing, and this
is a black-and-white computer.

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:29.670 align:middle line:10%
And this is the actual
picture we took.

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:34.280 align:middle line:10%
We took a picture of
the computer screen,

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.730 align:middle line:10%
because we had no
other way to connect

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:40.220 align:middle line:10%
a camera to the monitor,
like you could do today,

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:41.850 align:middle line:10%
back in those days.

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:43.230 align:middle line:10%
Well, I was flabbergasted.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:45.300 align:middle line:10%
I said, well, how
did this come about?

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:48.870 align:middle line:10%
He said, the voices
came on, talking to me.

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:51.240 align:middle line:10%
I said, well, what language
were they speaking, Paul?

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:58.190 align:middle line:10%
He said English, but it was as
if it was a mechanical English.

00:37:58.190 --> 00:38:01.970 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people who have
had abduction experiences

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:04.970 align:middle line:10%
or contactees know
what I'm talking about,

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:10.920 align:middle line:10%
a mechanically-induced sound.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:15.270 align:middle line:84%
So I was pretty excited, and
I didn't have any equipment

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:18.660 align:middle line:84%
with me to try to take
a picture at that point,

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:22.720 align:middle line:84%
but I called somebody else,
one of our ace photographers.

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.520 align:middle line:90%
Woke him up.

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:24.600 align:middle line:90%
You get out here.

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.260 align:middle line:90%
Take a picture of this.

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And then we took the
monitor back to the office,

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:35.150 align:middle line:84%
and we had a couple agents
who were experts in computers,

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:36.620 align:middle line:84%
even back in those
days, and they

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:39.830 align:middle line:84%
were trying to figure
out how did he do this?

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:45.470 align:middle line:84%
But that's our mentality,
which I can admit now,

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:46.770 align:middle line:90%
it's a big mistake.

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:50.210 align:middle line:84%
We didn't accept everything
that Paul was telling us,

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:54.590 align:middle line:84%
but this picture, I was
convinced that Paul, somehow,

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:55.640 align:middle line:90%
got this in.

00:38:55.640 --> 00:39:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, the next day,
we got his computer.

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:02.520 align:middle line:90%
Brought it back.

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.020 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't get it
off the computer.

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:06.860 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't-- there's no way
we could other than taking

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.820 align:middle line:90%
a picture of a picture.

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:12.680 align:middle line:84%
So I went back to Paul,
and I asked Paul, I said,

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:17.550 align:middle line:84%
Paul, number one,
we knew, this isn't

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:19.080 align:middle line:90%
the monitor you had before.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.610 align:middle line:90%
When did you buy this?

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:23.794 align:middle line:90%
He said, I didn't buy it.

00:39:23.794 --> 00:39:26.280 align:middle line:90%
I said, who bought it for you?

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:31.170 align:middle line:84%
He said, Allen Hynek
and Leo Sprinkle.

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:33.170 align:middle line:90%
I said, what?

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:38.411 align:middle line:84%
He said, yeah, they brought
it to my house some weeks ago.

00:39:38.411 --> 00:39:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, this changes the
dynamics of our investigation,

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:44.570 align:middle line:90%
like interference.

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:47.720 align:middle line:84%
I said, why did you
let them do that, Paul?

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:49.970 align:middle line:84%
I said, why didn't
you tell me this?

00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:50.870 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm sorry.

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:52.470 align:middle line:90%
I didn't think anything of it.

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:53.270 align:middle line:90%
They came here.

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:54.170 align:middle line:90%
We talked about it.

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:56.263 align:middle line:84%
I said, what else did
they talk to you about?

00:39:56.263 --> 00:39:57.680 align:middle line:84%
He said, well,
they were convinced

00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.790 align:middle line:84%
that I was in
contact with aliens,

00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:02.390 align:middle line:84%
and they were going to
decode the symbols that

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:05.370 align:middle line:90%
came on my computer.

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:09.660 align:middle line:84%
So this presented some problems
to us in our investigation.

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:14.790 align:middle line:84%
I actually had a conversation
with Allen Hynek,

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:17.520 align:middle line:84%
a nice, cordial
conversation with him.

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:21.900 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want him to
think or to have access

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:23.400 align:middle line:90%
to what we have already done.

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.130 align:middle line:84%
But anyways, I talked to
him, and he said, yeah,

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:27.330 align:middle line:90%
I heard about Paul.

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:32.300 align:middle line:84%
I said, wait a minute, how
did you hear about Paul?

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:35.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a
classified investigation.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:41.780 align:middle line:84%
Project Seven Lambs was
top secret, code word, SAP,

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:44.990 align:middle line:84%
special access program,
sensitive compartmented

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:47.171 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:40:47.171 --> 00:40:49.018 align:middle line:90%
Well, how did you get it?

00:40:49.018 --> 00:40:50.685 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I got
it from Bill Moore.

00:40:50.685 --> 00:40:53.520 align:middle line:90%


00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:57.720 align:middle line:84%
OK, I just mentioned a
name that some people think

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:00.150 align:middle line:90%
is a demon within ufology.

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:04.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, in actuality, Bill
Moore, as some of you know,

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:06.270 align:middle line:84%
who followed the story
was one of our sources.

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:08.290 align:middle line:90%
He was a source.

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:14.260 align:middle line:10%
Actually, we had Bill Moore
contact Paul, months and months

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:22.930 align:middle line:10%
before, just as a reporter, to
see what Paul would tell Bill.

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:26.990 align:middle line:84%
We more or less
tested Paul Bennewitz.

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately
for us, Bill Moore

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:39.040 align:middle line:84%
gave Paul information
about our investigation.

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:43.180 align:middle line:84%
When I put two and two together,
I confronted Paul, I mean,

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:44.200 align:middle line:90%
confronted Bill Moore.

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.430 align:middle line:90%
I said, Bill, what did you do?

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:48.940 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I was
just trying to see if I

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:50.890 align:middle line:90%
could get Paul to do, say--

00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:54.020 align:middle line:84%
I said, you told him
about this investigation?

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:55.570 align:middle line:90%
Well, a little bit.

00:41:55.570 --> 00:41:58.090 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK, you told Paul.

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:00.760 align:middle line:90%
What about Hynek and Sprinkle.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, I told
them a little bit, too.

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, that kind of ceased
some of our cooperation

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:16.160 align:middle line:84%
with Bill Moore, and you
know what happened later on.

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:22.570 align:middle line:84%
These are, it's hard to see, but
these are some of the symbols

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:27.100 align:middle line:90%
that Paul got off his computer.

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:28.720 align:middle line:90%
Now they're not hieroglyphics.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:33.100 align:middle line:10%
I have an expert
person, Jonny Enoch,

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:37.120 align:middle line:10%
my very, very, very good
friend, who's, I consider,

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:38.530 align:middle line:10%
an expert in this area.

00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:40.150 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to throw
this stuff at him

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:43.930 align:middle line:10%
and see if he can translate it,
also my very good friend, Billy

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:45.430 align:middle line:10%
Carson.

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:47.470 align:middle line:10%
Congratulating him for
that award yesterday.

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:50.260 align:middle line:10%
But we've done some
checking, and we

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:54.100 align:middle line:10%
can't find anything
close to hieroglyphics,

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:57.400 align:middle line:10%
Chinese characters,
Korean characters,

00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.650 align:middle line:10%
or Japanese characters.

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:07.100 align:middle line:10%
So these are actual symbols
that came off Paul's computer.

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.560 align:middle line:10%
It's not something
that he made up

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.435 align:middle line:10%
because we had
photographed them.

00:43:11.435 --> 00:43:12.560 align:middle line:10%
We saw these things.

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:17.930 align:middle line:10%
Now in this particular
display, we copied them down.

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:19.610 align:middle line:10%
One of our agents
copied them down.

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:24.480 align:middle line:10%
But we took pictures
off of them.

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:29.630 align:middle line:10%
OK, enter the National Security
Agency, Project Jaggered Spear.

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:32.690 align:middle line:10%
This is a project that they did.

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:36.080 align:middle line:10%
This is the information
that came out

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:43.050 align:middle line:10%
three years ago, about three
years ago, 2018 or '19.

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:44.400 align:middle line:10%
This is what they did.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.980 align:middle line:10%
This is what National
Security Agency did.

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:49.230 align:middle line:10%
This isn't what Rick Doty did.

00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:52.940 align:middle line:10%
This is what the National
Security Agency did.

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:54.710 align:middle line:84%
They became involved
with Bob Bennewitz.

00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:57.440 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to know how
he collected signals, how

00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:00.160 align:middle line:90%
he was doing what he was doing.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, they thought he was
so smart that they gave him

00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:13.450 align:middle line:84%
$135,000 and a contract
to tell them or show them

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:16.480 align:middle line:84%
how he did what he did,
as far as collecting

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:21.810 align:middle line:84%
these unique signals or
frequencies from the laser.

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, back in 1984, $135,000
was a lot of money.

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:33.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't know quite the
equivalent in pounds,

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:35.980 align:middle line:90%
but it's a lot of money.

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:37.545 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot of money.

00:44:37.545 --> 00:44:40.880 align:middle line:90%


00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And what their object was
is duplicate what you did.

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:49.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, NSA people
gave him equipment,

00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:53.660 align:middle line:84%
besides just the money,
and duplicate what you did.

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:55.960 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:58.840 align:middle line:90%
Paul did.

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And not only did he
duplicate, Paul Bennewitz

00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:06.670 align:middle line:84%
got a contract to create,
in his laboratory,

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:09.580 align:middle line:90%
something to collect signals.

00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, not only was
he collecting what

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:16.350 align:middle line:84%
we were generating at the
laser complex, Starlight laser

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:19.920 align:middle line:84%
complex, but Paul
developed a way, a method,

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.110 align:middle line:84%
to collect signals
that were coming

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:25.140 align:middle line:90%
in from space that were unique.

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:27.460 align:middle line:84%
They were unique
frequency signals.

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:28.510 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not a scientist.

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:30.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a frequency
expert, so I can't

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:33.090 align:middle line:90%
go into great details on that.

00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:39.960 align:middle line:84%
But they're signals
that are mimicking

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:41.380 align:middle line:90%
what we have in space.

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:46.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Paul Bennewitz was
in a very classified program--

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:50.080 align:middle line:84%
and we can talk about it now
because it was released--

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:53.890 align:middle line:84%
sending unique signals to
Voyager 1 and Voyager 2.

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Now Voyager 1, and Voyager
2 was launched in 1977.

00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:58.870 align:middle line:84%
During this time
period, they were,

00:45:58.870 --> 00:46:02.410 align:middle line:90%
I think, near Jupiter or Saturn.

00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And NASA, National
Space Agency, had

00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:13.230 align:middle line:84%
a unique way, a signal
that they had to shoot up

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:14.100 align:middle line:90%
and back and forth.

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, Paul developed a different
way of doing that for NSA,

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:22.470 align:middle line:84%
and it was still
highly classified.

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:27.510 align:middle line:10%
OK, our investigation
ended in 1985.

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:36.330 align:middle line:10%
And NSAs continued in 1988
because of the contract he had.

00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:40.830 align:middle line:10%
At no time during the
five-year investigation

00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:46.020 align:middle line:10%
that we had with Paul
did we ever give him

00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:52.200 align:middle line:10%
psychotropic drugs, which, story
out there that Rick Doty snuck

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:59.630 align:middle line:10%
drugs into his drinks, did we
ever illegally enter his home,

00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:04.810 align:middle line:10%
bug his phones, place
cameras in his phone,

00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:06.730 align:middle line:10%
place a pen register.

00:47:06.730 --> 00:47:10.150 align:middle line:84%
A pen register is
something intelligence use

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:13.770 align:middle line:84%
to know who you're dialing,
who you're calling.

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:16.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when this
all started, I

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:20.760 align:middle line:84%
asked Paul to sign a waiver,
a United States government

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:21.560 align:middle line:90%
waiver.

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:22.640 align:middle line:90%
He did.

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:26.790 align:middle line:84%
I asked Paul if we could
have access to his home.

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:29.670 align:middle line:84%
He gave us permission
to go into his home.

00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:31.110 align:middle line:90%
Did we go into his home?

00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but we had permission
to go into his home.

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:38.790 align:middle line:84%
Did we place clandestine
or surreptitious devices

00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:40.670 align:middle line:90%
in his house?

00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:42.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we did.

00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:43.190 align:middle line:90%
Unbeknownst to him?

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:44.180 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:49.946 align:middle line:84%
But after this was over with,
we told Paul everything.

00:47:49.946 --> 00:47:53.590 align:middle line:90%
And you know what Paul said?

00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:54.720 align:middle line:90%
I know what I did.

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:55.720 align:middle line:90%
I know what I collected.

00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:57.610 align:middle line:90%
I know it's ETs.

00:47:57.610 --> 00:48:00.490 align:middle line:84%
I know you were just trying to
protect me back in those days,

00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:03.690 align:middle line:84%
and you're not going to
change my mind about it.

00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I maintained
friendship with Paul

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:08.750 align:middle line:84%
right up to the
day he died, well,

00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:11.377 align:middle line:90%
two days before he passed away.

00:48:11.377 --> 00:48:13.210 align:middle line:84%
His wife didn't want
anything to do with me.

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And his sons didn't want
anything to do with me,

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:20.970 align:middle line:84%
but i maintained
friendship with him.

00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:24.060 align:middle line:90%


00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Paul Bennewitz wrote a
letter to President Reagan,

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:29.310 align:middle line:90%
and I know you can't see it.

00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:32.980 align:middle line:84%
It's on the internet, and
I'll tell you how to get it.

00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:37.730 align:middle line:10%
He wrote a pretty nice
letter to President Reagan.

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:40.190 align:middle line:10%
Of course, after he
wrote the letter,

00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:43.370 align:middle line:10%
there's a lot of questions
about why he wrote it

00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:47.900 align:middle line:10%
and the contents he had in
there and so forth and so on.

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:51.640 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
you got to understand

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:55.750 align:middle line:84%
is Paul Bennewitz,
not only did he

00:48:55.750 --> 00:49:00.010 align:middle line:84%
photograph a classified
drone program, which he did.

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:02.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he was doing that.

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:04.330 align:middle line:90%
He never told anybody about it.

00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:06.700 align:middle line:84%
He tapped into a highly
classified project

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:11.730 align:middle line:84%
on Kirtland Air Force Base,
that's one avenue over here

00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:15.600 align:middle line:90%
that he did, one particular box.

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:20.070 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, Paul
was in contact with ETs.

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:23.370 align:middle line:10%
I can say for a
fact now and having

00:49:23.370 --> 00:49:25.830 align:middle line:10%
spoke with a number of
people within the NSA,

00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:27.960 align:middle line:10%
they were thoroughly
convinced that Paul was

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:29.700 align:middle line:10%
able to communicate with ETs.

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:32.800 align:middle line:90%


00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.380 align:middle line:84%
We disavowed it
back in the '80s.

00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:39.370 align:middle line:84%
I did because I just didn't
think he could do it,

00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:40.630 align:middle line:90%
but he did.

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:42.340 align:middle line:90%
He had contact.

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:45.520 align:middle line:84%
That picture that I showed you,
I don't know what that is of.

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:49.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that's the
particular species of ETs.

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that's
a picture of a picture

00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:53.920 align:middle line:84%
that somehow it
got on his computer

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:55.550 align:middle line:90%
that we can't understand.

00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And I tell you what, the
National Security Agency

00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:04.360 align:middle line:84%
is the best code breakers
and the best in tapping

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:05.620 align:middle line:90%
into something like that.

00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:08.550 align:middle line:84%
If they couldn't figure
out how he did it,

00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:11.450 align:middle line:84%
I think the only answer
is the ETs put that there.

00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:15.040 align:middle line:90%


00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:19.720 align:middle line:84%
This is Manzano Storage
Area, and Paul's house

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:22.420 align:middle line:90%
was just off the perimeter.

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:24.340 align:middle line:10%
That's a map of
the storage area.

00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:32.700 align:middle line:10%
That's the actual case number
of Paul Bennewitz's case.

00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:36.360 align:middle line:10%
Now, at the end of
my investigation,

00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:40.110 align:middle line:10%
at the end of the Air Force
Office of Special Investigation

00:50:40.110 --> 00:50:48.290 align:middle line:10%
and DIA's investigation,
volumes of reports from me

00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:49.880 align:middle line:10%
and from all the
different agents

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:52.940 align:middle line:10%
that worked with me, all the
different scientists, all

00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:56.000 align:middle line:10%
the different analysts,
and believe me,

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.640 align:middle line:10%
this wasn't something
I did on my own.

00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:01.700 align:middle line:84%
As one particular
UFO researcher said,

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:03.560 align:middle line:84%
oh, you probably
made all this up.

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, right.

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:15.540 align:middle line:84%
But after all this was done, I
was on assignment in Germany.

00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:18.480 align:middle line:84%
I was called and said, you need
to get back to Washington, DC

00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:20.730 align:middle line:90%
on such and such a date.

00:51:20.730 --> 00:51:24.640 align:middle line:90%
I said, what did I do wrong?

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:27.840 align:middle line:84%
That's typical of anybody
who's been in the service

00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:29.453 align:middle line:90%
or in government services.

00:51:29.453 --> 00:51:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Why am I going
back to Washington?

00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:31.920 align:middle line:90%
What did I do?

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:33.220 align:middle line:90%
You got an assignment for me?

00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:34.387 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to tell you.

00:51:34.387 --> 00:51:35.700 align:middle line:90%
Just get back here.

00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:37.080 align:middle line:90%
So I get on a plane.

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:39.870 align:middle line:90%
I fly back to Washington, DC.

00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:43.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm met and I'm driven
out to the Pentagon.

00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:46.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm really thinking
I'm in trouble now.

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:48.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to the Pentagon.

00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So I get in the Pentagon,
and these two people meet me,

00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:55.510 align:middle line:84%
two Army, one's a
major in the Army.

00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:57.070 align:middle line:90%
One's a Lieutenant Colonel.

00:51:57.070 --> 00:51:58.630 align:middle line:84%
He said, sir, we're
going to take you

00:51:58.630 --> 00:52:02.140 align:middle line:90%
into General Vessey's office.

00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:03.310 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh, OK.

00:52:03.310 --> 00:52:06.400 align:middle line:84%
General Vessey was the
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:12.490 align:middle line:84%
of Staff of the United States
military, back in those days.

00:52:12.490 --> 00:52:16.870 align:middle line:84%
When I went in there, I went in,
and I sat in an outer office.

00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Then I went into
an inner office.

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And an aide came out
and said, General Vessey

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:24.702 align:middle line:84%
wants you to come in and
sit down in the chair,

00:52:24.702 --> 00:52:26.410 align:middle line:84%
and he's going to ask
you some questions.

00:52:26.410 --> 00:52:28.910 align:middle line:84%
I said, wow, it would
have been nice to know

00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:30.660 align:middle line:84%
what he's going to ask
me, because I still

00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:31.973 align:middle line:90%
didn't know what I did.

00:52:31.973 --> 00:52:33.390 align:middle line:10%
He said, oh, he's
going to ask you

00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:36.190 align:middle line:10%
questions about some
investigations you did.

00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:38.850 align:middle line:10%
And he said, believe
me, General Vessey

00:52:38.850 --> 00:52:40.170 align:middle line:10%
is cleared for everything.

00:52:40.170 --> 00:52:42.040 align:middle line:10%
So I say, no problem.

00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:43.650 align:middle line:90%
So I go in.

00:52:43.650 --> 00:52:46.620 align:middle line:84%
He introduces himself, which,
of course, I already knew him.

00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:52.530 align:middle line:10%
I sat down, and the first thing
asked me about was Seven Lambs.

00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:54.360 align:middle line:10%
So I told him the story.

00:52:54.360 --> 00:53:00.060 align:middle line:10%
He said, you were recommended
for not only a step increase

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:03.360 align:middle line:10%
but also a medal, the
intelligence medal.

00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:09.540 align:middle line:10%
And this is me, receiving
the secret award

00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:11.970 align:middle line:10%
because it was secret
because I couldn't keep it,

00:53:11.970 --> 00:53:14.640 align:middle line:10%
from General Vessey, who was
the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:16.450 align:middle line:10%
of Staff at that time.

00:53:16.450 --> 00:53:24.950 align:middle line:10%
So what I did during my time
investigating Paul Bennewitz

00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:27.260 align:middle line:10%
was all sanctioned
by the government.

00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:31.550 align:middle line:84%
I learned a lot of things,
including a citizen,

00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:36.640 align:middle line:84%
a private citizen can
make contact with ETs.

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:39.100 align:middle line:84%
During my time
investigating it, there

00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:42.280 align:middle line:84%
was always a doubt
in my mind, but this

00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:47.030 align:middle line:84%
proved that Paul Bennewitz
was able to have contact

00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:49.100 align:middle line:90%
with an extraterrestrial race.

00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:51.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, I wish, I
mean, there's a lot

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:55.580 align:middle line:84%
of things I wished
for during this.

00:53:55.580 --> 00:54:00.000 align:middle line:90%


00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Afterthoughts, everybody
has these afterthoughts.

00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Because, of course,
hindsight's 20/20 right?

00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:08.310 align:middle line:10%
I thought, well, I should have
done this, this, this and this.

00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And what I really
was sorry for is

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.460 align:middle line:84%
that I wish these ETs
that he had contact with,

00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:20.400 align:middle line:84%
and he had contact almost
daily with this particular race

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:24.410 align:middle line:84%
of ETs, I wish they
could have cured him.

00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:29.150 align:middle line:84%
Because the world is
not the same place

00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:30.275 align:middle line:90%
without Paul Bennewitz.

00:54:30.275 --> 00:54:36.890 align:middle line:84%
He was a fantastic human
being, a benevolent person,

00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:43.070 align:middle line:84%
very patriotic, loving
father, a loving husband,

00:54:43.070 --> 00:54:47.210 align:middle line:84%
and he was dedicated
to these things.

00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And another thing I
regret is we should have,

00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:54.950 align:middle line:84%
we, US Intelligence,
not NSA, should

00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:58.040 align:middle line:84%
have spent more time
in collecting what

00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:02.400 align:middle line:90%
he had the ability to obtain.

00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine what we would
have learned from these ETs

00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:12.230 align:middle line:84%
if we were able to collect
what Paul was given?

00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Now Paul, of course, he was
somewhat irresponsible for not

00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:18.950 align:middle line:90%
doing what he was doing.

00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:20.570 align:middle line:90%
I mean, collecting data.

00:55:20.570 --> 00:55:22.705 align:middle line:84%
But in those days,
there wasn't any way.

00:55:22.705 --> 00:55:24.080 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't keep--
we didn't have

00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:28.610 align:middle line:84%
a thumb drive or a USB
port to collect things

00:55:28.610 --> 00:55:32.750 align:middle line:84%
on or take a picture or do
a screenshot on a computer.

00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:33.920 align:middle line:90%
We still couldn't figure--

00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:36.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that
they've ever figured out

00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:39.890 align:middle line:84%
how to get that image
off that computer.

00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:42.790 align:middle line:10%
And believe it or not,
you can believe it

00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:46.770 align:middle line:10%
or not, all that
information that Paul

00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:50.550 align:middle line:10%
gave us is in Washington, DC.

00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:53.140 align:middle line:10%
All of it's still there.

00:55:53.140 --> 00:56:00.420 align:middle line:10%
So closing, in
conclusion, of course,

00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:03.390 align:middle line:10%
that's my email if you want
to copy it down and send

00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:06.250 align:middle line:10%
questions.

00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:08.470 align:middle line:10%
I've written a book.

00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:10.120 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people out
here know I did.

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:13.660 align:middle line:10%
I submitted a manuscript
to intelligence,

00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:17.680 align:middle line:10%
and they said, oh, you
got a 642-page book.

00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:21.300 align:middle line:84%
They took out 300
and some pages of it.

00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:23.920 align:middle line:84%
It didn't make any sense to
publish what I couldn't write.

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:26.200 align:middle line:90%
So I hired an attorney.

00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:28.150 align:middle line:90%
Spent money to get it appealed.

00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:32.830 align:middle line:84%
I got appealed, and they
gave me 129 pages back,

00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:38.550 align:middle line:84%
but out of those 129 pages, a
lot of the stuff was redacted.

00:56:38.550 --> 00:56:41.160 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to publish it.

00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:43.248 align:middle line:84%
So it will probably be
out here later this year.

00:56:43.248 --> 00:56:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And then on the
other hand, I'm going

00:56:44.790 --> 00:56:49.234 align:middle line:84%
to write a fictional
account of this.

00:56:49.234 --> 00:56:50.680 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:57.910 align:middle line:90%


00:56:57.910 --> 00:57:00.610 align:middle line:90%
They can't block that.

00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much for
being a good audience

00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:03.940 align:middle line:90%
and good listeners.

00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:04.840 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:08.140 align:middle line:90%


00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:10.290 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:57:10.290 --> 00:57:13.000 align:middle line:90%
