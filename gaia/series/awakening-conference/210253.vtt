00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.856 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.362 align:middle line:90%
>> Good morning.

00:00:15.362 --> 00:00:16.320 align:middle line:90%
How's everyone feeling?

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.240 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.360 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate you all
being here this early.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.520 align:middle line:84%
When you get up this
early in the morning,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.080 align:middle line:90%
you get your coffee cup out.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.320 align:middle line:90%
You say, make it a Blackpool.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.120 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.833 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:30.250 align:middle line:90%


00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.350 align:middle line:84%
But today, we have a
very interesting subject

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.770 align:middle line:84%
to discuss with all of
you, The Gods of Babylon

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.770 align:middle line:90%
and the Return of Ningishzida.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're all probably
thinking, well, who's that?

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.210 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get
into that today.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.190 align:middle line:84%
But I always enjoy
coming here to the UK.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.990 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And especially when I
come out here to Zohar

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.520 align:middle line:84%
and I work with them, Steve
Mera's always so friendly.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Just as they show attention
to detail with all of you here

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.610 align:middle line:84%
at this wonderful conference,
he knows that I always loved

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.820 align:middle line:84%
the cheese and onion sandwiches
from Marks & Spencer's.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.580 align:middle line:84%
So [LAUGHS] there's
always a fridge

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.200 align:middle line:90%
filled with those sandwiches.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.510 align:middle line:84%
So when they were first
announcing this conference,

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.330 align:middle line:84%
he said, Jonny, if you
come, I'm going to give you

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.590 align:middle line:90%
a cheese and onion sandwich.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Steve, what
do you think I'm worth?

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.870 align:middle line:90%
I said, come on, man.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.190 align:middle line:90%
I said, make it a meal deal.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Throw in a pack of
crisps and a Lucozade

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.060 align:middle line:90%
and you've got yourself a deal.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.150 align:middle line:90%
It's a true story.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.820 align:middle line:90%
But anyhow, I'm Jonny Enoch.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.890 align:middle line:84%
I've got this
funny-sounding name.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And no, there's no relation
to the guy in the Bible.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.410 align:middle line:84%
But I have been trying to call
the publishers for some sort

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.470 align:middle line:84%
of kickbacks and rights
into straight 25 CE,

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.080 align:middle line:84%
and they're not picking up
the phone, so it's not good.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.350 align:middle line:84%
But I got interested
in this subject much

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.950 align:middle line:84%
like all of you that are
sitting in these seats or those

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.450 align:middle line:84%
watching at home on the
other side of the screen.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.420 align:middle line:84%
When I was at a
very young age, I

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.490 align:middle line:84%
was having these
incredible experiences

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.880 align:middle line:84%
that maybe some of you can
relate to where sometimes I'd

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.350 align:middle line:84%
be floating above my bed,
looking down at myself.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And at other times,
I'd be thrust up

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.360 align:middle line:84%
to these multicolored,
hollow fractal energies

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.460 align:middle line:84%
in the universe looking
down at the Earth,

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.770 align:middle line:90%
and I was trying to get answers.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's
something that you've

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.710 align:middle line:90%
had happen to you before.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And when you start
asking questions,

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.267 align:middle line:84%
no one seems to know
what really is going on.

00:02:23.267 --> 00:02:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And you try to get
answers everywhere,

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.650 align:middle line:84%
but you have to go
out on your own.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.810 align:middle line:90%
And it's a lifelong passion.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a lifelong quest
to look at these things.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.230 align:middle line:84%
But we have to go deeper if we
want to look at the mysteries.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.470 align:middle line:84%
When we go back to Allen
Ginsberg, the poet,

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.340 align:middle line:84%
he said, "angelheaded
hipsters burning

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.350 align:middle line:84%
for the ancient
heavenly connection

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.400 align:middle line:84%
to the starry dynamo in the
machinery of the night."

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we look up at the
night sky, what do we wonder?

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.680 align:middle line:90%
We wonder where we come from.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.120 align:middle line:10%
Each one of you here, you all
have a piece of the puzzle.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.980 align:middle line:10%
You all wonder about
where you come from.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.050 align:middle line:90%
You all have an amnesia.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.020 align:middle line:84%
But we can solve these
mysteries together.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.070 align:middle line:84%
Point in fact, when we
wonder about the universe,

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.280 align:middle line:84%
the macrocosm of the universe
is under your nose right now.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.770 align:middle line:84%
You are the center
of the universe.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.380 align:middle line:90%
You existed before all of this.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.890 align:middle line:10%
And we start to learn when
looking at these mysteries

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.710 align:middle line:10%
that our whole universe
is a digestive system.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.880 align:middle line:84%
It works on causal
mechanics or a peristasis.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.120 align:middle line:90%
And what does that mean?

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.870 align:middle line:84%
That means that there's all
sorts of oscillating thoughts

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and that your reality is
happening through you and not

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.800 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
the most magnificent

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.420 align:middle line:90%
of secrets you begin to learn.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.170 align:middle line:10%
In fact, now when we
look at our universe,

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.545 align:middle line:10%
our scientists
are saying there's

00:03:42.545 --> 00:03:46.730 align:middle line:10%
more than 40,000 alien
civilizations in our galaxy

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:47.530 align:middle line:10%
that they believe.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.980 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's a very
interesting number.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.313 align:middle line:10%
That's what the diary of
astrophysics is starting to say

00:03:51.313 --> 00:03:52.980 align:middle line:10%
and starting to publish.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.540 align:middle line:10%
It gets us wondering,
all the incredible stuff

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.510 align:middle line:10%
that Steve Mera's talking about,
all these UAPs, Luis Elizondos.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.530 align:middle line:10%
Everybody's scratching
their head, saying,

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.200 align:middle line:10%
what are we looking at when
we look up at the night sky?

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.330 align:middle line:10%
But this idea of space and where
we're going, you might say it's

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.720 align:middle line:10%
a great part of our destiny.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.540 align:middle line:10%
What a really incredible
thing to think about,

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.630 align:middle line:10%
that there are more
planets in our galaxy

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.530 align:middle line:10%
than there are grains of sand
on all of our beaches on Earth.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.820 align:middle line:10%
And if you go 10,000 light
years in any direction away

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.410 align:middle line:10%
from here, you know what?

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.950 align:middle line:10%
You're going to find over
20 million solar systems

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.200 align:middle line:10%
capable of harboring life.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a rather astounding
thought, isn't it?

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're located in
the back area, the outback.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.505 align:middle line:84%
We're kind of like the
Blackpool of the universe.

00:04:44.505 --> 00:04:47.740 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.820 align:middle line:10%
We're out in the middle
of nowhere, really.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:51.840 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of neat.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Many people-- few people are
aware of the stuff that's

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.740 align:middle line:90%
kicking around our universe.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.828 align:middle line:90%
It's very strange.

00:04:57.828 --> 00:04:59.370 align:middle line:84%
What if I were to
tell you that there

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.370 align:middle line:84%
was a crashed craft on Mercury
that you didn't know about?

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Ruins all over our
moons, solar systems,

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.330 align:middle line:84%
25-foot whale-like
creatures swimming

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.045 align:middle line:84%
on the outside of the
watery surface of Europa.

00:05:13.045 --> 00:05:15.170 align:middle line:84%
What if I were to tell you
that we have settlements

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.940 align:middle line:90%
in our asteroid belts?

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.488 align:middle line:84%
Here's another
strange one for you.

00:05:18.488 --> 00:05:20.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't want you to
think about this,

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.290 align:middle line:84%
what I'm going to tell
you today, because it's

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.940 align:middle line:90%
going to sound very strange.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.060 align:middle line:84%
What if I were to tell you
right now that there are folks

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.420 align:middle line:84%
on this planet,
very wealthy folks,

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.420 align:middle line:84%
that have food on their dinner
table that's not grown here?

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.330 align:middle line:84%
What if I were to tell you that
there's private contracting

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.190 align:middle line:84%
companies that
Elon Musk only has

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.940 align:middle line:84%
a peripheral understanding of
that are mining out in space

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.165 align:middle line:84%
as well as agricultural
experiments with food that

00:05:44.165 --> 00:05:46.290 align:middle line:84%
tastes a hell of a lot
better than the stuff that's

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.810 align:middle line:84%
grown here, and that
it's brought to Earth

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.480 align:middle line:90%
in certain cargo places?

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Have any of you ever
heard of Diego Garcia?

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.760 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.930 align:middle line:84%
This is in the Indian Ocean,
right outside of Mauritius.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.060 align:middle line:84%
What if I were to tell
you that maybe there's

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.670 align:middle line:84%
these caisson stones
sort of areas that

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.310 align:middle line:84%
form an underwater tunnel
system and transportation

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.530 align:middle line:84%
system leading off
into Australia where

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.163 align:middle line:84%
the cargo from up
there goes outwards?

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And there's other
places like that

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.350 align:middle line:84%
in the Atlantic, other places
like that in the Pacific.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.470 align:middle line:10%
And that's not
even the end of it.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.384 align:middle line:10%
It's much further and
stranger and deeper than that.

00:06:22.384 --> 00:06:24.320 align:middle line:10%
So when we look
at the Earth here,

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.888 align:middle line:10%
all the good stuff starts
about 10 light years from here.

00:06:26.888 --> 00:06:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you start going out
about five, 10 light years--

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.370 align:middle line:84%
let's say Alpha Centauri,
let's say Sirius--

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.680 align:middle line:84%
and we go even
further than that, you

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.760 align:middle line:84%
go 50 to 100 light
years away from there,

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.200 align:middle line:90%
it starts to get pretty busy.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And then you go 1,000
light years out of here,

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.460 align:middle line:90%
it's extremely busy.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.920 align:middle line:10%
It's extraordinarily developed.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.900 align:middle line:10%
And this is according
to some of my sources

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.830 align:middle line:10%
in the unacknowledged or
special access programs.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.150 align:middle line:10%
They're absolutely
sure of it, that we're

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.950 align:middle line:10%
involved in these things.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.050 align:middle line:84%
But you know, when
we think about all

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.680 align:middle line:84%
these ancient visitors, we
start to wonder about places,

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.970 align:middle line:84%
about who's been in here and
who's been here in our past.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:07.160 align:middle line:10%
This is me overly
enthusiastically

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.190 align:middle line:10%
standing in front of the
Assyrian reliefs of those men

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.500 align:middle line:10%
with bags at the British Museum.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.830 align:middle line:10%
And we get to wondering when
we look at these ancient kings,

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.090 align:middle line:10%
who was helping them?

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Where were they
interfacing with?

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.270 align:middle line:84%
But before we can
ask that question,

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.108 align:middle line:84%
we have to look at the
kings in our modern time.

00:07:24.108 --> 00:07:25.410 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:26.410 align:middle line:90%


00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Didn't think I was going
to take it there, did you?

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.300 align:middle line:90%
This is the King of Rock.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.040 align:middle line:90%
This is Elvis Presley.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to do an
Elvis impersonation because I'll

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:37.970 align:middle line:90%
leave that to George Noory.

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.370 align:middle line:84%
He's an incredible Elvis
singer if you've ever

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:41.390 align:middle line:90%
been to his shows.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.720 align:middle line:84%
That man loves
singing Elvis songs.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.560 align:middle line:84%
So many of you
may not know this,

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.650 align:middle line:84%
but when Elvis
Presley was growing up

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.380 align:middle line:84%
he had this blue light
coming over his house.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.820 align:middle line:90%
He had a stillborn brother.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.800 align:middle line:84%
He had these beams
of light showing up.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, Vernon, his dad,
and others had witnessed this.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And all through his life
he was absolutely obsessed

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:00.890 align:middle line:90%
with the color blue.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.840 align:middle line:10%
He even said prayers
with the blue light,

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.010 align:middle line:10%
may it come over him.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.260 align:middle line:84%
This caused a lifelong
obsession with this.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.735 align:middle line:84%
He wrote over 15 songs
of blue in the title.

00:08:08.735 --> 00:08:11.263 align:middle line:84%
"Blue Suede Shoes," "Blue
Moon," "Indescribable Blue."

00:08:11.263 --> 00:08:12.680 align:middle line:84%
(ELVIS VOICE) Thank
you very much.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:12.995 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:08:12.995 --> 00:08:13.895 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:13.895 --> 00:08:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And 1950s-- in the 1950s he
had an incredible encounter

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.640 align:middle line:84%
of a giant mothership
in the sky,

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.670 align:middle line:84%
and it completely caused
this absolute fascination

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:23.940 align:middle line:90%
with these things.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Another interesting thing about
him is that everywhere he went,

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.550 align:middle line:90%
he was trying to contact ETs.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.890 align:middle line:84%
He carried around all
kinds of esoteric books,

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.130 align:middle line:84%
his spiritual advisory lined
up outside of the Philosophical

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Research Society in
Los Feliz, California,

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.380 align:middle line:84%
to try and meet Manly P. Hall
to get an autographed copy

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:40.180 align:middle line:90%
of his book.

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.120 align:middle line:84%
He was fascinated
with this stuff.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.793 align:middle line:10%
He was always talking
about Ezekiel's encounter.

00:08:44.793 --> 00:08:46.460 align:middle line:10%
And you know what
book he carried around

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.100 align:middle line:10%
with him the most that you can
find in Graceland to this day

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.660 align:middle line:10%
if you visit it?

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:54.200 align:middle line:84%
"Chariots of the Gods"
with Erich von Daniken.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.210 align:middle line:84%
Mr. von Daniken and
I were having a talk

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:58.220 align:middle line:90%
about this the other night.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
that Mr. von Daniken, who

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:04.110 align:middle line:84%
we're so fortunate to have
with us-- over 70 million books

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:04.910 align:middle line:90%
sold.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:08.270 align:middle line:84%
My god, this man is a legend,
the most successful nonfiction

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:09.260 align:middle line:90%
author of all time.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Over 3,000 lectures in 25
countries and we have him here?

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:14.900 align:middle line:90%
Incredible.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.480 align:middle line:10%
And he started us talking
about all these things.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.190 align:middle line:10%
But tonight, I want to pay--

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.260 align:middle line:10%
or today, not tonight--
well, tonight also--

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.730 align:middle line:10%
but I want to pay tribute to
my dear friend, Jordan Maxwell.

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:27.570 align:middle line:90%
I know Jordan's with us.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.260 align:middle line:84%
I know he's listening, so I want
to say, Jordan, we love you.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.030 align:middle line:90%
Jordan, we miss you.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Jordan is the godfather of
all of this, this genre,

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.740 align:middle line:84%
for over 60 years talking
about secret societies,

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.350 align:middle line:90%
hidden symbolism, etymology.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And one of the last great
projects he worked on

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:45.410 align:middle line:90%
was on Gaia.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:47.780 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to find
out about these things,

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.070 align:middle line:90%
you can go on there.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.860 align:middle line:10%
But Jordan over the years
became a great friend

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.920 align:middle line:10%
of mine, a great
teacher, a great mentor.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.220 align:middle line:10%
I learned a lot from him.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.710 align:middle line:10%
That's us standing in front
of the Philosophical Research

00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:59.510 align:middle line:10%
Society.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't have to wait
as long as Elvis Presley

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:02.690 align:middle line:90%
to get in there.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:06.660 align:middle line:10%
But Jordan and I, we
talked about many things

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.670 align:middle line:10%
on all the road trips
and places we went on,

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.800 align:middle line:10%
to all the fascinating
people he knew.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.145 align:middle line:84%
He knew movie producers and
rap stars and rock stars

00:10:15.145 --> 00:10:17.520 align:middle line:84%
who would sit at his bed and
try to take notes on things.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And we learned-- we talked
about many of these folks.

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And some of the interesting
conversations we had

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.470 align:middle line:84%
was about George Lucas
and Michael Eisner.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:29.610 align:middle line:84%
How many of you know that
George Lucas was almost

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:33.030 align:middle line:84%
stopped and prevented from
releasing "Star Wars?"

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.880 align:middle line:84%
How many of you know that
Michael Eisner, the President

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.650 align:middle line:84%
of Disney, and George
Lucas were involved

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:40.200 align:middle line:84%
in very interesting
conversations

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.960 align:middle line:84%
about disseminating
information to all of you

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.990 align:middle line:84%
about these subjects in
a very careful way that

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.480 align:middle line:84%
wasn't going to be too
shocking or overwhelming?

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And these subjects were
taken very seriously.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.330 align:middle line:84%
But another interesting
fact was a famous movie

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:55.860 align:middle line:90%
made by George Lucas.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.942 align:middle line:84%
Have any of you ever
seen this movie?

00:10:57.942 --> 00:10:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I know some of us, when
we go to these remote areas,

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:05.010 align:middle line:84%
we get that music playing
in the back of our heads.

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:06.970 align:middle line:84%
We feel like we're
Indiana Jones.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.095 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING "INDIANA JONES"
THEME) Dun, dun, dun, dun.

00:11:09.095 --> 00:11:10.090 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, how many of you know
that Indiana Jones was

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.330 align:middle line:90%
based on a real character?

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.790 align:middle line:10%
This man doesn't get
enough publicity.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.370 align:middle line:10%
And after today, I want you
all to go home and look him

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:24.860 align:middle line:10%
up and find out everything
you can about him.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.670 align:middle line:10%
Incredible.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:28.390 align:middle line:10%
This is George Hunt Williamson.

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:30.330 align:middle line:10%
This man is a legend.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.490 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you, not only
was he an anthropologist.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.790 align:middle line:84%
He was a professor at
the Colorado University,

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.410 align:middle line:90%
which it wasn't far from Gaia.

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And he went on these
adventures, into temples,

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.300 align:middle line:84%
into the jungles doing
all these amazing things.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that, he was
the real life Indiana Jones.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:46.950 align:middle line:90%
He was also an esotericist.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:47.790 align:middle line:90%
He was an alchemist.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.790 align:middle line:84%
He went by the name
Doreal, and that's

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.400 align:middle line:84%
when-- he was one of the
first to translate the Emerald

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.610 align:middle line:84%
Tablets into English,
which is very interesting.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:59.520 align:middle line:84%
But on top of that, he
was an ET contactee,

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.940 align:middle line:84%
a profound ET contactee that was
talking about the 12 planets--

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Marduk, ETs-- long
before anyone else.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And are any of you familiar
with who George Adamski is?

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.470 align:middle line:84%
All the hardcore ufologists
are raising their hands.

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Two hands over
there in the front.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Adamski, when you go
back into the '50s,

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:18.100 align:middle line:84%
he had these
amazing experiences.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.890 align:middle line:84%
How many of you know that it
was George Hunt Williamson that

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:22.660 align:middle line:84%
introduced him to
Orthon in the desert?

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And one year prior, he was
getting ET communications

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:26.860 align:middle line:90%
on a radio.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.330 align:middle line:90%
Pretty amazing stuff.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.550 align:middle line:84%
He was also guiding his
work in secret places

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:34.180 align:middle line:84%
of the lion like the Sphinx
and the other tongues of flesh.

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's interesting when
we talk about these Emerald

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.020 align:middle line:84%
Tablets and what they
mean to the mysteries.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.410 align:middle line:90%
Here's my friend Billy Carson.

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:43.910 align:middle line:90%
You guys saw him last night.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:45.110 align:middle line:90%
He wrote this great book.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:47.610 align:middle line:84%
You guys should all run out and
get it if you don't have it,

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:49.452 align:middle line:84%
the "Compendium of
the Emerald Tablets."

00:12:49.452 --> 00:12:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And in there, there's
all kinds of great wisdom

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:52.610 align:middle line:90%
you can look at.

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:55.790 align:middle line:84%
In there, you can learn about
the fact that all of you

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:58.100 align:middle line:90%
are coming from this one mind.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.440 align:middle line:84%
You're coming from the
mind of the universe,

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.300 align:middle line:90%
just as we were talking about.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.920 align:middle line:90%
That's how it happens.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:09.950 align:middle line:84%
But in there, there is a very
interesting piece of wisdom.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:14.090 align:middle line:84%
It says, "I, Thoth,
the Atlantean"

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:16.760 align:middle line:90%
who's this fellow over here.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.410 align:middle line:90%
We'll get into him in a bit.

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:23.030 align:middle line:10%
"I, Thoth, the Atlantean,
I built the Great Pyramid."

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.170 align:middle line:10%
No one else.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:27.320 align:middle line:10%
Not those schmucks on the
side over in the back.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.610 align:middle line:10%
Not those guys.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:32.360 align:middle line:84%
I built it, he said, as he
held out his great tablets

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.760 align:middle line:90%
of wisdom, designing this.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And he encoded into it all the
great mysteries of the Earth

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:39.360 align:middle line:90%
and everything else around it.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.970 align:middle line:84%
But what a lot of
people don't know,

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:44.480 align:middle line:84%
that the Emerald Tablets are
also a great alchemical text,

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.988 align:middle line:84%
and many were fascinated about
them, even the likes of Sir

00:13:46.988 --> 00:13:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Isaac Newton and others and
what they tried to look at,

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:49.940 align:middle line:90%
the ideas.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.310 align:middle line:84%
That in there, you talk about
ascending and descending

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:53.580 align:middle line:90%
to heaven.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.870 align:middle line:84%
That's the condensation and
distillation of alchemy.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:00.470 align:middle line:84%
You have in there the ideas
of the mother and the father,

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:02.450 align:middle line:84%
the sun and the moon,
the gold and the silver.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:04.370 align:middle line:84%
All these things are
the keys to alchemy.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And this has been written about
and lectured about by a dear

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:09.950 align:middle line:84%
friend, Timothy
Hogan, who's not only

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:12.110 align:middle line:84%
the grand master of
the Knights Templars,

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.300 align:middle line:84%
he's a Masonic and
alchemical author.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And he's demonstrated all these
principles in a laboratory.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.490 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Emerald
Tablets-- don't

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:21.190 align:middle line:90%
get caught up in that name.

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:22.190 align:middle line:90%
Don't even look at that.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.930 align:middle line:84%
What that is, that's
part of the process.

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.920 align:middle line:84%
This is really the Book of
Thoth, the Book of Hermes.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.090 align:middle line:10%
This is part of the process.

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:31.010 align:middle line:10%
You get these little
emerald-like pieces,

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:32.180 align:middle line:10%
and they're called
the green line.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.180 align:middle line:10%
You have the green line.

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:34.850 align:middle line:10%
You have the red line.

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:37.610 align:middle line:10%
You know, Barry
Fitzgerald and Steve Mera

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.550 align:middle line:10%
has some very interesting
alchemical work

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:42.470 align:middle line:10%
that they're doing right
now over in Ireland.

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:45.290 align:middle line:10%
They're looking at
some ancient secrets.

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:48.770 align:middle line:10%
But if Thoth built the
Great Pyramid as we believe

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:50.618 align:middle line:10%
and the Emerald
Tablet, if he truly

00:14:50.618 --> 00:14:52.160 align:middle line:10%
was the one that
built it, why are we

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.800 align:middle line:10%
told that it's a pyramid
built by Khufu or Cheops,

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:59.380 align:middle line:10%
a 25-year-old king that couldn't
even tie his own shoelaces?

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.150 align:middle line:10%
Well, who is Khufu?

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.350 align:middle line:90%
Who is Cheops?

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.870 align:middle line:84%
In the Fourth Dynasty, we're
told that he was desperately

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.880 align:middle line:84%
looking for the Book
of Thoth himself,

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.800 align:middle line:84%
because if you looked
upon the Book of Thoth

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.560 align:middle line:84%
you were said to
have magical powers.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.310 align:middle line:84%
But he was also looking
for it to find out

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:14.960 align:middle line:84%
the secrets of how the
pyramids were built.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.940 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of
funny, isn't it?

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:18.910 align:middle line:84%
But in there, we
learned about something

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:20.650 align:middle line:84%
I like to call the
Khufu deception.

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:22.010 align:middle line:90%
Where did that come from?

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was a time
when there was these--

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:30.460 align:middle line:84%
I want to say gunpowder
archaeologists that

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:31.720 align:middle line:90%
were visiting Egypt.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.400 align:middle line:84%
We've got the likes of
Auguste Mariette in 1850.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.400 align:middle line:84%
Went to the Sarapeum,
blew a hole in this thing.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.000 align:middle line:84%
You've got this lovely fellow
over here, Colonel Vyse.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, he comes with
the British, 1836.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And there's a fellow over there,
Giovanni Battista Caviglia,

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.240 align:middle line:90%
and he's doing some work.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Has taken about a
couple of years.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And this fine fellow
over here, he says,

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.225 align:middle line:84%
let's get this guy
out of the way.

00:15:55.225 --> 00:15:56.222 align:middle line:90%
I want to take charge.

00:15:56.222 --> 00:15:58.180 align:middle line:84%
He comes in there and he
starts running things,

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.013 align:middle line:84%
and after a while he's
not finding anything.

00:16:00.013 --> 00:16:01.150 align:middle line:90%
Of course, he's not.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:04.420 align:middle line:84%
He's probably having a few
shaky whiskeys every night

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.610 align:middle line:90%
and sleeping in.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.675 align:middle line:90%
And he decides, you know what?

00:16:08.675 --> 00:16:10.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go back
to what I do best.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.140 align:middle line:90%
He was a forger.

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.840 align:middle line:84%
He did forgeries all the time,
and he takes this red ocher

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:14.640 align:middle line:90%
paint.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you heard the brilliant
Maria Wheatley yesterday

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.550 align:middle line:90%
talking about red ocher.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a clay
that you look--

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.690 align:middle line:84%
and red ocher paint, the
best thing about it is you

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:23.650 align:middle line:90%
can't carbon date it.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:24.640 align:middle line:90%
You can't trace it.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:25.603 align:middle line:90%
So he does this.

00:16:25.603 --> 00:16:26.770 align:middle line:90%
And they even make mistakes.

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:28.157 align:middle line:90%
They misspell Khufu's name.

00:16:28.157 --> 00:16:30.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about you, but
I don't misspell my own name

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.860 align:middle line:84%
unless I'm signing it in that
dark corner with a Sharpie

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:33.890 align:middle line:90%
that runs out.

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:34.690 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:38.005 align:middle line:10%
But this guy, he
comes in there and he

00:16:38.005 --> 00:16:39.130 align:middle line:10%
puts this name on the wall.

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:39.640 align:middle line:90%
He goes, oh!

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.440 align:middle line:90%
Look at me.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm important.

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:42.640 align:middle line:90%
Give me more money.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Look what I found,
this name up there.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:48.070 align:middle line:84%
It must belong to Khufu,
the 25-year-old king that

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:48.925 align:middle line:90%
built this thing.

00:16:48.925 --> 00:16:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's kind of
interesting because when

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.290 align:middle line:84%
you look at the Great Pyramid,
it's absolutely magnificent

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:54.700 align:middle line:90%
if you visit it in person.

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.610 align:middle line:84%
If you want to see it in person,
I'll give you a shameless plug.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:01.330 align:middle line:84%
You can join me, Mohamed
Ibrahim, and Nassim Haramein

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.190 align:middle line:84%
this October for the
Resonance Academy.

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:04.750 align:middle line:84%
Come out there and
see it with us.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:06.940 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
the Great Pyramid, two

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.250 align:middle line:90%
and a half million stones.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Granite, sandstone,
and limestone.

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:14.200 align:middle line:84%
It was built like
a Faraday cage.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, could it have
been a water pump system?

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:18.369 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Could it have been a power
plant like the great Chris

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Dunn says in his Giza
power plant hypothesis?

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:25.900 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.400 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever thought
about the fact

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.120 align:middle line:84%
that it's a polynomial
tetrahedral structure that

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.860 align:middle line:84%
can be turned into
a sphere using

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.380 align:middle line:90%
transdimensional mathematics?

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:36.490 align:middle line:90%
It's magnificent.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:37.900 align:middle line:90%
An incredible edifice.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a sermon in the stone
that if you look upon it

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.168 align:middle line:84%
you're mesmerized,
especially when you go in it.

00:17:44.168 --> 00:17:46.210 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that it came
from the Fourth Dynasty

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:47.210 align:middle line:90%
is really quite amusing.

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Here's Zuzana over here, and
we're at the Nubian Museum.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:53.530 align:middle line:10%
And she's pointing out this
interesting pre-dynastic art

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:56.590 align:middle line:10%
where we see these
pyramids on it.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:58.720 align:middle line:10%
But Egyptologists
say, oh, I'm sorry.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.800 align:middle line:10%
Those are mountains.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.600 align:middle line:10%
Lots of mountains on the
Giza Plateau, aren't there?

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.510 align:middle line:10%
And they're very
clearly showing it.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:05.950 align:middle line:10%
This is an interesting piece.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:07.300 align:middle line:10%
It's at the Cairo Museum.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.740 align:middle line:10%
Have any of you ever
been to the Cairo Museum?

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:10.540 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.082 align:middle line:84%
We have quite a few
people over here.

00:18:12.082 --> 00:18:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, they keep telling us the
big new gem museum is coming,

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.950 align:middle line:84%
but I guess if they have a
few more grand opening parades

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:19.810 align:middle line:84%
one of these days, it
might actually open.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.780 align:middle line:10%
But over here we have
more of this art,

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle line:10%
but you see what's interesting
next to the builders

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.360 align:middle line:10%
of the Great Pyramid?

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.930 align:middle line:10%
I'm not saying it was
aliens, but where's Giorgio?

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.563 align:middle line:90%
Might be aliens.

00:18:33.563 --> 00:18:35.230 align:middle line:84%
But here's an interesting
story for you.

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:38.200 align:middle line:84%
This again is our
friend Timothy Hogan.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.080 align:middle line:84%
I was just there with
Jay from Project Unity.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:45.310 align:middle line:84%
We were just out with my
friend, Timothy Hogan.

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And if you've ever been
up in King's Chamber,

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:50.440 align:middle line:84%
you'll notice that once you
move up the ground gallery

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.523 align:middle line:84%
and you go into the back
there's a fan in the wall

00:18:52.523 --> 00:18:54.010 align:middle line:84%
that they've blocked
up that hole.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And if you were
to remove the fan,

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.100 align:middle line:90%
you'd see something interesting.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Rudolf Gantenbrink in 1993
goes up into the Great Pyramid.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And when he goes there,
he brings with him

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:04.570 align:middle line:84%
a very interesting robot
with a camera inside of it.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:06.182 align:middle line:84%
They move up into
the Great Pyramid,

00:19:06.182 --> 00:19:08.140 align:middle line:84%
up into the north side
of the chamber above it,

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.170 align:middle line:90%
and what do they see?

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:13.270 align:middle line:84%
They see a mysterious
writing on the floor in red.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:14.950 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:18.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you something
very interesting about this.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.950 align:middle line:84%
The writing that
you see on the top

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:24.771 align:middle line:84%
left, it resembles
nothing that we know.

00:19:24.771 --> 00:19:27.580 align:middle line:84%
All of the top Egyptologists and
experts come out and they say,

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:28.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.488 align:middle line:84%
We have no
hieroglyphics like this.

00:19:30.488 --> 00:19:32.280 align:middle line:84%
They bring my friend
Timothy Hogan in who's

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.470 align:middle line:84%
an expert on ancient
languages and mysteries.

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:35.590 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't decode it.

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:36.660 align:middle line:90%
He was at the meetings.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.400 align:middle line:84%
The meetings were
so controversial

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.120 align:middle line:84%
that the antiquities
at the time said,

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.390 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to even
touch this because it

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:45.600 align:middle line:84%
says that a civilization
older than the Egyptians may

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.010 align:middle line:90%
have built this thing.

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:48.060 align:middle line:90%
He was at this meeting.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Gantenbrink walks
away from this.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.660 align:middle line:84%
He's like, this is way too
controversial for my career.

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.035 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting the
hell out of here.

00:19:53.035 --> 00:19:54.627 align:middle line:84%
The Egypt's
antiquities, they say,

00:19:54.627 --> 00:19:56.460 align:middle line:84%
well, we'd better make
a press release quick

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.752 align:middle line:84%
saying these are probably
numbers they put on the floor

00:19:58.752 --> 00:20:00.570 align:middle line:90%
for the building of this thing.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:05.550 align:middle line:84%
Could this be what
the ancients used

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:09.810 align:middle line:84%
as their hieroglyphic
languages like the Solex-Mal

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:14.160 align:middle line:84%
the antediluvian
pre-cataclysmic languages?

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.320 align:middle line:90%
Could this be the Senzar?

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Or could this be similar
to the ancient Chinese

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:23.490 align:middle line:84%
or the ancient Hungarian that we
find connected to the Denisovan

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:24.870 align:middle line:90%
people?

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:26.370 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you a
little hint today.

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Could the Great
Pyramid, the part

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:30.750 align:middle line:84%
that you see today,
the top part have

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.250 align:middle line:90%
been built at a later time?

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:34.110 align:middle line:90%
The Sphinx is far older than it.

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:36.750 align:middle line:84%
The casing stones in the
basin were there already.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And everything that
you find under there

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:40.982 align:middle line:90%
is greatly classified.

00:20:40.982 --> 00:20:43.440 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of stuff that's
been found under there that's

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.840 align:middle line:84%
classified, all kinds of
moon temples and structures

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.940 align:middle line:84%
underneath the
entire Giza Plateau.

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:52.200 align:middle line:84%
You're just seeing the
outer epidural layers.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.150 align:middle line:90%
But who were the gods of Egypt?

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:56.550 align:middle line:84%
If we're going to talk
about this cheeky fellow

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:58.980 align:middle line:84%
over here building the
pyramids, who were they?

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, Plutarch, he says
the gods of ancient Egypt

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:04.470 align:middle line:84%
were the antediluvian or
pre-cataclysmic kings who

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:07.710 align:middle line:84%
were deified or made
into gods after death.

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:11.290 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like if one of us
did something really important.

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:13.628 align:middle line:10%
But these gods, they
go back a long way,

00:21:13.628 --> 00:21:15.420 align:middle line:10%
and we've got all kinds
of different ideas.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.370 align:middle line:10%
People have all sorts of
different theories about them,

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:18.270 align:middle line:10%
don't they?

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:22.140 align:middle line:84%
We talk about the
Anunnaki, those

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:24.640 align:middle line:84%
who came from Heaven
to Earth, people say.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Some will look at
this and say, hey,

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.610 align:middle line:84%
this is one of these kings
showing them about agriculture.

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's a plow he's
holding in his hands.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Others will say these are
extraterrestrial visitors

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:36.360 align:middle line:84%
teaching these fine folks about
all kinds of ancient things

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.160 align:middle line:90%
in the Sumerian world.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:43.710 align:middle line:10%
We have a planetary system
with 10 to 12 pieces there.

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:45.720 align:middle line:10%
You say, well, we count
the moon and the sun.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.012 align:middle line:10%
We have all kinds of different
ways of looking at this.

00:21:48.012 --> 00:21:50.840 align:middle line:10%
And this fellow over here,
do you guys know who this is?

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.220 align:middle line:10%
Zecharia Sitchin.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.200 align:middle line:84%
I want to pay tribute
to him today as well.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.050 align:middle line:90%
What a wonderful man he was.

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And today, there's all kinds
of armchair critics at home

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.850 align:middle line:84%
that like to criticize
him and say, well, I

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:02.790 align:middle line:90%
know better than him.

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.223 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to dismiss
what he says.

00:22:05.223 --> 00:22:06.390 align:middle line:90%
Well, he was quite a figure.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:08.640 align:middle line:84%
He's a really interesting
guy, really all self-taught.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.200 align:middle line:84%
He went to the
British Museum a lot

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.690 align:middle line:84%
and he pondered
over these things.

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:15.650 align:middle line:84%
But he also knew Jordan Maxwell
quite a lot with these theories

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:16.450 align:middle line:90%
that he had.

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:18.840 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to
play this clip for you

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:22.290 align:middle line:84%
to show you something that he
had said to Jordan Maxwell.

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:24.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Thank you, and I do very
much appreciate your time.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:31.500 align:middle line:10%
>> It's always a pleasure to
be interviewed by someone who

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.020 align:middle line:10%
knows almost as much as I do.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.400 align:middle line:10%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.010 align:middle line:10%
>> I leave a little for myself.

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:39.870 align:middle line:10%
>> You are a giant.

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>> It's almost a pleasure to
be interviewed by someone who

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:44.520 align:middle line:90%
knows just as much as I do.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.220 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't know
this, that Zecharia and Jordan

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:49.410 align:middle line:84%
were business partners of
the True Secret company.

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:52.470 align:middle line:84%
It was the first to
publish his works.

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:54.575 align:middle line:84%
And point in fact,
he talked about a lot

00:22:54.575 --> 00:22:56.700 align:middle line:84%
of the incredible knowledge
that we got from places

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.860 align:middle line:90%
like the Epic of Gilgamesh.

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Not only is it a story
about immortality,

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:02.830 align:middle line:84%
but we have the
creation story in there.

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:04.600 align:middle line:84%
We have all sorts
of ancient texts

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.170 align:middle line:84%
that've been buried in
very interesting places.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:09.900 align:middle line:84%
But you get this story
also in your Bible.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.690 align:middle line:84%
When you open up the Bible,
you look in Genesis 1:2,

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:15.350 align:middle line:84%
we have this interesting
part of the Bible.

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:17.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if any of
you are familiar with it.

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:21.180 align:middle line:84%
But it says that the Earth
was created or formed

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.190 align:middle line:90%
from tohu wa-bohu.

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Another way of saying it is
(ACCENTED SPEECH) tohu wa-bohu.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And a load of people like to
say in the biblical academic

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.720 align:middle line:84%
scholarly field that
are into hermeneutics,

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.900 align:middle line:84%
they say, well, this means
it was void and without form.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:34.900 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing there.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:35.910 align:middle line:90%
It was created.

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, point in fact, if you
talk to any rabbis or people

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.290 align:middle line:84%
with this sort of study,
it doesn't say that.

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:43.860 align:middle line:84%
It says the Earth
was being recreated.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't say there was
a god, a singular god there.

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:47.940 align:middle line:90%
It says there was the Elohim.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And the Elohim is a
plurality of beings

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:53.100 align:middle line:84%
that we were created in
their image, it says.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And you've all
heard this before.

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:57.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that there's a lot of
shows back there on the wall

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.310 align:middle line:84%
that have taught
this in the past.

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:02.580 align:middle line:10%
But point in fact, if you
open up the Bullinger study

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.890 align:middle line:10%
Bible that was put out
there by Dr. Bullinger

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:07.110 align:middle line:10%
the companion Bible-- and
I urge you to have that

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:09.580 align:middle line:10%
on your bookshelf if you're
interested in these subjects--

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:13.260 align:middle line:10%
he references Jeremiah
4:23, because this is great.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:15.760 align:middle line:84%
You could see another place in
the Bible where this is used.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.060 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at the
context of tohu wa-bohu

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.680 align:middle line:90%
and see how it's used.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.200 align:middle line:84%
In Jeremiah if you
flip open your Bible,

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.370 align:middle line:90%
you see there's Jeremiah.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:26.070 align:middle line:84%
Nice guy minding his own
business, much like all of you

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:27.390 align:middle line:90%
trying to enjoy your morning.

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:29.813 align:middle line:84%
And he's just pulled up
over on top of the Earth,

00:24:29.813 --> 00:24:31.230 align:middle line:84%
and he's looking
down at it and he

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:34.320 align:middle line:84%
says, that doesn't look too
good down there, does it?

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:37.290 align:middle line:84%
He sees Zion, the
cities on Earth,

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:40.830 align:middle line:84%
and it says they
weren't built by man.

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.750 align:middle line:90%
Well, who built them?

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:43.920 align:middle line:90%
The gods.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And it says these cities
became tohu wa-bohu, waste

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:48.780 align:middle line:90%
and desolation.

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.880 align:middle line:90%
They were destroyed.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'd ask you first
of all, that doesn't sound

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.080 align:middle line:90%
like there was nothing there.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, who the hell took
them up there above the Earth

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.233 align:middle line:90%
to look down at these things?

00:25:01.233 --> 00:25:02.400 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's very interesting.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.050 align:middle line:84%
We get a lot of
interesting clues.

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:07.380 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people when they
talk about Zecharia Sitchin,

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:08.670 align:middle line:90%
they'll criticize him.

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:12.540 align:middle line:10%
And they'll say, Zecharia
Sitchin, you know, this guy,

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:16.920 align:middle line:10%
he was using the cuneiform, and
modern dictionaries came out

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.780 align:middle line:10%
after he had passed away.

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And after he had passed
away, the dictionaries

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:23.220 align:middle line:84%
had a much broader use for
the words of the cuneiform.

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:26.617 align:middle line:84%
But he was using a much
earlier form of cuneiform, OK?

00:25:26.617 --> 00:25:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And the much earlier
form of cuneiform

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.320 align:middle line:84%
is kind of like if
we take old English

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.320 align:middle line:84%
and compare it to the
English we're using today,

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.160 align:middle line:84%
but an even more dramatic
effect than that.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.150 align:middle line:10%
If there's one criticism that
people could make of Sitchin,

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:40.440 align:middle line:10%
I think he got his dates
off, his years off.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.590 align:middle line:84%
I think you could add 20,000,
30,000 years onto his dates.

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:46.350 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, his story was
that the Anunnaki were coming

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:48.570 align:middle line:90%
here about 500,000 years ago.

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:51.990 align:middle line:84%
That's not to say that we
haven't had many, many groups

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:54.810 align:middle line:84%
here, many groups before
that, groups that were here

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:59.013 align:middle line:84%
600 million years prior, 70,000
years ago, all sorts of things.

00:25:59.013 --> 00:26:00.930 align:middle line:84%
But you know what's
interesting about Sitchin?

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Here's something
Jordan Maxwell told me

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.640 align:middle line:84%
I could share with all of
you after he passed away.

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.850 align:middle line:90%
>> I know you knew Sitchin well.

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:12.840 align:middle line:10%
Do you think that between
what you gathered from Sitchin

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.510 align:middle line:10%
and what you think
yourself in your spirit,

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:19.530 align:middle line:10%
do you think these Anunnaki
were reptile people

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:22.730 align:middle line:10%
or were they humanoid like us?

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:23.530 align:middle line:10%
>> You know what?

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:24.340 align:middle line:10%
I'm not sure.

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:26.710 align:middle line:10%
And I wish I would have asked--

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:28.210 align:middle line:10%
I wish I would have asked that.

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:31.750 align:middle line:10%
I didn't stop to ask that
kind of a question of him.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:36.340 align:middle line:10%
I know-- I know that he was
on a one-on-one relationship

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:37.570 align:middle line:10%
with them.

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:38.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, for sure.

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:38.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, no.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:39.880 align:middle line:10%
I know that for sure.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:40.930 align:middle line:10%
He told me he was.

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:41.800 align:middle line:10%
>> It's amazing.

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.910 align:middle line:10%
>> He talked with them
one-to-one, face-to-face.

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:48.790 align:middle line:10%
But that's another thing.

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:53.770 align:middle line:10%
You know, I could
cause quite a stir

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:57.220 align:middle line:10%
in the community
around the world

00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:00.280 align:middle line:10%
if I went and started talking
about the people I know

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.500 align:middle line:10%
and what they've
told me and private.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.345 align:middle line:10%
>> Holy smokes.

00:27:04.345 --> 00:27:08.170 align:middle line:10%
>> That would start a big fire.

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:13.300 align:middle line:10%
I'll go on-- if I go on a radio,
on my own network radio show

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:16.390 align:middle line:10%
and talk about Zecharia
Sitchin and what

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:21.190 align:middle line:10%
he said to me in private
that nobody knows,

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:22.680 align:middle line:10%
you're going to
see how quick that

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.720 align:middle line:10%
gets around the world, boy.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.010 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's the thing.

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:26.940 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the thing--

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>> So as you can see, a couple
parts had to be bleeped out

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.640 align:middle line:90%
there for Gaia.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:37.340 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at people
like Sitchin or many of you,

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:38.900 align:middle line:90%
you get help.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.100 align:middle line:90%
You get a lot of help.

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:41.930 align:middle line:90%
Sitchin should was a contactee.

00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:43.280 align:middle line:90%
People don't know that.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.080 align:middle line:84%
I've had it confirmed from
folks that were close to him,

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.500 align:middle line:84%
including Jordan that the
Anunnaki stepped into the room

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.200 align:middle line:84%
with him and were talking
to him, these beings we

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.010 align:middle line:90%
call the Anunnaki.

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:53.718 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they went
by a different name.

00:27:53.718 --> 00:27:55.450 align:middle line:90%
This is what we call them.

00:27:55.450 --> 00:28:00.160 align:middle line:84%
But here's Paul Tice who was
Jordan's personal videographer.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.410 align:middle line:90%
He was his cameraman.

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:03.910 align:middle line:84%
He was helping
publish his works.

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And he and I have talked
about Sitchin a lot.

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And he said independently,
it's not a surprise

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.870 align:middle line:84%
that Sitchin was talking
about the Anunnaki

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:13.240 align:middle line:84%
because guys were talking
about it in the 1800s.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.580 align:middle line:10%
Christian O'Brien, the
great author independent

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:18.580 align:middle line:10%
of Sitchin as an academic
said the same things as him.

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:20.740 align:middle line:10%
So the general
thesis is correct.

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:21.970 align:middle line:10%
We did have visitors.

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:25.300 align:middle line:10%
These were the folks that we're
talking about in the Bible that

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:26.710 align:middle line:10%
were coming at different times.

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:28.780 align:middle line:84%
These were the folks on
this planet that were

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:30.400 align:middle line:90%
looking at us, the human race.

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And the story that we get
is that they came here

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:36.670 align:middle line:84%
from their planet with
Nibiru and all the stuff that

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:40.160 align:middle line:84%
went on because, well, some will
say they were looking for gold.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:40.960 align:middle line:90%
They were mining.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.335 align:middle line:84%
That's why they
were coming here.

00:28:42.335 --> 00:28:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And they would be
in orbit with us.

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And we have this very
interesting story

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:49.240 align:middle line:90%
in these star maps.

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:52.840 align:middle line:10%
In fact, we get an idea in
these creation stories that

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:56.320 align:middle line:10%
our planets just as Immanuel
Velikovsky says in "Worlds

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:59.990 align:middle line:10%
in Collisions" kind of had a
bit of a pool table situation,

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:02.770 align:middle line:10%
different mash-ups.
And what if one time--

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:06.100 align:middle line:10%
at one time Mars was in our
orbit that would smash into us?

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:09.410 align:middle line:10%
Could that be why it's
called the god of war?

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:12.190 align:middle line:10%
We have this very interesting
story that comes out of this.

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:14.350 align:middle line:10%
To the Hungarians,
they have the taltos

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:17.030 align:middle line:10%
of the shamans that have
this map here that you see.

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:20.170 align:middle line:10%
And this is a map that they
have of a migration from Mars

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:22.510 align:middle line:10%
to here from where
the giants came here.

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:27.640 align:middle line:10%
That's an interesting thing to
say, the giants that came here.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:31.153 align:middle line:10%
But you know, when we talk
about these different folks that

00:29:31.153 --> 00:29:33.070 align:middle line:10%
have been coming here
and all the authors that

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:34.540 align:middle line:10%
have covered this
over the years,

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:36.860 align:middle line:10%
so many people have
touched down on this.

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:39.520 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Bob Brown
over there, he's

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.578 align:middle line:84%
the godfather of
UFO conferences.

00:29:41.578 --> 00:29:43.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if any
of you know that,

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.550 align:middle line:84%
the biggest UFO conferences
in the United States

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:46.810 align:middle line:90%
for so many years.

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:50.510 align:middle line:84%
UFO Congress, UFO Megacon,
packing the seats just

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:51.310 align:middle line:90%
like all of you.

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:53.470 align:middle line:84%
He's brought a big
collection of DVDs

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:54.940 align:middle line:90%
talking about this in the back.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.553 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
so rare and filled

00:29:56.553 --> 00:29:57.970 align:middle line:84%
with this information
they're just

00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:00.290 align:middle line:84%
absolutely impossible
to get your hands on.

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:04.120 align:middle line:84%
So I'd suggest you scoop up
as many of those as you can.

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.280 align:middle line:84%
But we get lots of stories
about flying machines

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:07.600 align:middle line:90%
in the ancient world, don't we?

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:13.140 align:middle line:84%
In Ethiopia we have a story
about Solomon flying around.

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:16.640 align:middle line:84%
If you go to India where
our friend Vish is from,

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.520 align:middle line:84%
he's well familiar with the
Vedas, the Vedantic texts,

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.260 align:middle line:84%
or my friend Sid
Goldberg over there.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:22.850 align:middle line:90%
Lived there for nine years.

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:27.680 align:middle line:10%
We have these ideas with Arjuna
and the Ramayana going up

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.530 align:middle line:10%
in Chapter 5, going up
to the various heavens.

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:33.590 align:middle line:84%
You have the idea of
going into the summer

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:35.930 align:middle line:90%
Rangana Sutradara in Chapter 31.

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:40.220 align:middle line:84%
It's talking about these robotic
AI-like females, vimanas.

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Think about vimanas, shamana,
the manna that we take.

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:45.030 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:47.370 align:middle line:84%
If you go into the
Persian Zoroastrian texts

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:50.350 align:middle line:84%
where your Mazda symbol comes
from, it's very interesting.

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:54.510 align:middle line:84%
You get the Avestan literature,
fravashi or fravahr,

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:57.990 align:middle line:84%
that is the one that we see
the man in the flying disk.

00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:01.050 align:middle line:84%
We also see a connection
to this over and over again

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:03.540 align:middle line:90%
in our Sumerian depictions.

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:06.508 align:middle line:10%
It's really quite
interesting, isn't it?

00:31:06.508 --> 00:31:08.050 align:middle line:84%
You guys never
thought about the idea

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:10.150 align:middle line:84%
that Obama took a very
interesting field trip

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:11.530 align:middle line:90%
with his friends up to Mumbai?

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:13.810 align:middle line:84%
They all stopped in
Afghanistan around 2012.

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:15.162 align:middle line:90%
You ever hear about that?

00:31:15.162 --> 00:31:16.870 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't that be
interesting if they were

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:19.810 align:middle line:90%
looking at an ancient vimana?

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Just like the field
trip those other folks

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:24.910 align:middle line:84%
took to the Antarctica
to see those ruins that

00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:26.230 align:middle line:90%
are millions of years old.

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:29.290 align:middle line:84%
Remember hearing about
how Buzz Aldrin got sick?

00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:30.590 align:middle line:90%
That's weird.

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Take a private trip
up to Antarctica,

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:34.598 align:middle line:90%
all these famous guys.

00:31:34.598 --> 00:31:36.640 align:middle line:84%
I guess they were looking
at a couple of icebergs

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.525 align:middle line:90%
and some penguins.

00:31:37.525 --> 00:31:40.340 align:middle line:90%


00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:42.500 align:middle line:10%
We find this over and
over again, though.

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.500 align:middle line:10%
Again, Ezekiel's cylinders
within cylinders.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.690 align:middle line:10%
The Lord comes down,
these bipedal beings,

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:51.320 align:middle line:10%
and they have these thousands
of little blinking lights

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:53.450 align:middle line:10%
or eyeballs with lapis lazuli.

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:55.820 align:middle line:10%
The Lord steps out of
them and talks to Ezekiel,

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.160 align:middle line:10%
takes them in the commander
chair up to a mountain.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.500 align:middle line:10%
You've got the idea of Moses.

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:04.220 align:middle line:10%
There's a pillar in the sky
with smoke moving around.

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:07.250 align:middle line:84%
Very interesting stories again
and again, including Enoch.

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:10.070 align:middle line:84%
But in the Anunnaki star
we hear about the Igigi

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:11.300 align:middle line:90%
or the Watchers.

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.370 align:middle line:84%
300 of them, in
fact, that came here.

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:14.700 align:middle line:90%
Sitchin said they're from Mars.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:16.700 align:middle line:84%
They were the workers
that had to do the mining.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:18.350 align:middle line:10%
And these guys, they
were mining on Earth

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:19.808 align:middle line:10%
and getting involved
in things that

00:32:19.808 --> 00:32:21.440 align:middle line:10%
really weren't that important.

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.330 align:middle line:10%
Not as important as
they're made out to be.

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:25.340 align:middle line:10%
But they'd come down
here and they set up shop

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:29.000 align:middle line:10%
over in places like Puma
Punku, Tiwanaku, Bolivia, Peru,

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:29.900 align:middle line:10%
in those areas.

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.600 align:middle line:10%
Very interesting places when
you go up to those areas.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.360 align:middle line:90%
12,500 feet above sea level.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.430 align:middle line:84%
The Andes are relatively
new mountains.

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:40.160 align:middle line:84%
We might ask ourselves, how'd
they get up there so fast

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.930 align:middle line:84%
and build walls
around the place?

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:43.820 align:middle line:84%
At Lake Titicaca
we have fossilized

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.470 align:middle line:90%
seashells and seahorses.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:48.170 align:middle line:84%
That's Brien Foerster and
I over by the H Blocks.

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:50.660 align:middle line:10%
This is a subterranean
complex near there,

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:53.300 align:middle line:10%
and we see these very
strange, alien-like faces

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.310 align:middle line:10%
in different groups
that have visited here.

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:57.730 align:middle line:10%
Strange stuff up there.

00:32:57.730 --> 00:32:59.480 align:middle line:10%
But you know, when we
go to this depiction

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.880 align:middle line:10%
we find, very famously
of these folks,

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.180 align:middle line:10%
you have the man with the flying
wings and the disk above there.

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:07.070 align:middle line:10%
And there's many
interesting interpretations

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:10.070 align:middle line:10%
we have here of this.

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:12.260 align:middle line:10%
My friend Andrew Gough
has some incredible work

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:15.158 align:middle line:10%
he's done on the honeybee
and the pollinators,

00:33:15.158 --> 00:33:16.700 align:middle line:10%
that these are
symbolically-- there's

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:19.880 align:middle line:10%
many layers to this when we
turn the key of the lock.

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.910 align:middle line:10%
We find that these could
be folks that are carrying

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:24.830 align:middle line:10%
around pollen with them.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:26.003 align:middle line:10%
It could be monoatomic gold.

00:33:26.003 --> 00:33:27.170 align:middle line:10%
It could be a lot of things.

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:30.140 align:middle line:10%
But it could also be a
pinecone in their hand

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:31.640 align:middle line:10%
that they're awakening.

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:34.010 align:middle line:10%
The folks with the wings
behind symbolically,

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:37.622 align:middle line:10%
the folks from the heavens are
awakening the kings on Earth,

00:33:37.622 --> 00:33:39.830 align:middle line:10%
awakening their pineal
glands, giving them knowledge,

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:42.830 align:middle line:10%
upgrading their chromosomal
structure, looking at that is

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:44.700 align:middle line:10%
like our DNA.

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:46.700 align:middle line:10%
That's one way you could
look at this, that this

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:47.960 align:middle line:10%
was a great experiment.

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:50.280 align:middle line:10%
But in this story, what we
see that's very important,

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.760 align:middle line:10%
we had these ancient cities on
Earth before the Great Flood,

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:54.560 align:middle line:10%
we're told.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.580 align:middle line:10%
We have eight rulers.

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:56.540 align:middle line:10%
We have five cities.

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:59.960 align:middle line:10%
241,200 years, and
these were very

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:03.560 align:middle line:10%
much like immortals that held
and possessed certain keys.

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Maybe alchemical
keys, you could say.

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:08.570 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were eating
a white powder of gold.

00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:11.300 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they had all
kinds of ancient ways

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.639 align:middle line:90%
of preserving themselves.

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:15.199 align:middle line:90%
We have Eridu.

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:18.109 align:middle line:90%
We have Baba-Tibir.

00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:20.659 align:middle line:10%
We look over at Dumuzid and all
those others that were there,

00:34:20.659 --> 00:34:21.139 align:middle line:10%
Separ.

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:23.139 align:middle line:84%
We have these great,
incredible places on Earth.

00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:26.810 align:middle line:84%
Then we start getting into
this pageantry of these gods.

00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:27.860 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting stuff.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.998 align:middle line:84%
And they've gone by many names
throughout all our cultures.

00:34:30.998 --> 00:34:32.540 align:middle line:10%
You can look at all
the cultures that

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.760 align:middle line:10%
come down from
these original gods,

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.110 align:middle line:10%
whether it's in the Norse--

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:40.100 align:middle line:10%
Odin, Freya, Baldr, Thor,
Osiris, Isis, Horus,

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:42.830 align:middle line:10%
moving into all these
different pantheons.

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:45.530 align:middle line:10%
But we start off with
this story of Anu who's

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:48.500 align:middle line:10%
the ruler and the father of--

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.120 align:middle line:10%
the grandfather of
all these groups.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And he's the leader
of the Anunnaki.

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Interesting that we have a
connection to the Japanese

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:57.280 align:middle line:90%
with Anu as well.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:00.250 align:middle line:10%
We have Anu and we
bring in Inanna.

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:04.090 align:middle line:10%
And you see these two folks
being the main players,

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:08.800 align:middle line:10%
and they're very much interested
in power and dominion, all

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:12.010 align:middle line:10%
the dramas that you might
expect in a good Hollywood

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:15.190 align:middle line:10%
film of sex and action
and strange relationships

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:16.370 align:middle line:10%
and all that sort of stuff.

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:19.090 align:middle line:84%
But our main characters
that we bring into the story

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:20.530 align:middle line:90%
are Enlil and Enki.

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So Enlil, we learn about
him as a scientist.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And Enki, he's an
interesting figure.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:29.110 align:middle line:84%
He's coming to Earth
and he's exploring.

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:32.560 align:middle line:84%
He's really into
looking at the seas

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:35.380 align:middle line:84%
and going from place to
place and helping them.

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And some people might look
at this as these two streams

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:40.540 align:middle line:84%
beside him of fish
moving up this,

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.790 align:middle line:84%
that he's sort of like
a water god, isn't he?

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:45.290 align:middle line:84%
He's sort of like
Poseidon from Atlantis

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:47.020 align:middle line:84%
if you think about
him like that.

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:49.270 align:middle line:84%
You could say, could
this be why the Pope

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:52.180 align:middle line:84%
wears that meter on his head,
the miter or that fish hat?

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Could this be why you see that
connection to Dagon, Nimrod,

00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:57.940 align:middle line:90%
Oannes, all those folks?

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Some might say the two streams
of the Tigris and Euphrates

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:02.110 align:middle line:90%
River.

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:04.450 align:middle line:84%
But then we bring in a
very interesting character,

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:06.340 align:middle line:90%
Ningishzida.

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Ningishzida, he's portrayed
with two serpents.

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:11.660 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever seen that before?

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:12.460 align:middle line:90%
The two serpents.

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:14.070 align:middle line:84%
It might give you
a clue to who he is

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:17.790 align:middle line:84%
and why he's been
important to this role.

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:20.820 align:middle line:84%
But we can't leave this
story without Marduk.

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:25.100 align:middle line:10%
Now Enlil and Enki, we're told
that they're two brothers.

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:27.958 align:middle line:10%
These are two
brothers, son of Enki.

00:36:27.958 --> 00:36:29.750 align:middle line:10%
And what's the interesting
thing about this

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:32.060 align:middle line:10%
is when you look at a lot
of our founding stories,

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:35.110 align:middle line:10%
even from Rome-- have any
of you ever been to Rome?

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:36.410 align:middle line:90%
A few in the front.

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:39.125 align:middle line:84%
You ever hear about-- story
about Romulus and Remus?

00:36:39.125 --> 00:36:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever heard
about-- they have stories

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.230 align:middle line:90%
in Bolivia, the two brothers?

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:46.190 align:middle line:84%
We get that over and over
again in our ancient stories.

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:49.130 align:middle line:10%
Well, then we start bringing
in a character called Dumuzid.

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:51.980 align:middle line:10%
And the story goes
on and on, but why

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:54.170 align:middle line:10%
we're bringing in
Dumuzid is that Dumuzid's

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:56.420 align:middle line:10%
one of these gods, these
folks on Earth that

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:57.650 align:middle line:10%
came from another place.

00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:58.790 align:middle line:90%
They had longer lifespans.

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:01.310 align:middle line:84%
To us, we'd see
them as the gods.

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:04.340 align:middle line:84%
But at some point, Inanna
falls in love with Dumuzid

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:05.780 align:middle line:90%
along with all her other lovers.

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:07.250 align:middle line:90%
He's a shepherd, a good guy.

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:08.640 align:middle line:90%
Likes to mind his own business.

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.620 align:middle line:90%
Writes a few poems.

00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:10.770 align:middle line:90%
Brings a few flowers home.

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:11.570 align:middle line:90%
Nice guy.

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:12.390 align:middle line:90%
He's a romantic.

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:15.650 align:middle line:84%
But then she gets an idea that
Marduk decides to kill him.

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:17.180 align:middle line:10%
She goes, that's it.

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:18.920 align:middle line:90%
He's on my bad list.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:20.450 align:middle line:90%
Going to come after him.

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:23.870 align:middle line:10%
So Marduk in this
story, he doesn't really

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:25.040 align:middle line:10%
get a fair share of things.

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:27.320 align:middle line:90%
He gets no crack at things.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.780 align:middle line:84%
Have you guys ever heard of
the American comedian Rodney

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:31.010 align:middle line:90%
Dangerfield?

00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:32.760 align:middle line:84%
You remember what
Dangerfield always said?

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.170 align:middle line:90%
I get no respect.

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:35.550 align:middle line:90%
No respect.

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:36.840 align:middle line:90%
That's him.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.880 align:middle line:90%
He gets no respect.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.560 align:middle line:84%
There's stories
according to Sitchin

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.940 align:middle line:90%
that he's kind of pissed off.

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:43.898 align:middle line:84%
He says, everybody else
has these great cities.

00:37:43.898 --> 00:37:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Eridu, Mesopotamia, you know,
that basic form of Egypt.

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:48.870 align:middle line:84%
He goes, you guys are all
doing these exciting things,

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:51.240 align:middle line:90%
but where's my city?

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.530 align:middle line:84%
He's not even allowed
to be ruler in Nburu.

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:55.885 align:middle line:84%
He's not even allowed to rule
any of these other places,

00:37:55.885 --> 00:37:57.510 align:middle line:84%
and he's kind of
kicked out everywhere,

00:37:57.510 --> 00:38:00.030 align:middle line:84%
becoming exiled, and a
wanderer on the Earth.

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:02.580 align:middle line:84%
Said he spent some times
with the folks up on Mars

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.480 align:middle line:90%
for a while.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:08.240 align:middle line:84%
So the story goes is that he
was very jealous at the time.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at this story
as these characters fitting

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.320 align:middle line:84%
over into the
Egyptian story, you

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:18.610 align:middle line:90%
might say that Ptah is Enki.

00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:21.670 align:middle line:84%
You could also look over at
the idea that he is Amun Ra.

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:24.467 align:middle line:90%
Remember, Ra becomes Amun.

00:38:24.467 --> 00:38:25.300 align:middle line:90%
He's the hidden one.

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.425 align:middle line:84%
That's why you say amen at
the end of your prayers,

00:38:27.425 --> 00:38:29.500 align:middle line:84%
to be kept hidden,
to be kept secret.

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.710 align:middle line:84%
Amen in all three
Abrahamic religions.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, the story is that he
was kind of a little bit

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:39.070 align:middle line:84%
jealous is that Ningishzida
or Thoth had built

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:42.400 align:middle line:84%
the Great Pyramid, and that
his face was originally

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.470 align:middle line:84%
the one on the Sphinx
before it was changed.

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:46.570 align:middle line:84%
But he goes off and
he builds Babylon.

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:48.610 align:middle line:90%
Babylon is an incredible place.

00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:51.100 align:middle line:84%
We hear about this tower
of Babel, a communication

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:53.200 align:middle line:84%
tower, a place that he
sort of symbolically

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:56.370 align:middle line:90%
builds that gets destroyed.

00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:58.290 align:middle line:84%
But Babylon is a very
interesting place

00:38:58.290 --> 00:38:59.850 align:middle line:90%
when we look at it.

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:03.180 align:middle line:84%
They call it mystery
Babylon in the Bible,

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:05.610 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes it's referred
to as the horror of Babylon.

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:08.180 align:middle line:84%
It's not a very
nice name, is it?

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:11.570 align:middle line:90%
Well, Babylon is magnificent.

00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:12.860 align:middle line:90%
Over 100 gates.

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:13.880 align:middle line:90%
Eight have been found.

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:17.110 align:middle line:84%
The Ishtar Gate
is over in Berlin.

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:18.730 align:middle line:84%
You get stories in
there in the Bible.

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:20.200 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting one.

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.210 align:middle line:84%
One of the presenters
on Gaia TV-- you

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:23.500 align:middle line:90%
can look up William Henry.

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:26.570 align:middle line:84%
He likes to say on shows like
"Ancient Aliens" that Shadrach,

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:27.370 align:middle line:90%
Meschia--

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Shadrach, Meschach, and Abednego
were in a burning furnace

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:31.660 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And somehow a mysterious
visitor came in there

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:35.830 align:middle line:90%
and ushered them out.

00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:39.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, could that have
been a stargate?

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.290 align:middle line:84%
We get a story about
these Hanging Gardens

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:43.120 align:middle line:84%
that were magnificent,
one of the seven

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.610 align:middle line:90%
ancient wonders of the world.

00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:48.430 align:middle line:84%
You learn about the later rise
of Nebuchadnezzar and Alexander

00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:52.030 align:middle line:84%
the Great, the great Macedonian
conqueror falling to his demise

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:55.460 align:middle line:90%
at 33 years of age in Babylon.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:58.520 align:middle line:10%
Here's my friend,
cheeky Colin Woolford,

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:01.940 align:middle line:10%
standing in front of one of
these magnificent statues

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:04.602 align:middle line:10%
or guardians that you'd
find in front of Babylon.

00:40:04.602 --> 00:40:06.560 align:middle line:10%
And I can assure you,
he's not a time traveler.

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.390 align:middle line:10%
That is at the British Museum.

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:11.540 align:middle line:10%
That's just to show you
how immensely incredible

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:13.510 align:middle line:10%
these places were.

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:18.520 align:middle line:10%
But we have these many
faces of all of our gods.

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:21.220 align:middle line:10%
As mentioned, this character
that we see, Ningishzida,

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:23.140 align:middle line:10%
he was also going
by the name Thoth.

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:24.710 align:middle line:10%
Why does he look like this?

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:26.740 align:middle line:10%
Why do we personify
him like this

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:28.420 align:middle line:10%
with the head of an ibis bird?

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, the ibis was
a very wise bird.

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:34.630 align:middle line:84%
The ibis knew when it
was going to rain, where

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:36.010 align:middle line:90%
the worms were going to be.

00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:38.345 align:middle line:84%
It almost did sort of a
meditation with a stone

00:40:38.345 --> 00:40:39.970 align:middle line:84%
that it would place
in its mouth and it

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:43.490 align:middle line:84%
would meditate and fall asleep
until the stone fell out.

00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:45.340 align:middle line:84%
That's why we personify
him like that.

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:48.310 align:middle line:84%
He's also personified
as Djehuty, the baboon

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:49.270 align:middle line:90%
to seek wisdom.

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:51.258 align:middle line:90%
Thoth is born wise.

00:40:51.258 --> 00:40:53.050 align:middle line:84%
That's where you get
the word thought from.

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:56.680 align:middle line:84%
He also goes by the name
Hermes Mercurius Trismegistus

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.780 align:middle line:84%
with the caduceus of
the double serpent.

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:00.460 align:middle line:10%
We know him as Quetzalcoatl.

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:03.340 align:middle line:10%
We know him as Kukulkan.

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:04.510 align:middle line:10%
He goes by many names.

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:07.870 align:middle line:10%
In fact, in the story we get
that after the fallout came

00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:09.610 align:middle line:10%
with Marduk,
according to Sitchin,

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:11.590 align:middle line:10%
he was sent off
over to the Yucatan.

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:12.918 align:middle line:90%
They said, hey, you know what?

00:41:12.918 --> 00:41:13.960 align:middle line:90%
Get the hell out of here.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.370 align:middle line:90%
We're tired of these problems.

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:16.430 align:middle line:90%
Just get out of Egypt.

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:17.230 align:middle line:90%
Get out of Dodge.

00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:20.210 align:middle line:84%
You can go have South America,
all these sort of places.

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:21.010 align:middle line:90%
Have the Yucatan.

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:22.480 align:middle line:90%
Let's just call a truce.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:26.140 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of fighting and
things going on at the time.

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:29.020 align:middle line:84%
When we look over in these
places, a lot of people

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:31.255 align:middle line:84%
talk about Chichen Itza,
that it's significant.

00:41:31.255 --> 00:41:34.165 align:middle line:90%
It's like classic period.

00:41:34.165 --> 00:41:37.330 align:middle line:84%
It's really just a nice site
that tourists can go to,

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:39.340 align:middle line:84%
but there's much
more ancient versions

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:41.320 align:middle line:90%
and pre-classic places.

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:43.720 align:middle line:84%
I was just there a
couple months ago.

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.400 align:middle line:90%
And this is Ek-Balam.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.110 align:middle line:10%
Isn't it interesting
in Ek-Balam you

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:49.000 align:middle line:10%
see Egyptian riding and boats.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.210 align:middle line:10%
You see these
elongated-headed individuals

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:54.460 align:middle line:10%
that are portrayed
with wings at the top.

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:57.190 align:middle line:10%
Just 10 years ago this
place was under rocks.

00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:58.240 align:middle line:10%
They just dug it up.

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:00.510 align:middle line:10%
Pretty incredible, eh?

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:02.698 align:middle line:84%
Get a lot of interesting
stories there.

00:42:02.698 --> 00:42:04.740 align:middle line:84%
But when we think about
these places, a lot of us

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:06.210 align:middle line:84%
wonder, well, what
could be there?

00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:07.590 align:middle line:90%
Is there anything still there?

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Did they leave behind
any clues for us?

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:16.260 align:middle line:10%
Well, one night I was at home
over in Budapest, Hungary.

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:19.110 align:middle line:10%
It was last year
around December,

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:21.630 align:middle line:10%
and trying to warm up.

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:23.250 align:middle line:10%
It's a bit cold.

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:25.860 align:middle line:10%
And this guy contacts me.

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And he'd been in contact
with a couple of people

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:31.710 align:middle line:84%
from behind the scenes
like Linda Moulton Howe.

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:34.500 align:middle line:84%
He was recommended
to me by someone,

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:38.420 align:middle line:84%
and he was at a very
interesting point of his life.

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:39.860 align:middle line:90%
He was going through cancer.

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Radiation, chemotherapy
treatments, in fact.

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I have been
involved in unacknowledged

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:47.690 align:middle line:90%
and special access programs.

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And there's folks like
that you do talk to when

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:50.852 align:middle line:90%
you put yourself out there.

00:42:50.852 --> 00:42:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I want
to come forward

00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:53.768 align:middle line:84%
and I want to tell
you some things,

00:42:53.768 --> 00:42:55.810 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to get
them off my chest.

00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I tell him, you know,
I'm going to come visit you.

00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And he tells me
that he's way out

00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:05.270 align:middle line:84%
in this place near Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, which

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:09.010 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you, compared to here
even, it's not an oil painting.

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:11.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:14.500 align:middle line:90%
And so I head out there.

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.240 align:middle line:84%
That's me in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania,

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.280 align:middle line:90%
with great excitement to arrive.

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And we show up and these
two fine gentlemen--

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:23.260 align:middle line:84%
they're very nice
guys, actually--

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:24.297 align:middle line:90%
they were telling me--

00:43:24.297 --> 00:43:25.130 align:middle line:90%
they're two friends.

00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:26.530 align:middle line:84%
They've both been involved
in these programs.

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:27.530 align:middle line:90%
They want to come forth.

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:30.820 align:middle line:84%
But he's a little afraid because
he says that all of his friends

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:33.040 align:middle line:84%
have faced sort of fears
and they've even had death

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.420 align:middle line:90%
threats and everything else.

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And this gentleman over
here, he says, look,

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:39.700 align:middle line:84%
he even retrieved a
baby extraterrestrial

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:41.137 align:middle line:90%
from an underwater craft.

00:43:41.137 --> 00:43:42.970 align:middle line:84%
We're going to release
a video of this soon.

00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And he says that he took
it out of a jelly sack

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:46.150 align:middle line:90%
with his parents.

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:48.208 align:middle line:84%
The two Greys had been
eaten on the outside.

00:43:48.208 --> 00:43:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And when he brought
out the baby Grey

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:52.990 align:middle line:84%
it was transmitting into
him an emotional feeling

00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:55.180 align:middle line:84%
of being afraid of
losing its parents.

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:58.210 align:middle line:84%
He could see in his mind and
through his body the craft

00:43:58.210 --> 00:44:00.490 align:middle line:84%
crashing through our atmosphere
and down to the Earth

00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:01.660 align:middle line:90%
and what he missed.

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:05.230 align:middle line:10%
And he became emotional with
tears streaming down his face

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:07.510 align:middle line:10%
as many have talked
about these things.

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:09.910 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you suppose the
governments and departments

00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:12.590 align:middle line:10%
you've worked with are ever
going to come forward with what

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:13.390 align:middle line:10%
they know?

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:16.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, they have been for the
last year and a half releasing

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:19.630 align:middle line:10%
information that when
I was in the military,

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:23.020 align:middle line:10%
in an intel division, I
was warned if I was to ever

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:27.070 align:middle line:10%
disclose anything like that I
would go to jail for 20 years.

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:32.020 align:middle line:10%
Now, they're releasing that
right out into the public

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:38.110 align:middle line:10%
to kind of prepare the public
for something that's coming.

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>> That's interesting.

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Now these two fellows,
that's Chris on the left

00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:42.970 align:middle line:90%
who's undergoing the therapies.

00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Even that day when I went
and talked to him that week,

00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:47.050 align:middle line:84%
he was going for
radiation the next day.

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:49.330 align:middle line:10%
And isn't it interesting
that the place

00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:51.370 align:middle line:10%
that he goes for
these treatments,

00:44:51.370 --> 00:44:53.950 align:middle line:10%
that when he goes there
at the VA hospital

00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:56.860 align:middle line:10%
there's two special agents
that take the samples from him

00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:58.970 align:middle line:10%
and remove them and
get them out of there?

00:44:58.970 --> 00:45:00.050 align:middle line:90%
It's really interesting.

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:01.820 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people might
not realize this,

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:04.900 align:middle line:84%
but when you've been exposed
to extraterrestrials,

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:06.760 align:middle line:90%
your atomic structure changes.

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.417 align:middle line:90%
Your circadian rhythms change.

00:45:08.417 --> 00:45:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of folks
in the earlier days

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.040 align:middle line:84%
show up with all
kinds of problems.

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:14.260 align:middle line:84%
They can't produce
cortisol anymore.

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:16.510 align:middle line:10%
They have all sorts of
issues, and you can tell

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:17.920 align:middle line:10%
when they've had radiation.

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:19.870 align:middle line:90%
Just ask Rick Doty about this.

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:23.140 align:middle line:84%
He could tell you all
about it, right, Rick?

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:25.790 align:middle line:84%
But this guy has started telling
me something very interesting.

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:27.280 align:middle line:84%
He says, look, I've got
to tell you something

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:28.750 align:middle line:90%
that's really important to me.

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:31.490 align:middle line:10%
He says, when I was involved,
I know we went to Iraq.

00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:32.740 align:middle line:90%
You want to know what we took?

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:34.790 align:middle line:90%
He goes, I was involved.

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:36.190 align:middle line:90%
He says, well, we went to Iraq.

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:37.870 align:middle line:84%
We extracted a
stargate from there

00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:41.315 align:middle line:84%
used by the extraterrestrials
that were there.

00:45:41.315 --> 00:45:42.440 align:middle line:90%
I said, that's interesting.

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:43.720 align:middle line:90%
Tell me more.

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting because
my friend Dannion Brinkley

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.830 align:middle line:90%
who many of you may know--

00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:49.630 align:middle line:90%
he directs a show with me.

00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:51.040 align:middle line:90%
We were traveling together.

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:54.250 align:middle line:10%
He is very famous for being
a near-death experiencer,

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:56.590 align:middle line:10%
if any of you have
ever seen him.

00:45:56.590 --> 00:46:00.860 align:middle line:10%
Dannion Brinkley, he
was assigned a mission.

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:03.153 align:middle line:10%
He was assigned a
mission over in Baghdad

00:46:03.153 --> 00:46:04.570 align:middle line:10%
at the time when
he was traveling.

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:06.487 align:middle line:10%
And he even traveled
with Sitchin, by the way.

00:46:06.487 --> 00:46:07.670 align:middle line:10%
They went to Syria.

00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:10.810 align:middle line:10%
They got stuck in certain
places, certain passport

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:13.810 align:middle line:10%
issues, and very strange stuff.

00:46:13.810 --> 00:46:16.420 align:middle line:84%
The agencies, let's
just call them that,

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:18.520 align:middle line:84%
gave Dannion and a bunch
of throwaway cameras.

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:21.340 align:middle line:84%
They were very interested
in what Saddam's brother was

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:24.095 align:middle line:84%
doing at the time, going
to Sweden and Switzerland

00:46:24.095 --> 00:46:25.720 align:middle line:84%
and other sorts of
places, getting back

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.520 align:middle line:90%
things for the Baghdad Museum.

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Dannion said they gave him
several throwaway cameras

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.528 align:middle line:84%
and he went into
Baghdad on a mission

00:46:31.528 --> 00:46:33.070 align:middle line:84%
when he was already
out there and was

00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:35.195 align:middle line:84%
photographing everything
for them to bring it back.

00:46:35.195 --> 00:46:36.310 align:middle line:90%
They were scoping it out.

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, the
weapons of mass destruction

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:42.390 align:middle line:84%
they were interested in is far
different than what you think.

00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, he starts to
tell me something

00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:46.980 align:middle line:84%
interesting about the
cities of Ur and Uruk

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:49.380 align:middle line:84%
where we start to bring
the scenarios down

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:52.710 align:middle line:84%
with those folks we were talking
about called the Anunnaki.

00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:57.330 align:middle line:10%
>> It was in the city of Ur
and the tomb of Gilgamesh,

00:46:57.330 --> 00:47:01.980 align:middle line:10%
and it was a part of a machine
that his father created

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:04.890 align:middle line:10%
thousands of years ago that
allowed Gilgamesh to do

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:07.380 align:middle line:10%
interdimensional travel.

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:13.800 align:middle line:10%
I saw with my own eyes the
results of what this piece did.

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:16.590 align:middle line:10%
They brought it over
to CERN Switzerland.

00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:19.470 align:middle line:10%
They plugged it
into CERN Collider.

00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And over there, they're a lot
more freer with information

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:23.410 align:middle line:90%
than here.

00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:26.460 align:middle line:10%
So I went to their newspapers
when this was happening,

00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:29.850 align:middle line:10%
and I read front page
on their newspaper

00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:31.960 align:middle line:10%
exactly what they
were going to do.

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:35.700 align:middle line:10%
They gave the day
and the time they

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:38.670 align:middle line:10%
were going to take this part
and put it in the Collider.

00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:42.810 align:middle line:10%
And they said it had to be
at 3 o'clock in the morning,

00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:44.220 align:middle line:10%
the hour of the devil.

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:46.080 align:middle line:10%
That's what it said
in their newspaper.

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:49.530 align:middle line:10%
Now, everybody was ready for it.

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:51.900 align:middle line:10%
All the people knew
the exact day and time.

00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:53.850 align:middle line:10%
And CERN is underground.

00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:55.870 align:middle line:84%
It's like over 400
feet under the ground.

00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:59.010 align:middle line:84%
It's about 17
kilometers around, OK?

00:47:59.010 --> 00:48:03.660 align:middle line:10%
And they turned it on and
these people were all there

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:05.130 align:middle line:10%
with their cameras and all.

00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:08.370 align:middle line:10%
You could see the beam coming
from under the ground, up

00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:12.240 align:middle line:10%
into the upper atmosphere,
opening its first portal.

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:17.640 align:middle line:10%
And when you look, though,
at what was put together,

00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:20.190 align:middle line:10%
Hollywood picked up on
it best a few years ago

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:23.760 align:middle line:10%
and came out with a series
and movie, "Stargate."

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>> So can you imagine this?

00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:27.810 align:middle line:84%
These doorways that were left
on Earth that were perhaps

00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:30.540 align:middle line:84%
active at one time that we
may not understand today,

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:34.050 align:middle line:84%
but they were used for
this sort of science

00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:36.960 align:middle line:84%
to be able to go
to other places.

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.340 align:middle line:90%
This is Saddam Hussein.

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Saddam Hussein, he believed
that he was the reincarnation

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:45.600 align:middle line:90%
of King Nebuchadnezzar.

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:47.310 align:middle line:90%
He had this in his art.

00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:49.090 align:middle line:90%
He made portraits of this.

00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:50.070 align:middle line:10%
These are the bricks.

00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:54.650 align:middle line:10%
He had rebuilt Babylon into a
perfect place for the UNESCO

00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:56.400 align:middle line:10%
World Heritage sites
should have declared.

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.858 align:middle line:10%
He said, this is Saddam Hussein,
the son of Nebuchadnezzar.

00:48:58.858 --> 00:49:01.150 align:middle line:10%
These were on the bricks that
he built into this thing.

00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:02.340 align:middle line:10%
This is what it looked like.

00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:05.010 align:middle line:10%
He rebuilt this thing, the
Hanging Gardens, everything.

00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:08.670 align:middle line:10%
The word on the street
was that our friend Saddam

00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:11.760 align:middle line:10%
was getting communications
and had technology and tapped

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:13.830 align:middle line:10%
into things because under
these ancient cities

00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:14.640 align:middle line:10%
they left records.

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:15.480 align:middle line:90%
They left cuneiform.

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:17.580 align:middle line:84%
We only have a fraction
of these tablets

00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:19.200 align:middle line:84%
that they had
given us back then.

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Most of these tablets
outside of the British Museum

00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:25.110 align:middle line:84%
and other places exist
in private collections.

00:49:25.110 --> 00:49:27.810 align:middle line:84%
How many of you know that
some of these families

00:49:27.810 --> 00:49:30.230 align:middle line:84%
and folks around the world--
they're not bad people,

00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:31.980 align:middle line:84%
but they have in their
private collections

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:33.540 align:middle line:84%
some very interesting
things that

00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:35.677 align:middle line:90%
reveal parts of our stories.

00:49:35.677 --> 00:49:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Maria Wheatley and
I were just talking

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:39.750 align:middle line:84%
about this yesterday, some
folks that are coming out

00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:42.310 align:middle line:90%
with this to help everyone.

00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:44.250 align:middle line:10%
So we go to the city of Ur.

00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:47.530 align:middle line:10%
We found out something
very interesting.

00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:51.400 align:middle line:10%
What we learned is that there
was a stargate inside of here,

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:53.620 align:middle line:10%
and it had been reactivated.

00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:56.710 align:middle line:10%
And as soon as they
found out that was there,

00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:58.855 align:middle line:10%
they said, let's buy
the first ticket to Iraq

00:49:58.855 --> 00:50:00.152 align:middle line:10%
and get in there quick.

00:50:00.152 --> 00:50:01.360 align:middle line:10%
They didn't do anything else.

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.640 align:middle line:10%
They left expensive laser
cutting tools on the ground.

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.598 align:middle line:10%
They went in there and
they stormed that place.

00:50:05.598 --> 00:50:08.900 align:middle line:10%
Does this look like they're
looking for a military threat?

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:11.440 align:middle line:10%
Isn't it interesting that we
built the largest US embassy

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:14.260 align:middle line:10%
in the world on top of that,
because we didn't want people

00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:15.670 align:middle line:10%
to find what was in there?

00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:19.330 align:middle line:10%
But according to Phil, he says
that we moved it over to CERN.

00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:21.070 align:middle line:10%
Well, CERN is an
interesting thing.

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:24.730 align:middle line:10%
We can find out the fundamental
functions and actions of we

00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:26.500 align:middle line:10%
go down into
subatomic particles.

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Quarks, neutrinos, hadrons,
leptons, gluons, bosons,

00:50:30.010 --> 00:50:32.350 align:middle line:84%
all these funny-sounding
little things.

00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:34.780 align:middle line:84%
But the real purpose is
to tap into the secrets

00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:36.610 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, to
activate these things,

00:50:36.610 --> 00:50:38.050 align:middle line:90%
to find out what's happening.

00:50:38.050 --> 00:50:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is
that this stuff

00:50:40.090 --> 00:50:41.890 align:middle line:90%
is far stranger than you think.

00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:43.240 align:middle line:10%
It's far weirder than you think.

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:44.615 align:middle line:10%
According to these
two gentlemen,

00:50:44.615 --> 00:50:46.540 align:middle line:10%
all the stuff you
call paranormal,

00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:49.810 align:middle line:10%
all this kind of talk,
there's divisions

00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:52.005 align:middle line:10%
in these programs
that study this,

00:50:52.005 --> 00:50:53.380 align:middle line:10%
that have a science
of this, that

00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:55.852 align:middle line:10%
are operating in this world.

00:50:55.852 --> 00:50:57.310 align:middle line:10%
Here's a depiction
of what it looks

00:50:57.310 --> 00:50:58.935 align:middle line:10%
like, some of the
last known depictions

00:50:58.935 --> 00:51:02.290 align:middle line:10%
we had in the 1850s of
what these gates look like

00:51:02.290 --> 00:51:03.410 align:middle line:10%
and what was there.

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:05.320 align:middle line:10%
Very much like that
show "Stargate."

00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:06.472 align:middle line:10%
Even the symbols they use.

00:51:06.472 --> 00:51:07.930 align:middle line:10%
We have the symbols
from Gilgamesh.

00:51:07.930 --> 00:51:09.970 align:middle line:10%
We have other connections
to this that they're

00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:11.170 align:middle line:10%
trying to tell you.

00:51:11.170 --> 00:51:14.620 align:middle line:10%
If you look at Freemasonry
and the York Rite,

00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:17.170 align:middle line:10%
you might say that this is
another little connection.

00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:18.208 align:middle line:10%
And in Masonry--

00:51:18.208 --> 00:51:19.750 align:middle line:10%
I don't want you to
think that Masons

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:21.875 align:middle line:10%
are walking through stargates,
because they're not.

00:51:21.875 --> 00:51:24.670 align:middle line:10%
The average Mason
doesn't have maybe even

00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:27.370 align:middle line:10%
an appreciation of what they've
inherited unless you really

00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:31.300 align:middle line:10%
have a classical education
in the seven liberal arts

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:32.710 align:middle line:10%
and sciences of decoding this.

00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:35.350 align:middle line:10%
But we have something called
the Royal Arch degrees

00:51:35.350 --> 00:51:37.545 align:middle line:10%
where the ancient
Sumerian and Royal Arch--

00:51:37.545 --> 00:51:38.920 align:middle line:10%
and in there, this
is a sun gate.

00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:40.690 align:middle line:84%
This is just like the
arch you find in St.

00:51:40.690 --> 00:51:42.400 align:middle line:90%
Louis or the arch of McDonald's.

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:43.930 align:middle line:90%
It's the horizon that you find.

00:51:43.930 --> 00:51:45.340 align:middle line:90%
And what do we have here?

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:46.930 align:middle line:84%
One of these cheeky
little Anunnaki

00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:50.010 align:middle line:90%
walking through the door.

00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:52.810 align:middle line:84%
We find these false
doors all over the world.

00:51:52.810 --> 00:51:54.870 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one good example
I'll give you of this--

00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:56.495 align:middle line:84%
and I want you all
to do your homework.

00:51:56.495 --> 00:51:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Don't just say,
this Jonny Enoch guy

00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:01.170 align:middle line:84%
was walking around on a stage
talking about Marks & Spencer

00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:02.653 align:middle line:90%
sandwiches and stargates.

00:52:02.653 --> 00:52:03.570 align:middle line:90%
And what does he know?

00:52:03.570 --> 00:52:04.920 align:middle line:90%
He didn't show us any proof.

00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Go home after you're done
and look this place up.

00:52:07.350 --> 00:52:10.230 align:middle line:84%
This is in Egypt near
Abusir, Abu Gorab.

00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:12.360 align:middle line:90%
It's called Zawyet el Aryan.

00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:15.060 align:middle line:10%
In the Arabic we call that
the naked place I don't think

00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:16.770 align:middle line:10%
anyone there is naked, though.

00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:19.440 align:middle line:10%
And what you find over there,
we have these pyramids.

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:22.085 align:middle line:10%
And nearby the kings that
are involved in this,

00:52:22.085 --> 00:52:24.210 align:middle line:10%
they have the name stargate
in front of their name.

00:52:24.210 --> 00:52:25.010 align:middle line:10%
Very interesting.

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:27.270 align:middle line:10%
The pyramids near it is
called the Ba and the Ka,

00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:29.650 align:middle line:10%
which are names that you have
in the parts of the soul.

00:52:29.650 --> 00:52:32.100 align:middle line:10%
We have in there,
according to my sources,

00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:36.780 align:middle line:10%
a subterranean complex below
it the size of New York City.

00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:39.720 align:middle line:90%
This is Egypt's Area 51.

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:41.430 align:middle line:84%
You can have aircraft
coming and going

00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:42.690 align:middle line:90%
without anybody seeing it.

00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And you might be very
interested to know

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:47.070 align:middle line:84%
that the fellows in
antiquities that have

00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:49.050 align:middle line:84%
had dinner that knew
about this stuff--

00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:51.450 align:middle line:84%
and nobody can go in
it since the 1950s.

00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:53.190 align:middle line:90%
Our militaries are there.

00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:54.090 align:middle line:90%
Not their militaries.

00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:55.560 align:middle line:90%
Ours are there.

00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:56.530 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it interesting?

00:52:56.530 --> 00:52:58.387 align:middle line:84%
They said these
Aurora borealis colors

00:52:58.387 --> 00:52:59.470 align:middle line:90%
come up out of the ground.

00:52:59.470 --> 00:53:01.345 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what
the hell to do about it.

00:53:01.345 --> 00:53:05.410 align:middle line:84%
This is the last active
stargate, you might say.

00:53:05.410 --> 00:53:08.370 align:middle line:10%
What do the Egyptians
have to say about this?

00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:11.400 align:middle line:10%
All over the place we see
the depictions of stargates.

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:13.860 align:middle line:10%
You see that down there, the
mouth above the stargate?

00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:15.750 align:middle line:10%
That means you need
sound to activate it.

00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:16.590 align:middle line:10%
Look over here.

00:53:16.590 --> 00:53:17.820 align:middle line:10%
This is at Kom Ombo.

00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:20.130 align:middle line:84%
The tour guides, I have to
listen to them all the time

00:53:20.130 --> 00:53:21.720 align:middle line:90%
say, the walls have ears.

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:22.553 align:middle line:90%
The walls have ears.

00:53:22.553 --> 00:53:23.353 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:53:23.353 --> 00:53:24.780 align:middle line:10%
What about the
Gate to the Nadirs?

00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:27.880 align:middle line:10%
The gate to the gods have ears.

00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:29.670 align:middle line:10%
The cosmic.

00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:31.430 align:middle line:10%
This is where the
gods came from.

00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:32.230 align:middle line:10%
This is the door.

00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:33.840 align:middle line:10%
In fact, over here
to the left of me,

00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:35.580 align:middle line:10%
again at the British
Museum, you'll

00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:39.310 align:middle line:10%
see that we have these folks
stepping through stargates,

00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:40.110 align:middle line:10%
again and again.

00:53:40.110 --> 00:53:41.280 align:middle line:10%
Here's your ears.

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:42.960 align:middle line:10%
They need sound
to activate them.

00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:45.390 align:middle line:10%
Over here you see
them pointing up.

00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:47.220 align:middle line:10%
You see the Templar cross?

00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:48.300 align:middle line:90%
You see the stars?

00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:49.830 align:middle line:84%
You see the places
of Nibiru where

00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:52.660 align:middle line:90%
they could go through a gate?

00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:54.310 align:middle line:84%
What's really
interesting about this,

00:53:54.310 --> 00:53:56.590 align:middle line:84%
we see again and again
Hathor being used.

00:53:56.590 --> 00:53:58.900 align:middle line:84%
Hathor is associated with
sound, with a rattle,

00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:00.550 align:middle line:90%
with resonance, with vibration.

00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:01.840 align:middle line:90%
We see this opening up.

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:02.800 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Why is sound so
important to this?

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Because our universe works
like a symphonic construct.

00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:11.680 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever seen these great--

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:14.920 align:middle line:84%
all these celebrities gathered
when Adele is singing?

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:17.320 align:middle line:10%
Adele has got this beautiful
voice that they're swaying

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:20.410 align:middle line:10%
and they're mesmerized,
or the beautiful harmonies

00:54:20.410 --> 00:54:22.330 align:middle line:10%
of John Williams in
our favorite movies.

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:23.890 align:middle line:90%
We love it, don't we?

00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Maria Wheatley over there,
she was talking yesterday

00:54:27.310 --> 00:54:29.707 align:middle line:84%
about the connection to
sound vibration and the folks

00:54:29.707 --> 00:54:31.540 align:middle line:84%
that Stonehenge that
could have been hearing

00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:34.180 align:middle line:84%
these things in that brilliant
lecture that she gave that

00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:35.980 align:middle line:90%
was so important, wasn't it?

00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:38.125 align:middle line:84%
What sound did to
the water, what sound

00:54:38.125 --> 00:54:40.440 align:middle line:90%
did to all these places.

00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you look at these
great parasynthetic harmonies

00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:46.740 align:middle line:84%
and constructs, why do
cathedrals have sound?

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:48.570 align:middle line:84%
Why do the Buddhist
monks use it?

00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:50.340 align:middle line:84%
They're unlocking
these particulars

00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:52.290 align:middle line:84%
in the universe with
the chromatic scales

00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:53.130 align:middle line:90%
and the octaves.

00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's important
in our secrets to resonance.

00:54:56.730 --> 00:55:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's a photo that Jay
over here, he was behind me.

00:55:00.610 --> 00:55:04.740 align:middle line:10%
And I said, don't photograph my
ass as I'm crawling up in here,

00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:06.870 align:middle line:10%
trying to crawl
into these places.

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:10.290 align:middle line:10%
I got access to these
new areas that we are

00:55:10.290 --> 00:55:11.850 align:middle line:10%
at Hathor's temple in Dendara.

00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:13.797 align:middle line:10%
We were just there last month.

00:55:13.797 --> 00:55:15.630 align:middle line:10%
That's one of the cool
parts about this job.

00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:17.100 align:middle line:10%
You get to go to Egypt a lot.

00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:19.650 align:middle line:10%
And you get food poisoning a
couple times here and there,

00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:21.362 align:middle line:10%
but it has its benefits.

00:55:21.362 --> 00:55:23.170 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS]

00:55:23.170 --> 00:55:25.680 align:middle line:10%
But one of the secrets
you'll find here

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:27.870 align:middle line:10%
is that Hathor who represents
sound and resonance

00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:29.040 align:middle line:10%
has a gate above her.

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:29.880 align:middle line:10%
She opens it up.

00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:31.140 align:middle line:10%
Here's the Nadirs.

00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:32.702 align:middle line:10%
If you go to
Hatshepsut's temple--

00:55:32.702 --> 00:55:34.410 align:middle line:10%
I was very lucky to
go there doing COVID.

00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:36.930 align:middle line:10%
It was all shut down and
you get better access.

00:55:36.930 --> 00:55:39.510 align:middle line:84%
What's great, the sign
says, absolutely no access.

00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:40.320 align:middle line:90%
No photography.

00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.320 align:middle line:90%
You can't go in there.

00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:42.310 align:middle line:90%
Do not go in there.

00:55:42.310 --> 00:55:43.600 align:middle line:90%
Do not step into this place.

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:44.850 align:middle line:84%
The guard will not
let you in there.

00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:46.800 align:middle line:84%
For five American dollars,
when no one's looking,

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:47.700 align:middle line:90%
you can go in there.

00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:50.050 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:50.050 --> 00:55:52.000 align:middle line:10%
There's Zuzana pointing
out the stargate.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:55.240 align:middle line:10%
We have [NON-ENGLISH],,
Thutmose III on the left.

00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:56.290 align:middle line:10%
You step into the back.

00:55:56.290 --> 00:55:57.340 align:middle line:10%
It says, do not go in there.

00:55:57.340 --> 00:55:59.298 align:middle line:10%
The guy goes, (EGYPTIAN
ACCENT) secret, secret.

00:55:59.298 --> 00:56:00.430 align:middle line:10%
Don't go in there.

00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:01.750 align:middle line:10%
There's another $5.

00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:03.430 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:04.917 align:middle line:10%
In the back we see a gate.

00:56:04.917 --> 00:56:07.000 align:middle line:10%
Can you imagine the gods
walking down those stairs

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.085 align:middle line:10%
at Hatshepsut's mortuary, the
top stargates in the areas?

00:56:10.085 --> 00:56:11.710 align:middle line:10%
In the gate you see
over there, there's

00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:12.788 align:middle line:10%
a cartouche on the wall.

00:56:12.788 --> 00:56:14.830 align:middle line:10%
In the left it looks like
it's filled with stars,

00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:15.910 align:middle line:10%
or is that the gate?

00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:18.580 align:middle line:10%
On the left, we see the nadirs
walking through the door

00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:20.470 align:middle line:10%
to instruct the
people, the gods,

00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:23.050 align:middle line:10%
the folks that were visiting.

00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And again and again, we see
the mentioning of stargates.

00:56:26.170 --> 00:56:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And this gets us to
asking questions like,

00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:31.510 align:middle line:90%
is there a cosmic Atlantis?

00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Today if you ask someone about
Atlantis, what comes to mind?

00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:39.100 align:middle line:84%
Never mind the story you
get from Solon and Sonchis,

00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:42.882 align:middle line:90%
Edfu, pyramidal texts.

00:56:42.882 --> 00:56:45.340 align:middle line:84%
We can go back to the ideas
that people think that Atlantis

00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:48.170 align:middle line:90%
was behind the Atlas Mountains.

00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:51.920 align:middle line:84%
They talk about this in
a very interesting way.

00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:54.020 align:middle line:10%
Well, we could get
into that story

00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:56.120 align:middle line:10%
a long time if you wanted
to talk about Morocco

00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:57.740 align:middle line:10%
and those places
that were underwater,

00:56:57.740 --> 00:56:59.300 align:middle line:10%
moving out into the West.

00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:02.053 align:middle line:84%
We can move out into the story
of how the Rock of Gibraltar

00:57:02.053 --> 00:57:03.470 align:middle line:84%
was really the
Pillars of Hercules

00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:05.595 align:middle line:84%
and the Azores and Canary
Islands were the mountain

00:57:05.595 --> 00:57:06.470 align:middle line:90%
peaks of Atlantis.

00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:10.250 align:middle line:84%
But what if Atlantis was a
great continental diffusion

00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:12.740 align:middle line:84%
of culture, a dissemination
of these cultures

00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:14.870 align:middle line:84%
that spread across the
world with the many pyramids

00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:16.490 align:middle line:90%
you see in the various places?

00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:18.830 align:middle line:84%
140 pyramids in the
Azorean Islands,

00:57:18.830 --> 00:57:20.720 align:middle line:84%
pyramids on both
sides of the Atlantic,

00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:24.850 align:middle line:84%
pyramids in the Yucatan,
pyramids in China.

00:57:24.850 --> 00:57:27.390 align:middle line:90%
They're all over the place.

00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:29.120 align:middle line:84%
So what if these
stargates bring us

00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:31.610 align:middle line:84%
into a cosmic Atlantis,
an Atlantis that

00:57:31.610 --> 00:57:35.390 align:middle line:84%
spanned all over our solar
system and the various galaxies

00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:40.910 align:middle line:84%
and places, connecting
them like one giant web?

00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, this fellow that
we talked to here, let's

00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:45.030 align:middle line:90%
come back to him.

00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:46.530 align:middle line:90%
How you doing?

00:57:46.530 --> 00:57:50.250 align:middle line:84%
He's been busy writing, and
he's got sometimes a staff,

00:57:50.250 --> 00:57:51.780 align:middle line:90%
sometimes a measuring stick.

00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:54.720 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it was said that he
helped measure and put together

00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:57.570 align:middle line:84%
the pyramid at the same time
he was helping with our DNA,

00:57:57.570 --> 00:58:02.280 align:middle line:84%
with Enki, giving us an upgrade,
helping us and evolving us.

00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, we hear that
he's returning.

00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:07.710 align:middle line:90%
That sounds all right.

00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, he doesn't
return here when the--

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:12.000 align:middle line:90%
to the lolly shop.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.490 align:middle line:90%
He might turn around.

00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:18.060 align:middle line:84%
But with this, we've got
to look at these Anunnaki,

00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:21.113 align:middle line:84%
if they're returning,
all joking aside,

00:58:21.113 --> 00:58:22.530 align:middle line:84%
could it be that
they're returning

00:58:22.530 --> 00:58:26.490 align:middle line:84%
in another form in the
evolution of our genetics

00:58:26.490 --> 00:58:29.710 align:middle line:84%
and the evolution of
who we are through us?

00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:30.510 align:middle line:90%
We're changing.

00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:32.520 align:middle line:84%
We're coming to this
maturation point.

00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:34.290 align:middle line:90%
This is the Age of Aquarius.

00:58:34.290 --> 00:58:36.780 align:middle line:84%
We have the Anunnaki story,
the Ningishzida story

00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:38.490 align:middle line:84%
all throughout our
ancient stories

00:58:38.490 --> 00:58:40.980 align:middle line:84%
with Attis from the
Phrygians who was Adonis.

00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:43.385 align:middle line:84%
We have the story
brought into Osiris,

00:58:43.385 --> 00:58:44.760 align:middle line:84%
the resurrection
of these things,

00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:46.230 align:middle line:84%
the return of an
ancient messiah.

00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:49.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a very old
and ancient story.

00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you know this
man, Randall Carlson's

00:58:51.210 --> 00:58:52.230 align:middle line:90%
absolutely brilliant.

00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:53.880 align:middle line:10%
You find him on Gaia
and these places.

00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:57.993 align:middle line:10%
He's looking at the procession
of the equinox of the Yugas.

00:58:57.993 --> 00:59:00.160 align:middle line:10%
And what he's talking about,
he's saying, hey, look.

00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:01.580 align:middle line:10%
You remember that
time when we had

00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:04.400 align:middle line:10%
the Sphinx and the age of Leo?

00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:05.750 align:middle line:10%
Do you remember that time?

00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:07.848 align:middle line:10%
Well, in the age of
Leo, this is when

00:59:07.848 --> 00:59:09.140 align:middle line:10%
we would have seen Ningishzida.

00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:10.880 align:middle line:10%
Look on the opposite
side of that.

00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:12.960 align:middle line:10%
All kinds of strange
things happen on the Earth

00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:13.760 align:middle line:10%
when Leo is here.

00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:16.348 align:middle line:10%
According to Randall
Carlson we see these cycles

00:59:16.348 --> 00:59:17.390 align:middle line:10%
that we're going through.

00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, right directly
opposite to that we see

00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Aquarius where we are, entering
into the Age of Aquarius.

00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Strange things are
happening on this Earth,

00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:28.460 align:middle line:84%
and we're getting
help at this time.

00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:29.960 align:middle line:10%
You might say that
we're going to go

00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:33.050 align:middle line:10%
through an evolution over this
next decade with everything

00:59:33.050 --> 00:59:38.320 align:middle line:10%
that we know about our lives,
from the way that we interact

00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:42.390 align:middle line:10%
with each other to our medicines
to the way that we travel,

00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:44.140 align:middle line:10%
the way that we harmonize
with each other.

00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:46.313 align:middle line:84%
You might say that
there's folks watching us.

00:59:46.313 --> 00:59:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And in some ways,
they're waiting for us

00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:49.103 align:middle line:90%
to get over our tribalism.

00:59:49.103 --> 00:59:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's some uncomfortable
things we're going through,

00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:54.950 align:middle line:84%
growing pains in fact,
but we will make it.

00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Many have talked about
a galactic federation

00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:59.610 align:middle line:84%
on shows that were on
Gaia like "Deep Space."

00:59:59.610 --> 01:00:02.860 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
that, haven't we, Sid?

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:05.020 align:middle line:10%
Now, it's my opinion
and not of the folks

01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:07.690 align:middle line:10%
that we talk to that the idea
of a "galactic federation,"

01:00:07.690 --> 01:00:10.570 align:middle line:10%
quote, unquote, isn't as
nice and pretty as it sounds,

01:00:10.570 --> 01:00:12.958 align:middle line:10%
and those shows like the
"Star Treks" and everything

01:00:12.958 --> 01:00:15.250 align:middle line:10%
with our brilliant Gene
Roddenberry and others who have

01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:17.900 align:middle line:10%
put together these concepts.

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:20.255 align:middle line:84%
But we have a whole
bunch of different groups

01:00:20.255 --> 01:00:22.130 align:middle line:84%
that have been influencing
us and coming here

01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:23.390 align:middle line:90%
at different stages.

01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And they're all sort
of tampering with us.

01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:29.960 align:middle line:84%
There's a cross-pollination
of realities, in fact.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I really love
the show "Cosmic Disclosure"

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.040 align:middle line:90%
with these folks over here.

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Do any of you watch
"Cosmic Disclosure?"

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:41.840 align:middle line:10%
That new season that Sid
Goldberg and Rick Doty had on

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.940 align:middle line:10%
and those folks like Tim
the tactical advisor,

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.927 align:middle line:10%
I was blown away
when I saw that.

01:00:45.927 --> 01:00:47.510 align:middle line:10%
Zuzana said, you've
got to come quick.

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.930 align:middle line:90%
Watch this.

01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:49.722 align:middle line:84%
Because some of the
folks I was talking to,

01:00:49.722 --> 01:00:51.930 align:middle line:84%
they were telling me that
what these guys were saying

01:00:51.930 --> 01:00:53.555 align:middle line:84%
was very similar to
what I was hearing.

01:00:53.555 --> 01:00:55.222 align:middle line:84%
So I picked up the
phone and called Sid.

01:00:55.222 --> 01:00:57.740 align:middle line:84%
I said, this is unbelievable
because I'm hearing the things

01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:01.580 align:middle line:84%
that he was learning about from
Tim and Rick and the other guys

01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:02.570 align:middle line:90%
on the show.

01:01:02.570 --> 01:01:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And that is that when we look
at who has been interacting

01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:08.210 align:middle line:84%
with us, especially the
ones that those folks

01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:10.100 align:middle line:84%
that you guys call
the Greys, it's

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:11.870 align:middle line:84%
not as simple as
calling them Greys.

01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And the Ebens, the
extraterrestrial biological

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:17.600 align:middle line:84%
entities, are not the
same as the other folks.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.810 align:middle line:84%
You have one group that might
be 200 or 400 years ahead of all

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:22.880 align:middle line:84%
of you, and then you've
got another group that's

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.950 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of millions
of years ahead of them

01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:27.200 align:middle line:84%
that have gotten rid of
their biological selves.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.330 align:middle line:84%
They're a time
traveling species.

01:01:29.330 --> 01:01:31.430 align:middle line:84%
They're interacting
with us through a type

01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:33.650 align:middle line:90%
of quantum multiplicity.

01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:36.620 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, we can look at this
thing called lineal subjugation

01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:39.860 align:middle line:10%
assessment on how we might be
able to find folks that could

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:41.990 align:middle line:10%
come backwards and
forwards in our history,

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:45.500 align:middle line:10%
interacting with us, inserting
narratives, and changing this

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:48.230 align:middle line:10%
like a Japanese sword maker
putting one tip on top

01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:51.060 align:middle line:10%
of the other to perfect it.

01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:52.283 align:middle line:90%
Very important show.

01:01:52.283 --> 01:01:53.950 align:middle line:84%
You want to keep
paying attention to it.

01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:55.710 align:middle line:90%
But lots of folks have been--

01:01:55.710 --> 01:01:59.110 align:middle line:84%
lots of folks have been saying
amazing things like this.

01:01:59.110 --> 01:02:02.410 align:middle line:84%
So I want to leave
you with a gift.

01:02:02.410 --> 01:02:05.570 align:middle line:84%
One of the insider folks I
talked to gave me permission

01:02:05.570 --> 01:02:06.820 align:middle line:90%
to share this with all of you.

01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:08.230 align:middle line:90%
I want you to research this.

01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:10.720 align:middle line:84%
Don't just take this
as infotainment.

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Take this as something
you can research.

01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:16.450 align:middle line:84%
I want you to research
transverse sound waves

01:02:16.450 --> 01:02:21.002 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to longitudinal
sound waves, OK?

01:02:21.002 --> 01:02:23.210 align:middle line:84%
You're going to learn all
sorts of interesting things

01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:24.650 align:middle line:84%
where you're going to
go and what you're going

01:02:24.650 --> 01:02:25.910 align:middle line:90%
to find out about this decade.

01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:27.740 align:middle line:90%
It's going to blow your mind.

01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:29.210 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
have modifications

01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:30.050 align:middle line:90%
to your cell phones.

01:02:30.050 --> 01:02:32.300 align:middle line:84%
We can modify your
cell phone right now

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:35.168 align:middle line:84%
so that that phone in your
hand that you have right there,

01:02:35.168 --> 01:02:37.460 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to have to
charge it for 10,000 years.

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Go home and look up what a
nanocarbon diamond battery is,

01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:46.422 align:middle line:84%
and that's going to blow your
mind, how close we are to that.

01:02:46.422 --> 01:02:48.380 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to find
out that we have a way

01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:49.820 align:middle line:90%
to travel into space.

01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:52.220 align:middle line:84%
If we look at these sound
waves just like we were talking

01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:54.803 align:middle line:84%
about, you're going to find that
some can go faster and reveal

01:02:54.803 --> 01:02:56.840 align:middle line:84%
a type of sound wave that
can transform waveform

01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:00.430 align:middle line:90%
propagation, all right?

01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:03.400 align:middle line:84%
The future of our space
travel is going to use this.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:06.070 align:middle line:84%
We're going to use a sort
of resonance propulsion

01:03:06.070 --> 01:03:10.690 align:middle line:84%
system or harmonic oscillation
to take all of these properties

01:03:10.690 --> 01:03:11.950 align:middle line:90%
that we are talking about.

01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:15.100 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
take time, gravity,

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:18.190 align:middle line:84%
and linear proportional distance
and we're going to transpose.

01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:20.200 align:middle line:84%
Them we're going to fold
them in on ourselves

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.480 align:middle line:84%
to reconfigure them like
these messenger pigeons that

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:25.490 align:middle line:90%
went such a long way.

01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And as we look at all
of this exciting stuff

01:03:27.610 --> 01:03:29.193 align:middle line:84%
that you're going
to be going through,

01:03:29.193 --> 01:03:31.570 align:middle line:84%
we're going to use this
technology in the next 25 years

01:03:31.570 --> 01:03:34.180 align:middle line:84%
for the first of all of
you to go out in space.

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to happen a
lot quicker than you think.

01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:middle line:84%
We have some things that we
have to go through first.

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:42.110 align:middle line:84%
But I promise you that
there are folks watching us

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:43.950 align:middle line:84%
in this progress as
we go through this.

01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:45.200 align:middle line:90%
I want you to know that today.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.190 align:middle line:90%
You're not alone.

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:48.110 align:middle line:84%
None of you sitting
in these seats are.

01:03:48.110 --> 01:03:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And just like the dinosaurs
who came before us,

01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:52.640 align:middle line:84%
they wore out their
time on their planet,

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:54.230 align:middle line:84%
I want you to think
of this as sort

01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:55.760 align:middle line:84%
of a great zoological
experiment.

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:58.670 align:middle line:84%
We're sort of an ant farm
for the folks up there,

01:03:58.670 --> 01:04:00.320 align:middle line:90%
and they're waiting for us.

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.777 align:middle line:84%
We've got to go
through some things.

01:04:02.777 --> 01:04:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to all think
about this great light

01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:06.300 align:middle line:84%
that you carry as
we go through this.

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:07.717 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever seen
that experiment

01:04:07.717 --> 01:04:10.080 align:middle line:84%
that Sir Isaac Newton
did when he had the prism

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:11.742 align:middle line:90%
that the light came through it?

01:04:11.742 --> 01:04:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And when the light
came through it,

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.783 align:middle line:84%
it turned into all
the rainbow colors.

01:04:14.783 --> 01:04:15.900 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that?

01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Think of those rainbow colors
as all the manifestations

01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:21.630 align:middle line:84%
of this world that are
in that light, the light

01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:25.120 align:middle line:84%
that you carry, the
light of the mysteries.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:25.920 align:middle line:90%
All right?

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:28.410 align:middle line:84%
So to get through
this, we really

01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:30.357 align:middle line:84%
need to be more
loving to one another.

01:04:30.357 --> 01:04:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't just
some sanctimonious thing

01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:33.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm telling you.

01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:33.960 align:middle line:90%
We really do.

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.460 align:middle line:84%
We have to move
through this period.

01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:38.170 align:middle line:10%
We have to have tolerance
for one another, in fact.

01:04:38.170 --> 01:04:39.690 align:middle line:10%
We have to show kindliness.

01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:40.740 align:middle line:10%
It's very important.

01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:42.480 align:middle line:10%
You wouldn't believe the
importance when I talk

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:44.897 align:middle line:10%
to near-death experiencers
about you walk down the street,

01:04:44.897 --> 01:04:48.120 align:middle line:10%
you smile at someone, you show
them a little bit of kindness,

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.445 align:middle line:10%
you buy them a lolly
at the shop outside--

01:04:50.445 --> 01:04:53.640 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:56.193 align:middle line:10%
Have more forgiveness.

01:04:56.193 --> 01:04:58.360 align:middle line:10%
Thank you, Mick and Lindy,
for sitting through this.

01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:00.010 align:middle line:10%
Please forgive me later.

01:05:00.010 --> 01:05:03.200 align:middle line:10%
You had to listen
to all my bad jokes.

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:06.240 align:middle line:10%
We have to be more generous, but
be generous without expecting

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.260 align:middle line:10%
anything in return.

01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And most of all,
show more compassion

01:05:10.590 --> 01:05:12.990 align:middle line:84%
not only for each other,
but for all the creatures

01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:15.860 align:middle line:84%
on this planet that
are dwelling with us.

01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:17.360 align:middle line:84%
I promise you if
we do these things,

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:18.850 align:middle line:84%
it's going to make
it a lot easier.

01:05:18.850 --> 01:05:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And most of all,
attempt to do no harm.

01:05:22.090 --> 01:05:24.640 align:middle line:84%
As a very wise friend
of mine and teacher--

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:27.270 align:middle line:84%
I call him Jack
from the Outback--

01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:30.450 align:middle line:84%
he tells me that we should
attempt to do no harm.

01:05:30.450 --> 01:05:31.680 align:middle line:90%
And why is that?

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:33.810 align:middle line:84%
Because no matter
how hard we try,

01:05:33.810 --> 01:05:36.180 align:middle line:84%
we always harm ourselves
sometimes, don't we?

01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:37.890 align:middle line:90%
And it's very easy to do.

01:05:37.890 --> 01:05:40.310 align:middle line:90%
So we can only do our best.

01:05:40.310 --> 01:05:44.760 align:middle line:84%
But we should attempt
to do that at all times.

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And I promise you
if we do that, we

01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:48.890 align:middle line:90%
don't have to fear the future.

01:05:48.890 --> 01:05:51.200 align:middle line:90%
We can create it.

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And with that, I hope that we
can all go on more adventures

01:05:55.030 --> 01:05:56.860 align:middle line:84%
and solve these
mysteries together.

01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:57.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jonny Enoch.

01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:58.480 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:05:58.480 --> 01:05:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoo!

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:00.880 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.080 align:middle line:90%
