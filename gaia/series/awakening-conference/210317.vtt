>>MARIA WHEATLEY:
Well, hi, everyone.

00:00:17.052 --> 00:00:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And thanks for getting up early
to come and listen to my talk.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be talking about
a secret history of Stonehenge

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.060 align:middle line:84%
because we have been
lied to time and time

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.620 align:middle line:84%
again from the
Ministry of Works.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.530 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Ministry
of Works, which

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.070 align:middle line:84%
was the early English
heritage, really

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.950 align:middle line:84%
saw what people were
doing at Stonehenge,

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.710 align:middle line:90%
and so they defaced the stones.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to bring
back the magic

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.140 align:middle line:84%
and show you what the
archaeologists did to partly

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.900 align:middle line:90%
destroy some of the stones.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.620 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to get
going with this lecture.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.770 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to go back
in time now, back in time

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.210 align:middle line:10%
to the Neolithic.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.290 align:middle line:10%
The Neolithic is about 5
and 1/2 thousand years ago.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.570 align:middle line:10%
And they built these
wonderful monuments.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.690 align:middle line:10%
You're seeing at the moment,
West Kennet Long Barrow.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.380 align:middle line:10%
That's a megalithic long
barrow and inside of which,

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.870 align:middle line:10%
there's these chambers of stone.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.340 align:middle line:10%
And what I discovered
through dowsing,

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.270 align:middle line:10%
through spiritual dowsing,
is that these people

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.400 align:middle line:10%
had elongated skulls.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.270 align:middle line:10%
And in 2015, when I discovered
these elongated skulls,

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.070 align:middle line:10%
I didn't have the
body measurements.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.120 align:middle line:90%
Now I have.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to show you
a long lost mythical race.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there were giants
around the Stonehenge.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.310 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to show you
what I believe is the origins

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.470 align:middle line:84%
of the Tuatha DÃ© Danann
mythology of Ireland.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.960 align:middle line:84%
This is another long barrow
called Wayland's Smithy.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.640 align:middle line:10%
Wayland's Smithy is
absolutely incredible.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.800 align:middle line:10%
It's in Oxfordshire.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.500 align:middle line:10%
And it's, again, a
Neolithic monument.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.030 align:middle line:10%
But these monuments were
laid out not just on leys,

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.840 align:middle line:10%
but have an Earth current
flow down their axis line.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.150 align:middle line:10%
So right, if they're invisible,
but they're going right the way

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.950 align:middle line:10%
down.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.460 align:middle line:10%
But people see earth energy,
it's like lines on a map.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.169 align:middle line:90%
And they call them leys.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:14.430 align:middle line:84%
But research has shown,
coming out of the 1930s,

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.990 align:middle line:90%
the earth energies are colorful.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.420 align:middle line:90%
They have a dominant color.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And the dominant color
of this barrow is blue.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So it can activate
the throat chakra.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.000 align:middle line:84%
But on the Salisbury Plain,
there isn't any stone.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.410 align:middle line:84%
It was all imported from places
like Wales and Marlborough

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.370 align:middle line:84%
for the different
types of stone there.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.200 align:middle line:10%
So this is a Neolithic
wooden, earthen mound.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.930 align:middle line:10%
That's what was on
the Salisbury Plain.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.210 align:middle line:84%
The Salisbury Plain,
like I said yesterday,

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.400 align:middle line:84%
is an area about 26 miles
by 26 miles, owned and run

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.930 align:middle line:84%
by the military, with 2,500
ancient sites on there

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.280 align:middle line:84%
controlled literally by all
those military establishments.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.280 align:middle line:84%
So again, why is
that wherever you

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.970 align:middle line:84%
have ancient sites,
powerful vortex energy,

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.000 align:middle line:90%
you have a military presence?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.240 align:middle line:10%
And these are another type
of megalithic structures,

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.950 align:middle line:10%
where they're called dolmens.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.390 align:middle line:10%
And the Tinkinswood one
with the long portal slab

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.630 align:middle line:10%
stone, that had up
to 100 people in,

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.390 align:middle line:10%
all buried in different ways.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.690 align:middle line:10%
In the Neolithic, they
didn't bury the whole body.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.150 align:middle line:10%
There would only be
one whole body normally

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.440 align:middle line:10%
in all of those burials.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.450 align:middle line:10%
So they used to
de-flesh the body,

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.940 align:middle line:10%
take the femur bone
and the skulls,

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.060 align:middle line:10%
and place those in a bit
like the pirate's flag.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they
placed into the barrows.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.220 align:middle line:84%
We used to have some very
unusual ones, the guardians.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show
you a guardian,

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.600 align:middle line:84%
you sometimes get them
in a flexed position

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.050 align:middle line:84%
like this, where they tie the
body up in the fetal position.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:55.320 align:middle line:84%
This is from the bell beaker
culture, which is 2500 BC.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's very tall.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.380 align:middle line:90%
The femur bone is very long.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.110 align:middle line:84%
So that person was
probably about 6 foot 9",

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.860 align:middle line:84%
7 feet, put in the
flexed position.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.600 align:middle line:90%
But then we have the guardians.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very old
antiquarian drawing,

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.100 align:middle line:84%
where you'd have them sitting,
staring out into the distance.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.560 align:middle line:10%
And as a kind of
spiritual person

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.660 align:middle line:10%
that interacts with these
ancient sites and as a druid,

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.260 align:middle line:10%
you ask the guardian before
you go onto the site.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.490 align:middle line:10%
You ask the spirit of
place and the ancestors.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And once you have permission
to go into the site,

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.930 align:middle line:84%
and it's easy, you just
stand by an ancient site,

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.760 align:middle line:90%
and you just tune into the land.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And then if your body pulls
forward, that's a yes.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.610 align:middle line:84%
The ancestors and
these guardians

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.260 align:middle line:90%
have allowed you access.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.650 align:middle line:84%
If you don't, it's just kind
of like going into a temple

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.330 align:middle line:90%
with no respect really.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.390 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we
tend to practice.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.080 align:middle line:10%
Now on the Salisbury Plain,
overlooking the land.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.420 align:middle line:10%
And when you're on
the Salisbury Plain,

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.610 align:middle line:10%
and these barrows certainly
overlooks the land,

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.380 align:middle line:10%
you're on elevated ground.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.980 align:middle line:84%
It feels like the sky
is very close to touch.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.240 align:middle line:10%
And this is the largest long
barrow in Northwest Europe.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.710 align:middle line:10%
It snakes across.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.670 align:middle line:10%
And it had one person
in it, one woman.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.140 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, she was probably a
high priest or high priestess.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And she was probably
associated as well

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.280 align:middle line:84%
with the building of
Stonehenge phase one.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.880 align:middle line:84%
We'll look at the
different phases later on.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.640 align:middle line:84%
So when I discovered
this barrow,

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.500 align:middle line:90%
I thought, well, who is it?

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And like I said yesterday,
these people of the past,

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.400 align:middle line:90%
they call to you.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you listen
very carefully,

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:51.780 align:middle line:84%
they tell you things and
guide you to make discoveries.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And one of those
discoveries that I found

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.500 align:middle line:84%
was very close to
Stonehenge, not on any map

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.500 align:middle line:84%
as well, it was on
antiquarian maps.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.320 align:middle line:10%
But one of the strangest
burials that I have found,

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.800 align:middle line:10%
and I found several, some of
which I'll be discussing today,

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.080 align:middle line:10%
was very similar to
Lloyd Pye's Starchild

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.550 align:middle line:10%
because the antiquarians that
dug into it wrote a report.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.260 align:middle line:10%
Then it was re-evaluated in
the 1930s, and we discussed.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And in that report,
it said there

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.310 align:middle line:84%
was several people in a
circle, all tied together

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.540 align:middle line:90%
with long skulls.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.730 align:middle line:90%
And they were forming a circle.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Inside of this circle
was this strange being

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.830 align:middle line:90%
that was described.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Had the eyes on the top
of the head, for example.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:40.940 align:middle line:90%
It had a tail.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And it had a crooked
skeleton as well.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.680 align:middle line:90%
So it was like that shape.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And they really didn't know
what they'd discovered.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.730 align:middle line:84%
So it got filed away in what's
called the National Monument

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.650 align:middle line:90%
Record Office.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.180 align:middle line:10%
And this is where I find these
type of details, which have

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.810 align:middle line:10%
been literally squirreled away.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.090 align:middle line:90%
So what was this person?

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.650 align:middle line:90%
Was it a deformed human being?

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.590 align:middle line:90%
Was it someone from the stars?

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.420 align:middle line:84%
We'll never know because
the skull has gone missing.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:13.490 align:middle line:10%
But it was definitely very,
very close to Stonehenge.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.970 align:middle line:10%
I think we have to be very
open-minded with the people

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.180 align:middle line:10%
of the past and
question everything

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.760 align:middle line:10%
because no one author has
all the answers anyway.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Coming together like we do, we
together can solve mysteries.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And so, some of the information
was lost, and some of it

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:35.300 align:middle line:90%
was gained as well.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And in the gain in the 1930s,
the bones of this Starchild

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.740 align:middle line:84%
as I call it, when a high
state of preservation,

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.840 align:middle line:84%
for example, like
it's written here,

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.360 align:middle line:84%
I told you there
was three skeletons.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.380 align:middle line:10%
And also, one of the bones,
they said the bones of the leg

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.730 align:middle line:10%
were like hollow as well.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:55.820 align:middle line:10%
So it's maybe that
caused it to have

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.790 align:middle line:10%
a crooked skull, a crooked
spine, for example.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.980 align:middle line:10%
So there's lots of
these facts going on.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.610 align:middle line:10%
So that's one of my
first strangest burials

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:09.210 align:middle line:10%
that I found at Stonehenge,
which is quite incredible.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:12.500 align:middle line:10%
And also, if we go to
Lloyd Pye's information,

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.960 align:middle line:10%
then his was about
900 years old.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.480 align:middle line:10%
Whereas this one's 5 and
1/2 thousand years old.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:21.740 align:middle line:84%
It could be one of the earliest
features in the Stonehenge

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.350 align:middle line:84%
landscape that may not
have been from this earth.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.260 align:middle line:84%
So I find that really,
really fascinating.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.620 align:middle line:90%
And it's never been found again.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.919 align:middle line:84%
None of these unusual
skulls, they get literally,

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:34.789 align:middle line:90%
like I said, pushed away.

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:36.385 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
all-- probably you

00:08:36.385 --> 00:08:38.650 align:middle line:84%
haven't been to
Cambridge University,

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.350 align:middle line:84%
but for example, in a room
like this, a really, really

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:45.220 align:middle line:84%
big room, down one side, you
have box after box after box,

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.590 align:middle line:84%
with skull after
skull after skull.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And then on the other side
is all the Egyptian skulls.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And they don't really
know what they've got.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.620 align:middle line:90%


00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So will all those
souls be playing again?

00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:58.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:01.280 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I know you're all
from the Salisbury Plain.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And these red flags mean you
can't have access to the plain.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.050 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be very
careful how you navigate it.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.580 align:middle line:90%
You really, really have.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And these unusual
burials are inside that.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.480 align:middle line:84%
So we have to imagine that
you've got to navigate it.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they're open
to the general public.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.260 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes it isn't.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.000 align:middle line:90%
It's Area 51.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.070 align:middle line:84%
It has hardly
anybody visiting it.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:26.180 align:middle line:90%
It has wardens.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And if you go off track,
the wardens will get you on.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.480 align:middle line:84%
You're being monitored
from the moment you

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.340 align:middle line:90%
go on to the Salisbury Plain.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And I took a group to meditate,
in the name of the ancestors,

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.350 align:middle line:90%
on one of the barrows.

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And literally, security was
there within five minutes.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:48.060 align:middle line:10%
So they're watching
you all of the time.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.030 align:middle line:10%
So yeah, these are
some of the tanks

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:52.520 align:middle line:10%
there that you find as you
drive across the plain.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.040 align:middle line:10%
This is a firing
area, for example.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And you can go in
a car when it's

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.960 align:middle line:84%
opened a couple of
times of the year

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.000 align:middle line:84%
because there's a village
there called Imber.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.990 align:middle line:90%
So it's open at some times.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:10.550 align:middle line:84%
What I find fascinating about
Stonehenge, they're the people.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to show you what
they look like in a moment.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:17.120 align:middle line:10%
But I want you to come and
visit Stonehenge with me

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.120 align:middle line:10%
because we all think
we know Stonehenge.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.280 align:middle line:84%
It's the most iconic
stone circle in the world.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.560 align:middle line:90%
So we do think we know it.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:31.280 align:middle line:10%
But when it was being restored
from the 1900s onwards,

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.500 align:middle line:10%
what didn't fit the model--

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.260 align:middle line:10%
and this is the
model that Stukeley

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.530 align:middle line:10%
drew in 1724, the
Reverend William

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.920 align:middle line:10%
Stukeley, that's the model.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:47.180 align:middle line:10%
And then when Colonel Hawley
came along in the 1900s,

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.190 align:middle line:10%
that's the model.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And Atkinson in the
1960s, that's the model.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:11:02.100 align:middle line:84%
But what Colonel Hawley did,
he found many unusual stones,

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.910 align:middle line:90%
but it doesn't fit the model.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:06.840 align:middle line:84%
So what do we do because we
think we know Stonehenge?

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.550 align:middle line:90%
So they buried it nearby.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And what I've done is I'm
raising all these stone

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:16.650 align:middle line:84%
features and showing you
a new view of Stonehenge.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Then we're going to have a
look at the individual stones.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.570 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, when
I opened up, they

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:28.220 align:middle line:84%
have been defaced and
destroyed by English heritage.

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
the reconstructions,

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.440 align:middle line:84%
before the
reconstruction, sorry.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And everybody tended
to write postcards

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:40.630 align:middle line:84%
when they visited in this era
here in 1929, after illness.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.090 align:middle line:84%
Time and time again,
it was after illness.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:47.380 align:middle line:84%
But we can see how bad the
state of Stonehenge was there.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.390 align:middle line:10%
They've got no
lintels on hardly.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:53.470 align:middle line:84%
That's what it looked like
when Colonel Hawley arrived.

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And so they set to work to
reconstruct over the next 40

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:59.020 align:middle line:90%
years or so.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.340 align:middle line:84%
But they all said
one thing as well.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And I could this
quote here says,

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:07.060 align:middle line:84%
"Still and then, those that
drank the miracle water

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.140 align:middle line:90%
were healed."

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.870 align:middle line:84%
That was first written
in the 12th century

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.300 align:middle line:90%
by Geoffrey of Monmouth.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:19.160 align:middle line:84%
He said, if you take scrapings
of the sarsen or bluestones

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.570 align:middle line:84%
that form Stonehenge,
you will be healed.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:27.110 align:middle line:84%
But could it be there
was a different type

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:32.000 align:middle line:84%
of water generated by
Stonehenge that was healing?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
I'll show you later.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.690 align:middle line:90%


00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And also, in that model
that I showed you earlier,

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:44.980 align:middle line:84%
that iconic model, they said
there was one or two stone.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing
Stonehenge weathered.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:50.840 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:54.080 align:middle line:84%
It's terribly weathered
for Orthodox dating,

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.200 align:middle line:84%
4 and 1/2 thousand years
of British weather.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.580 align:middle line:90%
What do you expect?

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.200 align:middle line:90%
It looks gray.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.090 align:middle line:90%
But originally it wasn't.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:03.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to later
on come and have

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.750 align:middle line:90%
a look at Polish bluestone.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:07.490 align:middle line:90%
The bluestones came from Wales.

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And they were so highly
polished, they looked

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.380 align:middle line:90%
like the star spangled sky.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.800 align:middle line:84%
At the center of Stonehenge,
bejewel in the monument,

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.580 align:middle line:90%
was the Altar Stones.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:18.380 align:middle line:90%
I'll show you.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.270 align:middle line:84%
They say there's
only one altar stone.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.580 align:middle line:90%
And it was green and red.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:24.950 align:middle line:84%
It was flexed with
garnet and mica.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:27.950 align:middle line:90%
And it shone and glistened.

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And on the outside, the
stones weren't gray.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:34.820 align:middle line:84%
All archaeologists know
the stones aren't gray.

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.730 align:middle line:84%
The greater trilithon
at Stonehenge,

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:42.590 align:middle line:84%
it was originally orange and
pink, reflecting the sun.

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And all archaeologists
agree with that.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:50.050 align:middle line:10%
So come on, let's see Stonehenge
in this really colorful way.

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:53.860 align:middle line:10%
Now Atkinson, Professor
Richard Atkinson.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Don't let the name
professor fool you.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.340 align:middle line:84%
He damaged Stonehenge
beyond all recognition.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And his name should be blighted
from the archaeological books.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.940 align:middle line:90%
He destroyed some of Stonehenge.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.760 align:middle line:84%
In fact, all the
druids in the area

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.390 align:middle line:84%
say one thing, go to Stonehenge,
don't get obsessed by it.

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:14.240 align:middle line:90%
Am I obsessed?

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.040 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.627 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:16.627 --> 00:14:18.460 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to be
really, really careful,

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.800 align:middle line:90%
OK, because he did get obsessed.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And he started to hide artifacts
in his bedroom and things.

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:26.380 align:middle line:90%
This is Professor Atkinson.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is him doing
the reconstruction,

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.730 align:middle line:84%
pulling one of
the trilithons up.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:32.590 align:middle line:90%
Now these aren't in the earth.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Most people think standing
stones in this area

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:36.190 align:middle line:90%
are in the earth.

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:36.990 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:39.430 align:middle line:90%
They're in solid chalk bedrock.

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:43.210 align:middle line:84%
So they're linked into
particular socket holes.

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:46.557 align:middle line:90%
He moved that by 15 inches.

00:14:46.557 --> 00:14:48.265 align:middle line:84%
So if you've got good
eyes at Stonehenge,

00:14:48.265 --> 00:14:50.680 align:middle line:84%
you know they're no longer
opposite each other.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.770 align:middle line:84%
That's another little
crime of Atkinson.

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.210 align:middle line:90%
The henge bank.

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:59.200 align:middle line:10%
When you see those iconic
pictures of Stonehenge,

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.190 align:middle line:10%
it's open.

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:04.570 align:middle line:10%
You can even drive along
the A303, look to your left,

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.100 align:middle line:10%
and you see the stones.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.870 align:middle line:10%
That wasn't like in
the ancient times.

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:10.990 align:middle line:10%
Imagine, there's
the stone circle,

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:15.280 align:middle line:10%
and it's surrounded by
a 10-foot chalk bank.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.080 align:middle line:10%
You can't see into Stonehenge.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.060 align:middle line:10%
So all you could see back
in the day as it were,

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.900 align:middle line:10%
was the top of the
greater trilithon.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:27.790 align:middle line:84%
I inherited all the unpublished
surveys by a master dowser

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:29.110 align:middle line:90%
called Guy Underwood.

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:32.630 align:middle line:10%
And my late father
was a master dowser.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:37.250 align:middle line:84%
He also knew the custodian
and the archaeologist

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:39.080 align:middle line:90%
of Stonehenge.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.350 align:middle line:90%
He was there at Atkinson's dig.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Atkinson wanted to know roughly
how deep this massive henge

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.230 align:middle line:90%
bank was glowing chalk white.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:50.030 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And he said that what
he saw, Atkinson lied.

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's in every
single guidebook.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Atkinson said, that's
made of chalk rubble,

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:01.820 align:middle line:90%
it's just chalk rubble.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And they kind of put it all
together and made a wall.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Our eyewitness said,
no, it was scooped out

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.200 align:middle line:84%
of the ground like a
pudding bowl and made high.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.330 align:middle line:84%
What sort of
technology did that?

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:18.660 align:middle line:84%
That's over 330
feet in diameter.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.660 align:middle line:90%
So it's very, very smooth.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Again in the ancient world,
there's evidence for color.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.810 align:middle line:84%
Everything may have
been very colorful.

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:30.800 align:middle line:84%
For example, this is a barrow
in Sardinia that I visited.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.230 align:middle line:84%
It looks gray,
and it looks warm.

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:37.430 align:middle line:84%
But that's what it was like,
full of beautiful color.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:38.270 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Ocher, I find ocher
everywhere around Stonehenge.

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.500 align:middle line:84%
There's also evidence
that the henge bank

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:50.990 align:middle line:84%
in other parts of the
country that preceded this,

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:54.140 align:middle line:84%
were also colorful,
carved with symbols.

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's from Professor
Mike Parker Pearson.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:00.080 align:middle line:84%
So what I say is
that hedge bank could

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.600 align:middle line:90%
have been very, very colorful.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.670 align:middle line:84%
I've done experiments
with ocher.

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:07.430 align:middle line:84%
If you mix it with
some ammonia, then you

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.589 align:middle line:90%
can literally paint onto stone.

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And even through
storm after storm,

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:13.760 align:middle line:90%
it remains pretty constant.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.380 align:middle line:84%
It would need a touch
up every now and again.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.250 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's a colorful
world, the ancients,

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:23.990 align:middle line:84%
not gray like that on
the inside and out.

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:28.084 align:middle line:84%
And in Orkney, they found paint
pots on the Ness of Brodgar.

00:17:28.084 --> 00:17:30.760 align:middle line:90%


00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And here we have
that iconic picture

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.320 align:middle line:90%
all in the shades of gray.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.410 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
that huge trailer

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:44.500 align:middle line:84%
form there, that was deep orange
with a beautiful pink hue.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:49.450 align:middle line:84%
These stones never
saw the light of day

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:51.730 align:middle line:90%
until they reached Stonehenge.

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:53.350 align:middle line:84%
People think when
they go and look

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:56.950 align:middle line:84%
at stones in what's called
the Valley of the Stones

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.830 align:middle line:84%
about 17 miles
from this monument,

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:01.660 align:middle line:84%
oh, that's where
they got them from.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.430 align:middle line:90%
No, they dug them out.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:04.360 align:middle line:90%
They were buried.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
have a buried stone

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.410 align:middle line:84%
and you raise it to
see the light of day,

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:11.420 align:middle line:84%
it's easy to make into
a lot and just shape.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.050 align:middle line:90%
So these stones were special.

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Avebury was built
from stones that

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:17.410 align:middle line:90%
had been lying on the surface.

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:20.140 align:middle line:84%
These came from
deep underground.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And bluestones,
that term bluestone

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:25.180 align:middle line:90%
implies they're all blue.

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:26.980 align:middle line:90%
No, some were green.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Some were such a beautiful
green shade with red.

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And like I said before,
these flexes in them,

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:36.260 align:middle line:90%
well, that didn't fit the model.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.160 align:middle line:84%
So guess what Atkinson
did, he buried them.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And I've got a map to show
you where they all were.

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:44.900 align:middle line:90%


00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.420 align:middle line:84%
When we look at
Stonehenge, again

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.940 align:middle line:84%
through this same,
same model, then we

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.820 align:middle line:84%
see it's got an axis
line that everybody says,

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:56.630 align:middle line:84%
oh it's aligned to
the midsummer sunrise.

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:57.740 align:middle line:90%
It's off.

00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.690 align:middle line:10%
Atkinson again.

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:03.370 align:middle line:10%
He forced that photograph
really because if you

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:04.820 align:middle line:10%
were at the center
of Stonehenge,

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.340 align:middle line:10%
to get the sunrise
over the Heel Stone,

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.000 align:middle line:10%
you have to be 6 feet away.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And he got his
photographer to do that.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Any archaeoastronomer will
tell you the Heel Stone's best

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.530 align:middle line:90%
alignment is to the moon.

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Every nine years the moon
rises above the Heel Stone.

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:28.550 align:middle line:90%
That's its true alignment.

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:30.670 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to go have
a new view of Stonehenge

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:33.190 align:middle line:84%
now because English
heritage will tell you,

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:36.580 align:middle line:84%
there's a stone circle of
sarsens in which there's

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:37.690 align:middle line:90%
the bluestones.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got the trilithons,
then you have the Altar Stone.

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:43.180 align:middle line:90%
I say no.

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:46.300 align:middle line:84%
There was a concentric stone
circle of bluestones there,

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.070 align:middle line:90%
and there's the evidence for it.

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And here, Professor Mike Parker
Pearson, he agrees with me.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:54.760 align:middle line:10%
He says we don't know
if the bluestone sockets

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.480 align:middle line:10%
behind the greater trilithon
were part of Q and R bluestone

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.530 align:middle line:10%
circle.

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:02.200 align:middle line:10%
Everyone else says
it's a horseshoe, which

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.910 align:middle line:10%
I have interpreted, and I do.

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:07.300 align:middle line:90%
But the English heritage say no.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.170 align:middle line:90%
It says a horseshoe.

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:09.760 align:middle line:90%
Let's stick it as a horseshoe.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.430 align:middle line:84%
But the professionals think
it's a concentric stone

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:15.020 align:middle line:84%
circle of the bluestones
on the inside.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.330 align:middle line:90%
I'll show you that in a moment.

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:19.010 align:middle line:90%


00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:22.130 align:middle line:10%
That's the model I've
been talking about.

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:25.880 align:middle line:10%
No avenue leading into
it, and this is my model.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.970 align:middle line:10%
And it's saying to you there
was two Altar Stones, very

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:30.770 align:middle line:10%
colorful.

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:34.700 align:middle line:10%
One was taken and we'll see,
by the occultist of the royals.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.470 align:middle line:10%
He stole that stone.

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:38.900 align:middle line:10%
And then that's the
concentric circle.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:44.260 align:middle line:10%
And there may have even
been another trilithon.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:45.370 align:middle line:90%
And I'll show you that.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:46.340 align:middle line:90%
They know that's there.

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:47.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.040 align:middle line:90%
So it could have been opposite.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.550 align:middle line:84%
So that's what English
heritage tell you.

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:54.400 align:middle line:10%
That is probably the
truth of Stonehenge.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.040 align:middle line:10%
And I'm getting more
and more archaeologists

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.030 align:middle line:10%
agreeing with me.

00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:59.860 align:middle line:10%
You just got to
step outside the box

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:04.450 align:middle line:10%
and say no, this could be
a beautiful new Stonehenge.

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:08.440 align:middle line:10%
And right at the top, where
it says stone number 30 and 1,

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.190 align:middle line:10%
you've got extra stones
like a bluestone avenue.

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:15.310 align:middle line:10%
You'd walk processionally
into Stonehenge,

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:17.890 align:middle line:10%
through a very short avenue.

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:21.670 align:middle line:10%
That's not on any model
at all because Atkinson

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:24.760 align:middle line:10%
knew that there was
that way to enter it.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.710 align:middle line:90%
And he even got the excavation.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:30.040 align:middle line:84%
That's the excavation
showing you the entrance.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:34.150 align:middle line:84%
But he decided in all the
guides, not to keep that in.

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Again, another kind of
I-repress information.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:42.020 align:middle line:90%
James I-- aren't all kings mad?

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:42.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.980 align:middle line:90%
Isn't our queen mad?

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:49.630 align:middle line:10%
The kings of the past, honestly,
King James VI for Scotland,

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:53.500 align:middle line:10%
James I of England, as
he would become known,

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.560 align:middle line:10%
a very unusual king.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And he even inspired all
of Shakespeare's plays.

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:02.960 align:middle line:90%
He was paranoid about witches.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:03.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.710 align:middle line:84%
He was so paranoid
about witches,

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:08.060 align:middle line:90%
he decided to write a book.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:13.300 align:middle line:84%
His first most famous book
was translating the Bible

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.280 align:middle line:90%
from Latin into English.

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's still a
bestseller today.

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And then he was accusing
people of witchcraft that

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:24.170 align:middle line:90%
are trying to topple him down.

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And so he wrote
demonology telling

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.800 align:middle line:84%
people, oh, if they have
these signs on them,

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.270 align:middle line:90%
that they're a witch.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And he started the
frenzy of it all.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.520 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, he
was an occultist.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And he had two occultists
working with him.

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:45.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he was married
to Queen Anne of Denmark.

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:49.960 align:middle line:90%
But he had a lover.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:54.040 align:middle line:10%
And his lover was
called George Villiers,

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:58.180 align:middle line:10%
the dashingly handsome
duke of Buckingham.

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.090 align:middle line:10%
That's what I need.

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:02.615 align:middle line:10%
Now traditionally, you
have one Altar Stone here.

00:23:02.615 --> 00:23:04.740 align:middle line:10%
It's said to have stood at
the heart of Stonehenge.

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.150 align:middle line:10%
I say there were two.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:08.370 align:middle line:10%
And I said there was
evidence for two.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:11.550 align:middle line:10%
The socket hole was
found in the 1620s

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:15.450 align:middle line:10%
by James I, his lover,
the Duke of Buckingham,

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:18.960 align:middle line:10%
and Inigo Jones went
with him as well.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:23.910 align:middle line:10%
Inigo Jones said that
there was six trilithons.

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:25.620 align:middle line:10%
He got that through
sacred geometry.

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.480 align:middle line:10%
We are going to
find the sixth one.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:33.360 align:middle line:10%
They called the socket hole
in modern times WA3359.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.830 align:middle line:10%
So what happened?

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Duke of Buckingham said
to James I, I'm ill,

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:42.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm really, really ill.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.540 align:middle line:84%
The whole of England
thought James

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:49.160 align:middle line:84%
I was going to die after
his wife, Anne of Denmark,

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.290 align:middle line:90%
departed.

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And so the Duke said,
we need a blood ritual.

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:56.270 align:middle line:90%
And they did a blood ritual.

00:23:56.270 --> 00:24:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And the following year,
James I came back to life.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And the first place they
all went to to visit

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:10.070 align:middle line:84%
was Stonehenge because they
knew the stones could heal,

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:12.290 align:middle line:84%
because it was written
in the 12th century

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:14.030 align:middle line:90%
that they were healing stones.

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:15.408 align:middle line:90%
So that's where they went.

00:24:15.408 --> 00:24:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we're
going to go in search for,

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:19.400 align:middle line:90%
the Altar Stone.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.910 align:middle line:84%
This is the Duke
of Buckingham here.

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:25.880 align:middle line:84%
When he went there
with Inigo Jones,

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.700 align:middle line:84%
he said, I will
buy the trilithon.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:32.000 align:middle line:84%
He wanted the greater trilithon
to take back to London.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And he offered the owner at
the time, any money you want.

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:39.180 align:middle line:84%
He had more power than
the King of England.

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:42.140 align:middle line:84%
He was in control of
England at that time.

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:47.190 align:middle line:84%
Him and his mother, they
were both occultists.

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:48.840 align:middle line:90%
But the owner said no.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
stone that they wanted.

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:51.900 align:middle line:90%
It's leaning.

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.828 align:middle line:90%
Colonel Hawley put it back up.

00:24:53.828 --> 00:24:55.120 align:middle line:90%
But that's the one they wanted.

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.287 align:middle line:90%
And they couldn't have that.

00:24:56.287 --> 00:24:59.190 align:middle line:84%
So they probably, for
the occult practices,

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:05.400 align:middle line:84%
took the Altar Stone, the second
Altar Stone, which is probably

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.200 align:middle line:90%
being stolen and carted away.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.070 align:middle line:10%
And this is the evidence for it.

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:13.430 align:middle line:10%
All through history has been
saying the second altar stone,

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:17.540 align:middle line:10%
in John Aubrey's famous
book "Monumenta Britannica,"

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:20.630 align:middle line:10%
Aubrey was told of the
second Altar Stone's fate

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:22.850 align:middle line:10%
by the Rector of Bishopstone.

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:25.700 align:middle line:10%
He said that Phillip,
Earl of Pembroke,

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:30.290 align:middle line:10%
Lord Chamberlain to King
Charles I, successor of James I,

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:33.210 align:middle line:10%
did say that an Altar Stone was
found in the middle of the area

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:34.010 align:middle line:10%
here.

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:36.470 align:middle line:10%
And it was carted
away to St. James.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:40.080 align:middle line:10%
And they interpret that as
St. James's Palace in London.

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.530 align:middle line:84%
So it was all documented
that the second Altar

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:44.060 align:middle line:90%
Stone was stolen.

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked archaeologists,
we have all of this evidence.

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:51.210 align:middle line:84%
They were still looking
for it in the 1930s.

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:55.820 align:middle line:84%
For example, oh, well, we'll
just stick to the model.

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably here
in St. James's Palace

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:01.880 align:middle line:84%
or in another
place in Wiltshire,

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.010 align:middle line:90%
which Inigo Jones designed.

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:05.690 align:middle line:90%
So it's in one of those places.

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of the
most healing stones there.

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:12.340 align:middle line:90%


00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:15.910 align:middle line:84%
With the official
line of Atkinson

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:19.060 align:middle line:84%
with the second oldest dome,
they know the hole's there.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:20.330 align:middle line:90%
They know the hole's there.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:21.850 align:middle line:90%
So they've got to find it.

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And he says that the
stone hole, WA3359,

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:29.350 align:middle line:90%
was for a makeshift stone.

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And the makeshift Altar
Stone was this blue stone

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.680 align:middle line:84%
with a groove in it
that still stands today

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:36.850 align:middle line:90%
by the Altar Stone.

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And there's one stone that
they buried and hid away

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.560 align:middle line:90%
that has a kind of tongue.

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And they put these
two stones together,

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:48.040 align:middle line:84%
and they made a makeshift
Altar Stone now.

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Everything at
Stonehenge had meaning.

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:51.860 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was by chance.

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's no way the
second Altar Stone.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:59.630 align:middle line:84%
But that's the
official line going.

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:02.300 align:middle line:84%
So we're coming to
another anomaly now,

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.640 align:middle line:90%
the buried trilithon.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.850 align:middle line:84%
Again, Hawley,
back in the 1930s,

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:10.160 align:middle line:90%
really knew that was the model.

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.290 align:middle line:90%
They clearly saw that.

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:16.460 align:middle line:84%
But they knew that they didn't
know what to do with it.

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:17.460 align:middle line:90%
They found it.

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.300 align:middle line:10%
And so this is the
model Inigo Jones

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.460 align:middle line:10%
made of the sixth trilithon.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.710 align:middle line:10%
That's what it looks like.

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:27.117 align:middle line:90%
And where is it?

00:27:27.117 --> 00:27:27.950 align:middle line:90%
This is where it is.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:29.630 align:middle line:90%
It's buried right there.

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:30.960 align:middle line:90%
And they know that.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And they won't dig it up, and
they won't do an excavation.

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:36.840 align:middle line:84%
I've called for one
recently and saying, well,

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.210 align:middle line:90%
let's just have a look.

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:39.260 align:middle line:90%
GeoPhys it.

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Do something to try and
find this wonderful stone.

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:46.620 align:middle line:90%


00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:50.540 align:middle line:10%
We're going to talk now
about the power of stone

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:55.490 align:middle line:10%
because Stonehenge can really
change your consciousness.

00:27:55.490 --> 00:28:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And it has such healing
ability that is second to none.

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:03.260 align:middle line:90%
And that is the magic of stone.

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:07.100 align:middle line:84%
Imagine there's loads
of ley lines coursing

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:07.940 align:middle line:90%
through Stonehenge.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:11.030 align:middle line:84%
But more than that,
at the center,

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:14.570 align:middle line:84%
you have a convergence of
earth currents rising out

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:16.100 align:middle line:90%
of the ground.

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And also, by the Heel Stone,
that's a power point as well.

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:25.310 align:middle line:84%
We'll have a look at the
metaphysical properties

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:29.555 align:middle line:84%
of stone and how the
ancients used the monument.

00:28:29.555 --> 00:28:32.130 align:middle line:90%


00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And here we have a wonderful
quote from the 12th century.

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:41.130 align:middle line:84%
"For in these stones is a
mystery and a healing virtue

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:42.780 align:middle line:90%
against many ailments.

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.150 align:middle line:84%
For they washed the stones
and poured the water

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:48.840 align:middle line:84%
into baths, whereby those
who were sick were cured.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.900 align:middle line:84%
For not a stone is
there that is wanting

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:54.480 align:middle line:90%
in virtue or leech-craft."

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Meaning it was the best place to
go and have healing and mixing

00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:59.640 align:middle line:90%
water with stone.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.670 align:middle line:84%
That's a trace element
of what was really

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:09.320 align:middle line:84%
happening with some of these
very, very mighty stones.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:13.430 align:middle line:84%
These stones here are
what's called in situ.

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:15.920 align:middle line:84%
They haven't ever been
touched by Atkinson.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.820 align:middle line:90%
They're not swamped in concrete.

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:21.610 align:middle line:84%
That's how the ancients
put them there.

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And again, imagine
them pink and orange.

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:27.590 align:middle line:10%
Fade like pink hue is
very beautiful sarsen

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:28.840 align:middle line:10%
that's come out of the ground.

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:33.650 align:middle line:10%
It's not that kind of
gray color that you see.

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is the side of
a very special trilithon.

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:37.907 align:middle line:90%
So join me now.

00:29:37.907 --> 00:29:38.990 align:middle line:90%
We're going to Stonehenge.

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:41.560 align:middle line:84%
We've gone through the entrance
of the bluestone concentric

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:42.360 align:middle line:90%
circle.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And now there's a horseshoe
with the trilithon behind me.

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And just on my left-hand
side is a towering stone.

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:52.910 align:middle line:10%
And if you walk towards
that, you really do

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:57.290 align:middle line:10%
feel your body down one
side tingle, for example.

00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:59.900 align:middle line:84%
But it had a hole
on the other side.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And that hole there,
according to the custodian

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:07.970 align:middle line:84%
of Stonehenge and
the archaeologist,

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:10.790 align:middle line:84%
that made water
even in a drought.

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:11.720 align:middle line:90%
It was magical.

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.470 align:middle line:84%
They said it could
be really hot day.

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:15.170 align:middle line:84%
It would fill up
with water, and they

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:17.420 align:middle line:84%
tried to figure out where
the water was coming from.

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And you can even
see water erosion

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:21.470 align:middle line:90%
where it was overflowing.

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And so people went
there from far and wide,

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and said that it could heal all
sorts of disorders, shortness

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:29.810 align:middle line:90%
of breath.

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Asthma is what they were
talking about in that time.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:36.560 align:middle line:84%
The falling sickness, epilepsy
is what that was called.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And people even in the
1940s after the war

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:44.000 align:middle line:84%
used to go there and start
bathing and washing in it.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And they said they would
be cured of all ailments.

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:49.250 align:middle line:84%
That's why in that
first postcard

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:51.960 align:middle line:90%
I showed you, after illness.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:55.050 align:middle line:90%
So it's very, very powerful.

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:56.610 align:middle line:90%
And so there was queues.

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Now in the 1940s, people had
ailments from the Second World

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:00.560 align:middle line:90%
War.

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.270 align:middle line:84%
So people are queuing
by that stone.

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And the authorities
got to hear about it

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:07.490 align:middle line:84%
and said, what's all this
about the healing waters here?

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:11.380 align:middle line:10%
They were saying, oh, it's
like the lords of France.

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:13.450 align:middle line:90%
And so we can't have this.

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:15.918 align:middle line:84%
We're going to stop
this practice now,

00:31:15.918 --> 00:31:16.960 align:middle line:90%
and that's what they did.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:20.840 align:middle line:84%
They plugged it up with
cement and plastic.

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.870 align:middle line:90%
So it no longer is a feature.

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:28.650 align:middle line:84%
But it's remembered by the very
old even in Amesbury today.

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:33.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the healing
virtues of the mighty temple

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:34.720 align:middle line:90%
we call Stonehenge.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.620 align:middle line:90%


00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:40.260 align:middle line:90%
This stone has fallen.

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:43.490 align:middle line:10%
It came down in a storm.

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:47.600 align:middle line:10%
That's the line that again,
English heritage say,

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.040 align:middle line:10%
the stones didn't fall down.

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.710 align:middle line:10%
They'd been up for 4
and 1/2 thousand years.

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:59.150 align:middle line:10%
What happened was Atkinson got
a crane, and he lifted stone 22

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:00.440 align:middle line:10%
from its socket.

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:03.240 align:middle line:90%
And apparently it went crazy.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And it spun around and
spun around and spun around

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:08.780 align:middle line:84%
and went bang into
another stone.

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:10.760 align:middle line:90%
And so now that one's leaning.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.970 align:middle line:84%
So they said, oh, we're
going to push that one up.

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And this one came down because
of something else Atkinson did.

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:19.280 align:middle line:90%
We'll see in a moment.

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:22.760 align:middle line:10%
But they, our archaeologists
say that this tool in here,

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:26.480 align:middle line:10%
as it's called broad
tooling, it makes a spine,

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.680 align:middle line:10%
like a big ridge.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.760 align:middle line:10%
And you've got two, and
they're human height.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.230 align:middle line:10%
So when that stone was upright,
if I went against it like this,

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:35.420 align:middle line:10%
it goes perfectly down my spine.

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:39.560 align:middle line:84%
You get these spine stones at
lots and lots of stone circles.

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.950 align:middle line:90%
Avebury has one.

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:44.370 align:middle line:10%
And I believe that they
were when they were upright,

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:45.990 align:middle line:10%
if you put your
spine against them,

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:49.140 align:middle line:10%
hundreds and hundreds of
people have done this with me

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:51.300 align:middle line:10%
and said that they
feel the energy.

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.300 align:middle line:10%
But here's a good trick when
you go to Stonehenge, when

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:57.510 align:middle line:10%
you get booked your
private access with me,

00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:01.050 align:middle line:10%
you can get your hands
and go all the way down,

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:04.290 align:middle line:10%
and you feel heat
rising out of the stone.

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And I took just recently,
this last month,

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.170 align:middle line:84%
I took 60 people all
in all to Stonehenge.

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:12.613 align:middle line:84%
60 people felt the heat
coming out of that stone.

00:33:12.613 --> 00:33:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And then you get the guards
come over, what are you doing,

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:16.655 align:middle line:84%
you're not allowed
to touch the stones.

00:33:16.655 --> 00:33:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Touch the stones
gently like that.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And I said, there's heat
coming out of the stones.

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:22.893 align:middle line:90%
Well, that was the look.

00:33:22.893 --> 00:33:24.060 align:middle line:90%
And then he saw it doing it.

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And he called the other
security over and said,

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:28.380 align:middle line:90%
look at this, the heat.

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:32.820 align:middle line:84%
So I think it was generated
like that in the past.

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.680 align:middle line:90%
It's an incredible stone.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:38.860 align:middle line:84%
All of the stones at Stonehenge
trilithons were for healing.

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:39.660 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:42.230 align:middle line:90%


00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:46.760 align:middle line:10%
This other trilithon
on the opposite side

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:50.900 align:middle line:10%
has a very strange
carving in it.

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:52.400 align:middle line:84%
It's like it was
seared in a moment.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:55.190 align:middle line:90%
It's like a rectangle.

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Back in the
Elizabethan times, it

00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:02.000 align:middle line:84%
was recorded that there was
a metal plate found here

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:02.990 align:middle line:90%
in Stonehenge.

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, it got buried
in a burial, possibly

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:09.983 align:middle line:84%
with a very tall giant, as
people, other researchers

00:34:09.983 --> 00:34:11.150 align:middle line:90%
like Hugh Newman, would say.

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:12.290 align:middle line:90%
I think he got buried.

00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:14.120 align:middle line:84%
But it was said to
be found near there,

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.620 align:middle line:90%
the metal they didn't know.

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.540 align:middle line:84%
They were learned
scholars at the time.

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:18.739 align:middle line:90%
They said it was tin.

00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:21.560 align:middle line:84%
Then they argued, no,
it's not tin, it's lead.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.170 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't figure it out and
had all these hieroglyphics,

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:27.380 align:middle line:84%
all and these strange
symbols on it.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:32.300 align:middle line:84%
I propose that it was
actually at Stonehenge itself.

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:35.960 align:middle line:10%
And this stone here, the
trilithon, this is the carving.

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:39.949 align:middle line:84%
It's the exact same measurements
as that metal plate.

00:34:39.949 --> 00:34:43.050 align:middle line:84%
So maybe that was saying
something about the history.

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:45.320 align:middle line:84%
But then people say, well,
no, it was a Stone Age.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:48.080 align:middle line:84%
It was the Neolithic
and the Bronze Age.

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.659 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless,
that plate, whatever

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:55.130 align:middle line:84%
it was, wherever it came
from, probably went there.

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:56.449 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I think.

00:34:56.449 --> 00:35:01.300 align:middle line:10%
And it probably
shone beautifully so.

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:04.660 align:middle line:10%
Just before we come to
the people of the past,

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:12.450 align:middle line:10%
I want to tell you about the
fate of trilithon 59 and 60.

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:15.450 align:middle line:84%
The spine stone I've just
showed you was gently

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:18.310 align:middle line:90%
leaning over like that.

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:22.810 align:middle line:84%
Anyone will tell you that
a leaning stone shows

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:27.280 align:middle line:84%
you the strongest earth energy,
and it bows to sacred space.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.070 align:middle line:84%
That's why when you
enter a long barrow,

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:32.890 align:middle line:84%
you always have to go down
and then come back up.

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:35.290 align:middle line:90%
You bow to sacred space.

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And Atkinson said, we're going
to straighten it like this.

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:44.160 align:middle line:84%
It can't be leaning, can't
be that, can't be the design.

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:49.820 align:middle line:84%
So with crane and chain,
he lifted that stone up.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And he must have
had an, oh-no moment

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:57.650 align:middle line:84%
because suddenly, it had
a cutout feature that

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:59.030 align:middle line:90%
began to crack.

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And it cracked to
all the way down.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And they said there
was a sound released

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:07.850 align:middle line:90%
from that stone itself.

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And today, that's the
weakest point of Stonehenge.

00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:13.950 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't know what to do.

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:15.530 align:middle line:84%
So they plugged it
up with concrete.

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:18.300 align:middle line:84%
That's why you see this
stone and people go,

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.250 align:middle line:90%
what's inside that?

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:22.470 align:middle line:84%
It's a huge piece
of ugly concrete.

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's because it was
destroyed by Atkinson.

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:28.130 align:middle line:84%
But the people of
the past, I mentioned

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:30.410 align:middle line:90%
that they had elongated skulls.

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:34.010 align:middle line:84%
There's two types of
elongated-skulled people.

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:38.280 align:middle line:84%
For example, back in 2015,
when I first discovered them,

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:40.910 align:middle line:84%
this is the high queen
of that long barrow

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:42.470 align:middle line:90%
that I discussed earlier.

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:45.890 align:middle line:84%
She had a hyper elongated
skull because it had

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:47.870 align:middle line:90%
been manipulated by bandaging.

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:51.110 align:middle line:84%
You do get naturally
long-skulled people,

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:53.930 align:middle line:84%
but some of their skulls
have been extended.

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is the one from
Cambridge, definitely

00:36:58.130 --> 00:36:59.870 align:middle line:90%
a ruling elite.

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:middle line:84%
She was buried with
artifacts as well.

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.390 align:middle line:84%
So they say in the Stone
Age, although there was never

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:07.280 align:middle line:84%
any artifacts, she
was buried with what

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:12.800 align:middle line:84%
looked like a kind of a
wand with antlers and also

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.300 align:middle line:90%
an incense pot.

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And the incense pots, if
you imagine in churches,

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:19.970 align:middle line:84%
they swing the incense
like that, don't they?

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:22.520 align:middle line:84%
That's what they would do, and
they had these incense pots.

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.920 align:middle line:84%
They were swinging
them like in churches,

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.930 align:middle line:90%
and they were full of opiates.

00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:31.080 align:middle line:84%
So they were entering a
different sort of consciousness

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.460 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Now I did have the
body proportions

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:36.560 align:middle line:90%
when I first had that skull.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.500 align:middle line:84%
I then had to go
back to Cambridge

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.900 align:middle line:90%
to find out the dimensions.

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And even though they had
very long elongated skulls,

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.950 align:middle line:84%
they're tiny little
skulls because we

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:52.250 align:middle line:84%
have a body measurement
of one eighth of our head

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:53.550 align:middle line:90%
to our bodies.

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:54.350 align:middle line:90%
They didn't.

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:55.490 align:middle line:90%
It was one tenth.

00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:59.360 align:middle line:84%
So they have very, very
small heads and long bodies,

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:02.450 align:middle line:84%
looking all completely
out of proportions.

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:06.008 align:middle line:84%
And these are from an
anthropologist from Oxford.

00:38:06.008 --> 00:38:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And when I said to
them, well, you've

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:08.810 align:middle line:90%
got all of this information.

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Has anyone ever put
one of these together?

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:12.830 align:middle line:90%
And they said, no.

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:15.290 align:middle line:10%
And with the full height
of the femur bone,

00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:17.250 align:middle line:10%
probably about 5 feet.

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:19.830 align:middle line:10%
This is a male, for example.

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:21.920 align:middle line:10%
So very tiny little heads.

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is me
measuring a femur bone

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:28.040 align:middle line:90%
with the curator of Oxford.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And all the measurements
from all of the Neolithic

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:33.560 align:middle line:90%
long barrows, 17 inches or less.

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Even from the names,
like the giants grave,

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:42.280 align:middle line:84%
they were just 16 inches,
again 5 feet 4" tall.

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:47.260 align:middle line:10%
That's the skull shape that
was again, from reports.

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:49.180 align:middle line:90%
So you imagine that tiny skull.

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And their faces were
so narrow, like this.

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And when I said to the
curator that you've just seen,

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:58.390 align:middle line:84%
that's like a child's,
and he said, yeah, I know.

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So they were kind
of very, almost like

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:04.960 align:middle line:84%
as you'll see, fairy-like
because their ears were

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:09.200 align:middle line:84%
all in a different position
than we have today.

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:13.630 align:middle line:10%
So I think these were the
mythical beings that descended

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:17.290 align:middle line:10%
into the mounds in mythology
in Ireland because they say

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:21.550 align:middle line:10%
the Tuatha DÃ© Danaan were
the ruling supernatural fae,

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:23.320 align:middle line:10%
the fairy folk of Ireland.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And after losing a
battle, which they

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:27.970 align:middle line:84%
did have a battle,
the elongated skulls,

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:29.810 align:middle line:90%
they descended into the mounts.

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:32.440 align:middle line:84%
That's what I think
these beings are.

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:35.770 align:middle line:84%
They're very different
from the giants because

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:39.340 align:middle line:84%
in every single report that
we read, their ears were

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:41.620 align:middle line:90%
quite large, set further back.

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:46.480 align:middle line:84%
So we have our ears in
the right place for us.

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.970 align:middle line:10%
Their ears, much,
much further back

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:52.030 align:middle line:10%
giving them again
this mythological kind

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:56.650 align:middle line:10%
of look like our modern day
depictions that we have today.

00:39:56.650 --> 00:40:00.140 align:middle line:10%
But very fine features as well.

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And I believe with
their elongated skulls,

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:07.750 align:middle line:84%
that they had metaphysical
powers about them.

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think they could,
as I mentioned yesterday,

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:13.690 align:middle line:84%
I think they could
hear the stones.

00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:16.000 align:middle line:84%
So there's two types
of long-headed people

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.060 align:middle line:90%
like I mentioned earlier.

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:20.440 align:middle line:84%
This is a long-headed
person, really

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.570 align:middle line:90%
extended skull at the back.

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And the evidence
from the long barrow

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:26.920 align:middle line:84%
is, especially at
Stonehenge, that there

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.830 align:middle line:84%
was some kind of battle
that was going on

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:32.270 align:middle line:90%
at Stonehenge, for example.

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:35.060 align:middle line:84%
So you've got these
mythical looking people.

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And I believe with
the ancient DNA,

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.910 align:middle line:84%
that they were the
ones that constructed

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Stonehenge because it's
a Neolithic monument.

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:44.870 align:middle line:90%


00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:middle line:90%
So you have the lesser type.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is one here, the
skull is still very tiny.

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And they were, again, very
small with their femur bones.

00:40:56.080 --> 00:41:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is a close-up of
a very, very childlike,

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.310 align:middle line:90%
even in weight.

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And these bones are
very, very light as well,

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:10.870 align:middle line:84%
rather than the dense
skulls that we have today.

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is how narrow
they are as well.

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:16.960 align:middle line:84%
That's the measurement map that
you use at places like Oxford,

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:18.100 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:21.180 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at
there, then this skull

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:23.130 align:middle line:90%
is the lesser long-headed type.

00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:26.340 align:middle line:84%
They are still
very, very narrow.

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:29.760 align:middle line:84%
Now let's compare that to
the invaders that came in.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And they were called the bell
beaker people around 2,500 BC.

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:36.730 align:middle line:90%
And that's a comparison.

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:39.130 align:middle line:84%
So they would have looked
like giants to them.

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:41.040 align:middle line:84%
So they were coming
over, and they

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.440 align:middle line:84%
were looking at our
monuments, the Europeans.

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:47.010 align:middle line:84%
We've got all the DNA evidence
for this incidentally.

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think there was now
a battle for Stonehenge

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:55.670 align:middle line:84%
just like in the Irish mythology
because the Neolithic queen

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:58.550 align:middle line:84%
that I opened up with,
she had been murdered.

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked to the
archaeological reports of all

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:04.460 align:middle line:84%
of the barrows that
surrounded her,

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:07.290 align:middle line:84%
they had all been
murdered as well.

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:09.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in one
barrow alone, there

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:15.380 align:middle line:84%
was a massacre of about 40
males, hidden away, squirreled

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:18.710 align:middle line:90%
away on the Salisbury Plain.

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:20.790 align:middle line:90%
So what was going on there?

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:23.930 align:middle line:84%
I think that the round-headed
people, and that's

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:27.530 align:middle line:84%
what the antiquarians finally
figured all of this out

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:30.740 align:middle line:84%
because they said
long-headed people

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:34.265 align:middle line:84%
in long barrows, round-headed
people in round barrows.

00:42:34.265 --> 00:42:37.510 align:middle line:90%


00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:38.620 align:middle line:90%
So they were the people.

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:40.680 align:middle line:90%
There was a battle.

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And it baffles
archaeologists why

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:49.440 align:middle line:84%
has Stonehenge gone over so
many different tinkerings.

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:52.300 align:middle line:84%
They would take one stone
setting and change it.

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:55.830 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
at 2,500 BC, they

00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:58.290 align:middle line:84%
took that concentric circle,
made it into an oval shape.

00:42:58.290 --> 00:42:59.400 align:middle line:84%
Then they would
take something out,

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.870 align:middle line:90%
and they would change it around.

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:01.875 align:middle line:90%
And they don't know why.

00:43:01.875 --> 00:43:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Why did they keep changing
all of our monuments?

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.190 align:middle line:90%
They did Avebury.

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Avebury is not one
monument at any one time.

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:12.220 align:middle line:84%
It's Neolithic and Bronze
Age and late Bronze Age.

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:15.220 align:middle line:84%
I think that's because the
round-skulled people were

00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:19.270 align:middle line:84%
dominating the area and
tried to make it theirs.

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:21.590 align:middle line:84%
The first thing they
did at Stonehenge,

00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:25.330 align:middle line:84%
which tried to topple the
greater trilithon by building,

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:29.240 align:middle line:84%
by constructing rather,
a big, big pit by it.

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:31.900 align:middle line:90%
But it still held its own.

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:34.180 align:middle line:90%
Now, earth energies.

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:38.320 align:middle line:84%
I think these people of the past
were highly, highly sensitive

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:41.820 align:middle line:90%
to the earth, to stone.

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And they were very
smart because I've

00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:49.470 align:middle line:84%
been taught dowsing by a
Chinese geomancer, master

00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:52.380 align:middle line:90%
dowsers of Europe, for example.

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And the master dowsers of
Europe showed me something.

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:57.390 align:middle line:84%
They got me to Turin
and said, we're

00:43:57.390 --> 00:44:02.190 align:middle line:84%
going to show you how even
today the bishops would

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:04.080 align:middle line:90%
enter an ancient site.

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:06.143 align:middle line:84%
I thought, that sounds
really interesting.

00:44:06.143 --> 00:44:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And so they got
me to try and find

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:09.870 align:middle line:90%
what they call a neutral area.

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, I think it's
here, just off to one side

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:16.620 align:middle line:84%
before you enter a
church or a cathedral

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:19.293 align:middle line:90%
in the northern part of Italy.

00:44:19.293 --> 00:44:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And then I said, well,
I'm going to have

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.260 align:middle line:84%
to see if I can find these
in the rest of the world

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:27.520 align:middle line:84%
because what they told me
was really quite fascinating.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.350 align:middle line:90%
You go to the neutral place.

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:32.320 align:middle line:84%
Before you enter the
monument and just stand there

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:35.530 align:middle line:84%
for a while, let the
energies soak in you.

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:36.400 align:middle line:90%
We measured them.

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:39.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of negative
ions coming out of the ground.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And the electromagnetic field
gets a little bit stronger,

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:43.877 align:middle line:90%
and so does the DC field.

00:44:43.877 --> 00:44:45.460 align:middle line:84%
So while you're being
cleansed, you're

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:48.020 align:middle line:84%
being grounded as
well at the same time.

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:50.590 align:middle line:84%
So Avebury, this is
the neutral stone.

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And you stand by it, and
then if you walk around it

00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:55.810 align:middle line:84%
on its inner face,
there's a ledge

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:59.510 align:middle line:84%
where you can sit down because
it cleanses the energies.

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:03.820 align:middle line:84%
So you don't take your emotional
baggage, we've all got that,

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:06.520 align:middle line:90%
into the stone circle or temple.

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.880 align:middle line:84%
You get this at Karnak,
with the avenues of Sphinx.

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:14.380 align:middle line:84%
So before you enter, you
cleanse your whole being.

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:16.840 align:middle line:90%
And it really does feel good.

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Also, if you're into dowsing,
you can do it before and after.

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.430 align:middle line:84%
So if I measured somebody's
aura for example,

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:27.100 align:middle line:84%
and you take a pendulum or
rod and just move it away

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:29.410 align:middle line:84%
from the body, you might
get a reaction here.

00:45:29.410 --> 00:45:31.120 align:middle line:90%
Normally it's about here.

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Soon as you've been
into a neutral space,

00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:34.270 align:middle line:90%
it would be way past me.

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:41.160 align:middle line:84%
So my auric field now
is very, very receptive.

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:44.220 align:middle line:10%
What the Neolithic were
looking for as well,

00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:47.910 align:middle line:10%
whether it's a pyramid,
whether it's a stone circle,

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:51.150 align:middle line:10%
they were looking
for sacred water.

00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And sacred water is water
that is born within the earth

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:56.760 align:middle line:84%
and generates this
spiral pattern

00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:59.980 align:middle line:90%
independent of rainfall.

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:01.960 align:middle line:84%
It's supposed to
be very healing.

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And amidst this kind of
high electromagnetic field

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:10.930 align:middle line:84%
of 7 to 10 hertz, that was
their first designed cannon.

00:46:10.930 --> 00:46:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter
where you go in the world.

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:18.510 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very
expensive to bore.

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:20.740 align:middle line:90%
And it's very difficult to find.

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:25.650 align:middle line:84%
So when you have moneyed people,
they will want that water.

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:27.310 align:middle line:90%
They know about it.

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And if you're on
your normal tap water

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:32.820 align:middle line:84%
that you drink from
the tap, then that

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:36.480 align:middle line:84%
is ground water that
has fallen from the sky

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:38.490 align:middle line:90%
and filled up the aquifers.

00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:45.780 align:middle line:84%
So esoteric water divine in law,
that's a healing symbol when

00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:47.290 align:middle line:90%
you stand above it.

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:52.350 align:middle line:84%
If you drink that water, you
will live to a long, long age.

00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And when I did some
water divining for--

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:58.470 align:middle line:90%
he's passed away now--

00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Lord Bath, Alexander Thynn,
he said, come to my property.

00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:04.020 align:middle line:90%
I want you to decode it, Maria.

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I live
above the spirals.

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:10.330 align:middle line:90%
We drink spiral water.

00:47:10.330 --> 00:47:12.430 align:middle line:90%
So they do know about this.

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:13.230 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And these type of aquifers
beneath the pyramids,

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:18.840 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people just
say it's a groundwater

00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:20.230 align:middle line:90%
aquifer beneath the pyramid.

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:21.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:23.880 align:middle line:84%
You've got the groundwater
there, yang water,

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:27.270 align:middle line:84%
but then you've got the
yin water down here.

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:34.160 align:middle line:10%
And that's the sacred energy
that will be in that field.

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:37.940 align:middle line:10%
And these energy patterns
of the underground water

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:40.130 align:middle line:10%
can create triple spirals.

00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:44.240 align:middle line:10%
And they are really sacred
and very, very holy.

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:47.660 align:middle line:10%
And this is
Newgrange in Ireland,

00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:48.975 align:middle line:10%
a terrible reconstruction.

00:47:48.975 --> 00:47:51.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've seen
the before and after of this.

00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:53.670 align:middle line:84%
That's got breeze
blocks behind it.

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And in Ireland, all of the
cairns, as they're called,

00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:59.870 align:middle line:84%
they have crystal quartz
going over the top.

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:01.670 align:middle line:84%
But they stuck it
around the side.

00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:03.800 align:middle line:84%
They now know that
was a mistake,

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:06.890 align:middle line:84%
a bit like some of the
reconstructions at Stonehenge.

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:11.090 align:middle line:10%
And here we have the very
famous Triple Spiral here.

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:12.950 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of people
would say, oh,

00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:14.450 align:middle line:10%
that represents the
time of the year

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:17.360 align:middle line:10%
and could be linked
to Cyrus or Venus.

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.550 align:middle line:10%
But the earth produces this.

00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And if we interact with
these type of energies,

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:26.810 align:middle line:84%
I believe they regenerate
your own body water.

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And they're very
healing in that regard.

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:32.450 align:middle line:84%
So I take people
to ancient sites

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:36.020 align:middle line:84%
to work with these energies
and cleanse themselves

00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:41.180 align:middle line:90%
literally from the inside out.

00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:43.730 align:middle line:10%
And these are the lunar
effects at Stonehenge

00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:47.150 align:middle line:10%
that create these
wonderful patterns.

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:54.920 align:middle line:84%
But underground water doesn't
behave like surface water.

00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:57.295 align:middle line:84%
So surface water,
such as the sea,

00:48:57.295 --> 00:49:02.950 align:middle line:84%
will react to the new and
full moon in its high tides.

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:06.430 align:middle line:84%
These stones, in
ancient druid lore,

00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:10.000 align:middle line:84%
you would only pick
a mistletoe six days

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.640 align:middle line:90%
after a new or full moon.

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And they constantly said
that the year began six days

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:20.320 align:middle line:90%
after the spring equinox.

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:24.280 align:middle line:84%
I suggest that the ancient
druids were so connected

00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:29.110 align:middle line:84%
to nature, they felt these days
because these energy patterns

00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:32.860 align:middle line:84%
happen six days after
new or full moon.

00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:35.500 align:middle line:84%
So if you go to an ancient
site on those days,

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:38.230 align:middle line:84%
but everybody tends to go
there on a new or full moon,

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:41.500 align:middle line:84%
then you'll be experiencing
by numerous stones,

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:43.330 align:middle line:90%
these triple spirals.

00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:47.380 align:middle line:10%
And when you really
work with this energy,

00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:51.320 align:middle line:10%
then I have had loads of
people had healing experiences.

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:54.100 align:middle line:84%
I took a blind person
around Stonehenge.

00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably one of
life's most interesting times

00:49:56.890 --> 00:50:01.690 align:middle line:84%
because she was so highly
sensitized, she could feel.

00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And she said it was like music
coming out of the ground.

00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And she could feel all
of these triple spirals.

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And here we have another one at
another phase of the six days

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:14.750 align:middle line:90%
after the full moon.

00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:18.850 align:middle line:84%
The first one is the new,
and that one is the second.

00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:21.655 align:middle line:84%
So a lot going on
at ancient sites.

00:50:21.655 --> 00:50:24.430 align:middle line:90%


00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people have
all heard about leys.

00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:31.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you all have here today
have heard about ley lines.

00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And back in the 1980s,
I had the pleasure

00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:39.970 align:middle line:84%
of working with the master
dowser, Hamish Miller and Paul

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:40.900 align:middle line:90%
Broadhurst.

00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And Hamish kindly has
forwarded some of my books.

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:46.900 align:middle line:90%
He's a truly remarkable dowser.

00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:50.530 align:middle line:84%
In the 1960s, John
Michell said that there

00:50:50.530 --> 00:50:54.550 align:middle line:84%
was a very famous ley
line going from the West

00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:58.870 align:middle line:84%
Coast in Cornwall, all
the way up to Hopton.

00:50:58.870 --> 00:51:00.460 align:middle line:90%
That's what he said.

00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And he said to Hamish and John,
why are you going dowsing,

00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.790 align:middle line:90%
guys?

00:51:03.790 --> 00:51:05.050 align:middle line:90%
And see what you get.

00:51:05.050 --> 00:51:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And they thought they'd get leys
aren't really that exciting.

00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:10.670 align:middle line:90%
They kind of expand and do this.

00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And then they sometimes
go into the ground.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.610 align:middle line:90%
So there they were dowsed.

00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And then they realized
they hit on a ley system.

00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:20.710 align:middle line:84%
So if you imagine that
there's the ley line

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:23.650 align:middle line:84%
and you've got a male
current entwined in it,

00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:26.650 align:middle line:84%
and then a female in
current entwining it,

00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:30.370 align:middle line:84%
you could see a symbol
or strand of DNA.

00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:32.590 align:middle line:90%
That's a ley system.

00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:34.750 align:middle line:90%
And they are very powerful.

00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:38.410 align:middle line:84%
You'll get the ley going through
the site as a carrier wave

00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:41.260 align:middle line:90%
almost, pushing the energy on.

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:45.200 align:middle line:84%
But the currents, that's what
the ancients were truly working

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.000 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Because in an environment
like Avebury or Stonehenge,

00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:52.540 align:middle line:84%
the ley line just hits
one, two features.

00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:56.290 align:middle line:84%
But these earth currents,
they hit every single feature

00:51:56.290 --> 00:51:58.840 align:middle line:90%
bathed in them in color.

00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Like I said earlier,
earth currents

00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:02.980 align:middle line:90%
have a dominant color frequency.

00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:06.600 align:middle line:84%
They're called the esoteric
colors of the earth.

00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:09.260 align:middle line:84%
You have the esoteric
colors of the sun.

00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:11.770 align:middle line:84%
So there's other colors
that the earth produces

00:52:11.770 --> 00:52:14.650 align:middle line:84%
that aren't on the
electromagnetic spectrum

00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:18.170 align:middle line:90%
from red through to violet.

00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Hamish called those two
currents Mary and Michael

00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:24.080 align:middle line:84%
mainly because they
have churches on them

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:25.940 align:middle line:90%
dedicated to Mary and Michael.

00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in
Egypt, I thought

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:30.230 align:middle line:84%
I would look for a
ley system over there

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:32.270 align:middle line:84%
because everybody else
just does the leys.

00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in Abydos
temple, for example,

00:52:36.810 --> 00:52:40.130 align:middle line:84%
you have this solar ley
line going right the way

00:52:40.130 --> 00:52:42.080 align:middle line:84%
through the axis
line of the church.

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:43.280 align:middle line:10%
That's done in yellow.

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:46.620 align:middle line:84%
There you've got another
crossing point of a blue ley.

00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:50.330 align:middle line:84%
You have three very
powerful currents

00:52:50.330 --> 00:52:52.670 align:middle line:84%
coursing through
the land in temple

00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:56.120 align:middle line:84%
after temple with
their energies.

00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:59.300 align:middle line:84%
They're affected by the
sun and the moon as well.

00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:03.290 align:middle line:84%
So you get the solar line
will be charged especially now

00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:07.190 align:middle line:84%
when yesterday was
midsummer's day, wasn't it?

00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:09.410 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people could
confuse midsummer's day

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:10.760 align:middle line:90%
with the summer solstice.

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:14.090 align:middle line:84%
People keep thinking it's in
the ground, it's earth energy.

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:15.500 align:middle line:90%
It must be in the ground.

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:17.180 align:middle line:90%
But it rises up.

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And we've used very
sensitive filters

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:23.870 align:middle line:84%
to try and find the
different frequencies

00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:25.760 align:middle line:90%
and the different colors.

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:28.670 align:middle line:10%
And it's interesting
to note that when

00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:35.150 align:middle line:10%
you look to famous dowsers, you
have for example, Isaac Newton.

00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:37.480 align:middle line:90%
He was a dowser.

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:43.860 align:middle line:84%
But one of the best dowsers,
unfortunately so, was Himmler.

00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And Himmler opened up
the dowsing academy

00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:51.700 align:middle line:90%
during the Second World War.

00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And in my family
archives, I've got

00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:56.620 align:middle line:84%
this wonderful photograph
of Himmler shaking

00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Hitler's hand, saying.
congratulations

00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:01.600 align:middle line:84%
on your dowsing
academy because they

00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:04.720 align:middle line:84%
were looking into how to
raise the frequencies,

00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:08.620 align:middle line:90%
probably for very dark purposes.

00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:11.410 align:middle line:84%
But they were
following and tracking

00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:14.170 align:middle line:90%
two very powerful frequencies.

00:54:14.170 --> 00:54:15.850 align:middle line:90%
They're opposite each other.

00:54:15.850 --> 00:54:18.760 align:middle line:84%
It's the white ray
and the red ray.

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's where they got the
colors for the Nazi flag from.

00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Because if you raise
these frequencies up,

00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:29.980 align:middle line:84%
it is said that you
can partly control

00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:32.480 align:middle line:90%
the whole of that ley system.

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:35.440 align:middle line:84%
So imagine that I'm right
in the bottom of Cornwall,

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:38.290 align:middle line:84%
and I'm manipulating
energies, I can influence

00:54:38.290 --> 00:54:41.050 align:middle line:90%
Hopton on the Norfolk coast.

00:54:41.050 --> 00:54:43.720 align:middle line:90%
That's the power of it in a way.

00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:48.270 align:middle line:10%
Wherever you are, you can
influence something else.

00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:50.510 align:middle line:84%
The German master
dowser that taught me

00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:53.780 align:middle line:84%
about the red and
the white frequency

00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:55.850 align:middle line:84%
said, we're going
to go to Stonehenge,

00:54:55.850 --> 00:55:00.450 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to raise
it by a factor of 15.

00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And he did it in a
particular manner.

00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:04.280 align:middle line:84%
He was a top German
master dowser.

00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:08.000 align:middle line:84%
He will always be
nameless because he

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.830 align:middle line:84%
has the most high-ranking
position in Europe, unelected

00:55:12.830 --> 00:55:13.730 align:middle line:90%
incidentally.

00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:17.240 align:middle line:84%
But he is a very
powerful dowser.

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:19.460 align:middle line:90%
So there we are at Stonehenge.

00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'm going to
raise it by the factor of 50.

00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:24.440 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And he said, and everybody that
isn't in harmony with our earth

00:55:27.850 --> 00:55:29.980 align:middle line:90%
current would dissipate.

00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:31.360 align:middle line:90%
But they do it naturally.

00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:33.340 align:middle line:90%
I thought this, I've got to see.

00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:35.320 align:middle line:90%
I like that little trick.

00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:36.310 align:middle line:90%
So he was there.

00:55:36.310 --> 00:55:39.790 align:middle line:10%
He deserved a particular
kind of right ritual,

00:55:39.790 --> 00:55:41.770 align:middle line:10%
and everybody laughed.

00:55:41.770 --> 00:55:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And then we were just
stood in Stonehenge

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:45.350 align:middle line:90%
watching all of this.

00:55:45.350 --> 00:55:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And then, my head
started ringing.

00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:49.510 align:middle line:90%
And I was thinking, wow.

00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:51.050 align:middle line:90%
I can't handle this either.

00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:52.690 align:middle line:90%
And I had to leave.

00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:55.360 align:middle line:84%
I just happened to be
talking to two ladies there.

00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh, I got a really
strange ringing in my head.

00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's what a lot of
people can do here today.

00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:06.910 align:middle line:84%
They can manipulate
these energies.

00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:09.670 align:middle line:84%
So I think when we
go to these sites,

00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:13.390 align:middle line:84%
tune in to see if you can
get the color frequency.

00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:15.380 align:middle line:90%
And it's so easy to do.

00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:19.330 align:middle line:84%
You just get a dowsing dial
and then you get a pendulum,

00:56:19.330 --> 00:56:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and you ask to be
shown the frequency.

00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:24.400 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
the Knights Templar

00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:25.990 align:middle line:90%
had their color frequencies.

00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:29.980 align:middle line:84%
The Nazis had their color
frequencies as well.

00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:35.030 align:middle line:84%
The British royals have
their color frequencies.

00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:40.940 align:middle line:84%
For example, whenever you
get the red and the white ray

00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:43.550 align:middle line:84%
of what the Germans
were looking for,

00:56:43.550 --> 00:56:45.740 align:middle line:90%
that's symbol of the warrior.

00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:47.960 align:middle line:84%
So when you go to some
ancient sites that

00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:51.500 align:middle line:84%
were associated with
war and warrior ship,

00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:53.930 align:middle line:90%
that's the color frequencies.

00:56:53.930 --> 00:56:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And when you go to
other sites that

00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:59.000 align:middle line:84%
have the frequency
of the white ray

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.960 align:middle line:84%
and the blue ray for example,
that's the healing frequency.

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you can
literally get healing.

00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And the Templars had
their encodements.

00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And so did other
societies as well.

00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:13.070 align:middle line:84%
They all have their
color encodement.

00:57:13.070 --> 00:57:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And the royals for
example, they will only

00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:21.650 align:middle line:84%
have a home or an ancient site
where they're inaugurated,

00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:24.140 align:middle line:90%
like Tara in Ireland.

00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:27.530 align:middle line:84%
The high kings went
there to be inaugurated.

00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:30.380 align:middle line:84%
Then you must have
the red, the white,

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:36.340 align:middle line:84%
and the blue, which is our
color encodement of our flags.

00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:41.680 align:middle line:84%
So I really feel as a
dowser, when we really

00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:44.320 align:middle line:84%
start to decode
ancient sites, we

00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:46.750 align:middle line:84%
can say what they
were being used for,

00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:50.620 align:middle line:84%
how to use them today,
and how they were probably

00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:54.910 align:middle line:84%
used in the past,
and by whom as well.

00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:57.280 align:middle line:84%
The natural thing
is, when you work

00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:00.940 align:middle line:84%
with these color frequencies for
example, if you're into healing

00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:04.390 align:middle line:84%
and you allow that
energy to literally come

00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:07.540 align:middle line:84%
through your being,
that will call you

00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:09.350 align:middle line:90%
in the healing frequencies.

00:58:09.350 --> 00:58:13.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's more than just
looking at lines on a map.

00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's more than just
looking at earth currents

00:58:16.210 --> 00:58:17.950 align:middle line:90%
in the ground.

00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And at particular
times of the year,

00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:23.260 align:middle line:84%
if it's a male
occurrence, like that's

00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:28.420 align:middle line:84%
a solar line with male
currents entwined in it,

00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:34.370 align:middle line:84%
they become active at particular
times of the eight-fold year,

00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:36.040 align:middle line:90%
which we've just had one.

00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:39.800 align:middle line:84%
The solstices, they
make the quarter days.

00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Then we have those
days in between.

00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:44.590 align:middle line:84%
For example, like
August the first,

00:58:44.590 --> 00:58:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Lammas, that's the next
portal day coming up.

00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Then we have Samhain,
Christianized to Halloween,

00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:56.260 align:middle line:84%
when in Druidry, the
ancestors are close,

00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:58.330 align:middle line:84%
and they can come
out of the ground.

00:58:58.330 --> 00:59:00.760 align:middle line:90%
And you can converse with them.

00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:03.550 align:middle line:90%
And Imbolc, February the first.

00:59:03.550 --> 00:59:07.870 align:middle line:84%
These are when these energies
are at their maximum.

00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's a sad fact is, when
everything's at its maximum

00:59:11.470 --> 00:59:14.230 align:middle line:84%
and you can really, really
become empowered by it,

00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:15.730 align:middle line:90%
Stonehenge is a free for all.

00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:16.810 align:middle line:90%
Anyone can enter.

00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's then, thousands
and thousands of people,

00:59:19.810 --> 00:59:21.850 align:middle line:90%
and it's pretty chaotic.

00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:24.460 align:middle line:84%
But if you go there
on those days,

00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:28.870 align:middle line:84%
you go to an ancient site on
one of those eight-fold days,

00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:33.220 align:middle line:84%
the veil is thinnest, and
then you can interact.

00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
feel, and then you

00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:38.050 align:middle line:90%
can walk around the monuments.

00:59:38.050 --> 00:59:41.980 align:middle line:84%
I believe that's how we
should try to reenact

00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:45.550 align:middle line:90%
how our ancestors were.

00:59:45.550 --> 00:59:49.900 align:middle line:84%
So when we have a recap on this
journey of going to Stonehenge,

00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:53.920 align:middle line:84%
Stonehenge isn't what you've
been shown in the past.

00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:55.810 align:middle line:90%
It really isn't.

00:59:55.810 --> 01:00:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Stonehenge, I found you lost
features of the lost Altar

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.500 align:middle line:90%
Stone, the trilithon.

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And there's many other
features besides that.

01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:09.310 align:middle line:10%
I've also shown you that
there's a mythical race,

01:00:09.310 --> 01:00:13.150 align:middle line:10%
a long-lost mythical race that
interacted with Stonehenge,

01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:16.220 align:middle line:10%
built phase one and phase two.

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:19.850 align:middle line:84%
The later phases of Stonehenge
were built by the much taller

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:21.020 align:middle line:90%
people.

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And the geology and the
archaeology fits that model.

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:31.140 align:middle line:84%
It's just we're not
told about that at all.

01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:34.370 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to be
wrapping up in a moment.

01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:36.470 align:middle line:10%
This is my new book
coming out soon.

01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:38.300 align:middle line:10%
It's going to be
out in September.

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:42.020 align:middle line:10%
It's got far more than what
we've discussed here today.

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:45.740 align:middle line:10%
It's going to be out, like
I said, probably September,

01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:50.000 align:middle line:10%
October because I'm taking earth
energies into the next level

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:50.870 align:middle line:10%
now.

01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:51.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm not only doing color.

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:55.430 align:middle line:84%
That's all my old research
of times gone as it were.

01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:59.090 align:middle line:10%
I found out every
single earth current can

01:00:59.090 --> 01:01:02.070 align:middle line:10%
produce a musical frequency.

01:01:02.070 --> 01:01:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And if you walk
around an ancient site

01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:07.190 align:middle line:84%
in a particular
manner, you're walking

01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:11.000 align:middle line:84%
in that musical harmonic
and becoming one with it.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And you can play musical
instruments to that harmonic.

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:20.030 align:middle line:84%
Also, I've discovered how we
can enhance food production

01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:23.210 align:middle line:84%
by living in harmony
with Gaia as well.

01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And my agricultural trials
are now two years on.

01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we can safely
say if we follow this model,

01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:35.120 align:middle line:84%
you can grow faster,
no chemicals,

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:40.010 align:middle line:84%
and be healthier for it because
we can learn from the past

01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:43.050 align:middle line:84%
and bring ancient
technology to the future.

01:01:43.050 --> 01:01:43.850 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:01:43.850 --> 01:01:46.600 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:52.000 align:middle line:90%
