00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you,
very, very perfect.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh, there Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Once again, my English is still
not better since yesterday,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.530 align:middle line:90%
but it's OK.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.330 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.759 align:middle line:84%
So in the '50s,
French ethnologists

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.280 align:middle line:84%
visited and studied a
tribe of Black people

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.740 align:middle line:84%
in Africa, in the
Republic of Mali.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.920 align:middle line:84%
The tribe is called
the Dogon tribe.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.330 align:middle line:10%
And the French
ethnologists, they

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.990 align:middle line:10%
observed that this tribe
celebrates every 50

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.900 align:middle line:10%
year a special festivity.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.880 align:middle line:10%
So the ethnologists asked
them, why only every 50 years?

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.490 align:middle line:10%
That's quite a long
period for a festivity.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.380 align:middle line:10%
I mean, not even
every generation

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.709 align:middle line:10%
can be part of this festivity.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:07.740 align:middle line:10%
And the Dogons, the priest
says to the ethnologist,

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.370 align:middle line:10%
we do this every 50
years because every 50

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:17.400 align:middle line:10%
years, an invisible star is
surrounding that star up there.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.930 align:middle line:10%
And they pointed to
our Sirius star system.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.770 align:middle line:10%
Every 50 years.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.270 align:middle line:10%
By the way, the
pictures you see are

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.110 align:middle line:10%
from the Dogon tribe in central
Africa, the Republic of Mali,

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.325 align:middle line:10%
the tribe I'm talking about.

00:01:29.325 --> 00:01:32.240 align:middle line:10%


00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.240 align:middle line:10%
So every 50 years, an invisible
star surrounds Sirius.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.190 align:middle line:10%
Now, the ethnologists
said, come on.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.850 align:middle line:10%
If the star is invisible,
you don't see it.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.700 align:middle line:10%
There's no reason
for your festivity.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.200 align:middle line:10%
They said, oh, yes, we know
it because our gods visited us

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.080 align:middle line:10%
from there, and
they told us that.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.620 align:middle line:10%
Now, the Dogon tribe not only
knew about this invisible star.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.380 align:middle line:10%
They had pictures,
cave paintings.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.960 align:middle line:10%
And there you show an eclipse--

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.390 align:middle line:10%
not the circle, an eclipse.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.770 align:middle line:10%
And down at the right corner
of the eclipse was Sirius.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.660 align:middle line:10%
They marked Sirius with a point.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.120 align:middle line:10%
And they said,
this invisible star

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.210 align:middle line:10%
is surrounding Sirius in
the form of an eclipse,

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.920 align:middle line:10%
and Sirius itself is always
right down at the right corner.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, modern astronomy knows
that Sirius is, in fact,

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.450 align:middle line:90%
a double star system.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.570 align:middle line:84%
The bright, shining Sirius
which everyone knows

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.990 align:middle line:84%
is called in astronomy
Sirius A. And there

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.310 align:middle line:84%
is an invisible star
called Sirius B. Sirius

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.010 align:middle line:90%
B is a so-called white dwarf.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.950 align:middle line:84%
You cannot see it
with your naked eye.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.560 align:middle line:90%
Now, the natives know about it.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Now another story with
this link to this story.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.130 align:middle line:10%
In South Africa are
ruins which you're

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.790 align:middle line:10%
seeing on our screen,
the ruins of Zimbabwe.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.820 align:middle line:10%
Zimbabwe was further
called Rhodesia,

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.700 align:middle line:10%
and now today it's an
own state, Zimbabwe.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.410 align:middle line:10%
And in Zimbabwe, they have
this ruin, ruin of an eclipse.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.030 align:middle line:10%
And down in the right
corner, they have a tower.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.650 align:middle line:10%
This ruin has no paintings,
no writings, nothing.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.630 align:middle line:10%
The ethnologists
of Zimbabwe have

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.900 align:middle line:10%
no idea who made
that ruin of Zimbabwe

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.090 align:middle line:10%
and what the symbolic is.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.270 align:middle line:10%
In the meantime, they learned
about the Dogon tribe,

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.270 align:middle line:10%
which are just their
neighbor in Africa.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.790 align:middle line:10%
And maybe this ruin shows
the star system of Sirius

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.260 align:middle line:10%
with down in the
right angle Sirius--

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.250 align:middle line:10%
Sirius is in the right angle,
and Sirius B, the invisible,

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.020 align:middle line:10%
is surrounding Sirius A in
that form of an eclipse.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, you cannot see Sirius B.
You cannot know that Sirius B

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.600 align:middle line:90%
makes an eclipse.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.200 align:middle line:84%
You cannot know that the star
Sirius is down in the right

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.170 align:middle line:90%
corner.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.590 align:middle line:90%
You see nothing of all this.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.700 align:middle line:10%
And they know this since
many, many generations.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.690 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.500 align:middle line:84%
For every festivity, their high
priests have different masks.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Every mask shows
different signs.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.030 align:middle line:90%
These signs are dates.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, they make their
festivity every 50 years.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.740 align:middle line:84%
So for every 50 years,
new masks are created.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.860 align:middle line:10%
At the end of the festivity,
they hang their masks

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.810 align:middle line:10%
on the central house.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.180 align:middle line:10%
Now, you simply have
to count the masks.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.610 align:middle line:10%
Every mask counts for 50 years--

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.860 align:middle line:10%
50, 100, 150, 200, et cetera.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.930 align:middle line:10%
And you know since
thousands of years,

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.410 align:middle line:10%
they have this knowledge
of Sirius B surrounding

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.740 align:middle line:10%
Sirius A with Sirius
down in the right corner.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And they absolutely
could not know it

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.480 align:middle line:90%
and see it by the naked eye.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And their information
is handed down them

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.670 align:middle line:84%
by a visitor from the
Sirius star system.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:05.820 align:middle line:90%
A mystery.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.510 align:middle line:10%
People really know somebody
has informed this tribe

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.710 align:middle line:10%
with a scientific message.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.930 align:middle line:10%
It's not just folklore
or something like this.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.000 align:middle line:10%
The next mystery which
does exist is from Greek.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.720 align:middle line:84%
It was on Easter
of the year 1900--

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:34.080 align:middle line:84%
1-9-0-0-0-- when Greek
divers that dive the sea from

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.220 align:middle line:84%
the island of Antikythera
in the Mediterranean Sea.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.990 align:middle line:10%
They found a 60-meter
deep wreck, an old ship.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.810 align:middle line:10%
Different objects were
brought to the surface,

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.170 align:middle line:10%
little statuettes and
gravestones and something

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:54.810 align:middle line:10%
which looked like a bigger
stone with some engravings on.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.450 align:middle line:90%
And that was in the year 1900.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.140 align:middle line:84%
This stone landed in the
National Museum of Athens,

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.130 align:middle line:84%
but not at expedition,
simply in the cellar.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Only 58 years later, a young
student of archeology--

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.350 align:middle line:90%
his name was Valerio Stais--

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.590 align:middle line:84%
found the stone in the
cellar of the museum

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.080 align:middle line:84%
with the certain
engraving in it.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And he asked himself,
what is this?

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And he found a writing
there on a paper

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.030 align:middle line:84%
that it was found
in the year 1900,

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.240 align:middle line:84%
60 meters deep in
the Mediterranean Sea

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.090 align:middle line:84%
before the island
of Antikythera.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Later, the same
student, Valerio Stais,

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:40.110 align:middle line:84%
became professor of archaeology
at the Yale University

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.550 align:middle line:90%
in New Haven in Connecticut.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:47.480 align:middle line:10%
He remembered the strange tone
and brought it to New Haven.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.290 align:middle line:10%
They checked it on the
magnifying glasses,

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.680 align:middle line:10%
and the effect was dramatically.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.420 align:middle line:84%
They found more than 80
cog wheels, some of them

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.620 align:middle line:84%
only visible under
the magnifying glass--

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.170 align:middle line:90%
very, very little.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:10.560 align:middle line:10%
And then on the
front and back side,

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:16.830 align:middle line:10%
microscopic inscriptions
with figures were found.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.400 align:middle line:10%
It turned out that they
gave the correct date

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.290 align:middle line:10%
of the planets in our solar
system, and this in relation

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:25.090 align:middle line:10%
to each other.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.990 align:middle line:84%
So, for example,
in what distance

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.770 align:middle line:90%
is Mars surrounding the Sun?

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And what is the distance
between Mars and Jupiter

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.550 align:middle line:84%
or Mars and Mercury at
what date of the year?

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, when Mars was there,
where was Jupiter in relation

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:44.880 align:middle line:90%
to Venus, for example?

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.530 align:middle line:10%
It was all on this
engraved stone.

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:54.450 align:middle line:10%
Professor Dr. Theodosis Tassios
from the National Technical

00:07:54.450 --> 00:08:00.300 align:middle line:10%
Museum of Athens
said, this mechanism

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.900 align:middle line:10%
is a computer, not
a digital computer,

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.870 align:middle line:10%
but an analog computer.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:10.440 align:middle line:10%
Now, 2,000 years or
more in the past,

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.850 align:middle line:10%
it was theoretically possible
to construct such a thing.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.980 align:middle line:10%
Our handicraft were
able to do such things.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.400 align:middle line:10%
But what is absolutely
not possible

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.130 align:middle line:10%
is the knowledge of the
dates of the planets

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:24.600 align:middle line:10%
in our solar system.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.150 align:middle line:10%
You know, Uranus,
Neptune, Pluto,

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:32.620 align:middle line:10%
these little planets were found
only 150 and 200 years ago.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.830 align:middle line:10%
How do they come across?

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:40.150 align:middle line:10%
And 80 cog wheels, you see them
only under a magnifying glass.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.809 align:middle line:10%
So we have absolutely
no idea where

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:47.190 align:middle line:10%
this mystery, the machine
of Antikythera, came from.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.880 align:middle line:10%
But they have the knowledge
of all the planets

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.590 align:middle line:10%
in our solar system.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Somebody must have
teached them in antiquity.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And this somebody must have
been an extraterrestrial.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.640 align:middle line:84%
In our own solar system,
we have no other forms

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.630 align:middle line:84%
of life, not intelligent
forms of life.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:07.980 align:middle line:84%
So it must have
come from outside.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.900 align:middle line:84%
The machine of Antikythera,
as it is called,

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:14.040 align:middle line:84%
can be seen today in
every detail, by the way,

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:18.240 align:middle line:84%
at the National Museum
of Athens in Greece.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.450 align:middle line:84%
When you ever go to Athens,
go to the National Museum.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And they show you the
computer in every detail,

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:27.960 align:middle line:84%
the machine of Antikythera,
more than 2,000 years

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.530 align:middle line:90%
or even older than that.

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:36.980 align:middle line:84%
The next impossibility
also comes from Turkey.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:41.870 align:middle line:84%
It was in the year
1929 in Istanbul.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Somebody cleaned up some
rubbish at the Topkapi Palace

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:52.130 align:middle line:84%
in Istanbul and found
an old map designed

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.320 align:middle line:90%
on the skin of an animal.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.080 align:middle line:10%
On the lower side
was an inscription

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:03.680 align:middle line:10%
which said, designed by Piri
Reis on April 7th of the year

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.680 align:middle line:10%
1513.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:12.070 align:middle line:10%
No one on this world
possesses a map like this.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.980 align:middle line:90%
Designed 1513?

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:18.010 align:middle line:84%
No one possesses
a map like this.

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:21.820 align:middle line:84%
It turned out that Piri
Reis was an admiral

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.710 align:middle line:90%
of the Turkish Marine.

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:26.020 align:middle line:10%
And on the back
side of the map, he

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.680 align:middle line:10%
wrote himself that
he designed this map

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.270 align:middle line:10%
on the basis of different
other old maps, which

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:38.180 align:middle line:10%
they made him a present at
the Library of Alexandria.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.290 align:middle line:10%
So there were different maps,
and Piri Reis, the admiral,

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:45.610 align:middle line:10%
composited out of different
maps the Piri Reis map.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:48.580 align:middle line:10%
The map was named the
Piri Reis map according

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.070 align:middle line:10%
to what is written in the back.

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:55.510 align:middle line:10%
Now, professor Dr. Charles
Hapgood, a US geographer,

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:59.500 align:middle line:10%
studied it closer and
was completely shocked.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:07.568 align:middle line:10%
What we see on the upper side
here, you see parts of Spain.

00:11:07.568 --> 00:11:09.110 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't help that
lately you can't

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:10.820 align:middle line:10%
see nothing, parts of Spain.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.320 align:middle line:10%
Then you see Gibraltar.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.360 align:middle line:10%
Then you see part
of Africa here.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.360 align:middle line:10%
But what's down,
completely down?

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.710 align:middle line:84%
The coastline of the
Antarctic is on the map.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.860 align:middle line:84%
But the Antarctic existed
thousands of years

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.440 align:middle line:90%
on the thick ice and snow.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And not only the coastline
of the Antarctic,

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.960 align:middle line:84%
several little islands
are there on the map.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And all these islands
in the correct position

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.450 align:middle line:90%
compared with today.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:41.180 align:middle line:10%
Professor Dr. Charles
Hapgood made it clear.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:44.510 align:middle line:10%
You see the grid here, and
he mapped it and compared it

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:45.800 align:middle line:10%
to today.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.980 align:middle line:10%
And he said, professor
Dr. Charles Hapgood--

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.530 align:middle line:10%
I quote-- "The coast
lines must have

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:56.420 align:middle line:10%
been designed before the
ice covered the land."

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:01.160 align:middle line:10%
The ice there is today
approximately 1 mile thick.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.660 align:middle line:10%
We have no idea how
this is possible.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:10.010 align:middle line:10%
Somebody cartographed the
coastline of the Antarctic,

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:13.790 align:middle line:10%
including the little islands
before the coastline.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And they all are in the correct
position compared with today.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:23.900 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely impossible.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, today, they made the
suggestions that the Antarctic

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.620 align:middle line:84%
must have been free of ice--
we don't know how many ten

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.090 align:middle line:90%
or hundred thousand years ago--

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:36.880 align:middle line:84%
and some cartographer
made a design on it.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.320 align:middle line:90%
But we cannot understand it.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.130 align:middle line:84%
According to our evolution,
some more than 10,000,

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:45.910 align:middle line:84%
20,000 years ago or even
more, there was no human.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Or somebody made a photograph
from a satellite taken

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.130 align:middle line:84%
over Cairo and give a
picture or a copy of it

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:57.550 align:middle line:84%
to one of his ancestors,
to a king as a gift.

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And this king
maybe made the map,

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.080 align:middle line:84%
and today we have
the map of Piri Reis

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.360 align:middle line:84%
with the coastline
of the Antarctic,

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.152 align:middle line:90%
which nobody can explain.

00:13:07.152 --> 00:13:09.510 align:middle line:90%
A mystery still existing.

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.930 align:middle line:84%
These are facts which
you can control.

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:14.490 align:middle line:84%
By the way, when
you go to Turkey,

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:17.280 align:middle line:84%
you still find that
in the Topkapi Palace,

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.240 align:middle line:84%
you can see the original
of the Piri Reis map.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.760 align:middle line:84%
The next mystery comes
from South America.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:30.170 align:middle line:84%
There in the high Andes
of the Sierra Nevada,

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:34.920 align:middle line:90%
this is Colombia today.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Professor Dr. Alvaro Soto
from the University of Bogota

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:45.150 align:middle line:84%
found 1,300 meters high in the
jungle the ruins of a city.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, most of you have
probably been once in Peru,

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.600 align:middle line:84%
and you have visited the
stories Machu Picchu,

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.090 align:middle line:84%
Machu Picchu with its
terraces in the jungle.

00:13:54.090 --> 00:14:00.420 align:middle line:84%
This here is 10 times bigger
than Machu Picchu in the jungle

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.040 align:middle line:90%
of the Sierra Nevada.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.830 align:middle line:10%
So if you come from
the Caribbean Sea,

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.630 align:middle line:10%
Santa Marta is the city.

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.090 align:middle line:10%
You could fly by
helicopter in there.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.580 align:middle line:84%
They flew me by
helicopter in there.

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.250 align:middle line:10%
Then if you wish to
go there personally,

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:17.100 align:middle line:10%
you can all fly, which
they do not accept anymore,

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.710 align:middle line:10%
or you can take a
mule or a horse.

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:23.430 align:middle line:10%
It takes you a six days
ride before you are there.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:26.340 align:middle line:10%
I photographed this 20
years ago or a little more,

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.170 align:middle line:10%
and wherever I look-- to
the right, to the left--

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:30.430 align:middle line:10%
it doesn't matter.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:36.450 align:middle line:10%
It's all terraces, platforms,
up of you, down of you,

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.350 align:middle line:10%
on the right side,
on the left side.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.380 align:middle line:10%
It never ends.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.750 align:middle line:10%
Roughly 450 years ago,
the Spanish conquerors

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.780 align:middle line:10%
fight against a tribe
who was living here.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:51.990 align:middle line:10%
The tribe was called the Kagaba.

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:55.350 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the Kagaba lost,
but some of them survived.

00:14:55.350 --> 00:15:00.180 align:middle line:10%
And they are still there
today, the tribe of the Kagaba.

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:03.670 align:middle line:10%
Now, look at the
picture in the jungle.

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.010 align:middle line:10%
Everywhere are ruins.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:09.340 align:middle line:10%
The jungle is full with it, and
it's not known to the public.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:13.120 align:middle line:90%


00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.690 align:middle line:84%
The Kagaba have
their creation story,

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:19.000 align:middle line:84%
and they say the
Kagaba-- also named Kogi.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.010 align:middle line:90%
Kogi, Kagaba, it's the same.

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:26.320 align:middle line:10%
They say not the high priest
descended from the sky

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.330 align:middle line:10%
after a great flood.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.790 align:middle line:10%
There was a flood,
a worldwide flood.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:33.830 align:middle line:10%
The high priest left the Earth.

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:37.640 align:middle line:10%
And after the water went
back, the high priest

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.510 align:middle line:10%
descended from the skies.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Funny, the same situation
or the same tradition

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:47.200 align:middle line:84%
we find in the
Sumerian cuneiform.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.020 align:middle line:84%
There it is written
after the flood,

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:53.600 align:middle line:84%
the gods descended
again from the sky.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.420 align:middle line:84%
The Kagaba or the
Kogi, they call

00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:00.110 align:middle line:90%
themselves the older brothers.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:01.100 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:06.290 align:middle line:84%
We, the normal humans,
are the younger brothers.

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:09.560 align:middle line:84%
The high priest
is called "Mama."

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And still today, he says
he stands in contact

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:16.790 align:middle line:84%
with the teachers
from this time.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Still today, the
high priests says

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:21.200 align:middle line:84%
he stands in
telepathically contact

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.530 align:middle line:90%
with the gods from antiquity.

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:29.270 align:middle line:84%
In their eyes, everything is
living, not only the humans

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:32.990 align:middle line:84%
and the animals, but
also every object.

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Not only every
plant, every stone

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.920 align:middle line:84%
has a form of life
in their eyes.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.900 align:middle line:90%


00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.770 align:middle line:84%
They built their
houses, and the houses

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:48.670 align:middle line:90%
has nine different platforms.

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:52.270 align:middle line:10%
Four platforms are above
us, four beneath us,

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:55.720 align:middle line:10%
and we are living on
the fifth platform.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, they construct
their houses still today

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:02.640 align:middle line:84%
in the form of an
egg, see like this.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:06.000 align:middle line:10%
They know exactly the
tradition concerning

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.569 align:middle line:10%
the great flood as we know it,
I said before, from the Bible.

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:12.359 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Kagaba or the Kogi,

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:16.859 align:middle line:84%
the whole universe has this
form, this form of an egg,

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:18.450 align:middle line:90%
containing nine levels.

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:21.660 align:middle line:84%
Four levels exist over
us, four levels under us.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.730 align:middle line:10%
And our solar system
is on the fifth level.

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:27.750 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, their
houses are constructed

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:30.590 align:middle line:10%
in the form of an egg.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:35.390 align:middle line:10%
There is the house of the
man and across the house

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:36.740 align:middle line:10%
of the woman.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:43.160 align:middle line:10%
Out of the roof ridge, two cross
beams like this are coming out.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:47.630 align:middle line:10%
And out of the man's
house, one big pillar.

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:52.190 align:middle line:10%
Now, exactly every
year on March 21,

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:56.960 align:middle line:10%
a long shadow enters into the
crushed shadow from the man's

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.140 align:middle line:10%
house to the woman's
house which says

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:03.020 align:middle line:10%
the shadow from the
man's house enters

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.240 align:middle line:10%
into the shadow of
the woman's house

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:09.890 align:middle line:10%
on March 21, which
means it is spring.

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:14.010 align:middle line:10%
It is time to put the
seeds into the earth.

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Still today, the Kagaba
practice astronomy.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Naturally, they are
convinced that the gods one

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:24.840 align:middle line:90%
day will return.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:30.630 align:middle line:84%
Still today, the high priest
says the gods will return soon.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:33.540 align:middle line:84%
I hear something similar
from the Hopi Indians

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.890 align:middle line:90%
in North America.

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:37.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if this is true,
but here from the Kagaba,

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:38.820 align:middle line:90%
we know it.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:41.160 align:middle line:84%
The gods who visited
our forefathers,

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.290 align:middle line:84%
and the high priest is still in
telepathic contact with them,

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:48.330 align:middle line:84%
said they are on the way
back to our solar system,

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:51.420 align:middle line:84%
and they will show
up sooner or later.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:56.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the old story
of returning of the gods.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:01.800 align:middle line:10%
Every culture expects
the god of returning.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Religion has made
out religion of it.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.600 align:middle line:84%
For example, we are
educated as Christians.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.510 align:middle line:84%
We believe one day
Jesus will return.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:12.480 align:middle line:84%
But the Jewish community
is educated as Jewish.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.060 align:middle line:84%
They believe one day
the messiahs are coming.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.220 align:middle line:84%
The Muslim societies
educated as Muslim,

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:20.040 align:middle line:84%
they believe one
day Mahdi is coming.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Now different dates,
different time.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:27.060 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sorry, honestly, not
every religion can be right.

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.800 align:middle line:90%
Some of them must be wrong.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.570 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, they are all wrong.

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:35.040 align:middle line:10%
Neither Jesus nor Mahdi or
another thing will return.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.870 align:middle line:10%
But extraterrestrials
will return.

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:40.000 align:middle line:10%
They were here some
thousands of years ago.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, the distances between
one star and the other

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:43.890 align:middle line:90%
are measured in light years.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:47.322 align:middle line:84%
You cannot just move over there
and return the next morning.

00:19:47.322 --> 00:19:48.780 align:middle line:84%
So between one
visit and the other,

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:51.670 align:middle line:84%
there are always some
thousands of years.

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:54.240 align:middle line:84%
That's why before they
left last time, when

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.460 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrials
were here, they promised

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.170 align:middle line:90%
to return in the far future.

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:03.000 align:middle line:84%
This promise of returning has
entered into every religion--

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.120 align:middle line:84%
not only into every
religion, into every culture

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.040 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:12.750 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you remember roughly 450
years ago, Francisco Pizarro.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Francisco Pizarro was
a Spanish conqueror.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:20.790 align:middle line:84%
He found South America,
the tribe of the Inca.

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:23.430 align:middle line:84%
When he showed up with
his ship, the Inca

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:26.370 align:middle line:84%
believed that Francisco
Pizarro, the Spanish,

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:29.370 align:middle line:84%
is the returned the
long-awaited god.

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:31.110 align:middle line:84%
They all fell down
on the ground.

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:32.370 align:middle line:10%
They worshiped him.

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:33.870 align:middle line:84%
Of course, he was
simply a human,

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:36.810 align:middle line:84%
but they believed it
is their awaited god.

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:39.090 align:middle line:84%
The same thing in
Central America.

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Hernan Cortez, the
Spanish conqueror,

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:44.130 align:middle line:84%
came to Central America
for the first time.

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:47.430 align:middle line:84%
There was a kingdom,
Moctezuma, the Aztecs.

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Even the king of the
Aztecs, Moctezuma himself,

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:51.990 align:middle line:90%
fell down on the ground.

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:middle line:84%
He believed that the
Spanish conqueror

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.430 align:middle line:90%
is the long-awaited god.

00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:02.620 align:middle line:84%
Go away, for example, to a
faraway island like Hawaii.

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:06.530 align:middle line:84%
James Cook, British explorer,
came for the first time

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:07.330 align:middle line:90%
to Hawaii.

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:08.260 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.240 align:middle line:84%
The natives all
fell on the ground.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.750 align:middle line:84%
They believed that James Cook
was the long-awaited god.

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:15.100 align:middle line:90%
Always the same thing.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:19.960 align:middle line:84%
Every culture worldwide knows
about the returning of the god

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.470 align:middle line:84%
because they promised long time
ago that in the far future,

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.860 align:middle line:90%
they will return.

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And they are still waiting
for the so-called god.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Now I can tell you a story
which is absolutely sensational,

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:39.190 align:middle line:84%
I think, and which I
am the only one who

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:41.740 align:middle line:84%
has the pictures because I
made these pictures roughly

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:45.320 align:middle line:90%
45 years ago.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:51.320 align:middle line:84%
In the upper Amazon River is
a tribe called the Kayapo.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:55.160 align:middle line:10%
And the Kayapo has, every
year, a special festivity.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.440 align:middle line:10%
They dress like this.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:01.010 align:middle line:10%
Only the high priest
dresses like this.

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:05.210 align:middle line:10%
The rest of the tribe makes
a ring around this man,

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:08.240 align:middle line:10%
and they dance around
this dressed man.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:14.590 align:middle line:10%
While they dance around,
they sing their story.

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:17.530 align:middle line:10%
Long, long time
ago, they said there

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:21.760 align:middle line:10%
was a certain noise in the sky,
and the bright shining light

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.680 align:middle line:10%
was coming down.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.730 align:middle line:10%
They were afraid.

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:27.130 align:middle line:10%
They run away into their caves.

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:31.690 align:middle line:10%
Then it became quiet, and
they came out of the caves,

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:36.940 align:middle line:10%
and they saw in the center of
the place was a strange being.

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:40.850 align:middle line:10%
The strange being was dressed in
a-- he was covered completely.

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:46.150 align:middle line:10%
He had no openings for
eyes, mouth, ears, nothing.

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:48.110 align:middle line:10%
In the beginning, they
were afraid of it.

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:51.700 align:middle line:10%
The stranger turned always
himself around his own axis

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:56.440 align:middle line:10%
and gave some goodies away,
sweet stuff to the natives.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:01.100 align:middle line:10%
So they were not afraid anymore,
and they came closer to it.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.890 align:middle line:10%
It took only three days.

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:07.690 align:middle line:10%
And the stranger spoke the
language of the natives.

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And the stranger explained
his name is Bep Kororoti.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.470 align:middle line:10%
And Bep Kororoti
in their language

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:18.460 align:middle line:10%
means "I'm coming
from the firmament."

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:21.760 align:middle line:10%
Bep Kororoti only lived
a few weeks among them,

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.350 align:middle line:10%
and nobody could touch him
except his dress outside.

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:30.970 align:middle line:10%
But nobody ever saw his
skin, his face directly.

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:33.160 align:middle line:10%
He never eat something.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.320 align:middle line:10%
He teach them in astronomy.

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.380 align:middle line:10%
This so-called Stone
Age tribe knows exactly

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:41.230 align:middle line:10%
about our solar system,
about the planets

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:45.400 align:middle line:10%
surrounding the Sun, in
which distance, et cetera.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.940 align:middle line:10%
He said he teached them also
not only in astronomy, but also

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:52.870 align:middle line:10%
in agriculture and
in practical things.

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:56.830 align:middle line:84%
He showed them
what kind of plants

00:23:56.830 --> 00:24:00.250 align:middle line:90%
were used to store their meat.

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:03.120 align:middle line:90%


00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And then one day he
said he will leave now,

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:08.040 align:middle line:84%
but he will return
in the far future,

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.880 align:middle line:84%
that they should
never forget it.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And in order to not forget
this visit of Bep Kororoti,

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:18.030 align:middle line:84%
they make this dance
still every year.

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:18.900 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm sorry.

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.620 align:middle line:90%
Here we have a proof.

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:26.760 align:middle line:10%
This is a natural tribe in the
upper Amazon River, no contact

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:30.150 align:middle line:10%
with society, nowhere.

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:33.780 align:middle line:84%
At that time, when I filmed
it, they had no radio.

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:37.560 align:middle line:84%
There was no television,
no [GERMAN],, nothing.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:41.380 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, they have
some trousers on and so,

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.780 align:middle line:84%
so-called primitive
Stone Age tribe.

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And since thousands
of year, they

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.490 align:middle line:84%
make their festivity
with their dress

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:50.920 align:middle line:90%
of their teacher from the sky.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:54.070 align:middle line:90%
What do we want more?

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:57.310 align:middle line:90%
What does our society want more?

00:24:57.310 --> 00:25:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Our astronomers, I adore them,
brilliant people, astrophysics.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:05.290 align:middle line:84%
But they don't know
nothing about these things.

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:07.330 align:middle line:90%
They have no idea.

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:11.620 align:middle line:84%
They are looking for microscopic
shells and stuff in meteorites,

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:14.350 align:middle line:84%
and they are not
opening their eyes.

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:17.770 align:middle line:84%
We have proof that
extraterrestrials were here.

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:19.120 align:middle line:90%
And I say we have--

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.390 align:middle line:84%
not just speculation,
curiosities.

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:25.422 align:middle line:84%
We know what we are
talking, and I especially

00:25:25.422 --> 00:25:26.380 align:middle line:90%
know what I am talking.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:29.470 align:middle line:84%
I have published 45
books on this subject.

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:31.000 align:middle line:90%
I know what's going on.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.370 align:middle line:84%
But our brilliant astronomers
are not interested.

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:34.270 align:middle line:90%
This cannot be.

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:35.440 align:middle line:90%
This is impossible.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrials
could never visit us.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.910 align:middle line:84%
The distances are too big, or
they don't look like humans.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:44.230 align:middle line:84%
They have no idea
what is going on.

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the distances
are large between one star

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:48.400 align:middle line:90%
and another.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.640 align:middle line:84%
But it is easy to
reach these distances.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:55.910 align:middle line:84%
Look, everyone here knows
the American space shuttle.

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Remember this machine
which you go up.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:03.210 align:middle line:84%
With every lift up, you
transport 50 tons, 50 tons

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:05.410 align:middle line:90%
to an orbit around the Earth--

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:07.000 align:middle line:90%
roughly 30 tons.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's a question of money,
if you start every four months

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:13.060 align:middle line:84%
or if you start
practically every week.

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.670 align:middle line:84%
If we have 5 or 10
machines, space shuttle,

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:16.900 align:middle line:90%
you will start every week.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:21.190 align:middle line:84%
That means every week, you
transport 30 tons in an orbit.

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:25.880 align:middle line:84%
You put all this material
together to a gigantic circle.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.400 align:middle line:90%
It has to be a circle.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.390 align:middle line:90%
A circle is finished.

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:30.640 align:middle line:84%
You turn the circle
around its own axis.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.740 align:middle line:84%
By turning the circle
around its own axis,

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:37.290 align:middle line:84%
you create gravity inside
by that centrifugal force.

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:39.130 align:middle line:90%
So you don't swim around there.

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And then the circle, you have
to have an engine in the center,

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:46.360 align:middle line:84%
and you simply start,
slowly, with only 2%

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.870 align:middle line:90%
of the speed of light.

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Nothing like over
speed of light.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.945 align:middle line:84%
Nothing like hocus pocus
or mysteries, just 2%

00:26:52.945 --> 00:26:54.790 align:middle line:90%
of the speed of light.

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:56.830 align:middle line:84%
With 2% of the
speed of light, you

00:26:56.830 --> 00:27:01.480 align:middle line:84%
would reach the distance of 10
years within 500 human years.

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.770 align:middle line:90%
They say 500 human years?

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:04.420 align:middle line:90%
Nobody will survive this.

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Of course not, but parents think
it's a generation spaceship.

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:11.240 align:middle line:90%
The parents make children.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.720 align:middle line:90%
The childrens make children.

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.870 align:middle line:84%
The grandchildren make
children, et cetera.

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:18.350 align:middle line:84%
So after 500 years, you
reach another solar system.

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:19.730 align:middle line:84%
There you look
for a planet which

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:23.060 align:middle line:90%
is similar to our Earth planet.

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.920 align:middle line:84%
10 years ago, we
believe that the Earth

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.570 align:middle line:90%
is unique in the universe.

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:27.950 align:middle line:90%
Only we have water.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:30.170 align:middle line:84%
Only we have the
right temperature--

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:31.280 align:middle line:90%
not too hot, not too cold.

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.990 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, we
know the universe

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:35.270 align:middle line:90%
is full of Earth-like planets.

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:36.890 align:middle line:84%
So you reach an
Earth-like planets

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:38.960 align:middle line:90%
after 500 years of travel.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Now you give to the
crew, which is sent down

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:44.420 align:middle line:84%
to the new detected
planet, you give them

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:48.170 align:middle line:84%
another 500 years to develop
an industrial society.

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:51.710 align:middle line:84%
So 500 years on
the way, 500 years

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:55.140 align:middle line:84%
to develop an
industrial society.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.430 align:middle line:84%
They should develop
an industrial society.

00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:58.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:03.970 align:middle line:84%
How long or how old is
our industrial society,

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:09.400 align:middle line:84%
our engines, 150 years,
200 years, 250 years?

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And we had to create to work
everything out of evolution,

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:14.970 align:middle line:90%
evolution of technology.

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Our forefathers had
to learn every detail

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.140 align:middle line:90%
before we have our industries.

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Here, in that
example, they don't

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:22.950 align:middle line:90%
have to start at the beginning.

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:25.950 align:middle line:84%
The travelers from
the spaceship know it.

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:30.720 align:middle line:10%
They tell them how machines
work, what kind of raw material

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.330 align:middle line:10%
you use, where you can
find the raw material.

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:36.600 align:middle line:84%
You give them 500 years
for an industrial society.

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.900 align:middle line:84%
After 500 years, they
would be able to construct

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:41.700 align:middle line:90%
their own spaceship.

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Now you have two spaceships,
the old one with which they

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.370 align:middle line:84%
arrived, and the second one,
the new one, which they made.

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And this new one starts again,
and this, again, 500 years

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.000 align:middle line:90%
on the way.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And again another 500 years to
create an industrial society

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:57.300 align:middle line:90%
far away.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:02.230 align:middle line:84%
With expanding of only
2% of the speed of light,

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:06.220 align:middle line:84%
you would create
intelligent forms of life

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:12.190 align:middle line:84%
in our Milky Way completely
within 10 millions of years.

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:13.790 align:middle line:84%
You think 10 millions
of years is big?

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:14.590 align:middle line:90%
Forget it.

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:15.820 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Our universe is billions
and billions of years old.

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:19.030 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing.

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.730 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- not
even a thousandth

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:24.100 align:middle line:90%
of the date of the universe.

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:25.730 align:middle line:90%
Everything is possible.

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:26.920 align:middle line:90%
There are no breaks.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.220 align:middle line:90%
This is impossible.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:29.530 align:middle line:90%
We cannot do it.

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:32.010 align:middle line:90%
Of course you can do it.

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Another story, about 2,500
years ago, roughly 500

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.890 align:middle line:84%
BC, the Greek historian
Herodotus was in Egypt.

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:43.470 align:middle line:84%
He has written two
books about Egypt.

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And in his second
book of history,

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:52.840 align:middle line:84%
he says the high priest showed
him 251 statues on the road,

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:53.640 align:middle line:90%
on a boulevard.

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:58.920 align:middle line:84%
The high priest and Herodotus
were working, 241 statues.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And the high priest said
to every statue a story.

00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Who was his name, when he was
living, from what to what.

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:09.090 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the boulevard, the
high priest said to Herodotus,

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:16.840 align:middle line:84%
these 241 statues
represent 11,340 years.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.180 align:middle line:84%
At that time, the
high priest said,

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:22.240 align:middle line:84%
the gods from the firmament
were among the humans.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Since that time, the
gods have not returned.

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:28.840 align:middle line:84%
If you want to control this,
take Herodotus second book

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:32.860 align:middle line:90%
of history, chapter 140, 141.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:38.440 align:middle line:84%
He says 11,340 years ago,
the gods from the firmament

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.360 align:middle line:90%
were living among the humans.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Since that time, they
have not returned.

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, Herodotus made this
statement, seen from today,

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:48.740 align:middle line:90%
2,500 years ago.

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:53.710 align:middle line:84%
So to the 11,340 years, we
have to add 2,500 years.

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:58.210 align:middle line:84%
So roughly 14,000
years ago, it all

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:02.200 align:middle line:84%
happened that the gods
were among the humans.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And Herodotus also says in
his second book of history

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.970 align:middle line:84%
that deep under the pyramid,
the plateau of the pyramids,

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:12.090 align:middle line:90%
there is a lake.

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And under the lake,
covered by the water,

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:18.610 align:middle line:90%
is a black sarcophagi.

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:21.790 align:middle line:84%
Our ethnologists and
archaeologists from Egypt,

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:24.430 align:middle line:84%
they never took
Herodotus' word for true.

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:27.670 align:middle line:84%
They say, what is
he talking about?

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:31.450 align:middle line:84%
11,340 years, this
is all nonsense.

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:35.080 align:middle line:84%
The history of old Egypt
is, if we take it very high,

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:39.520 align:middle line:84%
2500 BC, maybe 3000
BC, but not 11,340.

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.530 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And the sarcophagi, a
lake under the pyramid,

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:47.020 align:middle line:84%
that's all rubbish,
says our Egyptologist.

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.320 align:middle line:90%
Does not exist.

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Some years ago, I read a short
article in a Swiss newspaper

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:58.440 align:middle line:84%
that archaeologists
discovered under the pyramid

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:01.590 align:middle line:84%
on the pyramid plateau,
in fact, a lake.

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:03.570 align:middle line:84%
That was just a short
message, and then we

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:06.030 align:middle line:90%
hear nothing anymore.

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:10.380 align:middle line:84%
Of course, Ramón, my secretary,
and I, we went down to Egypt.

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Don't ask me how much money
I paid for the baksheesh,

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:14.650 align:middle line:90%
for the professors.

00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:15.450 align:middle line:90%
We simply paid.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:18.390 align:middle line:90%
I said, I want to go down there.

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:21.720 align:middle line:84%
If this story is true,
I want to know it.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.970 align:middle line:84%
I want to bring
the pictures there.

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Ramón
and I were down.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:30.010 align:middle line:90%
I show it to you.

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:32.190 align:middle line:10%
The entrance is not
under the pyramid.

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:33.480 align:middle line:10%
It's on the pyramid plateau.

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:39.390 align:middle line:10%
You enter up here,
through this room.

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:44.880 align:middle line:10%
From that situation, you go--
there is one small ladder, only

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:45.960 align:middle line:10%
2 and 1/2 meter.

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.880 align:middle line:10%
You enter into a room.

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:52.590 align:middle line:10%
And from that room, you have
a shaft right down, deep down.

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:55.230 align:middle line:10%
But the shaft-- you
see this shaft here--

00:32:55.230 --> 00:33:00.570 align:middle line:10%
is so large that it has room
for two ladders going down.

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:01.500 align:middle line:10%
We shall see them.

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:04.594 align:middle line:90%


00:33:04.594 --> 00:33:06.810 align:middle line:10%
You came to another room.

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:09.690 align:middle line:10%
You have to go
down on your knees.

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:12.930 align:middle line:10%
And then you enter
into this room.

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:20.380 align:middle line:10%
And in the room are seven
niches cut out of the wall.

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:24.030 align:middle line:10%
But only in two
niches are sarcophagi.

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:29.150 align:middle line:10%
This one is black basalt.
There are no black basalt,

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:31.517 align:middle line:10%
which is volcanic rock, nearby.

00:33:31.517 --> 00:33:33.350 align:middle line:10%
They must have transported
it from far away.

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:34.150 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:35.840 align:middle line:10%
Why do they use black basalt?

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:40.050 align:middle line:10%
The next sarcophagi is
made out of granite.

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:42.810 align:middle line:10%
Egyptologists told me
here when they found it,

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:45.150 align:middle line:10%
the sarcophagi were empty.

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:50.380 align:middle line:10%
I don't believe it, but they
were empty when I came down.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:53.850 align:middle line:10%
Now, from this point,
another shaft goes down.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:56.460 align:middle line:10%
And you will see this
second shaft is not

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.020 align:middle line:10%
the same one as before.

00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.090 align:middle line:10%
Before, we had two ladders.

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:03.960 align:middle line:10%
And you see now that's another
half, only one ladder going

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:04.830 align:middle line:10%
down.

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:10.530 align:middle line:10%
Now you have 52 meters in
the rock under the pyramids.

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:12.000 align:middle line:10%
Imagine that.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.949 align:middle line:10%
Oh, you want the pyramids.

00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:16.080 align:middle line:10%
Again, you have to
go onto your knees.

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:20.580 align:middle line:10%
You have to crawl
to the next room.

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:23.610 align:middle line:10%
And there you see, all
of a sudden, water.

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:24.870 align:middle line:10%
It's not a sea.

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:28.949 align:middle line:10%
It's a pond of water here.

00:34:28.949 --> 00:34:30.587 align:middle line:10%
Now, we had, of
course, our flashlight.

00:34:30.587 --> 00:34:32.670 align:middle line:10%
But you cannot use the
flashlights because as soon

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:35.639 align:middle line:10%
as we used the flashlight, the
reflection was so strong that

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:37.190 align:middle line:10%
you could see nothing anymore.

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:40.020 align:middle line:10%


00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:43.860 align:middle line:10%
Now, finally we realized
that, in fact, in the water,

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:50.250 align:middle line:10%
you see slowly coming up
the corners of a sarcophagus

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:51.539 align:middle line:10%
covered by water.

00:34:51.539 --> 00:34:54.159 align:middle line:10%


00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:56.630 align:middle line:10%
Here is here.

00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:59.570 align:middle line:10%
They, archeologists today,
they have taken the lid off.

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:04.250 align:middle line:10%
And these two wooden
pieces are part of today,

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:06.140 align:middle line:10%
not from antiquity.

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:09.470 align:middle line:10%
Now you see the sarcophagi
in the water covered by water

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:14.020 align:middle line:10%
under the pyramid of
the pyramid plateau.

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:16.000 align:middle line:10%
And the water is groundwater.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.160 align:middle line:10%
And it was already
there because you are

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:21.110 align:middle line:10%
a deeper level than the Nile.

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:22.690 align:middle line:10%
This groundwater
was already there

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:25.160 align:middle line:10%
when somebody constructed it.

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.730 align:middle line:10%
Who made something
like this thousands

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:29.810 align:middle line:10%
of years ago under the pyramid?

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:31.930 align:middle line:10%
The pyramid is a secret already.

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:34.510 align:middle line:10%
Why another secret
under the Great Pyramid?

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:37.200 align:middle line:10%


00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.420 align:middle line:10%
We have no answer.

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:41.690 align:middle line:10%
You see the sarcophagi?

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:44.565 align:middle line:10%
Now a friend of mine who works
there is an Egyptologist.

00:35:44.565 --> 00:35:45.440 align:middle line:10%
He called me one day.

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:49.400 align:middle line:10%
He said, Erich, we will
try to put the water

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.710 align:middle line:10%
pumps on to push the water out,
but only for a few minutes.

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:56.270 align:middle line:10%
As soon as the pumps stop,
the water flows back.

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:58.790 align:middle line:10%
So I had the chance to
be there in a situation

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:00.710 align:middle line:10%
when the water was not there.

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:04.970 align:middle line:10%
You see how precise
this sarcophagi is cut?

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:09.860 align:middle line:10%
Again, here they told me it was
nothing inside the sarcophagi.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:12.900 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if
this is true or not.

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.710 align:middle line:10%
But the question remains high.

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:19.580 align:middle line:10%
We are on the plateau of
the pyramids in Egypt.

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:22.880 align:middle line:10%
There are these gigantic
buildings over us.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.700 align:middle line:10%
Why, for heaven's
sake, is somebody

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:30.230 align:middle line:10%
making, deep under this
plateau, other mysteries?

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And there are more shafts
and tunnels, which we know.

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Some of these shafts
and tunnels are

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:39.210 align:middle line:84%
so small that not even a boy,
a child could go in there.

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:41.480 align:middle line:90%
So what is down there?

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:45.010 align:middle line:90%
What continues?

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:47.560 align:middle line:10%
1,200 years ago,
and a little later,

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:49.090 align:middle line:10%
there were Egyptian writers--

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:53.290 align:middle line:10%
al Macritchie, Ibrahim Abdul
al Macritchie-- he wrote,

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:55.570 align:middle line:10%
inside the pyramids
and under the pyramids

00:36:55.570 --> 00:37:01.310 align:middle line:10%
are gifts of the gods, the gods
who visited our planet a long,

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:03.610 align:middle line:10%
long time ago, as
Herodotus said.

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Under the pyramid and
inside the pyramid,

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:10.360 align:middle line:84%
gifts of the gods
and books of Enoch.

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:13.520 align:middle line:90%
I told this yesterday, as Enoch.

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:16.510 align:middle line:84%
So there is something,
and Egyptology does not

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:19.930 align:middle line:90%
talk about it.

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:23.280 align:middle line:10%
We live in a situation which
I call the spirit of time.

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:27.150 align:middle line:84%
The spirit of time is
what is today's knowledge.

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:31.260 align:middle line:84%
The spirit of time is always
what is reasonable today,

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.460 align:middle line:90%
reasonable.

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:35.490 align:middle line:84%
But every time, throughout
thousands of years,

00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:37.620 align:middle line:84%
every scientist or
every discoverer

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:40.680 align:middle line:84%
had to fight against
the spirit of time.

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And you can do nothing against
this stupid spirit of time.

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:46.650 align:middle line:84%
The spirit of time
dictates to the public

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:48.930 align:middle line:90%
what is reasonable today.

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:50.670 align:middle line:90%
I said, you can do nothing.

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:51.810 align:middle line:90%
Imagine the following.

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:53.380 align:middle line:90%
I am just writing a story.

00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:57.180 align:middle line:10%
Imagine the Pope from Rome
would have a discussion

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:59.040 align:middle line:10%
with two extraterrestrials.

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:04.770 align:middle line:84%
The next morning, he goes to his
priests and cardinals and says,

00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:07.050 align:middle line:84%
friends, yesterday
night I had a discussion

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:08.970 align:middle line:90%
with two extraterrestrials.

00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:11.880 align:middle line:84%
His cardinals would say,
please, holy father,

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:17.250 align:middle line:84%
do not go to public with this
because you would be ridiculed.

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:18.810 align:middle line:90%
Nobody would believe you.

00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Even if you are the Pope, a
personality whose word you

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:28.110 align:middle line:84%
believe, you cannot go
against the spirit of time.

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:30.900 align:middle line:84%
The spirit of time
will ridicule you.

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:34.290 align:middle line:84%
So we have to fight
against the spirit of time.

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:37.680 align:middle line:84%
We have to change the
spirit of time, slowly.

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:39.300 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm doing.

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:42.510 align:middle line:84%
I started with "Chariots
of the Gods" 55 years ago.

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And many of my
wonderful colleagues

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:45.990 align:middle line:84%
are working on
this same project.

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:48.660 align:middle line:84%
We know we have to change
the spirit of time.

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:51.570 align:middle line:84%
We know extraterrestrials
were here.

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:54.600 align:middle line:84%
We know we have proof
for extraterrestrials.

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:58.230 align:middle line:84%
In the pyramid, under the
pyramid, on different sides,

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:01.290 align:middle line:84%
we have skeletons and
all kinds of things.

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:04.110 align:middle line:10%
But the scientific community
doesn't look at it.

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:05.490 align:middle line:10%
They think, this is all garbage.

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:06.540 align:middle line:90%
This is all nonsense.

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Not because they
are stupid, no, not

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:12.880 align:middle line:84%
because of any controversy
or conspiracy theory.

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:16.710 align:middle line:84%
They simply say,
it can't be true.

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:20.370 align:middle line:84%
The spirit of time
does not allow them.

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:24.180 align:middle line:10%
If a modern astronomer
today would go to public

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:27.750 align:middle line:10%
and would say, yes, we have
proof that extraterrestrials

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:30.000 align:middle line:10%
were here, he would
simply be ridiculed,

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.370 align:middle line:10%
as the Pope in my example.

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.400 align:middle line:84%
You have to fight against
the spirit of time slowly,

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.170 align:middle line:90%
slowly, and slowly.

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And we are in this process of
changing the spirit of time.

00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:42.630 align:middle line:10%
And you all, ladies
and gentlemen, you

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:45.210 align:middle line:10%
are part of this, too.

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:47.850 align:middle line:10%
You would not have read
"Chariots of the Gods"

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:49.980 align:middle line:10%
and been influenced
a little, maybe,

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:52.650 align:middle line:10%
by this book, or the following
book, or the books of all

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:54.670 align:middle line:10%
my brilliant colleagues.

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:57.490 align:middle line:84%
We all try to change
the spirit of time.

00:39:57.490 --> 00:39:58.920 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:01.750 align:middle line:90%
We all know we are humanity.

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:04.480 align:middle line:84%
We are different people,
different colors,

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:07.330 align:middle line:84%
different races, a word
which you cannot use today.

00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:09.360 align:middle line:84%
But we are the
human intelligence.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:11.940 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't matter if you
are Black or white or yellow

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:13.860 align:middle line:10%
or whatever color we have read.

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:15.600 align:middle line:90%
We are the human race.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.240 align:middle line:84%
We are the intelligent
beings on this planet.

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:22.080 align:middle line:10%
Since thousands of years, we
are fighting against each other,

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.060 align:middle line:10%
mostly because of religion.

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.100 align:middle line:84%
My religion is the
only right one.

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:27.760 align:middle line:90%
No, mine is the only right one.

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:30.990 align:middle line:84%
You have to believe what I
believe, et cetera, et cetera.

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:33.400 align:middle line:10%
And we have to change this.

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Our people, the population
of this planet has to learn.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:40.120 align:middle line:10%
We are all unique.

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:42.040 align:middle line:10%
No way to fight.

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:44.830 align:middle line:10%
Soon as we have contact
with extraterrestrials.

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Imagine an extraterrestrial
will be here, a TV interview.

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Now a politician
comes from the--

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:58.900 align:middle line:84%
from the political right
or left wing and says,

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.420 align:middle line:90%
only my opinion is right.

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:03.820 align:middle line:84%
The other one, no, only
my opinion is right.

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.220 align:middle line:10%
Or the priest comes,
from any religion, say,

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:09.070 align:middle line:10%
only our belief are right.

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:10.870 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrials,
are they insane?

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:12.670 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with these humans?

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:13.510 align:middle line:90%
What's come?

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:15.310 align:middle line:90%
Everyone wants to be right.

00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:16.670 align:middle line:90%
Forget it.

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:19.150 align:middle line:84%
We have to learn, soon
as we're having contact

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:21.970 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrials,
the human fights,

00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:25.670 align:middle line:84%
the human wars makes
no sense anymore.

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:29.110 align:middle line:84%
We are all together, and we are
a little part of this planet.

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And we are part of intelligent
beings which exist out there.

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:37.240 align:middle line:84%
The universe is full
of intelligent beings.

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:39.460 align:middle line:90%
We are not the only ones.

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:41.770 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there could be
intelligent beings out there

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:43.940 align:middle line:90%
who look completely different.

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:46.600 align:middle line:84%
I always joke, maybe there is
something like flying elephants

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.520 align:middle line:90%
out there with tentacles.

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:49.930 align:middle line:90%
It's all possible.

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:53.500 align:middle line:84%
But also, intelligent
beings as we.

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:54.400 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:58.270 align:middle line:84%
Because we are the
offsprings of it.

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget all
the holy writings.

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not only
talking about the Bible.

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:03.640 align:middle line:90%
You know the Bible.

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:06.850 align:middle line:84%
I know other holy writings,
thousands of years old.

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And in each one
of them, they say,

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:13.360 align:middle line:84%
the gods created humans
according to their own image.

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:16.180 align:middle line:84%
Our writers in thousands of
years ago were not liars.

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:20.860 align:middle line:84%
The gods created us
according to their own image.

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:22.900 align:middle line:90%
We are the offsprings.

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:26.110 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to be afraid
of them, of the wicked.

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And we have to learn, we
are all one family and only

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.720 align:middle line:84%
one intelligent form of
life in the universe.

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:34.690 align:middle line:90%
The universe is full of it.

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And sooner or later,
we will get in contact,

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:41.170 align:middle line:84%
but only when the spirit
of time has changed.

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:44.560 align:middle line:10%
Today, it is impossible
for our society

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:48.130 align:middle line:10%
to declare that
extraterrestrials were here

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:48.970 align:middle line:10%
on the planet.

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:51.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, declare from
a scientific manner.

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:53.050 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:55.400 align:middle line:90%
Mankind, humanity is afraid.

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:56.200 align:middle line:90%
They are afraid.

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:56.440 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrials,
would they enslave us?

00:42:58.690 --> 00:42:59.770 align:middle line:90%
Would they kill us?

00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Would they steal
our raw material?

00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:02.890 align:middle line:90%
We are afraid.

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:05.240 align:middle line:90%
Humanity is not prepared for it.

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:09.370 align:middle line:84%
That's why the spirit
of time has to change.

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
all are working in it.

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:17.450 align:middle line:84%
The spirit of time is in
full process of changing,

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:21.730 align:middle line:84%
and you, ladies and gentlemen,
you are all part of it.

00:43:21.730 --> 00:43:26.110 align:middle line:84%
My friend George Zuccala
always says, it's up to you.

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Because you are here,
because you read our books,

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:30.970 align:middle line:90%
we can do our job.

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:34.240 align:middle line:84%
Because you buy our
books, because you

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:38.320 align:middle line:84%
are visiting our conferences,
that's why we can continue.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:43.825 align:middle line:84%
Without it, we would have
no reaction in the [GERMAN],,

00:43:43.825 --> 00:43:44.625 align:middle line:90%
whatever--

00:43:44.625 --> 00:43:45.533 align:middle line:90%
>> Public.

00:43:45.533 --> 00:43:46.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Public, the public.

00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:47.250 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:48.700 align:middle line:90%
Good, you speak English.

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:51.160 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I lost my words,
but it doesn't matter.

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Anyhow, ladies and gentlemen, we
are part of the spirit of time.

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.620 align:middle line:90%
We change the spirit of time.

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:59.960 align:middle line:84%
You are part of it, and I'm
proud that I had the chance

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:00.760 align:middle line:90%
to talk to you.

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:01.240 align:middle line:90%
Bye-bye.

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:02.240 align:middle line:90%
Next time.

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.710 align:middle line:10%

[GERMAN]

00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:05.410 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Ladies and gentlemen,
please give it up for Mr.

00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:10.250 align:middle line:90%
Erich von Daniken.

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:11.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:11.380 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:12.560 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:13.360 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:14.570 align:middle line:90%
Very kind of you.
