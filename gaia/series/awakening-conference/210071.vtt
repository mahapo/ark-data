welcome to Mr. Billy Carson.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.568 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:30.568 --> 00:03:35.348 align:middle line:90%


00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:36.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Good to see you.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Our esteemed guests will be
asked some preselected audience

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.870 align:middle line:84%
questions, starting with Hugh
Newman and then moving along.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.360 align:middle line:84%
So without further
ado, I'll pass you over

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.560 align:middle line:84%
to our digital emcee,
Mr. Peter Twist.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Hugh Newman.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.090 align:middle line:84%
Hugh, there has been
much talk recently

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.550 align:middle line:84%
in regards to giant
bones discovered

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.740 align:middle line:90%
near Stonehenge in the UK.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.380 align:middle line:84%
If this is true,
and if so, does this

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.530 align:middle line:84%
mean that there is a possibility
that Stonehenge could

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.870 align:middle line:90%
have been built by giants?

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.930 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that next question now?

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.230 align:middle line:84%
I live in the
Stonehenge landscape,

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.500 align:middle line:84%
and I haven't found
anything bones or giants

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.030 align:middle line:90%
myself just yet.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.250 align:middle line:84%
But who knows what's
under my house?

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.300 align:middle line:90%
It is quite haunted.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.190 align:middle line:90%
So you know, you never know.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.290 align:middle line:84%
But I've been researching with
Jim Vieira for a good few years

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.040 align:middle line:84%
on our new book, "The
Giants of Stonehenge

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.970 align:middle line:90%
and Ancient Britain."

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And we were always intrigued
by, you know, the fact

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.530 align:middle line:84%
that many of these megalithic
sites, Stonehenge included,

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.370 align:middle line:84%
have these giant legends,
these myths at their core.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And even the earliest name
recorded of Stonehenge

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.570 align:middle line:84%
is the Giant's Dance or
a Welsh Chorea Gigantum

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.608 align:middle line:84%
in various interpretations of
that, which comes from the book

00:04:57.608 --> 00:04:59.150 align:middle line:84%
"The History of the
Kings of Britain"

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.170 align:middle line:90%
by Geoffrey of Monmouth.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And there were earlier
texts which mentioned

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.740 align:middle line:90%
this giant connection as well.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.870 align:middle line:90%
And the myth goes--

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.550 align:middle line:84%
I'll just quickly
summarize this,

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.090 align:middle line:84%
that in very ancient times,
the stones of Stonehenge

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.960 align:middle line:84%
were brought over from the
farthest reaches of Africa

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.970 align:middle line:90%
by a group of giants.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And they were placed at
a site called Killaraus

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.520 align:middle line:90%
in the remote part of Ireland.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.690 align:middle line:84%
They stayed there for
thousands of years.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And then at some
point, King Ambrosius

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.420 align:middle line:84%
summoned his army, which
was led by Uther Pendragon,

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.870 align:middle line:84%
to bring the stones over from
Ireland to Salisbury Plain

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.360 align:middle line:84%
to build them in
honor, reconstruct them

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.180 align:middle line:84%
in honor of a fallen
army in a great battle

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.765 align:middle line:84%
where many of his
soldiers had been slain.

00:05:43.765 --> 00:05:45.140 align:middle line:84%
But here they
couldn't move them.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.607 align:middle line:84%
The 15,000 strong couldn't
move the stones from Ireland.

00:05:47.607 --> 00:05:49.940 align:middle line:84%
They tried really hard, and
they couldn't budge a stone.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And so they had to call
on the services of Merlin

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.820 align:middle line:84%
the magician or the
wizard to go over there.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.687 align:middle line:84%
And he was said to have moved
all the stones on his own.

00:05:59.687 --> 00:06:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And there were two or
three interpretations.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.330 align:middle line:84%
One story said he used
gears, levers, and engines.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And others says he used magic
and sleight to bring them over.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Whichever way he did it,
they got to Salisbury Plain

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.380 align:middle line:84%
and they were reconstructed
in the exact configuration.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the earliest
depiction ever of Stonehenge

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.430 align:middle line:84%
is from a version of
the history of Kingsbury

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.190 align:middle line:84%
and it came out a bit later that
has Merlin with King Ambrosius

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.120 align:middle line:84%
and what looks like a 16 to
18 foot tall giant lifting

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.640 align:middle line:84%
one of the lintels, one of
the top stones, into place.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And so this giant
connection with Stonehenge

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.260 align:middle line:90%
always intrigued us.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And then we found that
in 1719, myself and Jim

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.990 align:middle line:84%
came across a report
of a nine foot

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.050 align:middle line:84%
four skeleton being
found in a giant's

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.960 align:middle line:90%
grave, a mound near Salisbury.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.903 align:middle line:84%
Now Salisbury is the
nearest town to Stonehenge.

00:06:53.903 --> 00:06:55.070 align:middle line:90%
It's just a few miles south.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.822 align:middle line:84%
And it's part really of the
greater Stonehenge landscape.

00:06:57.822 --> 00:06:59.030 align:middle line:90%
And this really intrigued us.

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.890 align:middle line:84%
We found two or three
accounts of this.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And we know exactly
where it was buried,

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.600 align:middle line:84%
but it's been built over
now by the local art center.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.120 align:middle line:84%
But then we found this other
account which really got us,

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.910 align:middle line:90%
because this is from 1508.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was witnessed
by Sir Thomas Eliot,

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.890 align:middle line:90%
who was a well known scholar.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.360 align:middle line:90%
He was an MP for Cambridge.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.430 align:middle line:84%
He also wrote the
first Latin dictionary.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And he witnessed a
14-foot 10-inch skeleton

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.540 align:middle line:84%
found in the general area
just south of Salisbury.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Again, within the
Stonehenge landscape.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.535 align:middle line:90%
Now 14 foot 10 is really tall.

00:07:31.535 --> 00:07:33.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you meet
someone who's seven foot,

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:34.622 align:middle line:90%
it's pretty impressive.

00:07:34.622 --> 00:07:36.830 align:middle line:84%
So when you meet someone
who's 14 foot 10 or at least

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.250 align:middle line:90%
find their skeleton.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And he was buried in
this huge oak log coffin.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.720 align:middle line:84%
It had a book with
strange inscriptions on it

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.460 align:middle line:90%
that could never be deciphered.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And they found this quite large
metal disk made of tin and lead

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.980 align:middle line:84%
that again had the same kind
of obscure inscriptions on it.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.480 align:middle line:90%
But no one could decode it.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.310 align:middle line:84%
All of these have
now disappeared.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.930 align:middle line:84%
But before they
did disappear, they

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.390 align:middle line:84%
were witnessed not
only by Thomas Eliot

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:04.640 align:middle line:84%
and his well-known
father, but also

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.810 align:middle line:84%
by John Leland and various
other well-known scholars,

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:12.260 align:middle line:84%
almost like celebrities
and academics at the time.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.870 align:middle line:84%
So they wouldn't
really make this up.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.030 align:middle line:84%
One of the weird
things as well, even

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.840 align:middle line:84%
in the Bush Barrow where the
famous lozenge was found,

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.240 align:middle line:84%
which is just next
to Stonehenge,

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.770 align:middle line:84%
the description of
the burial there

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.470 align:middle line:84%
was a very robust,
very tall individual.

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.860 align:middle line:84%
We have similar accounts from
other mounds in the area.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:35.030 align:middle line:84%
But also we have this tradition
going back to the 1400s

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:39.730 align:middle line:84%
of a secret society, the
Guild of Tailors in Salisbury,

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:45.010 align:middle line:84%
parading a 24-foot giant
around town every summer--

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:47.620 align:middle line:84%
just after the summer solstice,
St. John the Baptist Day.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.830 align:middle line:90%
Every year since the mid-1400s.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.050 align:middle line:84%
This is before the
skeletons were even found.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And so there's
this-- why were they

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.080 align:middle line:90%
parading this giant around?

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.180 align:middle line:90%
What was this pageant all about?

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And then we realized
they eventually named him

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.780 align:middle line:90%
St. Christopher.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And me and Jim when we
were researching it,

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.000 align:middle line:84%
but why would they name
a giant St. Christopher?

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.350 align:middle line:84%
St. Christopher, if you look,
he was a giant Canaanite warrior

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.060 align:middle line:90%
from the Bible lands.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And he was said to have
carried Jesus on his shoulder

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.320 align:middle line:90%
when he came over.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is what he
became famous for.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:22.195 align:middle line:84%
And he decided to, you know,
kind of worship Jesus and God

00:09:22.195 --> 00:09:23.320 align:middle line:90%
and all this kind of stuff.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.780 align:middle line:84%
But so you've got all
these giant connections

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.600 align:middle line:84%
even with the Bible lands
in this particular area.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.970 align:middle line:84%
But I must admit,
this is the tip

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:34.700 align:middle line:84%
of the iceberg when it comes
to the giant discoveries made,

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.630 align:middle line:84%
especially in relation to
megalithic sites in Ancient

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Britain and Ireland and
Scotland and Wales, everywhere.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:44.860 align:middle line:84%
We have over 250
accounts with legends

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.290 align:middle line:84%
that match the discoveries
being made in the ground.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
real story here,

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.050 align:middle line:84%
and I hope this has given
you a quick introduction.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully it's
answered the question.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.965 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:09:56.965 --> 00:09:59.760 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Andrew Collins.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.580 align:middle line:84%
Andrew, do the last
underworld of catacombs

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:07.610 align:middle line:84%
beneath the Egyptian
pyramids show any evidence

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:09.390 align:middle line:90%
that the Egyptians built them?

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And if so, why were
they left unexplored

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.320 align:middle line:90%
for around 200 years?

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's a big one.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Who's heard of the
Hall of Records?

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:21.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:25.880 align:middle line:84%
The idea that somewhere
beneath the Plateau at Giza,

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.940 align:middle line:84%
beneath the Great Pyramid,
beneath the Great Sphinx

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:33.560 align:middle line:84%
is some kind of secret
chamber with the--

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.540 align:middle line:84%
quite literally the
secrets of the universe

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:36.890 align:middle line:90%
contained within it.

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Well this is something which
has actually been written

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.440 align:middle line:90%
about for the last 2,000 years.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
Roman accounts of it.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:47.120 align:middle line:90%
There's various Arab accounts.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.540 align:middle line:84%
There are various people
in the 19th century

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.680 align:middle line:90%
that wrote about it.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.400 align:middle line:84%
The great psychic Edgar
Cayce wrote about the idea

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.780 align:middle line:90%
of the Hall of Records.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And back in the '80s, I
first got to hear about this.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I want
to try and find it.

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:07.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I want to go out there
and actually try and find it.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really get the
opportunity until the 2000s.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And by that time, I was in
quite an influential position

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:20.210 align:middle line:84%
as far as my relationship
with people on the plateau,

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.700 align:middle line:90%
egyptologists, and whatever.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And I started working with
an egyptological researcher

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.600 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Nigel
Skinner Simpson.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was to
try and find if there

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:39.350 align:middle line:84%
was any possible entrance into
a cave underworld at Giza that

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:41.370 align:middle line:84%
would eventually lead
to the Hall of Records,

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:45.347 align:middle line:84%
which I firmly
believe was there.

00:11:45.347 --> 00:11:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And it took us five
years, I mean, you know,

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.390 align:middle line:84%
of absolute research, you
know, throughout the 2000s.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:54.050 align:middle line:90%
And then in 2008, we started--

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:58.460 align:middle line:84%
we uncovered this
200-year-old diary account

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:03.950 align:middle line:84%
that talked about a
British consul general guy

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:10.910 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Henry Salt
and his Italian, you know,

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:15.590 align:middle line:84%
explorer friend by the
name of Giovanni Caviglia.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- and there
was in this account,

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:22.130 align:middle line:84%
it said that they'd
gone into caves at Giza

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:25.820 align:middle line:84%
for a distance of
about 300 feet.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And that they went
even beyond that.

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:29.900 align:middle line:90%
They found chambers or whatever.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And Nigel said,
look, you know, I've

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.460 align:middle line:84%
read virtually
everything that's ever

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.100 align:middle line:84%
been written about
the Giza Plateau,

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.590 align:middle line:84%
whether it be in books,
articles, papers.

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And whatever they went into,
which was in about 1819,

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.840 align:middle line:90%
it's just not recorded.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.760 align:middle line:84%
So we carefully tried
to dissect exactly

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.350 align:middle line:84%
whereabouts this entrance
into this cave underworld was.

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And we pinned it down
to the northwest corner

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:58.670 align:middle line:90%
of the plateau.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And we thought, well,
OK, what's there?

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.900 align:middle line:90%
So we did a cursory visit.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And there is this weird place
called the Tomb of the Birds

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:16.220 align:middle line:84%
where Howard Vice, who was a
British engineer researcher

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.160 align:middle line:84%
explorer in the mid-19th
century had supposedly

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.190 align:middle line:84%
found the remains of
a lot of bird mummies

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:25.100 align:middle line:84%
and had removed them
out of this chamber.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And again, absolutely no record
of this in any official count.

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:34.430 align:middle line:84%
We went back there knowing
that this entrance had

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:37.620 align:middle line:84%
to be in the vicinity of this
so-called Tomb of the Birds.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:42.200 align:middle line:84%
So what we did was we hired
camels and put all of our stuff

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:47.150 align:middle line:84%
on camels and got onto the Giza
Plateau via the rear entrance

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:48.920 align:middle line:84%
to the south,
which is what you--

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.750 align:middle line:84%
the only place that
you can get onto it

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:52.670 align:middle line:90%
when they don't actually check.

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:56.347 align:middle line:84%
And we went across
to this, you know,

00:13:56.347 --> 00:13:58.430 align:middle line:84%
this particular place
called the Tomb of the Birds

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.230 align:middle line:90%
and investigated it.

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, in
the absolute darkness,

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:07.400 align:middle line:84%
we found this small crack
leading into this huge cave

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.420 align:middle line:90%
chamber.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, when we
shone the torch in there,

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.430 align:middle line:90%
and it was like, oh my god.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:17.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's this massive, huge
natural cave structure that

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.340 align:middle line:90%
had never been recorded before.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Certainly not over
the last 200 years.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.140 align:middle line:90%
So we went into it.

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And it was absolutely full
of bats and poisonous spiders

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.920 align:middle line:84%
and all sorts of other,
you know, bugs of the sort

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.720 align:middle line:84%
that you see on an
Indiana Jones film.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was absolutely
full of this.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:39.260 align:middle line:84%
So we progressed this as
far as we possibly could.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Until eventually,
the whole thing just

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.275 align:middle line:90%
shrank down to this small tube.

00:14:43.275 --> 00:14:47.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, probably about
150 yards, you know, meters.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.730 align:middle line:90%
And we eventually had to stop.

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:52.610 align:middle line:84%
We went back there
in all four times.

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:56.030 align:middle line:84%
But we had to report
it as well, which

00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:01.590 align:middle line:84%
we did to the local
egyptological authorities.

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, we
had to present it

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:09.030 align:middle line:84%
all to Dr. Zahi Hawass, who
was the big boss of the Supreme

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:10.320 align:middle line:90%
Council of Antiquities.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.350 align:middle line:90%
And he just denied it.

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:13.330 align:middle line:84%
He said, you've
discovered nothing.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:14.130 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:15.338 align:middle line:90%
And we said, no, no, we have.

00:15:15.338 --> 00:15:17.190 align:middle line:84%
We got the photographs
to prove it.

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Just a few months
later, right, he's

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:25.082 align:middle line:84%
on this TV show which
was called Finding--

00:15:25.082 --> 00:15:26.290 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember what it was.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:27.135 align:middle line:90%
What was it?

00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:30.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, this thing where
they were following him around,

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.380 align:middle line:90%
this reality show.

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:34.350 align:middle line:84%
Where they're actually showing
him going into these caves

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:37.020 align:middle line:84%
and discovering them
himself and avoiding

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.690 align:middle line:90%
all these bats flying around.

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And saying this was the most
incredible experience he's ever

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:45.030 align:middle line:90%
had on the Giza Plateau.

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Which is just
absolutely bizarre.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.450 align:middle line:84%
But the whole thing was written
up in a book that I wrote.

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:54.870 align:middle line:84%
It was published in 2009
called "Beneath the Pyramids."

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately it's
not available anymore.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:02.100 align:middle line:84%
But this all got me into
serious problems eventually.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And if I'd have gone back
to Egypt for a few years,

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:06.870 align:middle line:90%
I would have got arrested.

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:07.767 align:middle line:90%
Serious.

00:16:07.767 --> 00:16:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's without even talking
about what happened in Turkey,

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.320 align:middle line:90%
but that's another story.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:19.350 align:middle line:84%
(CHUCKLES) But-- anyway, so
but my good friend Robert

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Bauval, the author of
"The Orion Mystery"

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.510 align:middle line:84%
knew all the right people
and sorted it all out.

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:25.620 align:middle line:90%
So we can--

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.840 align:middle line:84%
I can finally go back
to Egypt, you know,

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.160 align:middle line:90%
with my head held high.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.240 align:middle line:90%
So that was it.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:35.310 align:middle line:84%
But those caves, you can
see them on radar images.

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And they go underneath
the second pyramid.

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Not the Sphinx, not
the Great Pyramid.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.340 align:middle line:90%
The second pyramid.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's said that
underneath the second pyramid

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.670 align:middle line:90%
is the tomb of Hermes.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And that within his
hands, he holds something

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.930 align:middle line:90%
called the Emerald Tablet.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And that they themselves
are supposedly

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:57.180 align:middle line:84%
symbolic of these
great secrets that

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.730 align:middle line:84%
are to be found within
the Hall of Records

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:01.390 align:middle line:90%
when finally you get to that.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:03.300 align:middle line:84%
But I'd like to
think that we've come

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:07.109 align:middle line:84%
closest to actually entering
inside those Hall of Records.

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:11.280 align:middle line:84%
So basically that's
my story of Egypt.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.520 align:middle line:84%
But just one of the many
adventures I've been on.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.569 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:17.890 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Maria Wheatley.

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Maria, it has been
written that decades ago,

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:27.060 align:middle line:84%
a most unusual skeleton was
excavated close to Stonehenge.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Its description was said to
be very similar to Lloyd Pie's

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:32.550 align:middle line:90%
famous Starchild.

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:36.900 align:middle line:84%
How true is this, and why
was it described as unusual?

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's many
different types of beings

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:45.030 align:middle line:84%
or civilizations
associated with Stonehenge.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:47.730 align:middle line:84%
There are giants,
like Hugh describes.

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:51.030 align:middle line:84%
But there are also other
types of civilizations

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:54.270 align:middle line:84%
that were much smaller
and very elfin-like.

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be describing
that in my talk.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.510 align:middle line:84%
My research, I really
like the Neolithic Era.

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's the ancient
time of Stonehenge.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:07.900 align:middle line:84%
That's going back to around
3800 BC and beyond that.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And they built and
constructed long barrows,

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.460 align:middle line:84%
causeway enclosures,
and cursus monuments.

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.340 align:middle line:84%
They were an incredible
type of people,

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.560 align:middle line:84%
because I discovered
that they had

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.630 align:middle line:90%
long skulls, elongated skulls.

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And the femur bones
of these people

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:28.740 align:middle line:84%
were only up to 16 inches,
which makes them really small.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:31.020 align:middle line:90%
The opposite of the giants.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:34.200 align:middle line:84%
So they were really
about sort of four feet

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.130 align:middle line:90%
eight for the women.

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And five feet four for the
males of the Neolithic period.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Now in that research, I noticed
that there's a long barrow,

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:45.210 align:middle line:90%
it's not on the map.

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:50.280 align:middle line:84%
It's on a very ancient map
that is in view of Stonehenge.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And in that barrow was described
the most unusual burial ever.

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.060 align:middle line:90%
It's unprecedented.

00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And it hasn't anything like
it in the British Isles.

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.930 align:middle line:84%
So if you imagine
that in the Neolithic,

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:06.330 align:middle line:84%
they would take a
whole body and put it

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.880 align:middle line:84%
in what's called the
flexed position-- that's

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.400 align:middle line:84%
in like the fetal
position-- and tie it up.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.430 align:middle line:84%
Or they would deflesh
the person and take

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:17.670 align:middle line:84%
the skull and the long bones
and sometimes a whole person

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:21.000 align:middle line:84%
as well and place those
into megalithic chambers.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.520 align:middle line:90%
That's a Neolithic burial.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.230 align:middle line:90%
Very common.

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:28.800 align:middle line:84%
But near Stonehenge,
things get weird.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.850 align:middle line:90%
And they really do.

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:31.650 align:middle line:90%
It's an energetic landscape.

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:33.630 align:middle line:84%
It's got ley lines
flowing through it.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:35.370 align:middle line:90%
It's got aquifers beneath it.

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:37.920 align:middle line:90%
It's a high res place.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
English heritage don't

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.960 align:middle line:90%
want you to touch the stones.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Because you will
get a download, as I

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:47.920 align:middle line:84%
have and many other
people before.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.590 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in my
presentation, I'm going

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:54.120 align:middle line:84%
to tell you lie after lie after
lie that the Ministry of Works

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.740 align:middle line:90%
has done to Stonehenge.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.750 align:middle line:90%
They've hidden stones.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:01.350 align:middle line:84%
They've defaced them,
which is a crime.

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And one stone was stolen
by the Royal Family.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.280 align:middle line:90%
But back to the Neolithic Era.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.630 align:middle line:84%
For example, in
this unusual mound,

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:15.000 align:middle line:84%
there were people
with long skulls,

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.980 align:middle line:84%
the short people
with long skulls,

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.710 align:middle line:90%
in a circle tied together.

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And in the center of
that circle of beings

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:26.370 align:middle line:84%
was this very unusual
skull that was described.

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:29.910 align:middle line:84%
It stopped the excavators
in their tracks,

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:33.670 align:middle line:84%
and they literally looked at
it and said, what is this?

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:34.980 align:middle line:90%
And so they wrote a report.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And that report was
re-evaluated in the 1930s.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And it said that
there was a skull

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:44.340 align:middle line:84%
and it had eyes on
top of its head.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Very similar like it was
said to Lloyd Pie's skull.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.940 align:middle line:84%
But more than that, it
was the whole skeleton

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.290 align:middle line:90%
that they were describing.

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And they were saying
the rib cages,

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:56.490 align:middle line:84%
they were very strange,
very close together.

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:57.780 align:middle line:90%
And it had a tail.

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And it must have been revered,
because everybody else was

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.640 align:middle line:90%
holding it around.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.600 align:middle line:84%
I gave that report
to Dr. Ted Robinson,

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.650 align:middle line:84%
who worked with Lloyd
Pie on the Starchild.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you tell
me what's going on.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.690 align:middle line:90%
You worked with Lloyd Pie.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And he said it's an
identical type of being.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:21.330 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's
lots more going on

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:24.720 align:middle line:84%
in this Stonehenge landscape
than we really know about.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's people
that, you know, do

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:28.260 align:middle line:84%
the investigations
that find there's

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.210 align:middle line:90%
different civilizations.

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think the different
phases of Stonehenge--

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.660 align:middle line:84%
because an archaeologist
will say, oh,

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:38.993 align:middle line:84%
it took 1,000 years
to build Stonehenge.

00:21:38.993 --> 00:21:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And it had feature after
feature, and it was altered

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.270 align:middle line:90%
and it was altered.

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:45.750 align:middle line:84%
I think it was built originally
by the Neolithic people

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:49.230 align:middle line:84%
and altered by different
civilizations that

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:51.000 align:middle line:90%
came through.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And even in the kind
of prehistoric times,

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:56.850 align:middle line:90%
Stonehenge has been evolving.

00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:59.550 align:middle line:84%
But one thing I really
do think about about

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.290 align:middle line:84%
the long-skulled
people-- because I

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:04.860 align:middle line:84%
had the pleasure of going
to Cambridge University

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:08.820 align:middle line:84%
to really study
and view the skull.

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And anybody knows me that
knows I'm a bit of a druid,

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:14.170 align:middle line:84%
and I can be a bit
of a witch as well.

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did,
I kind of vibed

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.600 align:middle line:90%
the curator to leave the room.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was kind of vibing
and vibing and vibing.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And then at Cambridge,
you think they

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:26.140 align:middle line:84%
would have sophisticated
communication systems.

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:26.940 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:29.100 align:middle line:84%
It was an old fashioned
pager that went off.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you
don't mind if I just

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:32.880 align:middle line:84%
leave the room for a little
while, do you, Maria?

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.130 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, of course not.

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:36.870 align:middle line:90%
And then I had the--

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:40.200 align:middle line:84%
it was a real pleasure
to feel the skull.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And it was almost like the
chakra system of the upper part

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.590 align:middle line:84%
was still alive
and still beating.

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And saying kind of-- like
energy was coming out.

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And so there seemed to be,
like, two crown chakras as well.

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:56.520 align:middle line:84%
So I think these star beings,
these elongated skulls,

00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.100 align:middle line:84%
sensed the environment
differently.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:00.900 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:06.450 align:middle line:84%
So Andy Collins knows
Rodney Hale well, don't you?

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:08.370 align:middle line:84%
Rodney came with me
to Avebury Henge.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:09.270 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Hugh lives near Stonehenge, I
lived near to Avebury Henge.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.325 align:middle line:90%
We're megaliths, Hugh.

00:23:14.325 --> 00:23:15.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:16.650 align:middle line:90%


00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And so we did some
testing on some stones,

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:22.110 align:middle line:84%
because I always said, as
did many other doubters,

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:25.410 align:middle line:84%
that standing stones can
equate to the chakra system.

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:28.020 align:middle line:84%
There's five above,
and there's two below

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.560 align:middle line:90%
if the stone is in the ground.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So the two were flowing through
the earth, and five were above.

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And when these were measured,
again, by Rodney and David

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Webb much later, said that
they resonated to 18 hertz.

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:43.710 align:middle line:90%
We hear at 20 hertz.

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:48.180 align:middle line:84%
I think the elongated skull
people and the Starchild

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:49.950 align:middle line:90%
heard the stones.

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And they listened
to the landscape.

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:56.380 align:middle line:84%
We're visual people, so we
kind of visualize things.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.820 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it was a totally
different experience

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:04.340 align:middle line:84%
of the landscape and of,
you know, the monuments.

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:06.570 align:middle line:84%
If you imagine that
in the Neolithic,

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:09.930 align:middle line:84%
some amazing monuments
were built by these people

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:12.480 align:middle line:84%
and maybe under direction
of the Starchild,

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.510 align:middle line:84%
maybe under the direction
of a ruling elite

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:19.800 align:middle line:84%
that I will show you in
my presentation tomorrow.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:24.510 align:middle line:84%
So, so much wrapped
up into the land.

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And one of their monuments
stood in front of Stonehenge.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And it was called
the Cursus Monument.

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:34.830 align:middle line:84%
Recorded by William
Stokely and--

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:38.680 align:middle line:84%
who was an antiquarian
of the 18th century.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And he described it
as being a huge, maybe

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:44.470 align:middle line:90%
six to 10 feet tall building.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:47.560 align:middle line:90%
Imagine that chalk block, like--

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:50.890 align:middle line:84%
almost like kind of blocks of
chalk that was smoothed off.

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And it went on for nearly two
miles in front of Stonehenge

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:57.670 align:middle line:90%
in a rectangular shape.

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:00.340 align:middle line:90%
Sadly, that got plowed out.

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And that would have
had very acoustic sound

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:05.620 align:middle line:90%
some people would speculate on.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And even the chambers that the
Neolithic people went into,

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:14.260 align:middle line:84%
it's been recorded that they
too have acoustic properties.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:17.380 align:middle line:84%
So for me, the
adventures haven't

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.260 align:middle line:84%
ended with my discoveries
at Stonehenge.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.718 align:middle line:90%
They've only just begun.

00:25:22.718 --> 00:25:25.870 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:26.670 align:middle line:90%


00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Barry Fitzgerald.

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Barry, do you think the
mythology from our ancient past

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:36.210 align:middle line:84%
still presents itself
in current times?

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:38.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I do.

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think there is
a lot to be learned

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:44.550 align:middle line:84%
from our ancient
mythology and folklore.

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And briefly, I was speaking
to some of our panel members

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.060 align:middle line:90%
today in regards to this.

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:56.520 align:middle line:84%
There is a real value in a lot
of the message, the messages

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.500 align:middle line:84%
and stories that
they left behind

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:02.940 align:middle line:84%
and how that brings us forward
into how we examine things

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:04.240 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, it
has great value.

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:11.790 align:middle line:84%
But outside of that, we also
need to look at the proof.

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:13.440 align:middle line:84%
What proof did
they leave behind?

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.680 align:middle line:10%
We need something
more substantial.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.640 align:middle line:84%
We-- it's not so
much I think we--

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:25.350 align:middle line:84%
I think possibly it's a
case of more substance.

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:28.290 align:middle line:84%
That's what the people
demand today, especially

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:29.220 align:middle line:90%
in today's climate.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.990 align:middle line:90%
We need direction.

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And our ancestors have
lived thousands of years,

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:36.570 align:middle line:84%
and they have left this
direction within the stone.

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And there is value
within the stone.

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:43.470 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, even from a
really weird circumstance

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.550 align:middle line:10%
of the high strangeness
of everything else,

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:48.210 align:middle line:10%
it brings us back to
look at the stone.

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And this goes right across
the board from ufology

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:56.430 align:middle line:84%
into folklore into various
other fringe research fields.

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:59.700 align:middle line:84%
We see our attention being
brought back to the stone.

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.470 align:middle line:90%
There's a value in the stone.

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:04.690 align:middle line:90%
Harmonics.

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:07.680 align:middle line:90%
Archaeology is developing.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:11.220 align:middle line:84%
We're now understanding
these areas of value

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:15.450 align:middle line:84%
and how they resonate and how
we resonate with those areas.

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:20.280 align:middle line:84%
But not only is that an
audible circumstance.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:25.530 align:middle line:84%
We also have the light that
penetrates those areas.

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:29.790 align:middle line:84%
That-- those ranges
of light that

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:33.540 align:middle line:84%
enter the chambers signify the
time in which these places were

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:34.830 align:middle line:90%
activated.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And so this all
correlates together.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Then we have to also consider
some of the substances

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:43.560 align:middle line:84%
that our ancestors
were also taking.

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.390 align:middle line:90%
And what were those substances?

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:48.810 align:middle line:84%
Now we can see and
understand now with the work

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:50.550 align:middle line:84%
that I've been doing
back in Ireland

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:55.060 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of the Akkadians'
wall art that was depicted,

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.960 align:middle line:84%
we now understand
what that fruit is.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.310 align:middle line:10%
How that fruit is--

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:02.850 align:middle line:10%
how that fruit is broken down
and how that resonates with us

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:04.470 align:middle line:10%
when we consume it.

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And what is it that they were
actually communicating with?

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:middle line:84%
This is something we
have to understand.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.930 align:middle line:84%
We lived-- our ancestors
lived in a society

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:15.300 align:middle line:90%
where there wasn't a lot of us.

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Yet they took the time to
build these amazing structures.

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:25.000 align:middle line:84%
That's taking away from
the ability to live.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.140 align:middle line:10%
So there was a great
importance behind these places.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.660 align:middle line:10%
And this is something
we have to reconnect to.

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:33.750 align:middle line:84%
We have to reconnect
to our spirituality.

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Because these places were
built under spirituality.

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:39.480 align:middle line:84%
We have to process
and understand

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:45.360 align:middle line:84%
that, which is something we
have really veered off from.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.515 align:middle line:90%
And in the present sense.

00:28:47.515 --> 00:28:49.890 align:middle line:84%
So now we're really starting
to understand what they were

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:52.210 align:middle line:90%
doing, how they were doing it.

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:55.800 align:middle line:84%
But more to the point, what
were they communicating with?

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And their lives a
very dangerous topic

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:00.450 align:middle line:84%
which I'll be speaking
about tomorrow.

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:02.492 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what is it that
we're communicating with?

00:29:02.492 --> 00:29:03.930 align:middle line:90%
What is behind the veil?

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:06.510 align:middle line:84%
So our ancestors
have left us a lot

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:09.210 align:middle line:90%
within the stone structures.

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:12.690 align:middle line:84%
It's up to us to decipher
it, to understand it, and get

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:15.300 align:middle line:84%
something more
substantial that gives us

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:20.070 align:middle line:84%
presently a grounding to
understand what's coming ahead.

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:22.006 align:middle line:90%
And that's very, very important.

00:29:22.006 --> 00:29:25.478 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:25.478 --> 00:29:26.970 align:middle line:90%


00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:28.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Billy Carson.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Billy, throughout
Egypt there are

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:34.170 align:middle line:84%
seemingly examples of rock
being cut and bored out

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:36.240 align:middle line:90%
by ancient machine tools.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.360 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe such ancient
civilizations possess

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.480 align:middle line:84%
such equipment, and if so,
what do you think happened

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.190 align:middle line:90%
to all of this equipment?

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:48.647 align:middle line:84%
>> Wow, that's a
fantastic question.

00:29:48.647 --> 00:29:50.230 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those
questions that makes

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:53.492 align:middle line:84%
you want to scratch your head,
because I've been to Egypt,

00:29:53.492 --> 00:29:55.700 align:middle line:84%
I've been to a lot of ancient
sites around the world.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.075 align:middle line:84%
And what's
interesting is you can

00:29:57.075 --> 00:30:00.280 align:middle line:84%
begin to see the same
type of tool markings

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.710 align:middle line:84%
on some of these
megalithic structures.

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And so now you have to
come to the assumption

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.660 align:middle line:84%
that if you see
it more than once,

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:09.580 align:middle line:90%
it's circumstantial evidence.

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And so when you have enough
circumstantial evidence,

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:13.130 align:middle line:90%
you have a case.

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:13.930 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And so you begin to build
this case on the fact

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:18.730 align:middle line:84%
that there were
these tools, advanced

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:21.160 align:middle line:84%
tools of some type
that were able to cut

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:24.880 align:middle line:84%
and bore these incredible
stones and quartz, granite,

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.120 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And it makes you want to
ask the question, well,

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.720 align:middle line:84%
if you have these tools,
then what in the world

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:32.780 align:middle line:90%
happened to them?

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:35.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you look at
some of these structures

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:38.800 align:middle line:84%
and you take a compass of
some of these ancient stones,

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.960 align:middle line:84%
you find out that when
you put the compass close

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.680 align:middle line:84%
to the stones, especially in
areas of Egypt, that sometimes

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.180 align:middle line:90%
the compass moves away.

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:48.580 align:middle line:84%
It spins away from where it
is, what direction you're

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:49.640 align:middle line:90%
standing in.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's another
curious thing,

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:54.733 align:middle line:84%
is somehow the magnetic
field around the atoms

00:30:54.733 --> 00:30:55.900 align:middle line:90%
has been altered or changed.

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:57.070 align:middle line:90%
Has it flipped?

00:30:57.070 --> 00:31:01.090 align:middle line:84%
What kind of tool can be used to
cut stone and at the same time

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:05.180 align:middle line:84%
alter the atomic structure
of the actual stone as well?

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:06.380 align:middle line:90%
Great, great questions.

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I personally believe
that in ancient times,

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:12.040 align:middle line:90%
these advanced beings--

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.860 align:middle line:84%
they call them the
Neteru in Ancient Egypt.

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:15.820 align:middle line:90%
The Neteru.

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:19.030 align:middle line:84%
In Mesopotamia, they
call them the Anunnaki.

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:20.710 align:middle line:90%
The Sumerians did.

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And they're named
in the Enuma Elis

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.390 align:middle line:90%
the Seven Tablets of Creation.

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And all around the
world, you find

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:29.080 align:middle line:84%
these cultures have
these different names

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:29.900 align:middle line:90%
for these beings.

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:32.320 align:middle line:84%
But in my opinion,
some beings came here,

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.525 align:middle line:90%
some advanced beings.

00:31:33.525 --> 00:31:34.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
they were gods

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.540 align:middle line:90%
as in the creator of universes.

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.490 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that
people deified them

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:42.560 align:middle line:84%
because they were mystified
by their capabilities.

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:46.240 align:middle line:84%
They became cargo cults
worldwide centered

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.740 align:middle line:90%
around these advanced beings.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.020 align:middle line:84%
But they had advanced
tools and technology.

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:54.220 align:middle line:84%
When I went to Cambodia,
I think it was 2018,

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:57.390 align:middle line:84%
one of the locals that had
been there for generations,

00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:59.140 align:middle line:84%
his family had been
there for generations,

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:01.720 align:middle line:84%
told me that the
camp-- the Angkor Wat

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.700 align:middle line:90%
was poured into place.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:04.937 align:middle line:90%
They poured it into place.

00:32:04.937 --> 00:32:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at some of the stone

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.470 align:middle line:84%
there around that
structure, it does

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:10.480 align:middle line:90%
look like liquefied concrete.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.810 align:middle line:90%
Pretty interesting.

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And so there obviously was a
very, very advanced culture

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:17.590 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion in
the ancient past.

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:20.620 align:middle line:84%
Not taking anything away
from our ancient ancestors,

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:24.160 align:middle line:84%
because they themselves had
been taught and developed

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.960 align:middle line:84%
different levels of
advanced technology.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.240 align:middle line:84%
But just my personal
experience and from dealing

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.480 align:middle line:84%
like especially with the Ancient
Egyptian texts and the language

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:34.180 align:middle line:84%
of light and learning
from that culture

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:37.450 align:middle line:84%
directly, dealing and talking
with local guides, homegrown

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:40.420 align:middle line:84%
guides, generations of
pyramid families, you know,

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:43.900 align:middle line:84%
it looks to me as if
these Neteru who came down

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.480 align:middle line:84%
at the time of Zep
Tepi, they were

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.270 align:middle line:84%
claimed to have turned
mud into a kingdom.

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:51.520 align:middle line:84%
These are sky gods
that came to Earth.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:54.702 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes
people scoff and say,

00:32:54.702 --> 00:32:56.410 align:middle line:84%
well, you know, why
couldn't human beings

00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:57.430 align:middle line:90%
just do all this stuff?

00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:00.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that human
beings didn't do all this stuff.

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying some type of
a person or hominid--

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:05.350 align:middle line:84%
because I don't really
think that a lot

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:08.980 align:middle line:84%
of these advanced beings
look like little green men

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:09.790 align:middle line:90%
with antennae.

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:12.880 align:middle line:84%
I think we look a lot like them
and they look a lot like us.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.190 align:middle line:84%
Potentially probably
even our cousins.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Because I kind of believe
now after visiting Australia

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:19.630 align:middle line:84%
and talking to the
Aboriginal elders,

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:23.470 align:middle line:84%
that Earth is most likely some
type of abandoned seed colony

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:25.220 align:middle line:90%
and we were seeded here.

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And so these beings
had the capability

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:28.865 align:middle line:90%
of turning mud into a kingdom.

00:33:28.865 --> 00:33:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And wherever you look
around the world,

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:33.670 align:middle line:84%
we see this same exact story
of this-- these advanced

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:36.310 align:middle line:84%
beings showing up
after a catastrophe

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:39.370 align:middle line:84%
and helping rekickstart
civilizations.

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:41.890 align:middle line:90%
Now where have the tools gone?

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:44.320 align:middle line:90%
Where have this technology gone?

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:49.128 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the way that
the stones were put together

00:33:49.128 --> 00:33:51.670 align:middle line:84%
and the types of materials in
the stones, the types of stones

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:54.040 align:middle line:84%
that were put up to create
these megalithic structures,

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.570 align:middle line:84%
you'd find that
they were created

00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:57.410 align:middle line:90%
to stand the test of time.

00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:01.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you take a piece of
human or manmade technology

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:04.960 align:middle line:84%
and put it next to a pyramid
and then go away and come back

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:08.260 align:middle line:84%
10,000 years later,
that technology

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.760 align:middle line:84%
that you put down next to the
pyramid is going to be dust.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:11.560 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.510 align:middle line:84%
So we know that for
a fact, because we

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:16.300 align:middle line:84%
experienced rust and everything
else here just in a few years.

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.210 align:middle line:84%
If you have a car
near the ocean or you

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:21.333 align:middle line:84%
have a car that drives
in a lot of salt

00:34:21.333 --> 00:34:23.500 align:middle line:84%
when it's in the winter
months like in New York City

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.290 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, the salt eats away
and rusts out your vehicle.

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:30.139 align:middle line:84%
So we know that technology
disintegrates over time.

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:33.219 align:middle line:84%
And so I think some of it has
disintegrated over time as well

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:36.520 align:middle line:84%
as the fact that I believe
after the last Pyramid War,

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.370 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of the
technology was stripped out

00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:42.790 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of the pyramids
and temples and taken away.

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:46.122 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the capstones of
majority of the pyramids,

00:34:46.122 --> 00:34:47.580 align:middle line:84%
I believe that they
were taking off

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:50.460 align:middle line:84%
and removed purposefully
to prevent people

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.620 align:middle line:84%
from accessing the energy
source or the power

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:53.909 align:middle line:90%
source or the technology.

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Whatever that finishing piece
of the structure accomplished,

00:34:56.790 --> 00:35:00.120 align:middle line:84%
I believe that that was taken
away as well by these people.

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose of
that was to prevent us

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:05.970 align:middle line:84%
from being able to
expedite our progress

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:07.678 align:middle line:90%
with technological advancement.

00:35:07.678 --> 00:35:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe that a
lot of it was taken away.

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And some of it, to be honest,
it just disintegrated over time.

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:14.940 align:middle line:90%
A massive amount of time.

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's my
personal experience,

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:18.321 align:middle line:90%
personal understanding of it.

00:35:18.321 --> 00:35:21.618 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:21.618 --> 00:35:22.560 align:middle line:90%


00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Hugh Newman.

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Hugh, it has been written
that some giant skeletons had

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:31.440 align:middle line:84%
extra digits and even
two rows of teeth.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.480 align:middle line:90%
Do you believe these to be real?

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And if so, do you think these
variations in such skeletons

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:40.860 align:middle line:84%
are a normal process
of evolution?

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Ooh, OK.

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.740 align:middle line:90%
So this is a weird one.

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:46.440 align:middle line:84%
This is something we've
come across, especially

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.780 align:middle line:90%
really mainly in North America.

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:51.780 align:middle line:84%
As you can see up here,
we've got all these accounts.

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.280 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we've got
an entire chapter

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.920 align:middle line:84%
devoted to this in our
book, "Giants on Record,"

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.740 align:middle line:84%
where there are
reports of what are

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.900 align:middle line:90%
called double rows of teeth.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes there
were triple rows

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:06.180 align:middle line:84%
of teeth in some of the jaws,
as we found in Amelia Island

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:09.000 align:middle line:84%
in Florida reported
in the mid-1800s.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.470 align:middle line:84%
But we have about 30,
maybe possibly 50 accounts.

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are quite unusual
descriptions of this phenomena

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:21.990 align:middle line:84%
the giant skeletons dug up from
the mounds and from the deserts

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:25.410 align:middle line:84%
and even from megalithic
sites in North America.

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Now sometimes you just
have a few extra teeth,

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:29.820 align:middle line:90%
like supernumerary teeth.

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:32.160 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be fully
fledged hypodontia

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.460 align:middle line:84%
which is like extra teeth,
abnormal growth in the mouth.

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:38.010 align:middle line:84%
But some of these
accounts are very strange,

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:39.570 align:middle line:90%
because they have clear--

00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:42.450 align:middle line:90%
two rows of teeth in each jaw.

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Now this is something
that has been

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:48.180 align:middle line:84%
noted is, do get genetic
throwbacks in modern times?

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:51.720 align:middle line:84%
But usually, these appear
in very, very tall people.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And I've had-- since
the book came out

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:56.310 align:middle line:84%
and since we did our TV show
about this, but lots of people

00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:57.570 align:middle line:90%
contacted us.

00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:59.370 align:middle line:84%
One of the things we
did in the TV show

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:06.810 align:middle line:84%
was interview Dr. Shara
Bailey of New York University,

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:08.460 align:middle line:90%
who's a dental anthropologist.

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And we showed her
all these accounts.

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:11.340 align:middle line:90%
Any photos we had.

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:12.840 align:middle line:90%
And she was absolutely stunned.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And what she realized, and
the only real explanation how

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.390 align:middle line:84%
this could keep
happening is there's

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:23.010 align:middle line:84%
some genetic line which could
be connected with a very

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:24.630 align:middle line:90%
early ancestor of human.

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:25.710 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps the Denisovans.

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:26.970 align:middle line:90%
We don't know yet.

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And these are genetic
throwbacks occurring.

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And they are kind of bred,
especially in North America,

00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:36.870 align:middle line:84%
between elite groups to
maintain these giant genes.

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And it got to a point
where extra rows of teeth

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:41.970 align:middle line:84%
would be created,
almost like just

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:45.120 align:middle line:84%
to fill up the gap in
the giant jaws that

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.295 align:middle line:90%
are occurring in North America.

00:37:47.295 --> 00:37:48.420 align:middle line:90%
But we have other accounts.

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:52.500 align:middle line:90%
We have stories from Ireland.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.630 align:middle line:84%
We have like hte
mythological stories

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:57.640 align:middle line:84%
of some of the giant kings
had double rows of teeth.

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:00.550 align:middle line:84%
They had extra
digits on each hand.

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:02.430 align:middle line:90%
We have stories of--

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:05.100 align:middle line:84%
we actually have
accounts, one from Dorset,

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:08.790 align:middle line:84%
and one from the Outer Hebrides,
where they were-- in Britain,

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:11.700 align:middle line:84%
where they've actually found
extra teeth in the jaws

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:12.720 align:middle line:90%
of certain individuals.

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And we feature that
in our latest book.

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:17.280 align:middle line:84%
But we also have the digits,
the extra fingers and toes.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.480 align:middle line:90%
Now this is an anomaly.

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:21.150 align:middle line:84%
My co-author and good
friend Jim Vieira

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:22.860 align:middle line:90%
is the real expert on it.

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:24.900 align:middle line:84%
He's done a whole
lecture about this.

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And he's found this
in more giant accounts

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.120 align:middle line:84%
than normal-sized
human accounts.

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:35.220 align:middle line:84%
So again, we seem to be finding
this kind of genetic throwback

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:37.500 align:middle line:84%
to very, very early
ancient times.

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And again, we have mythological
figures from the Bible.

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Like, I think it's the
fourth descendant of Goliath

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:47.760 align:middle line:84%
was said to have had six
fingers and six toes.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Some accounts from
the Bible have

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:54.030 align:middle line:84%
extra rows of teeth in the
mouth of the giant of Gath.

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's other stories
from all over the world where

00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:57.870 align:middle line:90%
we find this anomaly.

00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:00.480 align:middle line:84%
You also find
petroglyphs with, like,

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:04.170 align:middle line:84%
six fingers carved or painted
at certain places like in North

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:06.190 align:middle line:90%
America and other areas.

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And so the explanation is
quite a hard one to decipher.

00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:13.140 align:middle line:84%
But it appears, as
I said, like there's

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:16.260 align:middle line:84%
kind of genetic throwbacks
linked with these giant genes.

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And one of these giant
genes that we looked into

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:21.630 align:middle line:84%
was something
called the AIP gene,

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:25.870 align:middle line:84%
which is from the Ulster region
of northern part of Ireland.

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a gene that's at
least been recorded and traced

00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:32.070 align:middle line:90%
back at least 2,500 years.

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is the area where
Charles Burne, the Irish giant

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:37.110 align:middle line:84%
and many other kind of
relatively modern giants

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:40.260 align:middle line:84%
over the last few hundred
years, have come from.

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:41.490 align:middle line:90%
And it still happens today.

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:44.600 align:middle line:84%
The people are being born
with this AIP gene in them.

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't quite the same
as acromegaly or gigantism.

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And you do-- you're
quite well proportioned

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:54.650 align:middle line:84%
with this AIP gene, unlike
with these other pituitary

00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:55.760 align:middle line:90%
conditions.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And some people
have even suggested

00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.200 align:middle line:84%
this gene may have originated
from North America where

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.790 align:middle line:90%
we find the giants.

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Originally, I think,
like, America is actually

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:06.540 align:middle line:84%
the giant kind of
capital of the planet.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And so the fact that
you've got this occurring

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:12.260 align:middle line:84%
in this part of Ireland and
you have all these legends

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:15.770 align:middle line:84%
of these giant races,
like the Tuatha De Danann,

00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:18.890 align:middle line:84%
the Fomorians and others,
who again, some of them

00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:21.012 align:middle line:84%
were said to have extra
fingers and extra teeth.

00:40:21.012 --> 00:40:22.470 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
connection there.

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think the myths do record
elements of what was actually

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.300 align:middle line:90%
going on in prehistoric times.

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:31.520 align:middle line:84%
So there's more
research really needs

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.740 align:middle line:84%
to be done about this
double rows of teeth

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:34.700 align:middle line:90%
kind of phenomena.

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Because we presented this,
we've shown it to academics.

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And as usual, when
you're looking

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.000 align:middle line:84%
at unusual things
like this, there's

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.940 align:middle line:84%
very little interest from
that side of the kind of area

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:46.740 align:middle line:90%
of research.

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.480 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully more
will come out on that.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.780 align:middle line:84%
But for now, if you know
anyone with double rows

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:53.240 align:middle line:84%
of teeth or extra fingers,
please get in touch.

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:54.725 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:54.725 --> 00:40:58.190 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Andrew Collins.

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.630 align:middle line:84%
Andrew, over the
last 10 years, there

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:05.240 align:middle line:84%
have been numerous
theories about the function

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.460 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Pyramid in Egypt.

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:10.340 align:middle line:84%
What do you believe
its function was?

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, another good question.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:17.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm a conventionalist,
to be honest.

00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And for me, the Great
Pyramid probably

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:23.990 align:middle line:90%
was constructed around 2600 BC.

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:26.390 align:middle line:84%
I know there's lots
of theories suggesting

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:29.240 align:middle line:90%
that it's much older.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And I also believe that it
probably is a form of tomb.

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:38.690 align:middle line:84%
But I think the word
"tomb" really underplays

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:40.520 align:middle line:90%
what we're dealing with here.

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
think of a tomb, you

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:47.180 align:middle line:84%
think of going into a churchyard
and seeing a tomb or outside.

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, maybe
a box or a grave.

00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Or going inside a
church and seeing,

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.170 align:middle line:84%
you know, some kind of
monument or whatever.

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:56.632 align:middle line:84%
But we're not dealing
about that type of tomb.

00:41:56.632 --> 00:41:58.340 align:middle line:84%
We're not dealing with
that sort of tomb.

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:01.380 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about what might
be described as an ascension

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:02.180 align:middle line:90%
machine.

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:05.840 align:middle line:84%
I think that is a much
better way of looking

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:07.340 align:middle line:90%
at the Great Pyramid.

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And who would it have been
an ascension machine for?

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, the builder, the
traditional builder

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:16.820 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Pyramid, was Khufu.

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And he was one of the kings
of the Fourth Dynasty.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you know,
his immediate descendants

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:30.050 align:middle line:84%
were responsible for the
construction of the other two

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:32.540 align:middle line:84%
main perfect
pyramids, as they're

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:35.150 align:middle line:90%
called, on the Giza Plateau.

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:39.380 align:middle line:84%
Which is the second pyramid,
you know, the Pyramid of Khafre.

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
the third pyramid,

00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:42.920 align:middle line:90%
The Pyramid of Menkaure.

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, you've got these
three incredible monuments.

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the King's
Chamber in particular

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:56.540 align:middle line:84%
obviously was meant to be
the heart of this ascension

00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:57.690 align:middle line:90%
machine.

00:42:57.690 --> 00:43:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there is
a very strong possibility

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:09.170 align:middle line:84%
that the idea was to almost
project the soul of the pharaoh

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:12.620 align:middle line:90%
into some kind of sky world.

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Virtually through the actual
apex of the actual pyramid

00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:23.240 align:middle line:84%
itself towards some kind
of celestial or cosmic

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.630 align:middle line:90%
destination.

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Now obviously you'll be
aware of my good friend

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Robert Bauval's ideas
to do with Orion.

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:37.850 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
alternatives as well relating

00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:42.920 align:middle line:84%
to the alignments of the
three Great Pyramids of Giza.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And those that have read
my books like "The Cyngus

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:47.480 align:middle line:84%
Key" and "The
Cygnus Mystery" will

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:52.850 align:middle line:84%
know that Cygnus is also a very,
very important constellation

00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:55.100 align:middle line:90%
associated with Ancient Egypt.

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:58.460 align:middle line:90%
And what Cygnus represented--

00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:01.220 align:middle line:90%
by the way, Cygnus in Europe--

00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Euro and Eurasian tradition
is essentially a big bird,

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:07.070 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Usually a swan, but it
could also be a vulture.

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's, you
know, a sky figure.

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:14.060 align:middle line:90%
It's up there in the sky.

00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's identified
by different cultures.

00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:20.630 align:middle line:84%
But in Ancient Egypt,
Cygnus, the stars of Cygnus,

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:23.600 align:middle line:84%
of which the brightest
star is the star

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:27.410 align:middle line:84%
Deneb are actually
on the Milky Way.

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Where the Milky Way
breaks into two.

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And the Milky Way
in Ancient Egypt

00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:37.970 align:middle line:84%
was seen as the body of
a goddess known as Nuet.

00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:41.600 align:middle line:84%
You often see this
picture of this naked lady

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.500 align:middle line:90%
arched over the Earth.

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:45.940 align:middle line:90%
And that's Nut.

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And she was personified in the
night sky as the Milky Way.

00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you see that
as a literal impression

00:44:54.880 --> 00:45:00.400 align:middle line:84%
of this goddess, the position
where the Milky Way splits

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:05.680 align:middle line:84%
in two, where the Cygnus stars
are located, was her womb.

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And obviously beneath
that, obviously her legs

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:11.920 align:middle line:84%
were where the Milky
Way splits in two.

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And this area of the sky,
this womb, if you like,

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:20.620 align:middle line:84%
of the goddess was seen as an
entry and exit to the sky world

00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:23.860 align:middle line:84%
in amongst many different
ancient cultures

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:25.060 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:29.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for instance, in Native
American tradition, you have

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:33.220 align:middle line:84%
what's known as the path
of souls death journey.

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And this was a journey that
was adopted by at least 30

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:40.750 align:middle line:84%
to 40 different tribes,
all with variations

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:43.840 align:middle line:84%
of exactly the same
journey into the afterlife.

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And essentially
what would happen

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:50.080 align:middle line:84%
is that death, either the
deceased or the shaman going

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:54.310 align:middle line:84%
into an altered state,
would make a leap of faith

00:45:54.310 --> 00:45:57.130 align:middle line:84%
towards the horizon
at a particular time

00:45:57.130 --> 00:46:02.410 align:middle line:84%
where they would enter the Milky
Way via one of the key stars

00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:03.910 align:middle line:90%
in the constellation of Orion.

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:06.670 align:middle line:84%
That's why Orion is so
important in Ancient Egypt,

00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:10.330 align:middle line:84%
because it was like the first
bridge, the first doorway

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:12.400 align:middle line:90%
into the next world.

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And the soul would then
travel along the Milky Way

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:20.770 align:middle line:84%
until it reached the
Cygnus constellation.

00:46:20.770 --> 00:46:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And then it would be either
judged to be righteous

00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:27.070 align:middle line:84%
and it would go
into the afterlife.

00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Or if not, it would
be reincarnated.

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:32.260 align:middle line:84%
Or the soul would actually
be sent into oblivion.

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And this was what's known as
the path of souls journey.

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And the actual Milky Way
was that path of souls.

00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:41.530 align:middle line:84%
It was a road or river
into the afterlife.

00:46:41.530 --> 00:46:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Exactly the same thing was
going on in Ancient Egypt.

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:47.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Graham
Hancock talked all

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:50.080 align:middle line:84%
about this in his last
book, "America Before."

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:51.723 align:middle line:84%
But it's something
that, you know,

00:46:51.723 --> 00:46:53.890 align:middle line:84%
those that have read my
books like "Cygnus Mystery,"

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:57.070 align:middle line:84%
"Cygnus Key" will be very,
very much familiar with that.

00:46:57.070 --> 00:47:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And the pyramids, the
Three Pyramids at Giza,

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:06.190 align:middle line:84%
are perfectly aligned to the
three main stars of Cygnus.

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:08.860 align:middle line:84%
The so-called wing
stars of Cygnus.

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:12.580 align:middle line:90%
The bird in its form as--

00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:16.090 align:middle line:84%
well, in Egypt, it's probably
something like a hawk

00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:18.230 align:middle line:90%
or a falcon, basically.

00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And so those pyramids
were specifically placed,

00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:26.350 align:middle line:84%
specifically aligned so that
the soul could travel first

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:32.560 align:middle line:84%
to Orion and then journey on
into the afterlife via the womb

00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.720 align:middle line:90%
of the goddess Nut.

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's from within
this that the soul was

00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:43.270 align:middle line:84%
reborn into the afterlife,
into the second life.

00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:47.330 align:middle line:84%
The field of reeds beyond
the physical world.

00:47:47.330 --> 00:47:48.730 align:middle line:90%
So that's it, really.

00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:52.190 align:middle line:84%
So in summary, the Great
Pyramid, and its neighbors,

00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:56.470 align:middle line:84%
of course, was the end
product of a lot of evolution

00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:59.620 align:middle line:84%
that had gone on in Egypt
for many thousands of years.

00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:02.470 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, it's
an ascension machine

00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:06.526 align:middle line:84%
to project that soul
into the afterlife.

00:48:06.526 --> 00:48:07.930 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:09.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Maria Wheatley.

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Maria, locations of
Salisbury Plain in the UK

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:18.310 align:middle line:84%
are utilized by the
British military forces

00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:21.910 align:middle line:84%
and are considered off
limits to the general public.

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Maria, do you
think that there is

00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:28.030 align:middle line:84%
a reason for such military
bases in specific locations

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:30.010 align:middle line:90%
near to Stonehenge?

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:31.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.310 align:middle line:90%
Stonehenge is a power center.

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:36.520 align:middle line:84%
The biggest power center
in the British Isles.

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And close to it, if
you imagine, Stonehenge

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:42.130 align:middle line:84%
is right on the periphery
of the Salisbury Plain.

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:43.930 align:middle line:90%
And the Salisbury Plain itself--

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:46.390 align:middle line:84%
and it is a military
establishment--

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:49.930 align:middle line:90%
is 25 miles roughly by 25 miles.

00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:52.540 align:middle line:84%
You can't go onto some parts
of the Salisbury Plain.

00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:53.860 align:middle line:90%
You're denied access.

00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:56.650 align:middle line:90%
So it's likened to Area 51.

00:48:56.650 --> 00:49:00.130 align:middle line:84%
But more than that,
the Salisbury Plain

00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:07.840 align:middle line:84%
is an area that has up to 2,500
prehistoric monuments therein.

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:09.940 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of monuments.

00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And some of the most
interesting, intriguing,

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:17.840 align:middle line:84%
and fascinating burials
are in that zone.

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:21.290 align:middle line:84%
So it is very difficult. You
have to navigate the plane.

00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:23.800 align:middle line:84%
You have to work out if
there's a red flag flying.

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And if it is, you
can't enter it.

00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:29.520 align:middle line:84%
They use live ammunition and
it goes right over the heads

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:31.570 align:middle line:84%
over some of the
roads, as it were,

00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:35.080 align:middle line:90%
as you're traveling along it.

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:39.520 align:middle line:84%
But as well, Stonehenge
is often associated

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:42.010 align:middle line:90%
with time distortions.

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:44.410 align:middle line:90%
And I do past life regression.

00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And I had some very
interesting cases come my way

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:50.470 align:middle line:84%
from the military
who said that they'd

00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:54.280 align:middle line:84%
parked up their car along
a trackway very close

00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:55.630 align:middle line:90%
to Stonehenge.

00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And they'd had a ciggie,
a couple of cigarettes

00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:00.970 align:middle line:90%
and a couple of tins of beer.

00:50:00.970 --> 00:50:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, they're
having a good time.

00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And then what they
saw was these lights

00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:08.290 align:middle line:84%
come out of what
they thought was

00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:10.900 align:middle line:90%
the ground near some barrows.

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And these lights
came towards the car

00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:16.510 align:middle line:84%
and almost danced around
it quite hypnotically.

00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:18.130 align:middle line:90%
But they're from the military.

00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And they realized they could
triangulate and do this.

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.708 align:middle line:84%
And so they thought,
oh, it was, you

00:50:23.708 --> 00:50:25.000 align:middle line:90%
know, just one of those things.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And they'd heard of things
like earth lights, balls.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And that could
have answered what

00:50:30.130 --> 00:50:31.790 align:middle line:90%
had occurred with these lights.

00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:33.640 align:middle line:90%
So they go back to Lark Hill.

00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And I know there's
a chap here today

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:38.530 align:middle line:84%
from Lark Hill that
I've spoken to.

00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:40.300 align:middle line:90%
So they go back.

00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And then they are
under military arrest.

00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Because they've been absent
without leave for a few days.

00:50:48.490 --> 00:50:53.020 align:middle line:84%
So, and that was there, in got
out of a past life regression.

00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:55.660 align:middle line:84%
But they felt that it
had happened anyway.

00:50:55.660 --> 00:51:00.350 align:middle line:84%
So I think Stonehenge
can distort time.

00:51:00.350 --> 00:51:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what the military is

00:51:02.590 --> 00:51:05.420 align:middle line:90%
interested in as well.

00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And again, if we
look beyond the lay,

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:12.100 align:middle line:84%
if we look beyond earth
currents for one moment.

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And what is beneath Stonehenge
that would interest people

00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:18.190 align:middle line:90%
like the military?

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:23.740 align:middle line:84%
What's beneath Stonehenge
are two massive aquifers.

00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:26.200 align:middle line:84%
One is an aquifer of
groundwater that you

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:29.240 align:middle line:84%
get at places like the
Giza Pyramid, for example.

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:31.490 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a
large body of water.

00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:34.060 align:middle line:84%
But as an esoteric
water diviner,

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:36.460 align:middle line:84%
I know that there's
another type of water

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:39.010 align:middle line:84%
that I've often spoke
about in lectures.

00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's the water
borne within Gaia.

00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's independent
of rainfall,

00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:48.190 align:middle line:84%
and it produces
a spiral pattern.

00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:50.260 align:middle line:90%
Now water has memory.

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:51.140 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:54.670 align:middle line:84%
So I think how some
people can work with that

00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:58.270 align:middle line:90%
is the Akashic Record of Place.

00:51:58.270 --> 00:52:01.090 align:middle line:90%
It has information stored in it.

00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And also a little known fact
about Stonehenge is the first

00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:08.560 align:middle line:90%
stone to be raised wasn't.

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:09.850 align:middle line:90%
It was buried.

00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:12.910 align:middle line:84%
So the first stone went
down into the ground,

00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:16.100 align:middle line:84%
and then a stone
was placed upon it.

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I think the military
are interested in Stonehenge

00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:22.060 align:middle line:84%
because it has a lot of
different types of energy.

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:24.640 align:middle line:90%
It's also an Akashic Record.

00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And the energies when
you start to look

00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:32.170 align:middle line:84%
at how they flow into and out of
a monument is very interesting.

00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Because at Stonehenge,
they emerge.

00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:40.030 align:middle line:84%
Now when you have earth
energies emerging,

00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:42.640 align:middle line:84%
run by the altar
stone incidentally,

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:44.830 align:middle line:90%
you have a lot of power.

00:52:44.830 --> 00:52:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And it also is associated
with vortex energy.

00:52:48.730 --> 00:52:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And the military, you
only have to look to,

00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:54.970 align:middle line:84%
you know, country after
country after country.

00:52:54.970 --> 00:52:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And there's always
a little formula.

00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:01.480 align:middle line:90%
Vortex, ancient sites, military.

00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:05.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just Stonehenge,
it's all over the world.

00:53:05.350 --> 00:53:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Then when you start to look
how the military bases surround

00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:13.510 align:middle line:84%
Stonehenge is very
interesting as well.

00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Because you have-- it must be
about sort of seven miles away.

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:23.260 align:middle line:84%
You have our nuclear biological
testing center Porton Down.

00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Now that's right
on a straight lane

00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:29.650 align:middle line:84%
going out from the
Stonehenge environs.

00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:32.620 align:middle line:84%
So it seems that all of
their military establishments

00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:35.290 align:middle line:84%
are linked in with
ley energy as well.

00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:38.440 align:middle line:84%
That I believe that
they are neutralizing

00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:42.260 align:middle line:84%
in ways that, you know, they
do try to keep quiet about it.

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think they just,
like I said earlier,

00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:48.130 align:middle line:90%
they distort time as well.

00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:50.260 align:middle line:84%
As many of the
people on this panel

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:53.170 align:middle line:84%
know, and I've been to
Stonehenge year after year,

00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:56.810 align:middle line:84%
and I've been to Stonehenge
decade after decade.

00:53:56.810 --> 00:54:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And in 2010, I was really
excited because I actually

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:04.645 align:middle line:84%
was with Hugh in
2010 at Stonehenge,

00:54:04.645 --> 00:54:06.490 align:middle line:84%
you know, with
Michael Tellinger.

00:54:06.490 --> 00:54:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I was
bigging it up, as we do.

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was saying to the people
that were the participants,

00:54:14.830 --> 00:54:17.740 align:middle line:90%
it's coming into its power.

00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And a decade and a
decade before, it, like,

00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:22.330 align:middle line:90%
ripples through time.

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:24.490 align:middle line:90%
And it can get high res.

00:54:24.490 --> 00:54:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was coming into
its moment of power.

00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And that means if you go by the
greater trilithon, for example,

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:34.450 align:middle line:84%
you feel its energy field as
you're approaching that stone.

00:54:34.450 --> 00:54:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And that can change
your consciousness,

00:54:36.370 --> 00:54:37.660 align:middle line:90%
your spirituality.

00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:40.990 align:middle line:84%
Even, I believe,
your past karma.

00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:43.450 align:middle line:90%
So it's coming into its power.

00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:44.920 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, wow.

00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:48.290 align:middle line:90%
What a day this is going to be.

00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And so, we got--
if you remember,

00:54:50.650 --> 00:54:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Hugh, we were told to sort of
line up like schoolchildren

00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and told, you can't
touch the stones.

00:54:56.830 --> 00:55:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And from that moment
forth, when Stonehenge

00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:02.770 align:middle line:90%
could have been a place what--

00:55:02.770 --> 00:55:04.870 align:middle line:84%
when you go to
these ancient sites,

00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:07.480 align:middle line:84%
it's the place that
can change you.

00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:09.940 align:middle line:90%
Now imagine Avebury Henge.

00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:15.250 align:middle line:84%
The world's largest stone circle
can have up to 2,000 people

00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:17.470 align:middle line:90%
comfortably therein.

00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And you all got the same
intent, the same spirituality.

00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:23.320 align:middle line:90%
You're on the power lines.

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And it can bang, switch
people on like that.

00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:27.970 align:middle line:90%
2,000 people at any one time.

00:55:27.970 --> 00:55:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I think
these ancient sites were

00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:33.550 align:middle line:84%
being used in a good
way of increasing

00:55:33.550 --> 00:55:35.260 align:middle line:90%
people's spirituality.

00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think the military kind
of dampens that down greatly so.

00:55:41.590 --> 00:55:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And as well with
vortex energy patterns,

00:55:44.770 --> 00:55:48.790 align:middle line:84%
each type of earth energy
releases a pattern.

00:55:48.790 --> 00:55:51.460 align:middle line:84%
It's like a signature
in a way, and we

00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:53.770 align:middle line:90%
can decode those signatures.

00:55:53.770 --> 00:55:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And so if you go to
other ancient sites,

00:55:56.890 --> 00:55:59.530 align:middle line:84%
they will have
particular signatures.

00:55:59.530 --> 00:56:02.440 align:middle line:90%
Stonehenge is like a chapter.

00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, it
has energies emerging,

00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:07.300 align:middle line:84%
like the cobra coming
up out of the land.

00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:08.620 align:middle line:90%
Their alpha lines.

00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And it has earth currents that
terminate their omega lines.

00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:15.830 align:middle line:90%
And so it has everything.

00:56:15.830 --> 00:56:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And if we learn to work with
these different energies

00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:22.210 align:middle line:84%
in different ways, we can
co-create on an alpha.

00:56:22.210 --> 00:56:25.910 align:middle line:84%
We can release on an
omega type of energy.

00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:30.610 align:middle line:84%
So I think, you know, in its
most positive guise, Stonehenge

00:56:30.610 --> 00:56:32.740 align:middle line:90%
was the teacher of the people.

00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Stonehenge was the wisdom
keeper of the past.

00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
the military know,

00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:43.630 align:middle line:84%
and that's why they have
up to 16 military sites

00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:46.850 align:middle line:90%
surrounding Stonehenge.

00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:48.335 align:middle line:84%
I hope that answers
the question.

00:56:48.335 --> 00:56:51.170 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Barry Fitzgerald.

00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Barry, on occasion, do you think
folklore and mythology can help

00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:59.960 align:middle line:84%
bridge the gap
between our ancestors,

00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:03.050 align:middle line:84%
that is, until
science catches up?

00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I do think it's useful.

00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And the last question
that came through, I do

00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:12.350 align:middle line:84%
think that there
is some direction

00:57:12.350 --> 00:57:16.160 align:middle line:90%
that we can gain from that.

00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:20.210 align:middle line:84%
But there are also places
that we have to physically

00:57:20.210 --> 00:57:23.180 align:middle line:90%
endure, I find, from--

00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:25.910 align:middle line:84%
that originate within the
mythology and the folklore.

00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And like many in the panel who
have gone to these locations,

00:57:30.050 --> 00:57:35.030 align:middle line:84%
there is great learning to
be delivered by doing so.

00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And there have
been some locations

00:57:36.530 --> 00:57:40.550 align:middle line:84%
that have scared the absolute
bejesus out of me when

00:57:40.550 --> 00:57:41.510 align:middle line:90%
it comes to it.

00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And one of those locations was
back in my own home island.

00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And that place we labeled
the Island of the Dead.

00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:51.960 align:middle line:90%
This was a place of oracle.

00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And like the Oracle
of Delphi, this

00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:58.700 align:middle line:84%
was a place that you went
to to gain the knowledge

00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:00.830 align:middle line:90%
from beyond the veil.

00:58:00.830 --> 00:58:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, we heard many
stories of these places.

00:58:04.010 --> 00:58:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And investigating a lot of these
locations around the world,

00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:07.880 align:middle line:90%
you go, oh, yeah, yeah.

00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I've heard
this all before.

00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:10.967 align:middle line:84%
And you go and you
have your experience,

00:58:10.967 --> 00:58:12.860 align:middle line:90%
and you leave somewhat deflated.

00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:14.240 align:middle line:90%
This did not deflate.

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:16.370 align:middle line:90%
This scared the hell out of me.

00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:18.230 align:middle line:84%
We completely
underestimated what

00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:20.720 align:middle line:90%
we were about to step into.

00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was when dusk
started to settle

00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:27.740 align:middle line:84%
that this signature of
this island changed.

00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And we became aware that
we're not in Kansas anymore.

00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:35.610 align:middle line:84%
Because leading up to
that particular point,

00:58:35.610 --> 00:58:37.775 align:middle line:84%
we had church officials
that were telling us,

00:58:37.775 --> 00:58:39.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why you're
going to that island.

00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:40.850 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing to find.

00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Yet we have the
ancient maps that

00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:45.860 align:middle line:84%
were showing that, no,
there are structures here.

00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:47.450 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no, those maps are wrong.

00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:49.310 align:middle line:90%
You'll find nothing.

00:58:49.310 --> 00:58:51.950 align:middle line:84%
What we found what
was on those maps

00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:53.630 align:middle line:90%
when we went to that island.

00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:56.240 align:middle line:84%
But the problem was that the
only place that we could stay--

00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:59.840 align:middle line:84%
now, we may have forgotten
to mention to the church

00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:01.490 align:middle line:90%
that we were going to stay over.

00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:07.190 align:middle line:84%
But the only place that we
could stay were these pits.

00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Now this island
was not lived on.

00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:13.070 align:middle line:84%
Hadn't been lived on for
hundreds, hundreds of years.

00:59:13.070 --> 00:59:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Yet these pits, there was very
little growth within them.

00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:20.300 align:middle line:84%
It was like the
vegetation refused

00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:22.010 align:middle line:90%
to grow within these pits.

00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Now we were working
through vegetation that

00:59:24.290 --> 00:59:25.940 align:middle line:90%
was over our heads at times.

00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Yet we entered into these
areas where the pits were.

00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And they were the only
places that we could camp.

00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And it was during
that experience

00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:37.490 align:middle line:84%
of staying in those pits
that I was introduced

00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:41.120 align:middle line:84%
to this aspect of the
Neolithic spirituality

00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:43.730 align:middle line:84%
that I certainly was
not prepared for.

00:59:43.730 --> 00:59:47.527 align:middle line:84%
But that-- the experience that I
had there-- and I can tell you,

00:59:47.527 --> 00:59:49.610 align:middle line:84%
there are many people that
will head to the Amazon

00:59:49.610 --> 00:59:52.490 align:middle line:84%
and they'll drink ayahuasca
and they'll do everything else.

00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:54.080 align:middle line:90%
That is not enjoyable to me.

00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:59.030 align:middle line:84%
I do not like the idea of
purging myself from both ends.

00:59:59.030 --> 01:00:00.650 align:middle line:90%
That is not what I'm into.

01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:03.770 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even have a cup of
tea when I was on this island,

01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:06.090 align:middle line:84%
and I had the
experience of my life.

01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:08.670 align:middle line:90%
And it was so powerful.

01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:10.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very
powerful experience.

01:00:10.590 --> 01:00:13.400 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the church
tried to harness

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:15.350 align:middle line:90%
the power of that island.

01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:16.980 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't do it.

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:18.620 align:middle line:90%
They destroyed it.

01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And they duplicated the
island on another island

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.020 align:middle line:90%
on the same lake.

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Now you can still
go there today.

01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:28.370 align:middle line:84%
On the swipe of a
credit card for $80,

01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:31.820 align:middle line:84%
you can stay on that
island and experience

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:35.180 align:middle line:84%
the same structures that were
built on the original island.

01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:37.970 align:middle line:84%
But yet you can see
the original island.

01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:40.760 align:middle line:84%
You won't have the same
experiences from that place.

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:46.290 align:middle line:84%
That powerhouse is still there
in a remote part of Ireland.

01:00:46.290 --> 01:00:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was a place even
in the medieval period,

01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:52.730 align:middle line:84%
they knew that you went
there for your experience,

01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:56.180 align:middle line:84%
to learn from what was
coming through that veil.

01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:57.740 align:middle line:90%
Very, very dramatic place.

01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:02.190 align:middle line:84%
Very-- the power of that
place, I can't even express.

01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:07.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the language to
express just what it exudes.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.720 align:middle line:90%
But it was very, very dramatic.

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think that their
ancestral history,

01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:14.960 align:middle line:90%
it can give us knowledge.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.610 align:middle line:90%
And I have to say that being--

01:01:16.610 --> 01:01:18.800 align:middle line:84%
initially, after my
first experience,

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.000 align:middle line:90%
I says, I'm done with that.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going back
near that place.

01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:24.638 align:middle line:84%
And I left it for, I
must admit, maybe seven,

01:01:24.638 --> 01:01:26.930 align:middle line:84%
eight years before I decided,
OK, I'm going to go back.

01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:29.000 align:middle line:90%
But I'm going back in daylight.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.910 align:middle line:90%
And I went back.

01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very, very
dangerous lake in itself.

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:38.480 align:middle line:84%
So you can't take a
motorboat, you have to paddle.

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:41.090 align:middle line:90%
And we went back to the island.

01:01:41.090 --> 01:01:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And this was the
first place that we

01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:47.960 align:middle line:84%
were able to see where
this tunnel complex was,

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:51.150 align:middle line:84%
this cave complex,
what was left of it.

01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:54.870 align:middle line:84%
It was the first
time ever that we

01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:57.300 align:middle line:84%
were using
technological equipment

01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:01.200 align:middle line:84%
that we could record
that distortion in time

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.070 align:middle line:90%
you spoke about.

01:02:02.070 --> 01:02:04.650 align:middle line:84%
We got to see it
for the first time

01:02:04.650 --> 01:02:07.920 align:middle line:84%
that this location
has an effect on time.

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:11.430 align:middle line:84%
We were looking at this bridge
way between both places.

01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And scientifically,
we could see it.

01:02:15.030 --> 01:02:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And that was
exceptionally important.

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:18.450 align:middle line:90%
Still scared the hell out of me.

01:02:18.450 --> 01:02:22.560 align:middle line:84%
But it was a place I'm
aware of and I trust now

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:25.230 align:middle line:84%
that the power of that
place is so immense,

01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:27.840 align:middle line:84%
and it lifted me and
changed my paradigm

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:32.460 align:middle line:84%
of what I thought our world
was and what our ancestors were

01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:33.510 align:middle line:90%
in communication with.

01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:36.810 align:middle line:84%
So yes, there is a lot to be
learned from our ancestors.

01:02:36.810 --> 01:02:39.774 align:middle line:84%
And our science,
it's catching up.

01:02:39.774 --> 01:02:42.670 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:42.670 --> 01:02:43.470 align:middle line:90%


01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Billy Carson.

01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Billy, you once
wrote a hypothesis

01:02:47.370 --> 01:02:50.980 align:middle line:84%
based on your research that
planet Earth is, in fact,

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:53.370 align:middle line:90%
part of a binary star system.

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:56.010 align:middle line:84%
In more recent times,
your hypothesis

01:02:56.010 --> 01:02:58.470 align:middle line:90%
has been confirmed by science.

01:02:58.470 --> 01:03:01.750 align:middle line:84%
Billy, how did you come
to this conclusion?

01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:02.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:05.640 align:middle line:84%
You guys have some great
questions. (LAUGHS) Wow,

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:07.210 align:middle line:90%
you do some research.

01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:09.960 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I had
hypothesized that we

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:12.270 align:middle line:90%
live in a binary solar system.

01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:15.390 align:middle line:84%
That our sun is not
just a single sun

01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:18.960 align:middle line:84%
orbiting around the galactic
equator, but it actually are--

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.300 align:middle line:84%
we have in our solar
system two suns.

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And how I came to this
hypothesis, right around 2010,

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:29.290 align:middle line:84%
I kind of really got
deep into astronomy

01:03:29.290 --> 01:03:31.230 align:middle line:84%
and I became an
amateur astronomer.

01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And I started buying really
high tech telescopes.

01:03:34.690 --> 01:03:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And I started looking at the
precession of the equinoxes

01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:41.100 align:middle line:84%
and tracking it, just to
see how the ancients might

01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:43.620 align:middle line:84%
have tracked it or how the
Mayans might have tracked it.

01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Or how even now in modern day
science, how do we track this?

01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And through my measurements in
a very short period of time,

01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:52.597 align:middle line:84%
I realized if I projected that
time period out going forward--

01:03:52.597 --> 01:03:54.930 align:middle line:84%
and the precession is the
movement of the constellations

01:03:54.930 --> 01:03:56.250 align:middle line:90%
across the sky.

01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:59.923 align:middle line:84%
I discovered that
precession was speeding up.

01:03:59.923 --> 01:04:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying, why
would the precession

01:04:01.590 --> 01:04:02.970 align:middle line:90%
of the equinoxes speed up?

01:04:02.970 --> 01:04:04.050 align:middle line:90%
How can that possibly be?

01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:05.700 align:middle line:84%
What would cause
the stars to move,

01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:08.370 align:middle line:84%
the constellations to move
across the sky faster?

01:04:08.370 --> 01:04:10.320 align:middle line:84%
So I said, the only
thing that could be

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:13.560 align:middle line:84%
is that we must be
moving faster, right?

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And so our sun, which we
orbit, must be moving faster

01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:19.320 align:middle line:90%
through the galaxy.

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:23.068 align:middle line:84%
And in some way, creating this
speed up of the precession.

01:04:23.068 --> 01:04:25.110 align:middle line:84%
But I said, well, that
doesn't really make sense.

01:04:25.110 --> 01:04:27.260 align:middle line:84%
If our arm, if our galactic
arm is moving faster,

01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:29.010 align:middle line:84%
how could that still
create this movement?

01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Because we're all
moving at the same time.

01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And there would be more,
what we call red light.

01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, let me
look into this deeper.

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And I started finding
that in ancient text,

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:43.410 align:middle line:84%
there had been talk of--
talks of binary stars.

01:04:43.410 --> 01:04:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And that the Dogon
tribe but even

01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:46.860 align:middle line:84%
talked about a
trinary star system

01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:49.080 align:middle line:90%
that they had knowledge of.

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:51.158 align:middle line:90%
Or the series A, B, and C.

01:04:51.158 --> 01:04:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I wonder
if that means maybe we

01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:55.270 align:middle line:84%
have a binary or
trinary star system?

01:04:55.270 --> 01:04:57.240 align:middle line:84%
So I started digging
deeper into that.

01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And I found some really
incredible information

01:05:00.270 --> 01:05:04.470 align:middle line:84%
that was actually from the
NASA Space Agency, the European

01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:05.400 align:middle line:90%
Space Agency.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:07.770 align:middle line:84%
They had realized that
there was possibly

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:12.040 align:middle line:84%
a brown dwarf or a red
dwarf star orbiting our sun.

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:15.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be talking about
this in my lecture tomorrow,

01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:17.237 align:middle line:90%
so please don't miss it.

01:05:17.237 --> 01:05:19.320 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to bring
forth a lot of the evidence

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:21.960 align:middle line:84%
right there to you, where
astronomers now have finally

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:27.000 align:middle line:84%
discovered that there is a star
with a solar system orbiting

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.458 align:middle line:90%
our sun, right now today.

01:05:29.458 --> 01:05:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And so all the history
books are being rewritten,

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:34.830 align:middle line:84%
all the astrophysical books
are being rewritten for college

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:38.210 align:middle line:84%
and studies, because we now
know that there is another star

01:05:38.210 --> 01:05:39.010 align:middle line:90%
system.

01:05:39.010 --> 01:05:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And so as that star
orbits our sun,

01:05:41.610 --> 01:05:42.870 align:middle line:90%
they create a breakaway speed.

01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:44.403 align:middle line:84%
So it speeds up,
and it slows down.

01:05:44.403 --> 01:05:46.320 align:middle line:84%
As it needs more breakaway
speed, it speeds up

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.640 align:middle line:90%
and then it slows down.

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Now this is over
thousands of years.

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is over
about a 4,200 year period,

01:05:54.210 --> 01:05:57.180 align:middle line:84%
there is another mini solar
system with a brown dwarf

01:05:57.180 --> 01:06:00.270 align:middle line:84%
star which has got the
same mass as our sun,

01:06:00.270 --> 01:06:02.610 align:middle line:84%
but much, much
smaller and much more

01:06:02.610 --> 01:06:05.430 align:middle line:84%
dimmer sun that you can't
see with the naked eye,

01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:08.340 align:middle line:84%
only with-- if you
go into the telescope

01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:10.620 align:middle line:84%
system like
WorldwideTelescope.org,

01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:13.690 align:middle line:84%
you can put the telescope
into two mass infrared mode.

01:06:13.690 --> 01:06:15.180 align:middle line:90%
And then you can--

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:17.880 align:middle line:84%
right now, if you go into
the constellation of Leo,

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:21.450 align:middle line:84%
right by the lower right corner
of the constellation of Leo

01:06:21.450 --> 01:06:24.870 align:middle line:84%
and you zoom in, you'd be able
to see this brown dwarf there.

01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:28.380 align:middle line:84%
It's coming out of Leo
and it's orbiting our sun.

01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:31.620 align:middle line:84%
It's way far beyond
the orbit of Pluto,

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:35.130 align:middle line:84%
but still inside the
inner Oort cloud area.

01:06:35.130 --> 01:06:37.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's a part of
our solar system.

01:06:37.570 --> 01:06:42.120 align:middle line:84%
It's not, you know, a captured
star from somewhere else.

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:45.450 align:middle line:84%
It's in the same
vicinity way out there,

01:06:45.450 --> 01:06:46.780 align:middle line:90%
but still orbiting our sun.

01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- what's interesting is
this brown dwarf is giving off

01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:56.590 align:middle line:84%
gravitational waves-- something
I had predicted over 10 years

01:06:56.590 --> 01:07:00.290 align:middle line:84%
ago and was laughed at and
scoffed and told I was crazy

01:07:00.290 --> 01:07:04.120 align:middle line:84%
and a pseudoscientist, which
then NASA confirmed about four

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.530 align:middle line:90%
years ago and made it official.

01:07:05.530 --> 01:07:07.480 align:middle line:84%
That gravitational
waves actually do exist,

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:08.630 align:middle line:90%
they discovered that.

01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:11.768 align:middle line:84%
And so what's creating this
global warming, the importance

01:07:11.768 --> 01:07:13.810 align:middle line:84%
of this and what is creating
that global warming,

01:07:13.810 --> 01:07:17.680 align:middle line:84%
is actually the gravitational
waves from this binary star

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:19.690 align:middle line:90%
system that we're living in.

01:07:19.690 --> 01:07:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And when the stars
become closer together,

01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:26.380 align:middle line:84%
the waves from the brown
dwarf interacting with our sun

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:30.730 align:middle line:84%
create a ripple effect of
energy through our solar system.

01:07:30.730 --> 01:07:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And that energy goes
in and it warms up

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.987 align:middle line:84%
the cores of the
suns and the moons--

01:07:35.987 --> 01:07:38.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, the planets and
the moons in our solar system

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:41.270 align:middle line:84%
creating warming
of those objects,

01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:42.590 align:middle line:90%
of those spatial bodies.

01:07:42.590 --> 01:07:45.700 align:middle line:84%
So our entire solar system is
experiencing global warming

01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:49.620 align:middle line:84%
at the same exact time because
of this binary star system

01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:50.420 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:52.462 align:middle line:84%
And that's more evidence
that it actually exists.

01:07:52.462 --> 01:07:54.580 align:middle line:84%
As the energy from the
gravitational waves

01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:58.030 align:middle line:84%
goes into a planet or a moon,
it actually creates friction.

01:07:58.030 --> 01:07:59.830 align:middle line:84%
That friction warms
the planet or the moon

01:07:59.830 --> 01:08:01.000 align:middle line:90%
from the inside out.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Scientists now say that Saturn's
core is actually melting.

01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And if we were on Saturn,
if that was our planet,

01:08:08.650 --> 01:08:09.940 align:middle line:90%
we'd already be gone.

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:12.700 align:middle line:84%
The ice caps on Mars
are melting right now.

01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:15.970 align:middle line:84%
There's billions of tons
of liquid water on Mars.

01:08:15.970 --> 01:08:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Global warming on Earth is
not caused by exhaust fumes

01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:25.149 align:middle line:84%
and spray can-- hair spray
cans and cows passing gas, OK?

01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:26.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry, it's just not.

01:08:26.350 --> 01:08:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, do we have an appreciable
effect on global warming?

01:08:29.470 --> 01:08:30.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we do.

01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:34.510 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the ice core
data, the ice core samples,

01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:37.149 align:middle line:84%
and you can take that back,
it's like reading a book.

01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:39.550 align:middle line:84%
You can go back every so
many thousands of years,

01:08:39.550 --> 01:08:40.990 align:middle line:90%
you see a warming pattern.

01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And actually, we're not even
in the warmest warming pattern

01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:44.740 align:middle line:90%
that we've ever been in.

01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:47.390 align:middle line:84%
We're not even close to the
warmest warming pattern.

01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:49.330 align:middle line:84%
So there's even
cycles of warming.

01:08:49.330 --> 01:08:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And global warming,
at its highest level,

01:08:51.850 --> 01:08:56.037 align:middle line:84%
will create a ice age,
and we're not there yet.

01:08:56.037 --> 01:08:58.120 align:middle line:84%
So if that's something
you've been worrying about,

01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.420 align:middle line:90%
don't worry about it anymore.

01:08:59.420 --> 01:08:59.970 align:middle line:90%
It's just normal.

01:08:59.970 --> 01:09:00.770 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:09:00.770 --> 01:09:03.859 align:middle line:84%
But it's because it's a result
of this binary star system.

01:09:03.859 --> 01:09:08.410 align:middle line:84%
So my investigation into
astronomy and precession

01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:12.380 align:middle line:84%
led me to a hypothesis that
was then proved to be accurate.

01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:13.870 align:middle line:90%
That's how I found out about it.

01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:15.550 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:17.140 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:18.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Hugh Newman.

01:09:18.490 --> 01:09:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Hugh, your research
has taken you

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:24.670 align:middle line:84%
around the world investigating
the evidence for ancient giants

01:09:24.670 --> 01:09:26.859 align:middle line:90%
that once lived amongst us.

01:09:26.859 --> 01:09:30.819 align:middle line:84%
Hugh, have you ever discovered
the remains of giant weapons

01:09:30.819 --> 01:09:34.600 align:middle line:84%
that may have also been
used by the giants?

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:35.853 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

01:09:35.853 --> 01:09:37.270 align:middle line:84%
There's quite a
few accounts we've

01:09:37.270 --> 01:09:40.479 align:middle line:84%
come across where we've
encountered this, actually.

01:09:40.479 --> 01:09:43.510 align:middle line:84%
There's numerous ones
from North America.

01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:45.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, North America is
the homeland of the giants,

01:09:45.850 --> 01:09:46.720 align:middle line:90%
in my opinion.

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:49.300 align:middle line:84%
That's the proper
giant territory.

01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And we found huge axe heads
that are like-- some of them

01:09:53.410 --> 01:09:55.990 align:middle line:84%
are like, what, 36
pounds, 40 pounds.

01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.860 align:middle line:90%
And they're huge.

01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:58.240 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are like this big.

01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And they clearly were connected
to wood, rope, and everything

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:02.320 align:middle line:90%
else.

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:03.520 align:middle line:90%
And they'd been used.

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:06.370 align:middle line:84%
What they were used for, whether
they were hunting other humans.

01:10:06.370 --> 01:10:08.380 align:middle line:84%
We know there's a lot
of cannibalism going on

01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:09.490 align:middle line:90%
with these giants.

01:10:09.490 --> 01:10:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Or whether they were chopping
down wood or whatever.

01:10:11.770 --> 01:10:15.550 align:middle line:84%
But they're absolutely
ridiculous some of these.

01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a member of this
ancient artifacts preservation

01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:21.820 align:middle line:90%
society in America, and they--

01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:23.920 align:middle line:84%
there's people still
finding them today.

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:27.400 align:middle line:84%
There's people still finding
artifacts in North America.

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that
have been recorded

01:10:29.050 --> 01:10:33.220 align:middle line:84%
in history over the
last 200, 250 years,

01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:37.180 align:middle line:84%
have often been found along
with the giant skeletons.

01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Some of them even reported by
the Smithsonian Institution

01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:43.780 align:middle line:84%
in the annual reports
in the late 1800s.

01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Who then denied these
skeletons and artifacts ever

01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:50.150 align:middle line:84%
existed and disappeared,
the whole lot of them.

01:10:50.150 --> 01:10:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And so-- but people
are still finding them.

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:54.370 align:middle line:90%
I've seen some myself.

01:10:54.370 --> 01:10:57.130 align:middle line:84%
In our book, "Giants on Record"
and in a couple of videos

01:10:57.130 --> 01:11:00.790 align:middle line:84%
I've produced, we actually
had two amazing examples.

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And just to handle these
things that have been

01:11:03.130 --> 01:11:06.190 align:middle line:84%
dug out of mounds where
accounts of giant skeletons

01:11:06.190 --> 01:11:07.750 align:middle line:84%
were said to have
been dug up from.

01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:09.700 align:middle line:84%
One of them was near
Cahokia in Illinois.

01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Not Cahokia itself, but
another mound site near there.

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.110 align:middle line:90%
Another one was in Ohio.

01:11:14.110 --> 01:11:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think there
was another one

01:11:15.490 --> 01:11:19.580 align:middle line:84%
we saw actually from the
Mississippi area as well.

01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:20.650 align:middle line:90%
So that's North America.

01:11:20.650 --> 01:11:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And the other
artifacts that have

01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:25.780 align:middle line:84%
been found in Arizona and
Utah, like giant armor being

01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:29.020 align:middle line:84%
worn by some of the skeletons
found in some caves there.

01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:32.920 align:middle line:84%
We have-- in Britain,
we have a large amount

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:38.080 align:middle line:84%
of stories regarding
giant swords, armor,

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:40.870 align:middle line:84%
axes as well found
within the burials.

01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:45.250 align:middle line:84%
One of these was from Cumbria at
a place called St. Bees, where

01:11:45.250 --> 01:11:48.340 align:middle line:84%
a 13 and 1/2 foot
skeleton was found

01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:51.700 align:middle line:84%
in a field just when someone
was kind of, you know,

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:54.800 align:middle line:84%
basically working with
the wheat in their field.

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:56.800 align:middle line:84%
When they dug down, they
kept hitting, you know,

01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:00.280 align:middle line:84%
bits of rock, which are part
of this stone lined grave.

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And when they dug it up, there
was a 13 and 1/2 foot skeleton

01:12:03.370 --> 01:12:04.870 align:middle line:90%
with giant armor.

01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And this actually got passed
around to all the locals.

01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:10.180 align:middle line:84%
So there might still be
pieces of it lying around.

01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:12.107 align:middle line:84%
But we feature the full
account in our book.

01:12:12.107 --> 01:12:13.690 align:middle line:84%
So if like-- you
know, if anyone hears

01:12:13.690 --> 01:12:17.410 align:middle line:84%
about any giant pieces of
armor near St. Bees in Cumbria,

01:12:17.410 --> 01:12:19.330 align:middle line:90%
do get in touch.

01:12:19.330 --> 01:12:23.950 align:middle line:84%
We have other stories in
different parts of the world.

01:12:23.950 --> 01:12:25.750 align:middle line:84%
From South Africa,
we've got lots

01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:28.670 align:middle line:84%
of accounts of giant axe
heads, spearheads, and things

01:12:28.670 --> 01:12:29.470 align:middle line:90%
like this.

01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:31.570 align:middle line:84%
But there are
really quite a lot.

01:12:31.570 --> 01:12:34.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, and there was
one example, I believe.

01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:36.490 align:middle line:84%
I think-- I don't know if
this was a hoax or not.

01:12:36.490 --> 01:12:40.120 align:middle line:84%
But down in Ecuador, there
was Father Crespi's treasure.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And they found-- it wasn't
really a weapon as such,

01:12:42.670 --> 01:12:46.435 align:middle line:84%
but it was like a crown, which
was like this big, you know,

01:12:46.435 --> 01:12:48.490 align:middle line:84%
made of this certain
type of metal.

01:12:48.490 --> 01:12:50.020 align:middle line:90%
Gold, I believe, or copper.

01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:52.720 align:middle line:84%
With all these sort of
other pieces within it.

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:54.167 align:middle line:90%
And this hasn't been explained.

01:12:54.167 --> 01:12:55.750 align:middle line:84%
But again, that's
disappeared as well,

01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:58.090 align:middle line:84%
like much of Father
Crespi's treasure has.

01:12:58.090 --> 01:12:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And so, yeah, we got
a lot of accounts.

01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:02.350 align:middle line:84%
We do a whole chapter in
our "Giants on Record"

01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:06.610 align:middle line:84%
about North America called
Curious Artifacts, where

01:13:06.610 --> 01:13:08.800 align:middle line:84%
we go into lots and
lots of different things

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.000 align:middle line:90%
that have been found.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
list them all now.

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:15.520 align:middle line:84%
But there are, you know,
too many to ignore.

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:18.758 align:middle line:84%
And they're not just ceremonial,
like some people suggest.

01:13:18.758 --> 01:13:20.800 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of suggestions
that anything that's

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:23.290 align:middle line:90%
giant sized must be ceremonial.

01:13:23.290 --> 01:13:25.360 align:middle line:84%
There's even
Paleolithic hand axes

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:29.260 align:middle line:84%
which are three times the size
as they should be found down

01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:30.725 align:middle line:90%
in Kent in England.

01:13:30.725 --> 01:13:31.600 align:middle line:90%
And things like this.

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And these go back hundreds
of thousands of years.

01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:35.380 align:middle line:90%
So what was going on there?

01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:37.340 align:middle line:90%
Were the giants that long ago?

01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:39.700 align:middle line:84%
So to answer the
question, yes, there

01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:42.670 align:middle line:84%
are lots and lots of artifacts
found all over the world.

01:13:42.670 --> 01:13:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, many
have been lost.

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:46.780 align:middle line:84%
Many have been
deliberately disappeared.

01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:50.154 align:middle line:84%
But some are still on
display in various places.

01:13:50.154 --> 01:13:53.070 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:53.870 align:middle line:90%


01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:55.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Andrew Collins.

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.800 align:middle line:84%
Andrew, you have
spent numerous years

01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:01.820 align:middle line:84%
investigating and researching
Gobekli Tepe, an ancient site

01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:03.740 align:middle line:90%
situated in Turkey.

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Andrew, in your
opinion, who were

01:14:05.630 --> 01:14:08.600 align:middle line:84%
the founders of Gobekli
Tepe, and why did you

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:10.640 align:middle line:90%
come to this conclusion?

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's a good one.

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:12.980 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Gobekli Tepe, I
mean, most of you

01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:15.960 align:middle line:84%
will probably have
heard about it.

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:20.150 align:middle line:84%
This is incredible ancient
site in Southeast Turkey.

01:14:20.150 --> 01:14:23.150 align:middle line:90%
11,500 years old.

01:14:23.150 --> 01:14:26.930 align:middle line:84%
It confirms really it's almost
like the smoking gun of a lost

01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:31.730 align:middle line:84%
civilization that would have
existed in part at least

01:14:31.730 --> 01:14:33.890 align:middle line:90%
during the last Ice Age.

01:14:33.890 --> 01:14:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And almost certainly,
it's the point

01:14:36.410 --> 01:14:40.850 align:middle line:84%
I found, the cradle of
our modern civilization.

01:14:40.850 --> 01:14:43.670 align:middle line:84%
But from my own point
of view, the story

01:14:43.670 --> 01:14:47.030 align:middle line:90%
really goes back to about 1995.

01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And I was writing a
book back then called

01:14:49.490 --> 01:14:51.380 align:middle line:90%
"From the Ashes of Angels."

01:14:51.380 --> 01:14:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And what this did was to
look at all of the myths

01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:58.790 align:middle line:90%
and legends of these beings.

01:14:58.790 --> 01:15:02.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, I would say human
beings, flesh and blood beings,

01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:07.970 align:middle line:84%
that existed in some former
age in the Near East.

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:11.435 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere from Anatolia,
which is modern day Turkey, to,

01:15:11.435 --> 01:15:14.570 align:middle line:84%
you know, the other countries,
the Near East, Middle East.

01:15:14.570 --> 01:15:17.340 align:middle line:90%
And went under various names.

01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:20.060 align:middle line:84%
They're the Watchers,
the Nephilim, obviously

01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:22.430 align:middle line:90%
of Judeo-Christian tradition.

01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:26.360 align:middle line:84%
The Anunnaki of
Sumerian-Babylonian tradition.

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And in Iranian tradition, they
were known as the Immortals.

01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lots
of accounts of them.

01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:36.215 align:middle line:84%
They were said to
be an elite-- many

01:15:36.215 --> 01:15:39.590 align:middle line:84%
are often-- they were
said to be extremely tall.

01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was said that they gave
the rudiments of civilization

01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:46.640 align:middle line:90%
to mortal kind.

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And that it was from this
that civilization arose.

01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And all of these stories seem
to be focused around, you know,

01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:55.820 align:middle line:90%
a particular area.

01:15:55.820 --> 01:16:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And I began to pinpoint it
to Southeastern or Eastern

01:16:01.370 --> 01:16:02.510 align:middle line:90%
Anatolia.

01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:05.900 align:middle line:90%
The area of Sanliurfa today.

01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:08.180 align:middle line:84%
But also the mountains
just to the east.

01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
we were dealing

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:15.860 align:middle line:84%
with some kind of
elite-involving shamanism

01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:17.690 align:middle line:84%
and a particular
type of shamanism.

01:16:17.690 --> 01:16:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Shamanism involved with birds,
in particular, vultures.

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:25.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, again and again, it
talked about these individuals

01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:27.290 align:middle line:90%
wearing cloaks of feathers.

01:16:27.290 --> 01:16:29.300 align:middle line:84%
It's even there in
the Book of Enoch,

01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:32.060 align:middle line:84%
which talks all about the
Watchers and the Nephilim.

01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:34.880 align:middle line:84%
It talks about these
human angels wearing

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:36.200 align:middle line:90%
these cloaks of feathers.

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:39.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the idea
that angels had wings

01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:42.380 align:middle line:84%
is actually quite a late
development, really.

01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Probably came in no
earlier than about

01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:48.290 align:middle line:90%
the fourth or fifth century AD.

01:16:48.290 --> 01:16:50.210 align:middle line:90%
So I was writing about this.

01:16:50.210 --> 01:16:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And putting this book together,
working basically in the autumn

01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:57.980 align:middle line:90%
and winter of 1995.

01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And what I didn't realize is
that exactly the same time I

01:17:01.670 --> 01:17:05.240 align:middle line:84%
was writing this,
in Southeast Turkey,

01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:10.250 align:middle line:84%
the first spades were going
into the ground at Gobekli Tepe.

01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And this had been rediscovered
by a very enlightened

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:19.190 align:middle line:84%
German archaeologist by the name
of Professor Klaus Schmidt, who

01:17:19.190 --> 01:17:21.410 align:middle line:90%
sadly is no longer with us.

01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And he realized-- he
went up to this-- the top

01:17:23.570 --> 01:17:26.690 align:middle line:84%
of this mountaintop, and there's
this huge occupational mound,

01:17:26.690 --> 01:17:29.210 align:middle line:90%
or tepe, as they call it.

01:17:29.210 --> 01:17:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And he saw all of these
pieces of carved stone.

01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Now earlier, people had
seen these carved stone.

01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:38.000 align:middle line:84%
But they were so
advanced that they

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.980 align:middle line:84%
assumed that they belonged to
a culture that only existed

01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:44.600 align:middle line:90%
probably about 1,000 years ago.

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:46.670 align:middle line:84%
You know, equivalent
to the same time

01:17:46.670 --> 01:17:48.860 align:middle line:84%
as the Gothic
cathedrals in Europe.

01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:50.060 align:middle line:90%
And yet, no.

01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:54.050 align:middle line:84%
All of these carvings were
at least 11,000 years old.

01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And Professor Klaus
Schmidt realized that,

01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:59.300 align:middle line:84%
started the excavations
at Gobekli Tepe,

01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:02.090 align:middle line:84%
and uncovered these
incredible stone enclosures.

01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:03.980 align:middle line:84%
You can see, you
know, some of them

01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:05.970 align:middle line:90%
on the screen at the moment.

01:18:05.970 --> 01:18:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And they are massive
T-shaped pillars

01:18:09.890 --> 01:18:13.280 align:middle line:84%
with carvings of animals
and other creatures

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.660 align:middle line:90%
of the natural world.

01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Many of them have
anthropomorphic features.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.690 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they're
human like with hands

01:18:20.690 --> 01:18:24.230 align:middle line:84%
reaching around the front
narrow edges of the stones.

01:18:24.230 --> 01:18:30.080 align:middle line:84%
The actual T-shaped tops of
them are the abstract heads

01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:33.080 align:middle line:90%
of these human individuals.

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Now whether they
were the first gods,

01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:38.480 align:middle line:84%
whether they were celestial
beings or great ancestors,

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:41.540 align:middle line:84%
they still are a
matter of debate.

01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And very gradually,
from 1995 through to,

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:48.590 align:middle line:84%
you know, the current
decade, they've

01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:52.500 align:middle line:84%
been uncovering all of
these different enclosures.

01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And obviously I wrote a
book called "Gobekli Tepe--

01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Genesis of the Gods,"
which came out in 2014.

01:18:58.170 --> 01:19:01.710 align:middle line:84%
Which was a massive
bestseller not only,

01:19:01.710 --> 01:19:05.085 align:middle line:84%
you know, around the world,
but in Turkey itself.

01:19:05.085 --> 01:19:08.460 align:middle line:84%
You know, the people in
Turkey, you know, love this,

01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:10.210 align:middle line:90%
and it's very important to them.

01:19:10.210 --> 01:19:13.410 align:middle line:84%
But on top of this
is that recently,

01:19:13.410 --> 01:19:16.470 align:middle line:84%
the sister site of
Gobekli Tepe has

01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:19.890 align:middle line:84%
been discovered about
60 miles to the east,

01:19:19.890 --> 01:19:21.660 align:middle line:90%
at a place called Karahan Tepe.

01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is even
more sophisticated

01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:25.950 align:middle line:90%
than Gobekli Tepe.

01:19:25.950 --> 01:19:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's a site that
I'd been to on my own,

01:19:29.610 --> 01:19:34.740 align:middle line:84%
and with Hugh here and JJ,
whose partner on a number

01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:35.700 align:middle line:90%
of occasions.

01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:38.940 align:middle line:84%
But that was before these
incredible excavations

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:41.550 align:middle line:84%
that have taken place over
the last couple of years.

01:19:41.550 --> 01:19:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And this shows that at the
end of the last Ice Age,

01:19:44.610 --> 01:19:46.620 align:middle line:84%
that this civilization,
which I call

01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:48.390 align:middle line:84%
the civilization
of the ancients,

01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:50.820 align:middle line:90%
is even more sophisticated.

01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And this knowledge must have
been carried over from, well,

01:19:55.650 --> 01:19:57.720 align:middle line:84%
as I say before the
last Ice Age, certainly

01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:59.550 align:middle line:90%
during the last Ice Age.

01:19:59.550 --> 01:20:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And that these were
incredibly advanced peoples.

01:20:02.610 --> 01:20:05.430 align:middle line:84%
So that everything that I
wrote about from the "Ashes

01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:08.610 align:middle line:84%
of Angels" to do with the
Watchers, the Nephilim,

01:20:08.610 --> 01:20:10.860 align:middle line:84%
the Anunnaki, you
know, these are

01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:15.420 align:middle line:84%
the names of the
founders of civilization.

01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And that these stories were
passed on from generation

01:20:18.210 --> 01:20:20.890 align:middle line:84%
to generation until they
were eventually written down,

01:20:20.890 --> 01:20:23.490 align:middle line:84%
whether it be in Sumeria,
you know, Babylon.

01:20:23.490 --> 01:20:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Whether it be within, you know,
the Jewish Hebrew tradition

01:20:27.930 --> 01:20:30.420 align:middle line:84%
in things like the Book of
Enoch, the Book of Giants.

01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in the
Hebrew Bible itself.

01:20:32.890 --> 01:20:38.830 align:middle line:84%
So they preserve the memory of
these founders of civilization.

01:20:38.830 --> 01:20:41.220 align:middle line:90%
And that's what Gobekli Tepe is.

01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:44.880 align:middle line:84%
It is the point of foundation
of our own civilization

01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:47.580 align:middle line:84%
with massive implications
for everything

01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:50.910 align:middle line:84%
that came after, including
Egyptian civilization

01:20:50.910 --> 01:20:53.460 align:middle line:84%
and the construction
of the Great Pyramids.

01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And there's a book over
there called "The Cygnus Key"

01:20:56.850 --> 01:21:00.640 align:middle line:84%
that I wrote, which has most of
all of what I've just said in.

01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:02.140 align:middle line:90%
So check that out if you can.

01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:02.940 align:middle line:90%
Cheers.

01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:05.940 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:06.740 align:middle line:90%


01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Maria Wheatley.

01:21:08.090 --> 01:21:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Maria, Tilshead Barrow
one Salisbury Plain UK

01:21:11.810 --> 01:21:14.720 align:middle line:84%
is a location that has
captured your interest.

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:17.330 align:middle line:84%
What is it that makes
this particular barrow

01:21:17.330 --> 01:21:19.100 align:middle line:90%
different than others?

01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And what had been
discovered there?

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:21:22.010 --> 01:21:23.450 align:middle line:84%
Well I spoke
earlier that there's

01:21:23.450 --> 01:21:26.900 align:middle line:84%
different types of long
barrows that were Neolithic.

01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And going back sort of like
5,500 years, if you will.

01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And some of us
here probably have

01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:37.070 align:middle line:84%
been inside of a
megalithic long barrow,

01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:39.230 align:middle line:84%
like Wayland's
Smithy in Oxfordshire

01:21:39.230 --> 01:21:42.830 align:middle line:84%
or West Kennet Long
Barrow close to Avebury.

01:21:42.830 --> 01:21:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And on the Salisbury Plain that
I was talking about earlier,

01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:49.850 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't really
megalithic chambers.

01:21:49.850 --> 01:21:52.820 align:middle line:84%
They made them
surrounded by wood.

01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And so they built a
really long mound.

01:21:55.430 --> 01:22:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And you imagine, it's all kind
of paneled around the outside.

01:22:00.230 --> 01:22:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, I got interested
in Tilshead Long Barrow--

01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:07.430 align:middle line:90%
it's called Old Ditch Barrow--

01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:12.950 align:middle line:84%
because I decided to use
dowsing in a different way.

01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Because most people
use information

01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:17.690 align:middle line:90%
dowsing to ask a question.

01:22:17.690 --> 01:22:19.490 align:middle line:90%
And they get an answer.

01:22:19.490 --> 01:22:21.110 align:middle line:90%
Which is great.

01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:23.240 align:middle line:84%
But I thought, because
I come from like more

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:25.970 align:middle line:84%
of a druid Wiccan
background, what

01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:31.970 align:middle line:84%
if I asked the land itself,
what do you want me to find?

01:22:31.970 --> 01:22:34.020 align:middle line:90%
And what would happen.

01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:37.490 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to put a big
map up in my living room,

01:22:37.490 --> 01:22:42.260 align:middle line:84%
and I started divining the
ancient environs of Stonehenge.

01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's literally a method
that is so, so easy to do.

01:22:45.570 --> 01:22:48.350 align:middle line:84%
You go along one side of
the map and the other,

01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:53.270 align:middle line:84%
and you get a big X. X
marks the spot, literally.

01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And it kept going back
to Tilshead Long Barrow.

01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And at this time,
the elongated skulls

01:22:58.430 --> 01:23:01.650 align:middle line:90%
hadn't been discovered as such.

01:23:01.650 --> 01:23:06.050 align:middle line:84%
And so I decided on a
cold February morning

01:23:06.050 --> 01:23:09.360 align:middle line:84%
that something was
calling to me across time.

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:10.820 align:middle line:90%
And so I got out.

01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And it was literally
a freezing cold day.

01:23:13.070 --> 01:23:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And then, that was about
five years ago in 2015,

01:23:17.390 --> 01:23:20.330 align:middle line:84%
you could go onto this
magnificent mound.

01:23:20.330 --> 01:23:23.210 align:middle line:90%
And it has a spirit of place.

01:23:23.210 --> 01:23:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And that spirit of place kind of
touches your soul in some way.

01:23:28.650 --> 01:23:30.660 align:middle line:90%
And it really does.

01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:32.090 align:middle line:90%
And so I led on the mound.

01:23:32.090 --> 01:23:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And then I just thought, I've
got to find out who you are.

01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And who-- the what
sort of people

01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:39.710 align:middle line:90%
went into this long mound.

01:23:39.710 --> 01:23:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Because it was the biggest
in Northwest Europe.

01:23:44.450 --> 01:23:46.800 align:middle line:90%
No other mound is that big.

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:48.710 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, bingo.

01:23:48.710 --> 01:23:51.830 align:middle line:84%
I've hit hundreds and hundreds
of people that were buried

01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:53.510 align:middle line:90%
there in the ancient past.

01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Because Long Barrows were
communal burrows where

01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:59.750 align:middle line:84%
you could get up to 30,
sometimes hundreds people

01:23:59.750 --> 01:24:03.080 align:middle line:90%
went into particular barrows.

01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:05.960 align:middle line:84%
But it turned out
that it wasn't.

01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:08.420 align:middle line:90%
It contained just one person.

01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:11.160 align:middle line:90%
And that person was a woman.

01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:12.620 align:middle line:84%
It was the elongated
skull that I

01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:14.360 align:middle line:90%
said I went to Cambridge with.

01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:17.210 align:middle line:84%
But this is what's
happened since then.

01:24:17.210 --> 01:24:21.740 align:middle line:84%
I went back there in the time
when we should have gone out.

01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to go
there because, again, I

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:28.640 align:middle line:84%
have these like-- it's
like a calling across time.

01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And this time, the
calling came in a dream.

01:24:31.670 --> 01:24:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And this elongated skull
old woman came to me,

01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:38.030 align:middle line:90%
and she said, find my child.

01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And as a mother, that
touched my heart.

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:44.120 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to go back
to this massive barrow.

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, it snakes
across Salisbury Plain.

01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And what the military
had done, because people

01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:52.500 align:middle line:84%
that had read my book and
listened to, you know,

01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Gaia TV interviews and things
like that, their beauty

01:24:55.970 --> 01:24:57.110 align:middle line:90%
touched the landscape.

01:24:57.110 --> 01:24:59.960 align:middle line:84%
Because they were making
little clooties, ribbons,

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:02.600 align:middle line:84%
tying them on the tree
and saying prayers

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:04.220 align:middle line:90%
to this Neolithic woman.

01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:06.080 align:middle line:90%
That was very short.

01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:08.960 align:middle line:84%
She was four foot eight,
quite like Queen Nefertiti.

01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And she-- her skull was
very, very extended.

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:16.100 align:middle line:84%
Because I've discovered
two races of elongated

01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:17.060 align:middle line:90%
skulled people.

01:25:17.060 --> 01:25:21.680 align:middle line:84%
I call one the hyperelongated,
and the other, the lesser

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:23.030 align:middle line:90%
elongated.

01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:26.330 align:middle line:84%
So people will come in here,
paying homage, remembering

01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:29.090 align:middle line:84%
the spirituality of
the Salisbury Plain.

01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And for one moment
in time, forgetting

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:35.190 align:middle line:84%
that it was Area 51 if you
could have the right to go on.

01:25:35.190 --> 01:25:38.120 align:middle line:84%
So this is what the military
did in their response.

01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:42.867 align:middle line:84%
They started to put no entry
signs up across her barrow.

01:25:42.867 --> 01:25:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And it was crazy, really,
because the fence is only four

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:46.000 align:middle line:90%
foot.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.293 align:middle line:90%
So I just hop over the fence.

01:25:47.293 --> 01:25:48.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was
a bit ridiculous.

01:25:48.710 --> 01:25:50.930 align:middle line:84%
I was going to put
a fence, so come on.

01:25:50.930 --> 01:25:53.030 align:middle line:90%
Put a fence up, man.

01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:55.720 align:middle line:90%
And then, what they did--

01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:58.220 align:middle line:84%
and I went back and I thought,
well that's a joke, you know.

01:25:58.220 --> 01:26:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And then I went back there
two months later, yeah,

01:26:01.730 --> 01:26:04.160 align:middle line:84%
to see, again,
what was going on.

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.300 align:middle line:84%
Because you get this
calling across time.

01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:09.020 align:middle line:84%
You know what I mean, the
sensitive people here.

01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:11.750 align:middle line:90%
And you can't not listen to it.

01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And this time what
the military did,

01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:17.960 align:middle line:90%
they covered it in wire mesh.

01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:22.730 align:middle line:84%
So it was like a Faraday
cage placed over this barrow.

01:26:22.730 --> 01:26:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I tried to tug and
tug at it like you do,

01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:28.340 align:middle line:90%
but it was really nailed in.

01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:31.050 align:middle line:84%
So I was with a
friend, and I said,

01:26:31.050 --> 01:26:34.970 align:middle line:84%
let's get some wire clippers
and start clipping some off.

01:26:34.970 --> 01:26:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Because imagine that a long
barrow, and this one's huge,

01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:42.140 align:middle line:84%
is it-- like I said, it's the
biggest in Northwest Europe.

01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when an energy
currents flows along

01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:50.210 align:middle line:84%
the axis line of it,
some earth currents

01:26:50.210 --> 01:26:54.200 align:middle line:84%
are deemed special, recognized
by our ancient ancestors.

01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:59.000 align:middle line:84%
Because they pulse out energy
in seven, eight, or nines.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And we can, you know, literally
rebalance our chakra systems

01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:03.980 align:middle line:90%
upon these.

01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Glastonbury Abbey has an
access line like that.

01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And some of the other long
barrows in the area, especially

01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:12.290 align:middle line:90%
Wayland's Smithy.

01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:15.065 align:middle line:84%
So I was trying to
hack away at these--

01:27:15.065 --> 01:27:17.690 align:middle line:84%
you know, making holes so
the energy could symbolically

01:27:17.690 --> 01:27:18.800 align:middle line:90%
come back again.

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:22.913 align:middle line:84%
And then, unbeknown to me, you
know, there was a warden there.

01:27:22.913 --> 01:27:24.830 align:middle line:84%
So this time, you know,
they're really saying,

01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:26.000 align:middle line:90%
could you get off the mound?

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.350 align:middle line:90%
Get off the mound and go down.

01:27:28.350 --> 01:27:31.530 align:middle line:84%
So I had to get off the
mound and literally go down.

01:27:31.530 --> 01:27:33.420 align:middle line:90%
But this is the thing.

01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:35.420 align:middle line:84%
If they think that we're
going to be empowered

01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:39.110 align:middle line:84%
with love, beauty,
harmony, and balance, bang,

01:27:39.110 --> 01:27:40.550 align:middle line:90%
they tried to stop it.

01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's where people
like you and I can come in.

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:45.860 align:middle line:84%
We can free up these
monuments and just say, no.

01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And we can free up these
places and say, yes, we

01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:51.380 align:middle line:84%
can go there to
feel the energies.

01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:53.330 align:middle line:84%
To be with the
spirit of the place

01:27:53.330 --> 01:27:56.356 align:middle line:84%
and to be with
the ancestors old.

01:27:56.356 --> 01:27:58.250 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:27:58.250 --> 01:27:59.050 align:middle line:90%


01:27:59.050 --> 01:28:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Barry Fitzgerald.

01:28:00.910 --> 01:28:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Barry, throughout
our history, there

01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:07.030 align:middle line:84%
are details that suggest that
we are encountering today

01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:10.060 align:middle line:84%
on a supernatural
level the same as what

01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:12.040 align:middle line:90%
our ancestors encountered.

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:16.090 align:middle line:84%
Barry, do you also
see these connections?

01:28:16.090 --> 01:28:18.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, we do.

01:28:18.690 --> 01:28:23.830 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of the more ancient
stories which are available

01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:29.350 align:middle line:10%
online through our--
the Irish government, we

01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:31.480 align:middle line:10%
can see this correlation.

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And especially if we consider
within ufology for instance,

01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:38.080 align:middle line:84%
the idea of a cylinder,
which we would

01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:40.600 align:middle line:90%
identify in the modern sense.

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:45.340 align:middle line:84%
We have accounts written
in our older texts

01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:49.420 align:middle line:84%
that speak of people being
on lake shores watching this,

01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:52.600 align:middle line:84%
and they label it
the Ghost Train.

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:55.540 align:middle line:84%
They see this carriage
coming across the sky

01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:57.940 align:middle line:90%
and lowering itself into water.

01:28:57.940 --> 01:29:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And this huge amount
of heat that's

01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:04.330 align:middle line:84%
presented by this
particular ghost carriage

01:29:04.330 --> 01:29:06.310 align:middle line:90%
raises up steam into the air.

01:29:06.310 --> 01:29:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And then it raises and then dips
into an ancient passage chamber

01:29:11.770 --> 01:29:13.570 align:middle line:84%
and is gone, is
never seen again.

01:29:13.570 --> 01:29:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, they also described
the windows along the side.

01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:19.840 align:middle line:84%
Now that today is clearly
identifiable within ufology

01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:21.500 align:middle line:90%
as being a cylinder.

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:23.350 align:middle line:90%
So we do see these connections.

01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:25.720 align:middle line:90%
And the stories are tenfold.

01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:29.500 align:middle line:84%
We have-- Ireland is
one of those countries

01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:32.260 align:middle line:84%
around the world that
has taken that heritage

01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:34.600 align:middle line:84%
and put it online,
scanned the details

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:37.150 align:middle line:84%
and put it online
for everyone to look

01:29:37.150 --> 01:29:40.090 align:middle line:90%
at from a global perspective.

01:29:40.090 --> 01:29:42.910 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- the secrets
are not being held,

01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:44.680 align:middle line:90%
they're being given.

01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to us then that we
can go online and look at those

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.650 align:middle line:84%
and grab those
connections for ourselves.

01:29:51.650 --> 01:29:55.030 align:middle line:84%
So there's nothing being hidden
away from our perspective.

01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:57.370 align:middle line:84%
But yes, we do see
this correlation

01:29:57.370 --> 01:30:00.160 align:middle line:84%
between what our ancestors
were dealing with before

01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:01.660 align:middle line:84%
and what they're
dealing with now.

01:30:01.660 --> 01:30:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And that goes as
well, and that neatly

01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:07.510 align:middle line:84%
slips into this avenue,
this strange avenue

01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:09.040 align:middle line:90%
of animal mutilation.

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:12.340 align:middle line:84%
We also see this within
our ancient past.

01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And migrates itself
right through today.

01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:17.710 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that
what we're trying

01:30:17.710 --> 01:30:22.300 align:middle line:84%
to identify with
continually changed its mask

01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:24.320 align:middle line:90%
over the period of time.

01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes several
times in a generation.

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:31.150 align:middle line:84%
So for us, it was about stepping
behind that particular veil

01:30:31.150 --> 01:30:33.760 align:middle line:84%
to see, well, what
actually is this?

01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:36.700 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the indicators now
are suggesting that we're

01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:40.150 align:middle line:90%
looking at the same source.

01:30:40.150 --> 01:30:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, there
is, there is a lot

01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:44.710 align:middle line:84%
to be seen within
those particular files.

01:30:44.710 --> 01:30:46.480 align:middle line:84%
But I'll end there,
because I could really

01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:48.670 align:middle line:90%
go on and on and on.

01:30:48.670 --> 01:30:51.550 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:30:51.550 --> 01:30:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Billy Carson.

01:30:52.810 --> 01:30:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Billy, over the last
five years, there

01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:57.070 align:middle line:84%
has been information
come forward

01:30:57.070 --> 01:31:01.150 align:middle line:84%
from scientists stating that
a genetically coded number was

01:31:01.150 --> 01:31:03.520 align:middle line:90%
created within the human genome.

01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:06.580 align:middle line:90%
This being the number 37.

01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:09.580 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe this could
be evidence of tampering,

01:31:09.580 --> 01:31:14.020 align:middle line:84%
or intelligent design
by extraterrestrials?

01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so there's been a lot
of evidence coming forward.

01:31:17.470 --> 01:31:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And really, it started
beyond five years ago.

01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Bruce Lipton talked about
epigenetics over 20 years ago.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And he was also
scrutinized, laughed

01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:31.000 align:middle line:84%
at by his own peers
in his own field

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:34.220 align:middle line:84%
and almost ostracized
and decided to walk away

01:31:34.220 --> 01:31:35.020 align:middle line:90%
for a little while.

01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:37.940 align:middle line:84%
But now, all of this is
now come full circle.

01:31:37.940 --> 01:31:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And again, he has
now been vindicated.

01:31:40.570 --> 01:31:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And when you look into the
ancient Sumerian tablets,

01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:45.880 align:middle line:84%
particularly into the
Enuma Elish and the Seven

01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Tablets of Creation and
the Atra-Hasis epic,

01:31:48.850 --> 01:31:50.750 align:middle line:84%
you discover something
very interesting.

01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:53.110 align:middle line:84%
There was a time
period where there

01:31:53.110 --> 01:31:55.060 align:middle line:90%
was a hominid on this planet.

01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And at some point
during that time period,

01:31:57.940 --> 01:32:00.010 align:middle line:84%
according to these
tablets, there

01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:02.320 align:middle line:84%
was going to be a
modification to this hominid.

01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:03.460 align:middle line:90%
And how do we come to this?

01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was this
EGG working class being.

01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:08.545 align:middle line:84%
They were also
known as Anunnaki,

01:32:08.545 --> 01:32:10.420 align:middle line:84%
but they were like the
working class Anunnaki

01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:12.040 align:middle line:90%
according to the tablets.

01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And they were working and doing
labor for a very long time

01:32:15.370 --> 01:32:17.110 align:middle line:90%
and very frustrated that--

01:32:17.110 --> 01:32:19.100 align:middle line:90%
with the workload.

01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:22.890 align:middle line:84%
They were actually, according
to the tablets, working on Mars.

01:32:22.890 --> 01:32:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And I guess they were
mining for resources

01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:25.848 align:middle line:90%
and working on civilizations.

01:32:25.848 --> 01:32:28.982 align:middle line:84%
They were also on Earth, digging
canals and everything else.

01:32:28.982 --> 01:32:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And they decided they
were going to have a coup

01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:32.110 align:middle line:90%
against the kings of Earth--

01:32:32.110 --> 01:32:33.580 align:middle line:90%
Enki, Enlil, Anu.

01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
encircled their campus

01:32:36.190 --> 01:32:37.660 align:middle line:90%
where they were located.

01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And there was this long talk
that goes back and forth

01:32:40.330 --> 01:32:42.670 align:middle line:84%
in this text, where
they're, you know,

01:32:42.670 --> 01:32:45.190 align:middle line:84%
negotiating whether they're
going to fight or not fight.

01:32:45.190 --> 01:32:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, they
come to the agreement

01:32:47.110 --> 01:32:49.420 align:middle line:84%
that they can take the
existing homonid on this planet

01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:51.160 align:middle line:90%
and add their essence to it.

01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:55.510 align:middle line:84%
That is for me the point in
which genetic modification took

01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:56.473 align:middle line:90%
place.

01:32:56.473 --> 01:32:57.890 align:middle line:84%
There's also some
more information

01:32:57.890 --> 01:33:01.130 align:middle line:84%
with regards to the
Tower of Babel incident

01:33:01.130 --> 01:33:05.630 align:middle line:84%
where Yahweh, who's in the
Bible, really is Enlil.

01:33:05.630 --> 01:33:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And he comes back and he
sees human beings building

01:33:08.090 --> 01:33:09.950 align:middle line:90%
this tower into heaven.

01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:12.617 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
there's a decision

01:33:12.617 --> 01:33:14.450 align:middle line:84%
made that, wow, human
beings can do whatever

01:33:14.450 --> 01:33:16.490 align:middle line:84%
they want to do if they
really live long enough

01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:19.220 align:middle line:90%
and focus and join and unite.

01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:20.400 align:middle line:90%
They can achieve anything.

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:21.942 align:middle line:84%
So I tell you what
we're going to do.

01:33:21.942 --> 01:33:23.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to destroy this tower.

01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to
confuse their languages,

01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:27.350 align:middle line:84%
spread them all out
around the world.

01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:29.558 align:middle line:84%
And then I think I'll
shorten their life span, too.

01:33:29.558 --> 01:33:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
you see in the Bible

01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:33.710 align:middle line:84%
where lifespans were
shortened to 120 years.

01:33:33.710 --> 01:33:36.110 align:middle line:90%
My seed shall not abide in man.

01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:38.180 align:middle line:90%
His years will be 120.

01:33:38.180 --> 01:33:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And so we see that
there's this clear cut

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.993 align:middle line:84%
path that was taken hundreds,
maybe close to 200,000 years

01:33:44.993 --> 01:33:46.160 align:middle line:90%
ago, in my personal opinion.

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:48.740 align:middle line:84%
It could be much sooner, but
my opinion is taking it back

01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:52.160 align:middle line:84%
to close to 200,000 years in
which a genetic modification

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:53.810 align:middle line:84%
happened to the
existing hominid.

01:33:53.810 --> 01:33:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Our own cousins, our relatives
that were already here.

01:33:56.690 --> 01:33:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Not an alien from outer
space, but our own cousins

01:33:59.330 --> 01:34:00.830 align:middle line:84%
were then genetically
modified where

01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:03.140 align:middle line:90%
they took out the telomere.

01:34:03.140 --> 01:34:05.390 align:middle line:84%
They took out the
chromosome number two.

01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And they actually fused
chromosome number two together,

01:34:07.970 --> 01:34:10.760 align:middle line:84%
and they put telomere
caps on each end.

01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:13.220 align:middle line:90%
And this shortened our lifespan.

01:34:13.220 --> 01:34:16.227 align:middle line:84%
And also when modern
scientists have gone back,

01:34:16.227 --> 01:34:18.560 align:middle line:84%
geneticists and looked at
this, they say, wait a minute,

01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:21.470 align:middle line:90%
this is an artificial mutation.

01:34:21.470 --> 01:34:23.730 align:middle line:84%
We can't really figure
out how it happened.

01:34:23.730 --> 01:34:26.210 align:middle line:84%
It would take millions of
years through natural evolution

01:34:26.210 --> 01:34:27.210 align:middle line:90%
for this to happen.

01:34:27.210 --> 01:34:30.110 align:middle line:84%
But we're estimating
around 200,000 years,

01:34:30.110 --> 01:34:32.510 align:middle line:84%
around the same time that
I believe it happened

01:34:32.510 --> 01:34:33.800 align:middle line:90%
based on Sumerian tablets.

01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's pretty
interesting that we

01:34:36.230 --> 01:34:39.500 align:middle line:84%
see that mankind
around this time period

01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:40.820 align:middle line:90%
was genetically modified.

01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Chromosome number two was
taken out and fused together.

01:34:43.490 --> 01:34:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Telomeres caps put on each
end of those chromosomes.

01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:47.480 align:middle line:90%
Now what does that mean?

01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:50.390 align:middle line:84%
A telomere cap contains
genetic buffer material.

01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And as your cells
and DNA replicate,

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:54.980 align:middle line:84%
which happens every
single day, it

01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:57.050 align:middle line:84%
shares some of that
information so that nothing

01:34:57.050 --> 01:35:00.050 align:middle line:84%
gets lost in translation so
that your cells and your body

01:35:00.050 --> 01:35:03.770 align:middle line:84%
can properly duplicate so
you can continue to live.

01:35:03.770 --> 01:35:06.830 align:middle line:84%
However, with caps on the
telomeres, what they've done

01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:09.680 align:middle line:84%
is as the buffer material
runs out in the telomeres,

01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:11.480 align:middle line:84%
they get smaller and
smaller and smaller

01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:13.730 align:middle line:84%
until they run out
of buffer material.

01:35:13.730 --> 01:35:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Once that happens, your body
begins the death process.

01:35:16.890 --> 01:35:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And so by this method, they've
shortened your lifespan.

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Now scientists at Harvard
have now taken mice

01:35:22.970 --> 01:35:25.610 align:middle line:84%
and have experimented with
this same technique on mice

01:35:25.610 --> 01:35:29.600 align:middle line:84%
and were able to then stop the
degradation of the telomeres

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:32.990 align:middle line:84%
on the mice, allowing them
to live up to three times

01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:35.070 align:middle line:90%
their normal lifespan.

01:35:35.070 --> 01:35:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And so this is now a
science that exists today,

01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:39.770 align:middle line:84%
genetic modifications that
exist today that we're

01:35:39.770 --> 01:35:41.360 align:middle line:90%
capable of doing right now.

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And I believe personally
that they just copied

01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:45.253 align:middle line:84%
what they learned
from the ancient past

01:35:45.253 --> 01:35:46.670 align:middle line:84%
or heard about in
the ancient past

01:35:46.670 --> 01:35:49.100 align:middle line:84%
and started experimenting
how can they duplicate it.

01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:53.960 align:middle line:84%
So now today, we can genetically
modify a human being.

01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:56.240 align:middle line:84%
I think we can
actually stop this--

01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:58.130 align:middle line:84%
the shrinking of
telomeres in humans,

01:35:58.130 --> 01:36:01.087 align:middle line:84%
just like the Anunnaki could
turn on or turn that off.

01:36:01.087 --> 01:36:03.170 align:middle line:84%
Because some people were
granted longer lifespans.

01:36:03.170 --> 01:36:04.295 align:middle line:90%
Well, how did they do that?

01:36:04.295 --> 01:36:05.940 align:middle line:90%
Another modification.

01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:08.602 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why it's important
to have conferences like this

01:36:08.602 --> 01:36:10.310 align:middle line:84%
where we actually come
together and learn

01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:11.450 align:middle line:90%
about this information.

01:36:11.450 --> 01:36:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And that we learn
how to, you know,

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.520 align:middle line:84%
remember our ancient
past, learn about what's

01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:19.010 align:middle line:84%
happening around us right
now, so that we can all unite

01:36:19.010 --> 01:36:20.510 align:middle line:84%
and take back control
of our planet.

01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:23.812 align:middle line:84%
Because if we don't, they're
going to start selling us time.

01:36:23.812 --> 01:36:27.186 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:36:27.186 --> 01:36:30.450 align:middle line:90%


01:36:30.450 --> 01:36:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:36:31.250 --> 01:36:31.850 align:middle line:90%
Thank you all.

01:36:31.850 --> 01:36:32.650 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:36:32.650 --> 01:36:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Ladies and gentlemen, this
brings our Ancient Alien panels

01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:36.870 align:middle line:90%
to an end.

01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:39.350 align:middle line:84%
I hope you've enjoyed
it as much as I have.

01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:42.650 align:middle line:84%
Please put your hands together
for our esteemed guests.

01:36:42.650 --> 01:36:44.750 align:middle line:90%
