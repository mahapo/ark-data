00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.120 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.430 align:middle line:90%
So OK.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.290 align:middle line:84%
It is afternoon, so good
afternoon, everybody.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.805 align:middle line:84%
Everybody having a
good time so far?

00:00:20.805 --> 00:00:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.630 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've got a lot
to talk about, clearly.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I could go on for
12 hours, but we won't.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.600 align:middle line:90%
We're going for one.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.640 align:middle line:84%
There are some basics really
which we need to address.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is all
about UFOs and aliens

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.390 align:middle line:84%
and ancient civilizations,
but how does the whole thing

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.530 align:middle line:90%
fit together?

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we heard Paul
Sinclair's wonderful lecture

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.970 align:middle line:84%
earlier on all about
cryptids, around Bempton,

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.540 align:middle line:84%
and the strange lights, and the
weird paranormal experiences.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.818 align:middle line:84%
And some of you must
have been saying, well,

00:00:53.818 --> 00:00:55.110 align:middle line:90%
how does this all fit together?

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.670 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And what I want to try and
do by the end of this lecture

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.510 align:middle line:84%
is at least give you an
idea of what is really

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.519 align:middle line:90%
happening in this world.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.840 align:middle line:84%
So right, OK, that's the name of
my book, "Origins of the Gods."

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.390 align:middle line:10%
And let's look at
a picture of a UFO.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.970 align:middle line:10%
Now, 1947 was obviously the
time when the modern UFO

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.890 align:middle line:10%
enigma began.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.020 align:middle line:10%
You obviously had
Roswell that year.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.090 align:middle line:10%
You had key sightings.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.730 align:middle line:10%
Kenneth Arnold sees
nine flying objects

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.460 align:middle line:10%
over Mount Rainier
in Washington State.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.070 align:middle line:10%
And I got into this subject
a good few years ago--

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.730 align:middle line:10%
far too long ago, almost
in a past life now, but--

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.600 align:middle line:10%
and I thought every UFO was
a spaceship-- nuts and bolts

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.400 align:middle line:10%
spaceship.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.250 align:middle line:84%
I thought that the smaller
ones were scout craft,

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.020 align:middle line:84%
the bigger ones
were motherships,

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.270 align:middle line:84%
and the little tiny
ones, the balls of light,

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.400 align:middle line:84%
were probes sent out
to watch humanity.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.270 align:middle line:90%
And that was that.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.800 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's what I believed.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And I believed that all
aliens were flesh and blood,

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.639 align:middle line:84%
that they came down here from
another planet, another star

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:09.509 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.420 align:middle line:10%
They were interested
in us, and the contact

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.520 align:middle line:10%
would soon take place.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.150 align:middle line:10%
We obviously all watched "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind."

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.480 align:middle line:10%
You think someday
that's going to happen.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.520 align:middle line:10%
But as I went on, I
started to realize

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.440 align:middle line:10%
that something was wrong.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.590 align:middle line:10%
Now, I'm not going to be
dissing anything which we've

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.440 align:middle line:10%
been talking about here
to do with aliens or UFOs

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.340 align:middle line:10%
being spaceships.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.180 align:middle line:10%
That's not what
I'm trying to do.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.150 align:middle line:10%
But what I'm going
to tell you is

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.450 align:middle line:10%
that something else,
possibly even bigger,

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.580 align:middle line:10%
is going on in the background.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Because the first
indication to me

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.780 align:middle line:84%
that something
else was happening

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.090 align:middle line:84%
is that there were a
number of witnesses--

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I investigated
hundreds of cases of UFOs

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.820 align:middle line:90%
all over Britain.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And I started to realize that
various people were interacting

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.140 align:middle line:84%
with the phenomena when
they were seeing it.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.780 align:middle line:10%
In other words, they were
seeing strange balls of light,

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.020 align:middle line:10%
like the ones you can
see up on the screen.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.650 align:middle line:10%
And these objects were
responding to them.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.330 align:middle line:84%
They were focusing
their mind on them,

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.390 align:middle line:84%
and they were
responding in some way.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.470 align:middle line:90%
Or they could stop.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.790 align:middle line:90%
They come closer.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.850 align:middle line:84%
The people felt that there
was a connection between them

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.790 align:middle line:84%
and the phenomena, like there
was a communion going on.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.110 align:middle line:90%
And you think, well, hold on.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.713 align:middle line:84%
If these UFOs are spaceships,
well, why would that happen?

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:34.630 align:middle line:90%
Why would that happen?

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you watch
a helicopter go over

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.710 align:middle line:84%
and you look at it, it
doesn't stop and start

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.170 align:middle line:84%
responding to you
unless the pilots see

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.950 align:middle line:90%
you or something like that.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.800 align:middle line:10%
So I started to realize
something else was going on,

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.250 align:middle line:10%
that there was a
relationship between what

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.140 align:middle line:10%
we call human consciousness
and the UFO phenomena.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.620 align:middle line:10%
And then I started
reading books by people

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.830 align:middle line:10%
that were thinking differently,
thinking outside of the box

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.340 align:middle line:10%
to do with UFOs, people
like John Keel, who you

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.630 align:middle line:10%
can see here up on the screen.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.455 align:middle line:10%
That's me when I used to have
hair before it all fell off.

00:04:10.455 --> 00:04:11.400 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.515 align:middle line:10%
And that's me at a
conference having

00:04:13.515 --> 00:04:14.640 align:middle line:10%
a little chat about things.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.209 align:middle line:10%
Now, obviously, he's done
incredible books-- no longer

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.760 align:middle line:10%
with us, obviously-- like
"The Mothman Prophecies,"

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.860 align:middle line:10%
"Strange Creatures
of Time and Space,"

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.210 align:middle line:10%
"Operation Trojan Horse."

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.400 align:middle line:10%
And these give a different
perspective of the UFO

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.200 align:middle line:10%
phenomena.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.780 align:middle line:84%
They show how weird
it is, and how

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.950 align:middle line:84%
it relates to the human
mind, and that it almost

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.780 align:middle line:90%
responds to us.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Other authors, like
Jacques VallÃ©e as well,

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.230 align:middle line:84%
books like "Passport
to Magonia" showed

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.440 align:middle line:84%
the UFO phenomena is a part of
something that's been around

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.020 align:middle line:84%
for not just a few
decades, but hundreds,

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.130 align:middle line:90%
if not thousands, of years.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.410 align:middle line:90%
So if that's the case--

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.600 align:middle line:84%
have the aliens have
been waiting around,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.750 align:middle line:84%
waiting for the right time to
contact for thousands of years?

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Or is there something else
going on in the background?

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.580 align:middle line:90%
And then I read these two books.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.183 align:middle line:84%
Well, provisionally, the
second one, "Earth Flights."

00:05:11.183 --> 00:05:13.350 align:middle line:10%
But eventually, the first
one, which was "Space-Time

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.230 align:middle line:10%
Transients and Other
Unusual Phenomena,"

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.580 align:middle line:10%
by Michael Persinger and
Ghislaine Lafreniere.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.310 align:middle line:10%
I mean, Persinger is a
neuroscientist-- again,

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.630 align:middle line:10%
no longer with us.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And Paul Devereux was at the
time-- this was in the '80s--

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.110 align:middle line:90%
was the author of--

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.740 align:middle line:84%
not the author-- the editor
of "The Ley Hunter" magazine.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And again, what they
did with these books

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.480 align:middle line:84%
is to show that a whole
range of phenomena

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.500 align:middle line:84%
seems to take place
at certain locations--

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.690 align:middle line:84%
that location,
location, location

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.820 align:middle line:84%
was very, very important
to do with UFO events.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And the other types of phenomena
would take place, including--

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.050 align:middle line:84%
this is what Michael Persinger
writes in this book that

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.020 align:middle line:90%
came out in 1977 originally--

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.230 align:middle line:84%
the cryptids are associated
with the same locations where

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.360 align:middle line:84%
mysterious lights
are actually seen,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.870 align:middle line:84%
and it's all part of a
bigger single phenomena.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.030 align:middle line:84%
So he was really the
first person, I would say,

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.720 align:middle line:90%
that made that link.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, as we say, Paul
was telling us all about this

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.870 align:middle line:90%
in his lecture earlier on.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.340 align:middle line:84%
So why is location
important to do with UFOs?

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, people began
to realize that there

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.690 align:middle line:84%
was a connection with
certain locations

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.480 align:middle line:90%
as far back as the mid-1950s.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.770 align:middle line:84%
The French UFO
researcher, AimÃ© Michel,

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.110 align:middle line:84%
he did a book called "Flying
Saucers and Straight-Line

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.440 align:middle line:84%
Mystery," realized that there
were certain locations where

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.370 align:middle line:84%
the objects would seem
to either manifest more

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.010 align:middle line:84%
regularly than anywhere else,
and that they would seem

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:54.180 align:middle line:84%
to keep to certain lines, almost
as if there were roadways,

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.240 align:middle line:84%
invisible roadways that
the UFOs would take.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, what Paul Devereux added
to this, and Michael Persinger,

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.410 align:middle line:84%
is that these locations where
these objects take place often

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.660 align:middle line:90%
have the same type of geology.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And that geology generally
involves specific things.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:18.060 align:middle line:84%
It's the coming together of
plates underneath the Earth

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.970 align:middle line:84%
that put a hell of a lot
of pressure on the rocks

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.780 align:middle line:84%
creating what are
known as fault lines--

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.530 align:middle line:84%
faulting systems, where
the rocks smash together,

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.690 align:middle line:84%
but there are still
these fractures.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:35.250 align:middle line:84%
The incredible pressure
is occurring all the time.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Combined with this were certain
types of minerals and rocks,

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.390 align:middle line:84%
particularly the mineral
quartz, but also tourmaline--

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.490 align:middle line:90%
that's much overlooked--

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:49.450 align:middle line:84%
were often found where
UFOs repeatedly occur.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.120 align:middle line:90%
And you say, well, why is that?

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, the thing about quartz,
in particular, but also

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:58.740 align:middle line:84%
tourmaline, is that when
they're put under pressure,

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.570 align:middle line:90%
they create electricity.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.810 align:middle line:84%
They create the flow
of subatomic particles

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.362 align:middle line:90%
known as electrons.

00:08:05.362 --> 00:08:06.570 align:middle line:10%
And you think, well, hold on.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:07.903 align:middle line:10%
What's that got to do with UFOs?

00:08:07.903 --> 00:08:10.890 align:middle line:10%
Well, this is
happening all the time.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:14.340 align:middle line:10%
And when these rocks are put
under pressure, particularly

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.980 align:middle line:10%
just before earthquakes,
for instance,

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:22.710 align:middle line:10%
they generate massive amounts
of these freed-up electrons,

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.660 align:middle line:10%
which come from the atoms.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.340 align:middle line:10%
They rise to the surface.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.710 align:middle line:84%
They go into the
local environment.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:32.159 align:middle line:84%
And this creates the
perfect environment

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:34.289 align:middle line:90%
for the manifestation of UFOs.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:35.789 align:middle line:90%
So suddenly-- boom.

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Objects would suddenly
appear out of thin air.

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:43.195 align:middle line:84%
And you get this idea that
UFOs are out there somewhere--

00:08:43.195 --> 00:08:44.820 align:middle line:84%
do, do, do, do, do,
do, do, do, do, do.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.560 align:middle line:84%
They come down here--
do, do, do, do.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.160 align:middle line:90%
They go back.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:47.960 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Most UFOs appear quite
close to the ground.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some obviously are
up in the sky, obviously--

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.260 align:middle line:90%
no problems at all.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.240 align:middle line:84%
But it's place that
seems to be important.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.490 align:middle line:90%
There are certain locations.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And those locations,
as you'll get to hear,

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.930 align:middle line:84%
we call today portals
or vortex sites.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:10.920 align:middle line:84%
In the past, in the '60s, they
were known as window areas.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And these portals are
key to understanding

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.150 align:middle line:84%
this phenomena and the
intelligences associated

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:19.540 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
electrons are so important--

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.690 align:middle line:84%
and these are also known
as negative ions as well.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, there
are lots of them.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can't even
give you a figure.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:35.280 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they just create
the certain environment

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.390 align:middle line:10%
that's necessary for
something called ionization

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.810 align:middle line:10%
to take place.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:44.580 align:middle line:10%
Now, what this is, is that the
electrons, once they are freed

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.790 align:middle line:10%
up, get very excited literally.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.950 align:middle line:10%
And when they get
really excited,

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:53.520 align:middle line:10%
they not only generate
electromagnetic fields,

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.850 align:middle line:10%
but they also produce light--

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:01.360 align:middle line:10%
tiny particles of light--
which are called photons.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.690 align:middle line:10%
And as all this
is happening, they

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:07.690 align:middle line:10%
surround themselves with
self-generated magnetic fields.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:12.760 align:middle line:10%
And suddenly-- bang, an
object is in front of you.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.230 align:middle line:10%
So what's going on here?

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:19.120 align:middle line:10%
Well, this manifestation
of this ionization process

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.740 align:middle line:10%
is known as plasma.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And plasma, although you'll
see dismissed as simply

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.620 align:middle line:90%
ionized gas, it's not.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.770 align:middle line:84%
That really does
it an injustice.

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:32.890 align:middle line:84%
Plasma is known as the
fourth state of matter.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:35.560 align:middle line:90%
We all know about solid stuff.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.180 align:middle line:10%
We all know about liquids.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.750 align:middle line:10%
We all know about the gas
that surrounds us that we

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.160 align:middle line:10%
live in-- the air, everything.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.860 align:middle line:10%
But there's a higher
state of matter,

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.730 align:middle line:10%
and that's known as plasma.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.970 align:middle line:90%
So what the hell is plasma?

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:52.870 align:middle line:10%
Well, plasma is
essentially light--

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:54.820 align:middle line:10%
essentially bursts of light--

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:58.450 align:middle line:10%
something that can
appear just as a quick

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.940 align:middle line:10%
flash in a few
nanoseconds, or it

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:05.030 align:middle line:10%
can stay around for a
sustained period of time,

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.150 align:middle line:10%
be it minutes, hours.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:10.060 align:middle line:10%
And it can reappear,
come back again.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:15.010 align:middle line:10%
And plasma makes up
probably as much as 99%

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:16.240 align:middle line:10%
of the actual universe.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.790 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the physical matter
that we know and love

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:22.900 align:middle line:10%
here is actually a very small
proportion of the universe.

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:26.590 align:middle line:10%
Most of the universe is plasma.

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:29.920 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the sun
generates plasma.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.180 align:middle line:10%
That's why it generates the heat
radiation that keeps us warm,

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.440 align:middle line:10%
keeps us alive.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.360 align:middle line:10%
Solar flares-- plasma.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:42.340 align:middle line:10%
Coronal mass ejections, which
sometimes come out of the sun--

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.270 align:middle line:10%
they're plasma.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:47.920 align:middle line:10%
Neutron stars, black
holes, lightning is plasma.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.910 align:middle line:10%
All of this is
plasma, basically.

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:56.880 align:middle line:10%
And the important
thing about plasma

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:02.010 align:middle line:10%
is that when it manifests,
it can manifest as objects--

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.590 align:middle line:10%
objects that can be tiny.

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:06.430 align:middle line:10%
They can be huge.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.430 align:middle line:10%
They can be different colors.

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:10.030 align:middle line:90%
They can be quite solid.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:11.610 align:middle line:90%
They can be seen on radar.

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:14.520 align:middle line:90%
They can be invisible as well.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:20.640 align:middle line:84%
But there's no question
that most UFOs are either

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:25.710 align:middle line:84%
lights, objects of light,
or clusters of lights,

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:29.580 align:middle line:84%
and that for the most part,
this is what people see.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes they will
transform into something else.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.360 align:middle line:84%
But usually, UFO
encounters, UFO sightings,

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.020 align:middle line:84%
start with light
phenomena essentially.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And it can account for
quite a large percentage

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:44.970 align:middle line:90%
of UFO sightings.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, you might
think, well, hold on.

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Haven't UFOs got nuts
and bolts in them?

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:50.190 align:middle line:90%
We'll come back to that.

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:51.190 align:middle line:90%
We'll come back to that.

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying what's going
on in the background here.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.090 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is that
because they generate

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:02.520 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic fields, if you
get too close to a manifesting

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.180 align:middle line:84%
plasma, it's going
to affect your brain.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.110 align:middle line:84%
It's going to affect
your bodily system.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:10.380 align:middle line:90%
It's going to affect cars.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.760 align:middle line:10%
It's going to stop cars.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.890 align:middle line:10%
It's going to affect
electrical apparatus,

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.780 align:middle line:10%
your smartphone, anything.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:20.340 align:middle line:84%
The very intense electromagnetic
fields will do all that.

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about
Michael Persinger,

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.320 align:middle line:84%
the book that he did,
"Space-Time Transients."

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.190 align:middle line:84%
He did hundreds of papers,
most of which people

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.920 align:middle line:84%
just don't know about,
about the effects

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.100 align:middle line:84%
of electromagnetic fields
on the human brain,

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.310 align:middle line:84%
and how they create
otherworldly experiences,

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:40.860 align:middle line:84%
the sense of contact
with other realms,

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:45.330 align:middle line:84%
and the sense of communication
with intelligences--

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:48.392 align:middle line:84%
intelligences that he
firmly believed were real.

00:13:48.392 --> 00:13:50.100 align:middle line:84%
So we're not just
talking about something

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.570 align:middle line:90%
that's going on in the head.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:54.450 align:middle line:90%
And this is what plasma does.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:57.900 align:middle line:84%
But more important
than this is that it

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:01.830 align:middle line:84%
was realized a long time ago
that when plasma manifests,

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:04.380 align:middle line:90%
it acts as if it's alive.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:07.890 align:middle line:10%
And when I say acts
as if, it is alive.

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:09.330 align:middle line:10%
It seems to come alive.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:13.740 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the very term
"plasma" comes from the fact

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.870 align:middle line:10%
of the plasma in our body.

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:19.740 align:middle line:10%
Because the early researchers
who did the work on this

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:24.300 align:middle line:10%
in the late 19th, early 20th
century, recognized plasma.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.520 align:middle line:84%
They said, my God, look
at the way it's working.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.940 align:middle line:84%
It looks like the plasma
moving around the body,

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:34.190 align:middle line:84%
and that's how it got
the name that it has.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:38.600 align:middle line:10%
And this theoretical physicist
you can see up on the screen

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.510 align:middle line:10%
here-- a guy by the
name of David Bohm--

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:44.480 align:middle line:10%
he was American,
British, Brazilian,

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.300 align:middle line:10%
and came out with
some incredible stuff

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.490 align:middle line:10%
about the quantum
world in which we live.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:50.720 align:middle line:90%
That's the subatomic world.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.900 align:middle line:90%
That's the microcosmic world.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:57.470 align:middle line:84%
But he also did a lot
of work on plasma.

00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And he also recognized
that it came alive.

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:09.620 align:middle line:10%
And what he actually realized
was that plasma becomes

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:14.780 align:middle line:10%
like this medium into which
intelligences-- he called it

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:18.920 align:middle line:10%
the protointelligence-- comes
up from what he referred to

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.310 align:middle line:10%
as a deeper level of
existence, one that's

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:26.540 align:middle line:10%
beyond our physical space
time, which he referred to

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.690 align:middle line:10%
as the implicate order.

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:32.360 align:middle line:10%
And he said that
this implicate order

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.620 align:middle line:10%
is something which
coexists with us,

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.180 align:middle line:10%
but it's beyond
normal space time.

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:42.590 align:middle line:84%
His colleague, Basil Hiley,
referred to it as the prespace.

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's what's known
as a nonlocal medium.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.840 align:middle line:84%
What that means is that it's
not connected by anything.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:51.318 align:middle line:84%
Like for sound,
you bang something,

00:15:51.318 --> 00:15:52.610 align:middle line:90%
bang something, bang something.

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:53.480 align:middle line:90%
It's all connected.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.460 align:middle line:90%
That's all what they call local.

00:15:55.460 --> 00:16:00.410 align:middle line:84%
But something that's nonlocal
is outside of normal space time.

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's a medium through which
information, energy, and mass

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:09.050 align:middle line:84%
can be transferred
instantaneously.

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:11.750 align:middle line:84%
So once you start thinking
about all of this,

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:18.010 align:middle line:84%
you think, well, hold on, yeah,
is it possible that some UFOs--

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:22.370 align:middle line:84%
not all-- some UFOs
are actually plasma,

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:26.390 align:middle line:84%
and that they are actually
intelligent in the sense

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:30.650 align:middle line:84%
that they are inhabited by
intelligences that occupy them

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:32.690 align:middle line:84%
from a deeper level
of existence--

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:36.200 align:middle line:84%
this realm called the
prespace, this nonlocal realm.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the case, who
are these intelligences,

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:43.490 align:middle line:84%
and how do they relate to aliens
and UFO theories and whatever?

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:45.200 align:middle line:90%
Well, we'll come on to that.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.130 align:middle line:90%
Because the other thing--

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:49.460 align:middle line:84%
and you can go
down a rabbit hole

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.440 align:middle line:84%
with this-- is
quantum entanglement.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Some of you may know about
quantum entanglement.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:58.760 align:middle line:10%
But it's the idea that particles
can become twinned or linked.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.980 align:middle line:10%
And no matter how far away
they get from each other--

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.438 align:middle line:10%
one can be one end
of the universe,

00:17:03.438 --> 00:17:05.522 align:middle line:10%
the other one could be the
other end of universe--

00:17:05.522 --> 00:17:06.470 align:middle line:10%
they will have--

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:09.329 align:middle line:10%
they will retain this
link between them.

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:12.770 align:middle line:10%
And if you can imagine that
there are whole systems

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:16.280 align:middle line:10%
of entangled particles
existing within this universe,

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.280 align:middle line:10%
within my head-- some in
my head, some in your head,

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.410 align:middle line:10%
some in the person
sitting next to you--

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:23.810 align:middle line:10%
it creates whole systems of--

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.690 align:middle line:10%
entangled systems
of particles that

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:32.150 align:middle line:10%
allow us to understand things
like telepathy, precognition,

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.060 align:middle line:10%
mind over matter,
for the first time.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.130 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of people say,
yeah, well, hold on,

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:40.050 align:middle line:10%
quantum entanglement only
works on the microcosmic level.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:40.850 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:43.100 align:middle line:10%
In the past five
years, it's been

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.460 align:middle line:10%
proved that quantum
entanglement affects what they

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.110 align:middle line:10%
call the macrocosmic world.

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.370 align:middle line:10%
That's the world
in which we live.

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.970 align:middle line:10%
So suddenly,
quantum entanglement

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:56.690 align:middle line:10%
becomes the key to understanding
not just what I just

00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:01.910 align:middle line:10%
said, these telepathy and that,
but the entanglement between us

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:02.990 align:middle line:10%
and UFOs.

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And remember what I said
when I first started.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:11.330 align:middle line:84%
I was quite perplexed why
people could interact with UFOs,

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:14.540 align:middle line:84%
and the objects would seem to
respond to them as if they were

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.120 align:middle line:84%
intelligent, as if
they were entities,

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.890 align:middle line:90%
beings in their own right.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're
starting to get answers

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:27.230 align:middle line:84%
that the intelligences, the
beings that actually occupy

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:32.510 align:middle line:84%
these UFOs, UAPs, plasma,
constructs, as we like

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:34.910 align:middle line:90%
to call them, are intelligent.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:35.870 align:middle line:90%
They are intelligent.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:38.870 align:middle line:84%
They are intelligences
coming from somewhere.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And they're not necessarily
always coming from outer space.

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:47.760 align:middle line:84%
But where they come from,
we'll save for a moment.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:52.820 align:middle line:84%
So now, David Bohm believed
that these intelligences

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:57.060 align:middle line:84%
came from a deeper
level of existence.

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:59.160 align:middle line:84%
So what is this deeper
of level of existence?

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.040 align:middle line:90%
What is this so-called prespace?

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, for that, we have
to go to string theory.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:09.140 align:middle line:10%
Now, string theory is one of
the modern ideas of interpreting

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.550 align:middle line:10%
the subatomic world.

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:14.585 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it talks about the most
microscopic level particles

00:19:14.585 --> 00:19:17.780 align:middle line:10%
that are like these
weird rubber bands that

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.813 align:middle line:10%
vibrate that they call strings.

00:19:19.813 --> 00:19:21.230 align:middle line:10%
We don't have to
worry about that.

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:25.100 align:middle line:10%
Because it's one of the theories
that came out of string theory

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.020 align:middle line:10%
that's very
important to that us,

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.080 align:middle line:10%
and this was the
so-called M-theory

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:34.970 align:middle line:10%
that was devised in 1995
by a theoretical physicist

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:39.782 align:middle line:10%
by the name of Ed Witten of the
Southern California University.

00:19:39.782 --> 00:19:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And he brought together various
different existing string

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:45.890 align:middle line:90%
theories and created M-theory.

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
it's so important

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:52.970 align:middle line:84%
is because it tells us
that there is not simply

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:56.510 align:middle line:84%
three dimensions of space
that we know and love

00:19:56.510 --> 00:20:00.470 align:middle line:84%
and one dimension of time,
which clearly is running forward

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:01.490 align:middle line:90%
for us.

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:05.510 align:middle line:84%
But there's actually 11
dimensions out there,

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:09.200 align:middle line:90%
and that these 11 dimensions--

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.810 align:middle line:90%
four are actual space.

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:14.630 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, there's
an extra dimension of space.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Time is there, but time
operates differently

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:19.370 align:middle line:90%
on a higher dimensional level.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.600 align:middle line:84%
It can go backwards
and forwards in time.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And in many ways, doesn't
really exist in the way

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.610 align:middle line:90%
that we think about it.

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
six dimensions

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:31.820 align:middle line:84%
that exist in what they refer
to as a compactified state.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.370 align:middle line:84%
What this means is that
they are scrunched up

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:39.980 align:middle line:84%
tiny within subatomic particles,
and play a role which we don't

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.960 align:middle line:90%
properly really understand.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.560 align:middle line:84%
But I reckon they're to
do with consciousness.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I say
that is because work

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.950 align:middle line:84%
that was done by a
organization in Switzerland

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:53.540 align:middle line:84%
called the Blue
Brain Project, which

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:57.050 align:middle line:84%
is trying to map the entire
human mind to try and transfer

00:20:57.050 --> 00:21:00.080 align:middle line:84%
consciousness into
AI, have worked out

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:05.790 align:middle line:84%
that the brain operates on up
to 11 dimensions of geometry.

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost
like our brains are

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:12.320 align:middle line:84%
hard-wired to operate on
a multidimensional level

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:16.670 align:middle line:84%
when we come to understand
those dimensions.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:18.640 align:middle line:90%
So that's it.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.320 align:middle line:84%
But where are these
other dimensions?

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.380 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, it would seem as
if our universe sits

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:30.700 align:middle line:84%
within something else, something
that in M-theory is referred

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.230 align:middle line:90%
to as the bulk.

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:33.820 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's a silly term, I know.

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:38.680 align:middle line:10%
But the bulk is seen to be like
this nonlocal medium that's

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.170 align:middle line:10%
outside of the
physical universe,

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:44.710 align:middle line:10%
and it is of 11 dimensions.

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:49.210 align:middle line:10%
And that under certain
conditions within that bulk,

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:52.300 align:middle line:10%
universes come into being
and sort of blow up,

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.700 align:middle line:10%
almost like balloons
being blown up

00:21:54.700 --> 00:22:01.060 align:middle line:10%
by mass and energy that's
coming in to these universes

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:03.010 align:middle line:10%
using what they
believe is white holes.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:04.510 align:middle line:10%
They're the opposite
to black holes.

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:06.160 align:middle line:10%
Black holes suck everything out.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:12.660 align:middle line:10%
White holes push mass and
energy into an environment which

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.040 align:middle line:10%
creates a physical universe.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.650 align:middle line:10%
And the interesting thing
there is that white holes

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:18.150 align:middle line:10%
produce plasma.

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Plasma quickly transforms
into atomic matter,

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:25.870 align:middle line:84%
the stuff that makes up
our particular universe.

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:28.950 align:middle line:84%
So we exist within one
of these universes.

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And the bulk is, therefore,
something that's outside

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:32.830 align:middle line:90%
of everything.

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:34.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a multidimensional
environment,

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:38.890 align:middle line:84%
but it also exists within our
physical universe as well.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:41.407 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's
embedded within everything.

00:22:41.407 --> 00:22:42.240 align:middle line:90%
It's still embedded.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.620 align:middle line:90%
The bulk is with us.

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:48.060 align:middle line:84%
But it's a realm that we
didn't really know existed,

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:52.515 align:middle line:84%
and it conforms to everything
that we know about David Bohm's

00:22:52.515 --> 00:22:55.520 align:middle line:90%
implicate order, the prespace.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.930 align:middle line:84%
It's been given
various other names

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:01.770 align:middle line:84%
along the way, like the
ether and the quantum field,

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:03.270 align:middle line:90%
things like this.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:06.670 align:middle line:84%
But it has an impact
on this world.

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:08.580 align:middle line:90%
And let me explain this.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Because in M-theory, they
refer to physical universes

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:13.770 align:middle line:90%
as branes--

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:17.670 align:middle line:90%
B-R-A-N-E-- or brane worlds.

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And we live in one of
these brane worlds.

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:23.010 align:middle line:84%
But outside of our
physical universe,

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:26.190 align:middle line:84%
they believe that there
are other brane worlds,

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:29.820 align:middle line:84%
and they may have their
own laws of physics.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:34.230 align:middle line:10%
But they are outside there,
and occasionally, they

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:36.850 align:middle line:10%
can interact with each other.

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:40.140 align:middle line:10%
They can either back
up side by side,

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:43.170 align:middle line:10%
or, under certain
circumstances, they

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:47.080 align:middle line:10%
can overlay our
physical universe.

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.740 align:middle line:10%
And when that happens,
this other brane world--

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:52.580 align:middle line:10%
and there may well
be lots of them,

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:56.200 align:middle line:10%
but let's say one specifically
we're talking about now--

00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:00.430 align:middle line:10%
once it overlays ours,
whatever laws of physics

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:03.880 align:middle line:10%
exist within that
brane world will also

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:07.360 align:middle line:10%
start having an
effect on our world.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:11.350 align:middle line:84%
So is it possible,
therefore, that there

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:16.750 align:middle line:84%
are certain locations where
this interaction, this overlay

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:20.830 align:middle line:84%
between these brane worlds
will produce phenomena

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:23.500 align:middle line:84%
that we would call
paranormal, and also,

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:27.670 align:middle line:84%
provide the environments
where these intelligences can

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:32.620 align:middle line:84%
manifest into our world more
easily, somewhere like Bempton,

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:35.650 align:middle line:84%
which Paul Sinclair was
talking about earlier on.

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Because you have
to say to yourself,

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:40.100 align:middle line:84%
wolfmen don't appear
down my street.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.090 align:middle line:84%
So what's so special
about Bempton?

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, the fact is that
Bempton and that environment

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:48.970 align:middle line:84%
has one of the biggest
fault lines in Britain,

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:50.320 align:middle line:90%
going all the way through it.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Plus, there's prehistoric
activity there,

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:57.320 align:middle line:84%
including the largest
monolith in Britain,

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.410 align:middle line:84%
which I believe Maria was
talking about earlier--

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:01.180 align:middle line:90%
the Rudston monument.

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And the ancients were
aware that this area

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.210 align:middle line:90%
had special qualities.

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:08.500 align:middle line:90%
I am certain of that.

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:11.320 align:middle line:84%
As much as 4,000 years
before Roman times,

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.050 align:middle line:84%
the people were
there interacting

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:15.490 align:middle line:90%
with this phenomena.

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:18.310 align:middle line:84%
There are certain places
where the interaction

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:21.370 align:middle line:84%
between these brane worlds
more easily takes place.

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And when it happens,
that's when your cryptids

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:27.130 align:middle line:84%
start crossing over
from parallel worlds,

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:30.010 align:middle line:84%
parallel existings,
hopping into our world,

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:34.480 align:middle line:84%
and existing whilst that
overlay takes place.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as that overlay
stops and the brane worlds

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.690 align:middle line:84%
part again, it's
like they vanish

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:42.700 align:middle line:84%
like camphor,
completely disappearing,

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:46.750 align:middle line:84%
as if those cryptids, those
wolfmen, those big cats,

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:50.140 align:middle line:84%
those big dogs, and obviously,
even the intelligence

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:54.620 align:middle line:84%
behind the UFO-- suddenly
they're no longer there.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:58.450 align:middle line:84%
So what type of intelligences
are we dealing with?

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:01.240 align:middle line:90%
Well, in my opinion--

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.400 align:middle line:84%
and again, we'll talk about
aliens, proper aliens,

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.200 align:middle line:90%
in a minute.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:08.560 align:middle line:84%
But we are talking about the
intelligences and the beings

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.930 align:middle line:90%
that exist within the bulk.

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:14.410 align:middle line:84%
We call them
n-dimensional beings.

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:17.273 align:middle line:10%
n just means the
number of dimensions,

00:26:17.273 --> 00:26:18.190 align:middle line:10%
which we are not sure.

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:20.740 align:middle line:10%
It could be four, could
be seven, could be 11,

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:22.550 align:middle line:10%
could be 32, could be more.

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:24.490 align:middle line:90%
So that's what the n represents.

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:27.400 align:middle line:84%
We just call them
n-beings for short.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And these are transdimensional
intelligences.

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:35.830 align:middle line:84%
These, we believe, are
what occupy the plasma UFOs

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:39.550 align:middle line:90%
and interact with us.

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:42.040 align:middle line:10%
And the thing is,
you might say, well,

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.430 align:middle line:10%
what do these beings look like?

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, ultimately, they can look
like whatever they want to.

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:49.630 align:middle line:10%
And whatever they do, because
they are multidimensional

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:53.260 align:middle line:10%
in nature, we cannot
fully see them.

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.950 align:middle line:10%
And I mean, for instance, if you
are a two-dimensional creature,

00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:02.470 align:middle line:10%
like these guys here on
this flat pan existence,

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:08.140 align:middle line:10%
and a three-dimensional sphere
passed through their flat

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:13.030 align:middle line:10%
world, all they would see is a
circle that gradually opened up

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:17.710 align:middle line:10%
until it reached
its widest place--

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:20.110 align:middle line:10%
sorry-- diameter.

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:21.910 align:middle line:10%
And then as it passed
through their world,

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:25.420 align:middle line:10%
it would just close back
up until suddenly there

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:26.220 align:middle line:10%
was no longer.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:27.470 align:middle line:10%
They would never see a sphere.

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:31.170 align:middle line:10%
They would only ever see a
circle opening and closing.

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:33.787 align:middle line:10%
And it's the same for us.

00:27:33.787 --> 00:27:36.120 align:middle line:84%
In a three-dimensional world--
by the way, thanks, Nick,

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.580 align:middle line:90%
for the pictures.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:42.000 align:middle line:10%
In a three-dimensional
world, we would never

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.020 align:middle line:10%
see a four-dimensional creature,
a four-dimensional being,

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.090 align:middle line:10%
a four-dimensional shape.

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:52.110 align:middle line:10%
All we would see is a
three-dimensional approximation

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:54.880 align:middle line:10%
of something existing in a
higher dimensional state.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.990 align:middle line:10%
So in other words, we could
never see it properly anyway.

00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:59.860 align:middle line:10%
We might be able
to dream about it.

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:02.400 align:middle line:10%
We might be able to have
psychic experiences to do

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.940 align:middle line:10%
with higher dimensions,
and that's about it.

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:09.480 align:middle line:84%
But we can't look straight
on at these creatures.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.040 align:middle line:84%
You've all heard of things
like shadow people and shadow

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:12.840 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, in a way,
they are very easily

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.950 align:middle line:84%
possibly multidimensional
beings that

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:22.860 align:middle line:84%
somehow are able to
cross over into our world

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:25.030 align:middle line:90%
on a temporary basis.

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:26.640 align:middle line:90%
So that's it.

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:31.980 align:middle line:10%
So these wonderful videos
that were released by the US

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.970 align:middle line:10%
Navy a few years ago--

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:37.750 align:middle line:10%
was it Gimbal, GoFast,
and Tic Tac, wasn't it?

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:38.550 align:middle line:10%
Was it Tic Tac?

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:39.470 align:middle line:10%
That was it.

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:42.540 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you look at these.

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:43.740 align:middle line:10%
We've all seen them.

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.640 align:middle line:10%
They've all been
on documentaries.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.610 align:middle line:10%
You watch them on YouTube
and the rest of it.

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:51.030 align:middle line:10%
You look at them, and
the one thing you can say

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:52.050 align:middle line:10%
is these are real.

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:54.300 align:middle line:10%
These are real UFOs.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.750 align:middle line:10%
They've been officially
authenticated

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.920 align:middle line:10%
by the US government, US
Navy, the spokespeople

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:02.760 align:middle line:10%
for the Pentagon.

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:04.830 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, these are real.

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:06.960 align:middle line:10%
So what are they?

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.810 align:middle line:10%
Are these
extraterrestrial vehicles,

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:11.560 align:middle line:10%
or are they something else?

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:15.210 align:middle line:10%
Are these objects of plasma--

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:18.720 align:middle line:10%
are they intelligent
beings in their own right?

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, I can't
answer that question.

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that you yourself

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:25.470 align:middle line:90%
will have to ponder over.

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:30.930 align:middle line:84%
But we definitely are talking
about physical aliens, as well

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:33.240 align:middle line:84%
as anything that I've
been saying here.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.670 align:middle line:10%
Carl Sagan, the
great cosmologist

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:37.230 align:middle line:10%
up on the screen here--

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:40.650 align:middle line:10%
astronomer, consultant to NASA--

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:45.960 align:middle line:10%
he wrote a paper as
early as 1963 basically

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:49.590 align:middle line:10%
saying that it was
inevitable that humanity

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:52.170 align:middle line:10%
would have been visited
by extraterrestrials

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:53.820 align:middle line:10%
on countless occasions.

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:55.350 align:middle line:90%
He wrote this paper.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's only really
recently resurfaced again.

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:00.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of people
think that Carl Sagan

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.830 align:middle line:84%
didn't believe in UFOs and
didn't believe in aliens.

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:04.330 align:middle line:90%
That's not right whatsoever.

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, I've talked
to one of his colleagues

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.400 align:middle line:90%
who knew him very well.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And Carl Sagan said, look, I
had to drop the whole thing.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:15.043 align:middle line:84%
When I joined NASA, they said,
look, all this UFO stuff,

00:30:15.043 --> 00:30:15.960 align:middle line:90%
you've got to drop it.

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Aliens-- you've got to drop it
if you want to work with us.

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And so if a man
like Carl Sagan, who

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:26.540 align:middle line:84%
wrote the film "Contact," or
the book, "Contact"-- obviously,

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.400 align:middle line:84%
the blockbuster film
came out of that.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:32.150 align:middle line:84%
If he says that we've been
visited on countless occasions

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:38.160 align:middle line:84%
by aliens, physical aliens, then
who am I to say anything else?

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.420 align:middle line:90%
And I think that it is true.

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:43.700 align:middle line:84%
I think that we probably have
been visited on many occasions.

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:47.570 align:middle line:84%
But there's something else
going on in the background.

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Plasma holds the key to
understanding many UFO

00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:55.010 align:middle line:90%
encounters.

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:59.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, many of these ideas that
I've-- up to this point were

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:03.640 align:middle line:84%
in my book "Lightquest,"
which is available over there.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.500 align:middle line:84%
But that came out
in 2012, and we've

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.350 align:middle line:90%
moved on massively since then.

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's my good friend and
colleague, Erich von Daniken.

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:15.340 align:middle line:84%
His book, "Chariots
of the Gods,"

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:18.100 align:middle line:84%
had an incredible impact
on me a long time ago,

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:21.070 align:middle line:84%
as I'm sure it did
on many of you here.

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:23.760 align:middle line:90%
Because what he's saying--

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.920 align:middle line:84%
the questions that
he asks is, look

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.420 align:middle line:84%
at all these incredible
monuments of the past.

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:30.520 align:middle line:90%
Look at Stonehenge.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.080 align:middle line:90%
Look at the Great Pyramid.

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.700 align:middle line:90%
Look at the Nazca Lines.

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.250 align:middle line:84%
Look at Sumerian
myths and traditions.

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that we were
helped in the past by aliens?

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.560 align:middle line:90%
That's all he said.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.050 align:middle line:84%
As I think Georgio was
trying to point out,

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:50.920 align:middle line:84%
they've never said the Great
Pyramid was built by aliens.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:54.130 align:middle line:84%
But the inspiration
behind it could have

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:57.130 align:middle line:90%
come from higher intelligences.

00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, those higher intelligences
could be physical aliens.

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:05.440 align:middle line:84%
But again, is it possible
that these n-beings,

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:08.170 align:middle line:84%
these transdimensional beings
that I'm talking about,

00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:13.410 align:middle line:84%
are also responsible for some
of the human progress that's

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:14.210 align:middle line:90%
taken place?

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
want to go onto now.

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:18.220 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
is it possible

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:21.760 align:middle line:84%
that in addition to God being an
astronaut, which was obviously

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.730 align:middle line:84%
the question that came out
of "Chariots of the Gods,"

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:30.000 align:middle line:90%
was God, or is God, an n-being?

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.650 align:middle line:10%
So I want to take you
now to Israel, OK,

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:38.370 align:middle line:10%
in a place called
the Qesem Cave.

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:43.320 align:middle line:10%
It was discovered in the year
2000 just outside of Tel Aviv.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:48.450 align:middle line:10%
And it was on my
radar for a few years.

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:51.000 align:middle line:10%
But then something
was discovered there

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.530 align:middle line:10%
that basically made me drop
everything and go to Israel

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:57.840 align:middle line:10%
to talk to the
archaeologists about what

00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:01.230 align:middle line:10%
had been discovered there
because this is incredibly

00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:02.760 align:middle line:10%
important.

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:08.170 align:middle line:10%
Because it was occupied for the
first time about 400,000 years,

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:10.790 align:middle line:10%
and it-- right the way down
to about 2,000-- sorry--

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:12.130 align:middle line:10%
2-- yeah-- sorry--

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.080 align:middle line:10%
200,000 years ago.

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:18.580 align:middle line:10%
And they discovered the
oldest evidence anywhere

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:20.860 align:middle line:10%
in the world of shamanism.

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:24.310 align:middle line:10%
Now, shamanism
and a shaman are--

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:27.010 align:middle line:10%
a shaman is somebody
that communicates

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:31.660 align:middle line:10%
with other worldly realms
and other worldly beings.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And they discovered
a swan wing bone--

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:39.490 align:middle line:84%
so one of the most
important bones

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:44.590 align:middle line:90%
on a swan that allows it flight.

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's incredibly
important because these

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:50.530 align:middle line:84%
were much prized
by ancient shamans

00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:55.030 align:middle line:84%
to make that connection,
when in a trance state

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:57.400 align:middle line:84%
to enter into
otherworldly environments.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.890 align:middle line:84%
There's a picture of
it, or section of it,

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:01.420 align:middle line:90%
on the screen at the moment.

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:02.660 align:middle line:90%
It's been modified.

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:05.180 align:middle line:84%
It was obviously used
for ritualistic purposes.

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:10.659 align:middle line:84%
So shamanism begins with the
Qesem Cave 400,000 years ago.

00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, you'll see the relevance
of all this as we go on.

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:14.949 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, there's a swan there.

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Swan shamanism--
very, very important

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:19.090 align:middle line:90%
in many ancient cultures.

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:21.699 align:middle line:84%
And for those of you that have
read my books like "The Cygnus

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Mystery" and "the
Cygnus Key," you'll

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:26.290 align:middle line:84%
know I have got a particular
interest in the importance

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:29.469 align:middle line:84%
of the swan to
cosmology and shamanism

00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:32.170 align:middle line:90%
amongst ancient cultures.

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:36.699 align:middle line:10%
But in addition to using
swan bones, particularly

00:34:36.699 --> 00:34:37.630 align:middle line:10%
this swan bone--

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:40.120 align:middle line:10%
obviously, that's a very
important shamanic animal--

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:45.010 align:middle line:10%
they were also using these
handheld balls, these stone

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:47.949 align:middle line:10%
balls, which the
archaeologists believe

00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:51.639 align:middle line:10%
were used to communicate
with other worldly realms

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:53.409 align:middle line:10%
and beings.

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:54.670 align:middle line:10%
I mean, here's one here.

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:55.690 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I was out there.

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:57.370 align:middle line:10%
I held some of these.

00:34:57.370 --> 00:35:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And in many ways, these are
the oldest crystal balls

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:04.390 align:middle line:90%
anywhere in the world.

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:06.760 align:middle line:84%
So they were using them
to focus their mind,

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.700 align:middle line:84%
to concentrate on
other worldly realms,

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.610 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with the
entities and the beings.

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And to them, they
probably saw them

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:17.410 align:middle line:84%
in terms of their
ancestors, but also

00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:19.900 align:middle line:84%
probably the spirits
of the animals

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.102 align:middle line:84%
that were killed
during the hunts.

00:35:22.102 --> 00:35:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
they would enter

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.570 align:middle line:84%
almost like this
sort of "Jungle Book"

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:28.780 align:middle line:84%
environment of the mind,
where they would communicate

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:30.280 align:middle line:84%
with the animals,
and communicate

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.090 align:middle line:90%
with their own ancestors.

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:36.490 align:middle line:84%
So they were doing
this by using items

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:39.760 align:middle line:90%
of shamanic paraphernalia.

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And also, by using these
balls as points of focus.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.960 align:middle line:10%
But the other important thing--

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.240 align:middle line:10%
and this is why I'm
talking about this--

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:53.530 align:middle line:10%
is that in the Qesem Cave,
a whole number of firsts

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:56.410 align:middle line:10%
for humanity were
actually taking place

00:35:56.410 --> 00:35:59.350 align:middle line:10%
at this time, everything
from what they call

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:04.450 align:middle line:10%
canned food, which was a way of
chopping the legs off of deer,

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:07.060 align:middle line:10%
while presumably dead-- once
they're dead, obviously--

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:10.180 align:middle line:10%
and storing them up and
putting them in their backpack,

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:14.380 align:middle line:10%
so that they could use them
as a tasty meal for the marrow

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:18.880 align:middle line:10%
inside them at any point,
early forms of freezers,

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:22.690 align:middle line:10%
production lines of blade
tools, the first sustained

00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:27.970 align:middle line:10%
use of fires, and even what they
refer to as a school of rock

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:31.780 align:middle line:10%
in the press, where people would
come to the cave, young pupils,

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:36.760 align:middle line:10%
to learn the trade of making
stone tools of different types,

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.250 align:middle line:10%
and there was different
sections of the cave.

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is
that all of this

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:45.010 align:middle line:84%
might not sound rock and
roll, but for these people

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:47.440 align:middle line:84%
they were becoming
the smartest people

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.930 align:middle line:90%
on the planet at this time.

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:53.020 align:middle line:90%
This is 400,000 years ago.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is that
these are not Homo erectus.

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:56.710 align:middle line:90%
They're not Neanderthals.

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:58.030 align:middle line:90%
They're not Denisovans.

00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:00.490 align:middle line:90%
They're our ancestors.

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:04.120 align:middle line:84%
The teeth that have
been found in this cave

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:06.910 align:middle line:90%
are almost identical to our own.

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:09.790 align:middle line:90%
They are our direct ancestors.

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:12.820 align:middle line:84%
They were the smartest
people on the planet,

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:16.060 align:middle line:84%
and they're inventing
shamanism at the same time.

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Tell me this is
not a coincidence.

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:24.970 align:middle line:84%
So what the hell was going
on here all this time ago?

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:28.300 align:middle line:10%
This is an image of
that "The First Shaman"

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:31.570 align:middle line:10%
by Russell Hossain, a friend
and colleague of mine,

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:34.790 align:middle line:10%
who's done various
images for my books.

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:38.030 align:middle line:10%
This is what we think
was going on here.

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:42.880 align:middle line:10%
This is an impression of that
first shaman all those years

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.020 align:middle line:10%
ago.

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:46.720 align:middle line:10%
And the answer to this--

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:50.750 align:middle line:10%
I mean-- and this was something
that I tried to ponder over.

00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:55.190 align:middle line:10%
And it was then realized that
if you're at the Qesem Cave,

00:37:55.190 --> 00:38:00.020 align:middle line:10%
on the horizon is a very,
very important mountain,

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:03.230 align:middle line:10%
a place called Mount Gerizim.

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:06.150 align:middle line:10%
And this is Mount Gerizim today.

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:10.490 align:middle line:10%
And the reason why Mount
Gerizim is so important

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:13.880 align:middle line:10%
is because it appears
a number of times

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:18.020 align:middle line:10%
in the first few chapters
of the Hebrew Bible.

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:21.320 align:middle line:10%
It is said to be the
dwelling place of God.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.550 align:middle line:10%
God dwells on this mountain.

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:25.400 align:middle line:10%
No other mountain.

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:26.540 align:middle line:10%
Only this one.

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:28.980 align:middle line:10%
This was seen as the
center of the world.

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:32.960 align:middle line:10%
It was also seen as the
gateway to heaven itself.

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And Abraham, who is
the great-grandfather

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:39.890 align:middle line:84%
of the Israelite peoples,
when he first arrives

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:43.640 align:middle line:84%
in the promised land of Canaan,
the first place he goes to--

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:46.000 align:middle line:90%
Mount Gerizim.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.340 align:middle line:84%
God appears to him-- the God
that will eventually become

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:49.210 align:middle line:90%
Yahweh--

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:51.760 align:middle line:84%
and basically says,
look, this is your land

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:55.390 align:middle line:90%
for you and your descendants.

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And he builds his
first altar there.

00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:02.200 align:middle line:84%
So this is the first place that
Abraham connects with Yahweh,

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.520 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.400 align:middle line:10%
And we all know the
story of Jacob--

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:12.790 align:middle line:10%
lies down, dreams of angels
going up and down a ladder

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:14.680 align:middle line:10%
as he lies on this stone--

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.390 align:middle line:10%
the pillow-- Jacob's pillow.

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:18.010 align:middle line:10%
That takes place here.

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:19.960 align:middle line:10%
It takes place at a
place called Bethel.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:22.330 align:middle line:10%
Bethel means the house of God.

00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:26.710 align:middle line:10%
And if you look closely
at the Bible, that's here.

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:30.700 align:middle line:10%
That's exactly what-- and
there are a number of occasions

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:33.940 align:middle line:10%
where God manifests
to the earliest

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:38.980 align:middle line:10%
Israelites, the patriarchs, and
it's all recorded in the Bible.

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:42.940 align:middle line:10%
But the most important thing
about this dwelling place

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:48.760 align:middle line:10%
of God himself is that it's
said that God manifests

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:53.260 align:middle line:10%
on this mountain in his
form as the Shekhinah

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:54.580 align:middle line:10%
So what's the Shekhinah?

00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:56.860 align:middle line:10%
Shekhinah means presence.

00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:59.110 align:middle line:10%
It means the presence of God.

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's universally interpreted
within Hebrew tradition,

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Aramaic tradition,
as meaning light--

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.520 align:middle line:90%
bursts of light, basically.

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:13.990 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, God was
seen to manifest this mountain.

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:17.500 align:middle line:84%
They would know that God was
there when these lights would

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:18.940 align:middle line:90%
appear on this mountain.

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:20.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm thinking, hold on.

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:24.700 align:middle line:84%
If this is not far
from Qesem Cave,

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:29.380 align:middle line:84%
do we dare to even think
that what's going on--

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:31.870 align:middle line:84%
Gerizim could have been
going on much earlier,

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:34.660 align:middle line:84%
and that the people
of Qesem somehow were

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:36.880 align:middle line:90%
connected with this mountain?

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll show a picture a
little later on-- it's probably

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:40.150 align:middle line:90%
out of place.

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:44.800 align:middle line:84%
But there is no question that
the people of the Qesem Cave

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:48.610 align:middle line:84%
would go to this mountain to
collect the flint that they

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:51.440 align:middle line:90%
used to make their stone tools.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.050 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
they unquestionably

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:56.230 align:middle line:84%
saw this mountain is
important, and they

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:59.920 align:middle line:84%
could have used any other flint
locally to make their tools.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.830 align:middle line:84%
But they wanted to go
specifically to this mountain.

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:03.760 align:middle line:90%
So they knew it.

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.200 align:middle line:90%
They know it.

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:09.460 align:middle line:84%
The other important thing is
that the Shekhinah is the way

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:14.500 align:middle line:84%
that God manifests in connection
with the Ark of the Covenant.

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:19.840 align:middle line:10%
And it said that that
night, God's presence

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:25.180 align:middle line:10%
would be seen above the mercy
seat of the Ark of the Covenant

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:29.642 align:middle line:10%
in the form of this fire,
this bright light, which was

00:41:29.642 --> 00:41:30.850 align:middle line:10%
referred to as the Shekhinah.

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:34.420 align:middle line:10%
In other words, the same
manner that God appears

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:37.150 align:middle line:10%
on the mountain, he also
appears in connection

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:39.790 align:middle line:10%
with the Ark of the Covenant.

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And the Ark of the
Covenant-- the first place

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:48.100 align:middle line:84%
that Joshua brings to the
Ark of the Covenant after he

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:50.320 align:middle line:84%
and the Israelites cross
over the River Jordan

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.720 align:middle line:84%
and into the promised
land of Canaan,

00:41:52.720 --> 00:42:00.070 align:middle line:84%
shortly after Moses had died,
they go to Mount Gerizim.

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And at the base of it is a city,
an ancient city called Shechem.

00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Today, it is the modern city of
Nablus in the Palestinian West

00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:13.570 align:middle line:90%
Bank.

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:15.730 align:middle line:90%
I was there in 2019.

00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:19.060 align:middle line:84%
This is the site of Shechem
that you can see here.

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:20.290 align:middle line:90%
This is a standing stone.

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:23.860 align:middle line:84%
This was the exact spot
that the Ark of the Covenant

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:25.930 align:middle line:84%
was said to have
been placed down,

00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:28.870 align:middle line:84%
with Gerizim in the background
and another mountain called

00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:30.550 align:middle line:90%
Ebal on the other side.

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And they did this whole
thing called the bless--

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:37.000 align:middle line:84%
the ceremony of the
curses and the blessings.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.610 align:middle line:84%
12 tribes would
go up one mountain

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:47.470 align:middle line:84%
and do blessings on people that
adhered to the law of Yahweh.

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And the others
would-- the other six

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:51.400 align:middle line:84%
would go on the other
mountain and curse

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:55.570 align:middle line:84%
all those that didn't
adhere to the divine law.

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:57.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is what
the Bible says anyway.

00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:58.930 align:middle line:90%
All of that happened here.

00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And it said that the Ark of the
Covenant stood between the two

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:04.780 align:middle line:84%
with the Shekhinah
rising up above it,

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:07.330 align:middle line:90%
this manifestation of light.

00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, this light, this
manifestation of the Shekhinah

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:14.560 align:middle line:84%
also appears in other
places in the Bible.

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:18.220 align:middle line:10%
For instance, when
Moses and the Israelites

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:21.490 align:middle line:10%
arrive, when they're in the
wilderness for 40 years,

00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:23.920 align:middle line:10%
when they arrive at
Mount Sinai, they

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:27.430 align:middle line:10%
can see these bursts of light
on the top of Mount Sinai, which

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:31.720 align:middle line:10%
you can see here depicted by
this 19th-century illustration.

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And Moses climbs the
mountain, and he speaks to God

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:40.360 align:middle line:84%
in the form of this
devouring fire.

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And God obviously gives
him the Ten Commandments,

00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:46.420 align:middle line:84%
which are obviously written
down in the tablet the law.

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:50.760 align:middle line:84%
But also, in addition to that,
this manifesting light form,

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:54.270 align:middle line:84%
this intelligence
who we call Yahweh,

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:59.070 align:middle line:84%
tells Moses how to create
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:01.410 align:middle line:84%
The Ark of the Covenant
is very clearly

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:07.830 align:middle line:84%
a piece of plasma technology
that was given specifically

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:10.440 align:middle line:84%
to Moses to allow
him to communicate

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:14.320 align:middle line:84%
with these intelligences
which, in my opinion,

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:17.340 align:middle line:84%
are these multidimensional
n-beings, basically.

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:19.740 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they
gave him the technology.

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:23.460 align:middle line:84%
They told him how to
continue to communicate

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:28.170 align:middle line:84%
with us by creating the Ark of
the Covenant in a specific way.

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:29.520 align:middle line:90%
And obviously, here's a picture.

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:32.970 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's fascinating looking
at all the different pictures

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:34.680 align:middle line:10%
of the Ark of the
Covenant and how

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:39.950 align:middle line:10%
they represent God manifesting
over the mercy seat itself.

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:42.850 align:middle line:10%
And you'll see the picture here.

00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:46.020 align:middle line:10%
But the other important
thing was Mount Gerizim.

00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:50.310 align:middle line:10%
Firstly, it has all of the
attributes of the right geology

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:51.990 align:middle line:10%
for a portal location--

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:56.190 align:middle line:10%
tectonic plates, underground
faulted, the quartz,

00:44:56.190 --> 00:45:01.590 align:middle line:10%
all the rest of it to produce
exactly the type of environment

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:03.600 align:middle line:10%
to create the
manifestation of lights.

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.740 align:middle line:10%
And I looked into this.

00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:07.950 align:middle line:10%
Historically, lights
seen in the area.

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:09.810 align:middle line:90%
No problem at all.

00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:11.790 align:middle line:84%
They've even been seen
in more modern times,

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:15.570 align:middle line:84%
have been interpreted in terms
of flying saucers and UFOs.

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:19.710 align:middle line:84%
But what's so interesting
is that I thought, well,

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:21.990 align:middle line:84%
that's all very nice,
but I need more.

00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:23.860 align:middle line:90%
I need to go there.

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:27.120 align:middle line:90%
So I went to the Qesem Cave.

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:31.170 align:middle line:10%
After that, I crossed over
into the Palestinian West Bank.

00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:33.360 align:middle line:10%
I climbed Mount Gerizim.

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.460 align:middle line:10%
And at the top,
there's a community

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:37.350 align:middle line:10%
of people known
as the Samaritans.

00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:41.610 align:middle line:10%
They claim to be the descendants
of the original Israelites.

00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:46.260 align:middle line:10%
And I wanted to ask them about
the mysteries of the mountain.

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:52.710 align:middle line:10%
And we spoke to one of the
highest ranking priests there.

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:55.050 align:middle line:90%
I was there with an interpreter.

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:57.060 align:middle line:90%
And I said to him, I said--

00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:59.820 align:middle line:84%
I said to him, these
lights, I said,

00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:02.425 align:middle line:90%
are they still seen here today?

00:46:02.425 --> 00:46:03.300 align:middle line:90%
And he said, oh, yes.

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:04.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:08.100 align:middle line:84%
I said, how do you
interpret them?

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And the word that he said was
"malak," which some of you

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:14.700 align:middle line:90%
will probably know means angel.

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:20.970 align:middle line:84%
So what we would call
today UFOs or UAPs still

00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:24.770 align:middle line:84%
appear on this
mountain to this day,

00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:28.280 align:middle line:84%
and they are interpreted by
this very ancient community,

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:31.460 align:middle line:84%
religious community,
as the manifestation

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:34.580 align:middle line:84%
of God's messengers-- the
angels appearing there.

00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:37.790 align:middle line:10%
And this does show
you how timeless

00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:41.420 align:middle line:10%
this subject is, that we are
not dealing with nuts and bolts

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:44.240 align:middle line:10%
spacecraft all the time, that
we're dealing with something

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:47.300 align:middle line:10%
that's many, many
thousands of years old,

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:50.150 align:middle line:10%
and has been interpreted
by different people

00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:52.410 align:middle line:10%
in different ways.

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:54.090 align:middle line:10%
And as I mentioned
earlier-- this is

00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:57.740 align:middle line:10%
the slide I alluded
to-- is the Qesem people

00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:00.080 align:middle line:10%
would go to this mountain
to get their flint.

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.330 align:middle line:10%
And there are traditions all
the way around the world.

00:47:02.330 --> 00:47:04.700 align:middle line:10%
I talk about it in the
book "Origins of the Gods"

00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:08.030 align:middle line:10%
over there, that
holy mountains are

00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:10.520 align:middle line:10%
associated with mysterious
light phenomena.

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:11.510 align:middle line:10%
I go to China.

00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:13.190 align:middle line:10%
I go to Greece.

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:15.060 align:middle line:10%
I go to America.

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And there are the places
where lights are seen,

00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:21.740 align:middle line:84%
UFOs are seen, Indigenous
peoples have always

00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:24.710 align:middle line:84%
gone to get their
raw materials to make

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:29.300 align:middle line:84%
their tools because they believe
that there is a power connected

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:32.660 align:middle line:84%
with those mountains, one
that they can take away

00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:37.850 align:middle line:84%
in a mobile or temporary form
to create their stone tools,

00:47:37.850 --> 00:47:40.220 align:middle line:84%
or their stone balls,
or whatever it is,

00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:43.730 align:middle line:84%
to continue that
link with an entity

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:47.000 align:middle line:84%
that they associate
with those mountains.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.560 align:middle line:10%
And this entity,
by the way, we call

00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:53.750 align:middle line:10%
egregore, which essentially
is means an entity that

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:56.270 align:middle line:10%
has its own
existence, but is fed

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:59.040 align:middle line:10%
by what we call human
consciousness interaction.

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:01.910 align:middle line:10%
That's the other important
element of all of this,

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:06.650 align:middle line:10%
is that we are a part of
the phenomena-- as Paul

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:08.240 align:middle line:10%
Sinclair was saying
earlier today

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.270 align:middle line:10%
with the Bempton phenomena
and the wolfmen stuff,

00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:13.520 align:middle line:10%
is that we play a role.

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:17.060 align:middle line:10%
I would say that we
are as much as 50%

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:22.520 align:middle line:10%
of the contribution to us
connecting with the phenomena.

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:25.160 align:middle line:84%
In other words, take
us out of the picture,

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.660 align:middle line:90%
put us on another planet--

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:29.330 align:middle line:84%
would the phenomena
still take place?

00:48:29.330 --> 00:48:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it would, but
only to a degree.

00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:35.330 align:middle line:90%
It needs us.

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:38.660 align:middle line:84%
It needs human
observation, human contact,

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:42.830 align:middle line:84%
human consciousness interaction
to properly manifest

00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:46.820 align:middle line:84%
and to know when to manifest
because we have this entangled

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:49.070 align:middle line:90%
connection with the phenomena.

00:48:49.070 --> 00:48:51.720 align:middle line:90%
It's all part of the same thing.

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:55.680 align:middle line:84%
So as we mentioned earlier,
the Ark of the Covenant

00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:56.480 align:middle line:90%
was brought here.

00:48:56.480 --> 00:49:00.200 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the Ark is
not only an example

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:02.300 align:middle line:10%
of what I call
n-being technology.

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:04.650 align:middle line:10%
But remember, the people--

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:06.740 align:middle line:10%
the Israelites firmly
believed that it was

00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:10.490 align:middle line:10%
God manifesting above that Ark.

00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:14.150 align:middle line:10%
And if that's the case,
then their interaction

00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:16.970 align:middle line:10%
with these plasma intelligences,
these multidimensional

00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:18.980 align:middle line:10%
intelligences, is being fed.

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:22.520 align:middle line:10%
It's being fed all the
time by using this box,

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:27.440 align:middle line:10%
by using it to manifest
these intelligences.

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And the technology, as I said,
was given by the light itself--

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:34.100 align:middle line:90%
God in the form of light.

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:38.780 align:middle line:84%
So Mount Gerizim, just
like Bempton and Yorkshire

00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:40.550 align:middle line:90%
is a portal location.

00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:43.430 align:middle line:84%
There are countless
ones all over the globe,

00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:45.110 align:middle line:84%
probably in every
country of the world.

00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:48.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you probably know of
many yourself, many places

00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:52.220 align:middle line:84%
where lights manifest,
paranormal phenomena manifests,

00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:54.110 align:middle line:90%
where cryptids appear.

00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:56.670 align:middle line:84%
They're all part
of the same thing.

00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:59.210 align:middle line:84%
They're all part of
a bigger picture.

00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest showcase
portal location in the world

00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:08.570 align:middle line:84%
is obviously Skinwalker
Ranch at this time.

00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:13.800 align:middle line:10%
And during the writing
of "Origins of the Gods,"

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:17.540 align:middle line:10%
which I wrote with my
colleague, Greg Little,

00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:20.210 align:middle line:10%
I had the opportunity of
going to Skinwalker Ranch.

00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:21.380 align:middle line:10%
I was invited out there.

00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:23.990 align:middle line:10%
I've had a lot of contact
with the people involved.

00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:25.550 align:middle line:10%
There's me at the entrance.

00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:27.860 align:middle line:10%
And there's me
with various people

00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:31.880 align:middle line:10%
that you will recognize
from the TV show there.

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:36.410 align:middle line:10%
And I was able to spend a
good couple of days, not just

00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:41.510 align:middle line:10%
talking to these guys, but
also to workers on the ranch--

00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:46.430 align:middle line:10%
people who were not interested
in UFOs per se, really.

00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And yet, they'd seen
objects themselves.

00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:52.400 align:middle line:84%
They'd seen them either suddenly
manifest directly above them,

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:55.310 align:middle line:84%
or they were seeing
objects flying along

00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:57.830 align:middle line:84%
what's known as the
northern mesa, which borders

00:50:57.830 --> 00:51:01.130 align:middle line:90%
the ranch on the northern side.

00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to build up
a massive picture of what

00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:07.280 align:middle line:90%
was going on there.

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:12.600 align:middle line:90%
And here's the summary of it.

00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:15.840 align:middle line:10%
The main price associated
with the phenomena

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:19.260 align:middle line:10%
there is the northern mesa.

00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:23.280 align:middle line:10%
This is homestead
number two, which

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:27.540 align:middle line:10%
is where more paranormal
phenomena takes place

00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:29.560 align:middle line:10%
than anywhere else.

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:32.100 align:middle line:10%
And the thing about
this northern mesa

00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:34.740 align:middle line:10%
is that it's made of a
type of sandstone that's

00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:36.600 align:middle line:10%
almost solid quartz.

00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:40.620 align:middle line:10%
And this quartz powders,
in fact, to such a degree

00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:44.970 align:middle line:10%
that you have to wear masks
or scarves around your neck--

00:51:44.970 --> 00:51:47.340 align:middle line:10%
around your face almost all
the time because it just

00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:50.220 align:middle line:10%
gets in your throat, and
it's really not good for you.

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:54.900 align:middle line:10%
And in addition to that,
the Native American peoples,

00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:58.360 align:middle line:10%
the Utes and the
Navajo of the area,

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:03.420 align:middle line:10%
refer to this northern mesa
as the Path of the Skinwalker.

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:06.810 align:middle line:10%
And they say that
this creature called

00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:09.660 align:middle line:10%
the Skinwalker, which we'll
talk about in a second,

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:10.830 align:middle line:10%
moves along there.

00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:13.320 align:middle line:10%
And they've believed this
for at least something

00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:14.620 align:middle line:10%
like 15 generations.

00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:16.950 align:middle line:10%
So at least a couple of
hundred years, and I'm

00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:20.590 align:middle line:10%
sure much longer than that.

00:52:20.590 --> 00:52:22.380 align:middle line:10%
But what's so
important about this.

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:25.770 align:middle line:84%
We already talked about
quartz producing electrons

00:52:25.770 --> 00:52:29.220 align:middle line:84%
which produce what's known
as ionospheric environments,

00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:31.410 align:middle line:90%
where lights can appear.

00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:34.380 align:middle line:84%
But we'd also expect to
have other types of geology

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:38.280 align:middle line:84%
at Skinwalker Ranch which tells
us it's a portal location.

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, there
is a fault line.

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And nobody's
mentioned this other

00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:44.970 align:middle line:84%
than me, is that there's the
fault line going right the way

00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:47.400 align:middle line:90%
through this northern mesa.

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:52.300 align:middle line:84%
So that produces-- helps
produce electricity,

00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:56.790 align:middle line:84%
which releases these electrons
into the air, which can produce

00:52:56.790 --> 00:52:58.590 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetic fields.

00:52:58.590 --> 00:53:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And also, these
plasma objects will

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:04.020 align:middle line:84%
suddenly burst and
manifest into existence.

00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And it creates the
right environment

00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:09.420 align:middle line:84%
where the overlay between
these different brane worlds,

00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:13.560 align:middle line:84%
these multidimensional realms,
can take place more easily

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:15.160 align:middle line:90%
than somewhere else.

00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:18.480 align:middle line:84%
So the communication
with the intelligences

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:22.830 align:middle line:84%
of these other realms,
these intelligences,

00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:26.760 align:middle line:84%
these beings of the bulk,
can more easily take place.

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:32.610 align:middle line:84%
But what's so interesting is
that the guys who are on the TV

00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:35.220 align:middle line:84%
show who I was able
to talk to, they

00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:39.390 align:middle line:84%
say that the intelligence
involved with Skinwalker Ranch

00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:41.310 align:middle line:90%
is a single entity.

00:53:41.310 --> 00:53:44.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they believe
that there is just one.

00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And that everything
that happens there

00:53:46.050 --> 00:53:48.750 align:middle line:84%
is a manifestation of
this one intelligence.

00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And this intelligence
knows them.

00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:53.640 align:middle line:90%
It's omnipresent.

00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:56.490 align:middle line:90%
It's omnipotent in a way.

00:53:56.490 --> 00:54:00.760 align:middle line:84%
It only manifests, it only does
things when it wants to do it.

00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And what's so interesting
is that the term

00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:05.970 align:middle line:84%
that they use for
this intelligence,

00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:10.800 align:middle line:84%
this single intelligence which
I call an egregore, is the host.

00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:14.552 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard Paul talk
about the Bempton phenomena,

00:54:14.552 --> 00:54:16.260 align:middle line:84%
and the intelligence
behind the phenomena

00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:18.660 align:middle line:90%
there, also use this same term.

00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:22.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting that
these portal locations

00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:27.420 align:middle line:84%
seem to have this entity, this
egregore, this intelligence

00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:31.230 align:middle line:84%
associated with it that
somehow is connected

00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:34.500 align:middle line:84%
with a multidimensional
existence,

00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:37.350 align:middle line:84%
and that it's this
that can suddenly

00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:40.380 align:middle line:84%
produce lights, or suddenly
produce wolfmen, or suddenly

00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:44.400 align:middle line:84%
produce paranormal activity,
can suddenly connect with you

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:45.630 align:middle line:90%
and be with you.

00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:47.790 align:middle line:90%
And then eventually, let you go.

00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:52.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these intelligences
are not necessarily

00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:55.270 align:middle line:84%
how we've perceived
aliens up to this point.

00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:58.140 align:middle line:84%
We have to update
our views about what

00:54:58.140 --> 00:54:59.890 align:middle line:90%
is going on out there.

00:54:59.890 --> 00:55:01.510 align:middle line:90%
There's no question about that.

00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:04.940 align:middle line:84%
But just a few words on
skinwalkers themselves.

00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:09.740 align:middle line:10%
The term skinwalker is
essentially a Navajo term.

00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:12.530 align:middle line:10%
And it means a witch--

00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:16.400 align:middle line:10%
that's their term-- it
was a Navajo word for it,

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:18.650 align:middle line:10%
but basically we mean shaman--

00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:21.860 align:middle line:10%
the form, the supernatural
form, that they take when

00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:24.200 align:middle line:10%
they are in a trance state.

00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:26.480 align:middle line:10%
So they'll do their ritual.

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:29.870 align:middle line:10%
They'll get out into
an altered state,

00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:32.120 align:middle line:10%
and they will become
an animal that

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:33.680 align:middle line:10%
will then be able
to go out and do

00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:35.270 align:middle line:10%
things, including curse people.

00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:36.830 align:middle line:10%
And they do do that.

00:55:36.830 --> 00:55:42.110 align:middle line:10%
And the most obvious form of
the skinwalker is the wolf.

00:55:42.110 --> 00:55:44.990 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the same word for
witch and wolf in Navajo

00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:46.410 align:middle line:90%
is exactly the same.

00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:49.280 align:middle line:84%
So that shows the
link between the two.

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And Skinwalker Ranch and the
little area of the entire basin

00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:57.680 align:middle line:84%
where it's in, was
sacred lands to

00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:00.350 align:middle line:84%
these Native American
peoples in the past.

00:56:00.350 --> 00:56:02.450 align:middle line:84%
There is a stone
circle up there.

00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:06.920 align:middle line:84%
There is rock art As we know,
the Native American peoples

00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:09.080 align:middle line:84%
call it the Path
of the Skinwalker,

00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:12.350 align:middle line:84%
and it's all connected with this
northern mesa where this fault

00:56:12.350 --> 00:56:14.720 align:middle line:84%
line is, which seems to
be the focus of where

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:16.890 align:middle line:90%
all this phenomena takes place.

00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And so they interpret
what they see,

00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:24.140 align:middle line:84%
which presumably is lights and
other paranormal phenomena,

00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:27.380 align:middle line:90%
as evidence of skinwalkers.

00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why they
believe that it's skinwalkers

00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:33.950 align:middle line:84%
is because the
Ute and the Navajo

00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:36.740 align:middle line:90%
had wars in the 19th century.

00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:38.450 align:middle line:90%
It was very nasty.

00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there's
an element, particularly

00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:46.940 align:middle line:84%
amongst the Ute who
conquered the Navajo

00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:49.850 align:middle line:84%
and imprisoned them, possibly
even put them into slavery,

00:56:49.850 --> 00:56:54.200 align:middle line:84%
according to certain stories,
is that I think they almost

00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:57.170 align:middle line:84%
feel that the presence
of this phenomena

00:56:57.170 --> 00:57:01.430 align:middle line:84%
is like the result
of this curse that

00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:06.810 align:middle line:84%
was put upon them by their rival
tribe, the Navajo, in the past.

00:57:06.810 --> 00:57:09.020 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, when
they see and experience

00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:12.590 align:middle line:84%
paranormal phenomena, they're
not seeing aliens and UFOs.

00:57:12.590 --> 00:57:16.010 align:middle line:84%
They're seeing evidence
that their tribe

00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:18.260 align:middle line:90%
has been put under a curse.

00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And, I say, there's
references for all of this.

00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:23.610 align:middle line:90%
So this is real stuff.

00:57:23.610 --> 00:57:27.070 align:middle line:84%
So what happened to
me when I was there?

00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:30.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, firstly, the
whole time I was there,

00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:32.620 align:middle line:84%
I just had this sense
that it was like--

00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:36.340 align:middle line:84%
I felt I was on the edge of
paradise was the term that

00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:37.720 align:middle line:90%
kept coming into my head.

00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:39.400 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I always
felt that anything

00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:40.810 align:middle line:90%
could happen at any time.

00:57:40.810 --> 00:57:42.460 align:middle line:90%
It was a very weird feeling.

00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's only a few
places where I've felt that.

00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:46.900 align:middle line:90%
One is Bempton up in Yorkshire.

00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Another is Marfa in Texas, where
mysterious lights also appear--

00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:54.910 align:middle line:90%
this same edginess about it.

00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:57.380 align:middle line:90%
But something weird did happen.

00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:59.330 align:middle line:84%
I was taking-- I mean,
whilst I was there,

00:57:59.330 --> 00:58:03.070 align:middle line:84%
I took hundreds, if not
thousands, of pictures.

00:58:03.070 --> 00:58:04.300 align:middle line:90%
I took video.

00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:06.700 align:middle line:84%
I was recording sound
recordings all the time

00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:10.550 align:middle line:84%
just so that we could
analyze them afterwards.

00:58:10.550 --> 00:58:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And one of the strangest
things was this picture

00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:15.490 align:middle line:90%
that you can say here now.

00:58:15.490 --> 00:58:18.820 align:middle line:10%
And it's towards
homestead number two.

00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:21.410 align:middle line:10%
You can see the
northern mesa behind it.

00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:27.490 align:middle line:10%
And there's this weird creature
turns up over homestead two.

00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:29.740 align:middle line:10%
And this is it.

00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:32.770 align:middle line:10%
Now, I saw nothing at the time.

00:58:32.770 --> 00:58:35.080 align:middle line:10%
I showed it to the guys
in the command center,

00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:36.670 align:middle line:10%
and they did
actually try and look

00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:40.720 align:middle line:10%
to see if there was
anything on the cameras.

00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:42.220 align:middle line:10%
They couldn't see anything.

00:58:42.220 --> 00:58:45.280 align:middle line:10%
And I don't know what
the hell this is.

00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:49.160 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's not an insect
because it's far too sharp,

00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:51.640 align:middle line:10%
which means it was
a distance away.

00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:56.980 align:middle line:10%
I've tried contacting
bird specialists in Utah.

00:58:56.980 --> 00:58:57.790 align:middle line:10%
They have no idea.

00:58:57.790 --> 00:58:58.870 align:middle line:10%
And yet, you can see the colors.

00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:59.620 align:middle line:10%
It's blue.

00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:00.280 align:middle line:10%
It's yellow.

00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:00.850 align:middle line:10%
It's black.

00:59:00.850 --> 00:59:01.650 align:middle line:10%
It's white.

00:59:01.650 --> 00:59:04.540 align:middle line:10%
And there's this weird thing
hanging from the center of it

00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:06.695 align:middle line:10%
almost like a stalk of corn.

00:59:06.695 --> 00:59:09.070 align:middle line:10%
I mean, some people said, oh,
could it have been a drone?

00:59:09.070 --> 00:59:10.970 align:middle line:10%
Well, there was no
drones up at that time.

00:59:10.970 --> 00:59:12.850 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they did use
one later on that day,

00:59:12.850 --> 00:59:15.050 align:middle line:10%
but it certainly
didn't look like that.

00:59:15.050 --> 00:59:17.830 align:middle line:10%
So is it possible
that it is a cryptid?

00:59:17.830 --> 00:59:22.690 align:middle line:10%
And weird birds have been
seen at Skinwalker Ranch.

00:59:22.690 --> 00:59:24.910 align:middle line:10%
That's one of the
weird cryptids that

00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:27.280 align:middle line:10%
appears there other than,
of course, wolf men,

00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:29.050 align:middle line:10%
just like at Bempton.

00:59:29.050 --> 00:59:32.950 align:middle line:10%
You get these
weird dog men which

00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:36.910 align:middle line:10%
archaeologically they call
lycans, which means basically

00:59:36.910 --> 00:59:38.660 align:middle line:10%
wolf man, basically.

00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:40.540 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know what this is.

00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And to me, I've
just thrown it in.

00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:46.330 align:middle line:84%
I've included it in the
book, and that's that.

00:59:46.330 --> 00:59:51.700 align:middle line:84%
So Skinwalker Ranch is a perfect
example of a portal location.

00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:55.460 align:middle line:90%
But it's only a showcase site.

00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And you will know
places like this.

00:59:57.410 --> 01:00:00.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they won't-- they
don't need to be big either.

01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:02.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they could
be somewhere locally,

01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:06.650 align:middle line:84%
somewhere that's, a, connected
with mysterious lights, UFOs,

01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:10.430 align:middle line:84%
paranormal activity,
cryptids in your own locale,

01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:12.860 align:middle line:84%
wherever that is, whether
it be in this country,

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:14.930 align:middle line:84%
or whether it be
abroad, somewhere

01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:18.590 align:middle line:84%
that you know that you can
connect with the phenomena.

01:00:18.590 --> 01:00:22.250 align:middle line:84%
Also, just be aware that
when you go to these sites,

01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:26.150 align:middle line:84%
these are the most obvious
places or the most likely sites

01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:29.450 align:middle line:84%
where you can communicate
with these transformational

01:00:29.450 --> 01:00:30.680 align:middle line:90%
intelligences.

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:33.115 align:middle line:84%
I mean, aside from any
other type of intelligence,

01:00:33.115 --> 01:00:34.490 align:middle line:84%
aliens or whatever
else it is you

01:00:34.490 --> 01:00:38.570 align:middle line:84%
want to see as associated
with these places.

01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:42.500 align:middle line:84%
But remember, that they
are multidimensional.

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:45.310 align:middle line:90%
They're entangled with you.

01:00:45.310 --> 01:00:48.190 align:middle line:90%
And they are super intelligent.

01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:50.560 align:middle line:84%
They will know
that you're there.

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.780 align:middle line:90%
You can communicate with them.

01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:54.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in the
book "Lightquest,"

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:59.680 align:middle line:84%
I give a whole meditation
on how you yourself can

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:02.170 align:middle line:90%
connect with these entities.

01:01:02.170 --> 01:01:03.868 align:middle line:90%
And you ought to go there.

01:01:03.868 --> 01:01:05.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you'll also
find that there's

01:01:05.410 --> 01:01:06.880 align:middle line:90%
folklore connected with them.

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:09.460 align:middle line:84%
Probably it will
say that this was

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:13.240 align:middle line:84%
the haunt of devils in the
past, or of mysterious beasts,

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:17.110 align:middle line:84%
or the folk-- or folk creatures
like goblins, elves, things

01:01:17.110 --> 01:01:19.750 align:middle line:84%
like that would manifest here
with their strange lights.

01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:22.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you'll often find
that's the case, particularly,

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:23.920 align:middle line:90%
of course, in Europe.

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.980 align:middle line:84%
In America, it's Native
American tradition

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:30.850 align:middle line:84%
that you would look for
similar sort of traditions.

01:01:30.850 --> 01:01:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, my
colleague, Greg Little,

01:01:33.250 --> 01:01:35.950 align:middle line:84%
in his half of the
book, looks at all

01:01:35.950 --> 01:01:38.560 align:middle line:84%
of this from the Native
American perspective.

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:42.310 align:middle line:84%
I obviously, keep much more
to the Eurasian continent,

01:01:42.310 --> 01:01:45.640 align:middle line:90%
and Britain, in particular.

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:48.940 align:middle line:84%
So to me-- and
this is something I

01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:53.500 align:middle line:84%
want you to take away is
that, yes, UFOs exist.

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:55.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes, aliens exist.

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:58.420 align:middle line:90%
And they can be physical.

01:01:58.420 --> 01:01:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And they probably
have been visiting

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:02.680 align:middle line:84%
the Earth for a very,
very long period of time.

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:06.100 align:middle line:84%
What their impact has
been on human civilization

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:07.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:10.090 align:middle line:84%
But what I also believe
is that going as far

01:02:10.090 --> 01:02:14.650 align:middle line:84%
back as 400,000 years with the
Qesem Cave, the Qesem people,

01:02:14.650 --> 01:02:17.950 align:middle line:84%
is that they were interacting
with these intelligences,

01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:20.500 align:middle line:84%
and these intelligences
were helping

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:24.520 align:middle line:84%
them to progress with
innovations and technology.

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:28.450 align:middle line:84%
That's why they became the
smartest people in the planet

01:02:28.450 --> 01:02:29.780 align:middle line:90%
in that time.

01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:32.500 align:middle line:84%
But I think that this connection
probably even goes back even

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:33.700 align:middle line:90%
further than that.

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:38.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we all came
originally from Africa

01:02:38.110 --> 01:02:41.290 align:middle line:84%
on the Great Rift Valley
in countries that are today

01:02:41.290 --> 01:02:44.210 align:middle line:90%
Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia.

01:02:44.210 --> 01:02:48.430 align:middle line:10%
And this is some of the most
geologically active places

01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:49.810 align:middle line:10%
on the planet.

01:02:49.810 --> 01:02:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we invented
fire for the first time.

01:02:53.830 --> 01:02:56.980 align:middle line:90%
We built these fires in caves.

01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And we would have thrown
all sorts of plants on them.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And some of those plants
would have been psychoactive.

01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And they would have sent
us into altered states

01:03:05.170 --> 01:03:06.340 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And at exactly this
time, we go from creating

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:13.570 align:middle line:84%
what are known as pebble tools,
which are just picking up

01:03:13.570 --> 01:03:15.670 align:middle line:84%
pebbles, smashing
them, and using them,

01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:21.370 align:middle line:84%
to creating the most beautiful,
multifaceted crystal-like hand

01:03:21.370 --> 01:03:24.730 align:middle line:84%
axes for the first time known
as the Acheulean hand ax.

01:03:24.730 --> 01:03:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And some connection-- this was
the first point of connection,

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:29.860 align:middle line:84%
I think, with
these intelligences

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:32.990 align:middle line:84%
as much as 1.75
billion years ago.

01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And from that point
onwards, these intelligences

01:03:35.230 --> 01:03:37.330 align:middle line:90%
have been influencing us.

01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:40.570 align:middle line:84%
They influenced us to create
the Ark of the Covenant.

01:03:40.570 --> 01:03:42.520 align:middle line:90%
They inspired the Great Pyramid.

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:44.650 align:middle line:84%
They inspired places
like Gobekli Tepe

01:03:44.650 --> 01:03:45.940 align:middle line:90%
in Southeast Turkey.

01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:50.500 align:middle line:84%
They inspired the beautiful
geometry of places

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:52.355 align:middle line:84%
like Stonehenge, the
megalithic culture.

01:03:52.355 --> 01:03:53.980 align:middle line:84%
They were aware of
these intelligences.

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:56.080 align:middle line:90%
They connected with them.

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And they are still
with us today.

01:03:58.070 --> 01:04:00.310 align:middle line:10%
And I think that there is
an awful lot of companies,

01:04:00.310 --> 01:04:02.560 align:middle line:10%
organizations, and
think tanks that

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:07.000 align:middle line:10%
know that these n-beings,
these multidimensional,

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.860 align:middle line:10%
transdimensional beings exist.

01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And that if we can just
communicate with them,

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:15.770 align:middle line:84%
they will help progress
human evolution.

01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, this has been
going on since the beginning.

01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:21.910 align:middle line:84%
So with that, I will
say thank you very much.

01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:23.510 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:24.310 align:middle line:90%


01:04:24.310 --> 01:04:27.660 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:30.000 align:middle line:90%
