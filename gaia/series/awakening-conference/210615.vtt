[APPLAUSE]

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.820 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, boots on the ground.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.050 align:middle line:84%
So this is a little
bit unusual for myself,

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.650 align:middle line:90%
and I can just see the screen.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.700 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to be
talking about Wolfland.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.770 align:middle line:84%
But before we
start, I would like

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.560 align:middle line:84%
to point out that I
never want to be labeled

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.690 align:middle line:90%
as a cryptid researcher.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.670 align:middle line:90%
This is multiphenomena research.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, everything within
the genre that we're looking at

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.100 align:middle line:90%
is linked.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.440 align:middle line:90%
So how did it begin for me?

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.860 align:middle line:84%
Writing the first
truth-proof book,

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.340 align:middle line:84%
the local newspaper put a few
articles in for me saying,

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.970 align:middle line:84%
author wants stories of
the strange and unusual.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And in amongst it I got
a story from this place,

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.750 align:middle line:90%
Flixton, North Yorkshire.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And there's a picture of me
stood outside the village.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.968 align:middle line:84%
There's actually three villages,
Staxton, Flixton, and Faulkton.

00:01:09.968 --> 00:01:11.510 align:middle line:84%
If you put them
together, you've just

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.030 align:middle line:90%
got one average-sized village.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.230 align:middle line:90%
So I looked into this story.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.440 align:middle line:84%
They're talking about
the Flixton werewolf.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Mildly interested,
did a bit of digging

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.690 align:middle line:84%
and then found out
that it actually

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.640 align:middle line:84%
has a history, shall
we say, of werewolfery.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.870 align:middle line:84%
59-year-old, I'm talking
about werewolves,

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.620 align:middle line:84%
trying to portray to
you guys that there's

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.090 align:middle line:90%
some reality to this.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.080 align:middle line:90%
And there really is.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.350 align:middle line:84%
But let's forget about the
full moon and silver bullets

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.870 align:middle line:84%
because I don't think that's
got any connections to it.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.240 align:middle line:84%
However, the more
I looked into it,

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.460 align:middle line:84%
the more I realized that
there's some kind of--

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.260 align:middle line:90%
it's there.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.790 align:middle line:90%
There's a phenomena here--

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.160 align:middle line:90%
Carr Mans Spital Flixton.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.790 align:middle line:90%
Everybody can see that.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.950 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.240 align:middle line:84%
937 AD, the then
king, Athelstan,

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.260 align:middle line:84%
ordered that a refuge be built
at Flixton for the protection

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.300 align:middle line:90%
of travelers from wolves.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know that wolves
would have been prevalent

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.250 align:middle line:84%
throughout the United Kingdom
in 1937 AD, 1,084 years ago.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.880 align:middle line:84%
However, the writing
goes on to say,

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.290 align:middle line:84%
"and an infestation of savage
beasts least they be devoured."

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.820 align:middle line:84%
So is Paul trying to say
that they were werewolves?

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:22.620 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.787 align:middle line:84%
I really haven't, but it's
an interesting little bit

00:02:24.787 --> 00:02:27.080 align:middle line:84%
of writing when you
put it into context

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.810 align:middle line:84%
of what's come out of Flixton
and what continues to come out

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.820 align:middle line:90%
of East and North Yorkshire.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Remember that bears would
have long been extinct,

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.900 align:middle line:90%
15,000 to 2,000 years before.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.960 align:middle line:84%
So what was the other
apex predator in the area?

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.310 align:middle line:84%
So before we leave this
slide, "Wolfland," Athelstan

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.330 align:middle line:84%
also said that a certain portion
of land within that vicinity

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.150 align:middle line:84%
would forever be
known as Wolfland.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And as you can
see, I'm not going

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.740 align:middle line:84%
to dwell on the negative
magnetic anomaly,

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.170 align:middle line:90%
but of Bempton and Speeton.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.260 align:middle line:84%
We do have one about 18
nautical miles off the head.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Whether this has any
influence on the phenomena,

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't really know.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.860 align:middle line:90%
But all I know is in that area--

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.240 align:middle line:90%
and it's not for this talk--

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.030 align:middle line:84%
aircraft have gone missing,
literally vanished off

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.240 align:middle line:90%
radar, ZA610, XS894, ZE723.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Lots of aircraft
have gone around

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.380 align:middle line:90%
that negative magnetic anomaly.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.703 align:middle line:84%
Trawlermen have talked about
missing time and advanced time.

00:03:21.703 --> 00:03:23.120 align:middle line:84%
But I need to stick
with Wolfland,

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.620 align:middle line:90%
so I'm rambling, people.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.970 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, I do it.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.400 align:middle line:90%
So there we go.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Spital roundabout, so
that's very close to where

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.630 align:middle line:84%
the ancient refuge was built.
The white cottage or farmhouse

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.340 align:middle line:84%
in the picture is built on
the foundations of Carr Mans

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.140 align:middle line:90%
Spital.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.730 align:middle line:10%
So one of the
first stories I got

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.840 align:middle line:10%
was from this young lady
who was driving home

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.370 align:middle line:10%
after visiting York for the
day with her husband and two

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.170 align:middle line:10%
children.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.980 align:middle line:84%
They'd been for a meal
and gone to the cinema,

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.800 align:middle line:84%
coming back quite late, not
a lot of traffic on road.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.685 align:middle line:90%
And she saw this.

00:03:55.685 --> 00:03:56.485 align:middle line:10%
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:03:56.485 --> 00:04:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I was in disbelief
because it was so large,

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.270 align:middle line:84%
and it had its back
end up in the air.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And its front end sort of
looked like it was down,

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.240 align:middle line:84%
so like it was
looking at something

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.070 align:middle line:90%
or maybe eating something.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.470 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.270 align:middle line:90%
>> She saw this.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.430 align:middle line:90%
Her husband hadn't seen it.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.537 align:middle line:84%
As they pulled off the
roundabout to go to Cayton,

00:04:19.537 --> 00:04:21.870 align:middle line:84%
where they lived, she asked
her husband to stop the car,

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.220 align:middle line:90%
lock the doors.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.830 align:middle line:84%
They did several circuits
of the roundabout.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.090 align:middle line:90%
Nothing to be seen.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.920 align:middle line:84%
But she's adamant
about what she saw,

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.420 align:middle line:90%
and that's just one of many.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.490 align:middle line:84%
I haven't just got one
account from Flixton,

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.370 align:middle line:84%
and they go back decades
and decades, people, farmers

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.810 align:middle line:90%
working the area.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.920 align:middle line:84%
So there's a slide in
relation to Carr Man's Spital

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.090 align:middle line:84%
where the farmhouse stands now,
approximately 48 meters away.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.790 align:middle line:10%
We've also got a stream
running close to it

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.210 align:middle line:10%
because watercourses seem to
feature in a lot of the-- well,

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.360 align:middle line:10%
not just say cryptid sightings,
but unexplained phenomena

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.640 align:middle line:10%
reports.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.730 align:middle line:10%
Close to Flixton and Staxton
we've got the river Derwent.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.020 align:middle line:84%
The river Derwent seems to run
through this history, this land

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.980 align:middle line:90%
of werewolfery, should we say.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And we've also got
about 3/4 of a mile

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.540 align:middle line:84%
away, at the top
of Staxton Wold,

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.640 align:middle line:84%
we've got RAF Staxton
Wold where we've

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.380 align:middle line:84%
got UFO reports, cat reports,
crpytid reports, all manner

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.660 align:middle line:84%
of unexplained phenomena
presenting because these

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.590 align:middle line:90%
are multiphenomena areas.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
like to impress.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.220 align:middle line:84%
We might not know
why they're linked.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.020 align:middle line:90%
Well, I don't.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.103 align:middle line:84%
Somebody in the audience
might be able to tell me.

00:05:30.103 --> 00:05:32.310 align:middle line:90%
But it's presenting.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.350 align:middle line:84%
I think what we've
got is an enabler,

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.510 align:middle line:84%
and I don't mean a
godhead, but there's

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.340 align:middle line:84%
something within the
structure of the land

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.520 align:middle line:84%
is enabling unexplained
phenomena to present

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.880 align:middle line:90%
in these areas.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.070 align:middle line:10%
So we move forward, and now
we've just gone down below

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:53.040 align:middle line:10%
Flixton, the refuge, onto the
Carrs, C-A-R-R-S, it should be.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.860 align:middle line:10%
It means reeds and
elder, wetlands.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.860 align:middle line:10%
And the archaeologists
back in the 1940s,

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.840 align:middle line:10%
a guy called John Moore
discovered that this

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.520 align:middle line:10%
was an ancient lakebed.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.560 align:middle line:10%
And he named it Lake Flixton.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.480 align:middle line:10%
And since that time,
now, it's probably

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.330 align:middle line:10%
one of the most important
archaeological sites,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.980 align:middle line:10%
certainly, in the
United Kingdom.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.930 align:middle line:84%
But it's renowned
throughout the world.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.250 align:middle line:84%
But what I find interesting,
based on the artifacts found

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.620 align:middle line:84%
at Starr Carr,
the archaeologists

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.830 align:middle line:84%
have concluded,
some of them have,

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.320 align:middle line:84%
that these ancient peoples,
Mesolithic peoples going back

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.880 align:middle line:84%
8,000 to 11,000 years was shaman
practicing ritualistic magic

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.470 align:middle line:90%
and sacrifice.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And I find that fascinating when
putting into context with what

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.350 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about here,
the stories of the Flixton

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:41.150 align:middle line:90%
werewolf.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And here's-- excuse me-- an
account from a farmer who works

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:45.770 align:middle line:90%
the Carrs.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:46.570 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.415 align:middle line:10%
>> You know that if you stand,
it's like flat like, isn't it?

00:06:49.415 --> 00:06:51.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, that's the
Carrs, flat, yeah.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they're running across
them fields, all morning.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.770 align:middle line:84%
If I stood at the
end of that field,

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.540 align:middle line:84%
it would be about another
foot, 2 foot taller than me.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:00.690 align:middle line:90%
And I'm 6 foot, 6 foot 1.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:01.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Tall, 6 foot 1.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>> About that.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.257 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:05.090 align:middle line:90%
>> And it went fast.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.850 align:middle line:10%
So it went running,
flee line with a twisty,

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.890 align:middle line:10%
where you come down the hill.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.840 align:middle line:84%
It got from there across and up
the edge of the left-hand wood.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.640 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Up the edge of the
left-hand wood-- well,

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.140 align:middle line:84%
there's burial mounds in the
left-hand wood because, once

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.600 align:middle line:84%
again, we've got ancient
earthworks and the connection

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.080 align:middle line:84%
to these ancient phenomena
because that's what they are.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.200 align:middle line:10%
But I tend to think that,
although the early people were

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.030 align:middle line:10%
more in touch with the
land than we are today,

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.300 align:middle line:10%
I think they probably
place their earthworks

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.940 align:middle line:10%
and places of reverence
in these locations

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.800 align:middle line:10%
because they knew the
significance of the land.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.060 align:middle line:90%
So we move on.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Danes Dyke, this is about
6 miles away from Flixton

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.050 align:middle line:84%
and about 3 miles
away from my home.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.110 align:middle line:84%
There I am stood outside
the entrance of Danes Dyke.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.890 align:middle line:84%
But before we go to
the cryptid, Danes Dyke

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:54.290 align:middle line:84%
also has stories
of a white lady,

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:55.760 align:middle line:90%
the ghost of a white lady.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And you can look in
books of folklore

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.570 align:middle line:84%
that go back hundreds
of years where

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:03.020 align:middle line:84%
people claim to have seen this
apparition, this white spirit

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.020 align:middle line:90%
form.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.638 align:middle line:84%
I spoke to three people
within living memory,

00:08:07.638 --> 00:08:09.180 align:middle line:84%
obviously, since
I've spoken to them.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.953 align:middle line:84%
But they've not
seen a white lady.

00:08:10.953 --> 00:08:12.620 align:middle line:84%
When they tell me
that they've seen her,

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.480 align:middle line:90%
it's a sphere of light.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.340 align:middle line:84%
They've seen light
form phenomena

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.460 align:middle line:84%
drifting through the
lake, through the Dyke.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.795 align:middle line:84%
So once again we've got
human interpretation.

00:08:22.795 --> 00:08:24.170 align:middle line:84%
We're fitting it
to our narrative

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.792 align:middle line:90%
of that's what I believe.

00:08:25.792 --> 00:08:27.500 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless, the
phenomena is there.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And we've got big cat,
as in black cat phenomena

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:31.430 align:middle line:90%
in the lake--

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.140 align:middle line:90%
why am I saying lake--

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.100 align:middle line:90%
in the Dyke.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.490 align:middle line:84%
So Danes Dyke is an ancient
earthwork, 2 and 1/2 miles,

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:41.450 align:middle line:84%
cutting Flamborough head
off from the mainland.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.150 align:middle line:84%
Originally, people
thought that the Danes

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.870 align:middle line:90%
built it or constructed it.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:50.420 align:middle line:84%
But it was excavated in
the 1800s by a guy called

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Pitt Rivers who found
quantities of flint tools,

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.000 align:middle line:90%
so that predates the Vikings.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.520 align:middle line:84%
So once again, whilst
writing the first book,

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.810 align:middle line:84%
I got an account here,
April the 16th, 2014.

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And where I am stood,
behind me, there's

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.840 align:middle line:84%
a driving home from a night
shift from the nearby village

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.610 align:middle line:90%
of Bessingby.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:13.970 align:middle line:10%
And he's coming down
the road about 3:00 AM,

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.282 align:middle line:10%
picks up eye shine where
that arrows depict.

00:09:16.282 --> 00:09:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And he thinks there's
a deer or a badger.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.960 align:middle line:84%
But as he slows down,
and his words, there's

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.480 align:middle line:84%
something on the side
of the road on all fours

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:28.840 align:middle line:84%
that resembles the "American
Werewolf in London."

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.480 align:middle line:84%
These people have
got nothing to gain

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.340 align:middle line:84%
that have come forward
and spoken to us

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:33.750 align:middle line:90%
whilst the making "Wolflands."

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.460 align:middle line:84%
They're totally
unconnected to one another.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:40.230 align:middle line:84%
They've got different
levels of education.

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.680 align:middle line:90%
There's something there.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.150 align:middle line:84%
So the next account,
October the 15th,

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:49.440 align:middle line:84%
but before that, on
November the 15th, 2021, I

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.750 align:middle line:84%
took my little dog for a
walk in the part of the Dyke

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.840 align:middle line:90%
where I'm stood behind me.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.260 align:middle line:10%
Whilst I'm there,
there's a guy walking,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.710 align:middle line:10%
doing the same thing as us,
is stopped for a coffee.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And I strike up a
conversation with him,

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and I ask him if he's seen
anything unusual in the Dyke.

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:08.820 align:middle line:90%
I cite the big cat.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.705 align:middle line:84%
I usually do that if I'm trying
to strike up a conversation.

00:10:11.705 --> 00:10:12.580 align:middle line:90%
I think we all do it.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.277 align:middle line:84%
We all want to know if anybody's
had some kind of experience

00:10:15.277 --> 00:10:17.610 align:middle line:84%
because that's the nature of
what we're about, everybody

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:18.990 align:middle line:90%
here I would think.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And he said he hadn't
seen a big cat.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:21.990 align:middle line:90%
And he asked me the date.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And I opened my phone,
November the 15th.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.180 align:middle line:84%
He said, it will have been
a month ago today taken us

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.460 align:middle line:90%
to October the 15th.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.150 align:middle line:90%
Came for a walk.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:36.030 align:middle line:84%
He said, he explained that he
uses public transport, a bus.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:39.017 align:middle line:84%
And he was walking
back to the bus stop,

00:10:39.017 --> 00:10:41.100 align:middle line:84%
which you can see just
below where it says October

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.990 align:middle line:90%
the 15th at about 10 to 5:00.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:46.110 align:middle line:90%
So the bus came about 10 past.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is what he
claims because he

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.862 align:middle line:90%
allowed me to record him.

00:10:48.862 --> 00:10:49.662 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:10:49.662 --> 00:10:51.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, what it was
is I left the ward.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.780 align:middle line:84%
What I mean, it should have
part the Dyke, Danes Dyke.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm taking
my Wellies off,

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:59.640 align:middle line:84%
this big thing, it
was gray in color.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And it just stopped
and stared at me.

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:05.325 align:middle line:84%
It was just turning dark, and
I looked at the dog, its face.

00:11:05.325 --> 00:11:06.180 align:middle line:90%
I kid you not.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.913 align:middle line:10%
It looked half human, half dog.

00:11:07.913 --> 00:11:10.080 align:middle line:10%
But the head of the bloody
thing looked bloody huge.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.942 align:middle line:10%
And when it looked
at me, the eyes

00:11:12.942 --> 00:11:14.400 align:middle line:10%
were bloody sparkling
on the thing.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:14.910 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:17.285 align:middle line:84%
>> The eyes were sparkling,
as if he's not seen something

00:11:17.285 --> 00:11:19.170 align:middle line:90%
unusual stood at the bus stop.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Quite an unexpected
conversation.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.790 align:middle line:84%
I've spoken to him
since, but the sparkling

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:26.940 align:middle line:84%
eyes I find fascinating because,
if we go back through folklore,

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.590 align:middle line:84%
the Eastern North
Yorkshire coast

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.360 align:middle line:84%
and into the forests
of North Yorkshire

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.400 align:middle line:84%
where we'll visit
shortly, we've got

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.310 align:middle line:84%
the phantom hounds with the
huge glowing eyes, the amber

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:38.710 align:middle line:84%
eyes and the flaming red eyes
that roam through folklore.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:43.110 align:middle line:84%
So really, I'm walking in
other people's footsteps here.

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:44.315 align:middle line:90%
I'm not treading new ground.

00:11:44.315 --> 00:11:46.440 align:middle line:84%
We're probably dressing it
up with different words,

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.287 align:middle line:84%
but people have
done this before.

00:11:50.287 --> 00:11:52.620 align:middle line:84%
I think we should really look
at the stories of folklore

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:56.430 align:middle line:84%
and give them a little bit more
credence than what they get.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.460 align:middle line:90%
So we'll move on.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.670 align:middle line:84%
So we've got the strange
coastline of East

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and North Yorkshire, a mile
and a half to two miles

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.930 align:middle line:90%
from Danes Dyke.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:07.810 align:middle line:90%
February the 7th, 2019.

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Bempton Cliffs, my
primary area of research.

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.223 align:middle line:84%
And I know people have said, oh,
it's the Skinwalker of the UK.

00:12:14.223 --> 00:12:15.640 align:middle line:10%
I don't think it
needs that title.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.350 align:middle line:10%
It can stand on
its own two feet.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.330 align:middle line:10%
Everything presents here.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:20.452 align:middle line:10%
It won't present to order.

00:12:20.452 --> 00:12:21.910 align:middle line:10%
You can probably
go for six months.

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:24.020 align:middle line:10%
You might go for a
year and see nothing.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.770 align:middle line:10%
But there's a higher
probability to experience

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:29.050 align:middle line:10%
unexplained phenomena here
than I believe anywhere

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.120 align:middle line:10%
else in the UK, certainly.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.630 align:middle line:10%
February the 7th,
two ex-military guys

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:39.250 align:middle line:10%
visited Bempton, keen birds
enthusiasts, particularly

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:40.190 align:middle line:10%
birds of prey.

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:42.500 align:middle line:90%
And this is a bird sanctuary.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to see
the peregrine falcons that

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.600 align:middle line:84%
were flying wild up there in
full flight early morning.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.140 align:middle line:84%
When they arrived very late,
a bit of frost on the ground,

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.840 align:middle line:90%
they've got two dogs with them.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And they decided to go for
a walk, late night walk.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.440 align:middle line:84%
I've spoke to them, and he
said since, one of them,

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.660 align:middle line:84%
he said, the feeling in the
air that night, he says,

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.320 align:middle line:84%
I've done Bogside
in Northern Ireland.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.800 align:middle line:84%
I've done Iraq and
experienced conflict.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.810 align:middle line:84%
He says, but nothing
felt quite like that.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And what we saw, it were
off the scale of fear

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:15.903 align:middle line:90%
that I've ever experienced.

00:13:15.903 --> 00:13:17.195 align:middle line:90%
And this is what he had to say.

00:13:17.195 --> 00:13:17.995 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:13:17.995 --> 00:13:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The atmosphere
was bloody weird.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:21.290 align:middle line:90%
It was electric.

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:23.090 align:middle line:84%
I can't really
put it into words.

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:26.480 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this was about 2:00ish,
so we're shining the lamp.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And we lit up a pair
of fucking yellow eyes.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:30.620 align:middle line:90%
We carried on walking.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And we walked through
for another five minutes.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.470 align:middle line:84%
We got through this gate post
and walked a couple of meters.

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:38.960 align:middle line:84%
We lit her up again 20
feet in front of us.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.870 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have a point of
reference for what it could be.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:42.890 align:middle line:90%
And I was hunkered down.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:44.360 align:middle line:90%
And at first it was on his back.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And then the [BLEEP] thing
stood up on two legs, mate.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:49.460 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I could
think of what it looked like

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:50.970 align:middle line:90%
was a [BLEEP] werewolf.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:51.770 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:52.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you imagine that?

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.860 align:middle line:90%
Absolute terror.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:56.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I know.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.990 align:middle line:84%
This guy along with
other people claimed

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:01.610 align:middle line:84%
to have seen this
along the clifftops.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:02.450 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's barren.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:07.220 align:middle line:84%
We've got 80 to 420-foot cliffs,
with the sea hitting the bottom

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.290 align:middle line:90%
of them most of the time.

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:13.160 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally, on a low tide you
will have a bit of rocky beach.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.630 align:middle line:84%
But nobody can
walk around there.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:17.360 align:middle line:84%
You've got farmland to the
right, the left, and inside.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.830 align:middle line:84%
So basically, there's
nowhere to hide such a thing

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:25.100 align:middle line:84%
as what these guys are
claiming they've seen.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.740 align:middle line:84%
But we've just got to
define what the real is.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.240 align:middle line:90%
That's what we've got to do.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.730 align:middle line:84%
It's real, but we've got
to define what the real is.

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And something, like
I've said before,

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.530 align:middle line:84%
within the structure
of the land--

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:38.540 align:middle line:84%
this is close to the
magnetic anomaly--

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.150 align:middle line:84%
is enabling many forms
of unexplained phenomena

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:45.450 align:middle line:84%
to present and present in close
proximity and by time as well.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:47.420 align:middle line:90%
So the next slide.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.190 align:middle line:90%
This lady is-- there you go.

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:53.420 align:middle line:84%
It's less than a year later,
January the 31st, 2020.

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And Jamie came
with a friend, Lee,

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.060 align:middle line:90%
and they stayed at Flamborough.

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.980 align:middle line:84%
They stayed near the
lighthouse in a cottage.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.810 align:middle line:90%
And they arrived quite late.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:04.880 align:middle line:90%
And she decided to--

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.610 align:middle line:84%
or they decided to go for a late
night walk to where she stood--

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:09.680 align:middle line:90%
now, that's North Landing--

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.510 align:middle line:84%
and said, there were a bit
of moonlight, no full moon,

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:13.505 align:middle line:90%
bit of cloud.

00:15:13.505 --> 00:15:15.380 align:middle line:84%
But they could see the
contours of the cliffs

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.760 align:middle line:90%
and the white chalk cliffs.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And if the photograph extended
behind her, there's a ravine.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.610 align:middle line:84%
It's got earth
steps cut into it.

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:25.100 align:middle line:90%
It's about 60 foot deep.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.768 align:middle line:84%
And they walked down
into the ravine.

00:15:26.768 --> 00:15:28.310 align:middle line:84%
There's a wooden
bridge at the bottom

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.320 align:middle line:84%
of the cliffs, fresh
water stream running out

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.460 align:middle line:90%
into the sea.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.590 align:middle line:84%
They can hear the
sound of the sea.

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:37.500 align:middle line:84%
They also heard a flock
of geese flying overhead.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And then, we talk about--
people call it the Oz Factor.

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:42.800 align:middle line:84%
I prefer to call it
the lower silence.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.140 align:middle line:84%
But there's a raised awareness
before the lower silence.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:50.220 align:middle line:84%
She said, they became aware that
there was something changing.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And then everything
descended into this vacuum

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.800 align:middle line:90%
of this disjointed reality.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And she tapped her friend,
Lee, and said, come on,

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:00.860 align:middle line:90%
we need to go.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.090 align:middle line:84%
They became frightened
and said, we need to go.

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:04.958 align:middle line:90%
We can do this in the daylight.

00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.000 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they did.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.400 align:middle line:84%
But they paused at
the top of the cliff

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.340 align:middle line:84%
and looked out onto
the rocks momentarily.

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And something sat there
that weren't there before.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Lee explained that
it was six foot tall.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.582 align:middle line:84%
He said, this thing,
whatever it was,

00:16:18.582 --> 00:16:21.750 align:middle line:84%
looked six foot in
the seated position.

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And they described this
as having long arms.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.280 align:middle line:90%
So there you go.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.080 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Kind of just
looking out to sea,

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.050 align:middle line:84%
and then I started to notice
something on the cliff.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:33.150 align:middle line:90%
It looked like a big dog.

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:35.550 align:middle line:84%
He brought an IR
camera, infrared camera

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:37.860 align:middle line:90%
and another camera with him.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And what he tried
to do, he tried

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:42.130 align:middle line:90%
to pick it up on the camera.

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:44.430 align:middle line:84%
So we can see it
with our naked eyes,

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:46.680 align:middle line:84%
but he couldn't pick
it up with the camera.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.050 align:middle line:90%
You got a weird feeling.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.310 align:middle line:90%
I can describe it as fear.

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:51.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't really know
because you're looking

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:52.785 align:middle line:90%
at something that's huge.

00:16:52.785 --> 00:16:53.590 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:55.710 align:middle line:90%
There's a few things in there.

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:57.540 align:middle line:90%
The all accounts fascinating.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, there's a lot more
detail to that in "Wolflands."

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And most of these
people are on camera.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.160 align:middle line:84%
They're not got
their back to camera

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.190 align:middle line:90%
or blurred out or anything.

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:10.983 align:middle line:84%
So they can see it
with the naked eye,

00:17:10.983 --> 00:17:12.900 align:middle line:84%
but they can't see it
with an infrared camera.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.660 align:middle line:84%
That's taking it away from
any normal type of animal.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.760 align:middle line:90%
They heard a growl.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.680 align:middle line:84%
It lowered to-- not
lowered to the ground,

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.210 align:middle line:90%
but lowered and slinked away.

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:22.470 align:middle line:90%
And they made a hasty retreat.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.510 align:middle line:10%
Myself and Bob Brown
who sat in the audience,

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:27.000 align:middle line:10%
we met them the
very next morning

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.430 align:middle line:10%
and got the story,
as well as close

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:33.280 align:middle line:10%
to the source from the
actual location as we could.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.080 align:middle line:90%
So we move on.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.890 align:middle line:84%
We're literally,
February the 7th,

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:42.690 align:middle line:84%
2019 was the military
guys' connection.

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Just about a year later,
just over a year later,

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.900 align:middle line:84%
and we're 500 yards away
from where the guys are there

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.220 align:middle line:90%
sighting.

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And on this night,
myself, Bob Brown,

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.860 align:middle line:84%
and one of my daughters,
Gemma, came to the clifftops.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Gemma has no interest in
unexplained phenomena at all.

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:01.980 align:middle line:84%
She was staying with
us for a few weeks.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:05.580 align:middle line:84%
The alternative was to
watch TV soaps with her mom

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.650 align:middle line:84%
or come with us,
and she chose that.

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:08.830 align:middle line:90%
She chose to come with us.

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:10.788 align:middle line:84%
So while they're there,
I'm setting a camera up

00:18:10.788 --> 00:18:13.950 align:middle line:84%
on the clifftops hoping to catch
these spheres of orange light

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:17.178 align:middle line:84%
that I've been banging
on about for years.

00:18:17.178 --> 00:18:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And I can hear Gemma
and Bob talking.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.137 align:middle line:84%
And she's picked
her big torch up,

00:18:20.137 --> 00:18:25.020 align:middle line:84%
and she's highlighted a white
square on about 60 yards away.

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.450 align:middle line:84%
At first, Bob said it might
be a board on a fence post.

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:30.630 align:middle line:84%
But we go up to those cliffs in
the winter four or five times

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:33.600 align:middle line:84%
a week at night, and he
soon realized it wasn't.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.280 align:middle line:90%
So here's Bob.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.540 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:39.795 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell us what you saw on that
hillside, Bob, in the night.

00:18:39.795 --> 00:18:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, Gemma saw--

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.020 align:middle line:84%
she put her torch
on, and she said,

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.270 align:middle line:84%
there's a white light over
there, a square white light.

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, there's
no post out there, Gemma.

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:53.400 align:middle line:84%
So I shone my light, and I saw
the bright light, square light.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And it dropped to the
ground and disappeared.

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:56.580 align:middle line:90%

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:57.925 align:middle line:90%
>> They became a bit animated.

00:18:57.925 --> 00:19:00.300 align:middle line:84%
That's when-- because it was
just background noise to me.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.135 align:middle line:84%
I weren't really
taking a lot of notice.

00:19:02.135 --> 00:19:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And that were
probably-- well, it

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:04.927 align:middle line:84%
was the highlight
of anything that

00:19:04.927 --> 00:19:07.110 align:middle line:84%
happened because,
like I've said,

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:10.470 align:middle line:84%
we'd go up there four or five
times a week in the winter time

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:12.630 align:middle line:90%
when there's no tourists about.

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And as everybody else
in this audience knows,

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.660 align:middle line:84%
true unexplained phenomena
does not present to order.

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.610 align:middle line:84%
It's always when you're
least expecting it.

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And at times, it's when
I've took strangers up

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:24.150 align:middle line:90%
that it's happened.

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Chris Turner, who you probably
all know, and Jerry Denning,

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:27.600 align:middle line:90%
they've been up.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And they've seen the
light form phenomena.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:30.870 align:middle line:90%
First time, first hit.

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:32.850 align:middle line:84%
We'd been going up for
months and seen nothing.

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:34.590 align:middle line:90%
But they got to see it.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And we'll just move
to this next one.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:41.730 align:middle line:84%
So later that night,
when we got home,

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:44.310 align:middle line:84%
probably had a tea or a
coffee, and I went to bed,

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:47.370 align:middle line:90%
Gemma stayed up to watch TV.

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:50.310 align:middle line:84%
So I'll just give a
breakdown of the room.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:53.820 align:middle line:90%
There's an alcove with a --

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:57.750 align:middle line:84%
excuse me-- a large TV on the
wall in front and a solid brick

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:59.030 align:middle line:90%
wall behind.

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Behind that is a hall
with another brick wall.

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.650 align:middle line:90%
Above is a soundproofed ceiling.

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:06.090 align:middle line:90%
Why am I saying all this?

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:09.060 align:middle line:84%
It will make sense in a moment--
and a flat above, unoccupied.

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.740 align:middle line:84%
I know that because
they're our flats.

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:13.730 align:middle line:84%
There was no nobody
living in it at the time.

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:15.930 align:middle line:90%
She said, I'm watching TV.

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Bear in mind, this is about a
year after the military guys

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:21.810 align:middle line:90%
have seen this werewolf.

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:24.310 align:middle line:90%
And I become aware of a noise.

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And at first I thought
it was thunder,

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.020 align:middle line:90%
and I muted the TV, and this--

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:29.820 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:33.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Gemma, can you tell me what
happened later that night after

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:37.410 align:middle line:84%
you and Bob had seen that square
of white light on the hillside?

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>> I stayed up late watching
a film, and all of a sudden,

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:42.630 align:middle line:90%
I heard a noise.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.060 align:middle line:84%
At first, I thought
it was thunder,

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.220 align:middle line:90%
so I turned the TV down.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized
it was a growling

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.030 align:middle line:90%
sound that was right behind me.

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:53.250 align:middle line:90%
It was that loud.

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:55.800 align:middle line:84%
I could feel my
insides vibrating.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.110 align:middle line:90%
It was as loud as thunder.

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:02.280 align:middle line:84%
The only way I can describe
it, it was something demonic.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.540 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the way she felt. Now,
I've also written a book about

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.890 align:middle line:84%
my own experiences from
childhood to about 2020 when we

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:12.690 align:middle line:90%
finished the book.

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And my wife and our four
girls, the only person

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:19.790 align:middle line:84%
to have nothing to say
in that book is Gemma.

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:21.690 align:middle line:90%
Nothing seemed to affect her.

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:24.180 align:middle line:84%
She'd not been touched by
the phenomena, should we say.

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:26.760 align:middle line:84%
So it was unusual for her
to come out with this.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.630 align:middle line:90%
Now, where am I going with it?

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:31.170 align:middle line:84%
I will note the
play "Skinwalker."

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And you often get researchers
and interested parties

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:41.350 align:middle line:84%
who visit that location who,
at times, go back home and say

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.000 align:middle line:84%
that strange things
are happening.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost as though the
phenomena has arrived with them

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:46.990 align:middle line:90%
or interacting with them.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:49.400 align:middle line:84%
I believe they call it
the hitchhiker effect.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:53.215 align:middle line:84%
I'd think that it's an
intermind connection because I

00:21:53.215 --> 00:21:54.340 align:middle line:90%
think it's as easy as that.

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.620 align:middle line:84%
I think that we can
concentrate on these things,

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:59.080 align:middle line:90%
and we can evoke.

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that that's what
happened there with Gemma.

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:05.620 align:middle line:84%
I could be wrong, but
interesting nonetheless,

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:06.550 align:middle line:90%
for me anyway.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:09.700 align:middle line:84%
That gives you an idea of the
scale of Bempton and Speeton

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.170 align:middle line:90%
Cliffs.

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:14.800 align:middle line:84%
But before we do that, we've
got the rock anglers encounter,

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.030 align:middle line:90%
November 1998.

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:22.150 align:middle line:10%
Now, in 2018, once again, myself
and Bob went to the clifftops

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:23.420 align:middle line:10%
during the night.

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:24.770 align:middle line:10%
I set my cameras up as I do.

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:26.410 align:middle line:10%
We always put a heavy
towel over them.

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:28.060 align:middle line:10%
You can't have
them running 24/7.

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.400 align:middle line:10%
There's so much moisture
in the air in winter.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.820 align:middle line:10%
And I don't have the
funds to replace cameras

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.110 align:middle line:10%
of a few thousand pounds.

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:36.400 align:middle line:10%
So that's what I did.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.470 align:middle line:10%
And in the distance,
3/4 of a mile

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:39.880 align:middle line:10%
away, there's a rock angler.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.190 align:middle line:10%
I can see his head light,
and he's fishing off

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:43.420 align:middle line:10%
the edge of these cliffs.

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:46.180 align:middle line:10%
They literally do that,
and they catch fish.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.940 align:middle line:10%
Crazy-- in the night, no fence.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:52.540 align:middle line:10%
So yeah, I know.

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.613 align:middle line:10%
So right, I said to Bob--

00:22:54.613 --> 00:22:56.530 align:middle line:10%
because we started on--
they were on the move.

00:22:56.530 --> 00:23:00.730 align:middle line:10%
The tide must be going out, or
fishing's become unfavorable,

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:01.623 align:middle line:10%
and he's packed in.

00:23:01.623 --> 00:23:03.790 align:middle line:10%
I said, when he gets a
little bit closer to us, Bob,

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:04.957 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to put a light on.

00:23:04.957 --> 00:23:06.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to startle him.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.270 align:middle line:84%
It's two people just
sat in the darkness.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:10.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a bit odd anyway, isn't
it, when you think about it.

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:11.050 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:14.060 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, so I did just that.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.070 align:middle line:90%
I put the light on.

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:16.630 align:middle line:90%
He drew up alongside of us.

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:19.115 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know me, but he knew--

00:23:19.115 --> 00:23:20.740 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know him,
should I say, but he

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:23.830 align:middle line:84%
knew who I was because a lot
of the anglers, trawlermen,

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:26.260 align:middle line:84%
lifeboat men have
given me reports

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:28.750 align:middle line:84%
of the strange and unusual,
particularly the orange spheres

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:30.730 align:middle line:84%
of light that I'm
always talking about

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:32.350 align:middle line:90%
because they're not aircraft.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:34.930 align:middle line:84%
They're not some kind
of military exercise.

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:37.330 align:middle line:84%
These things have been
documented for decades.

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:40.240 align:middle line:84%
They're in the lifeboat logs
from the earliest of times,

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.300 align:middle line:84%
8 to 9 hour call-outs looking
for these spheres of light

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.510 align:middle line:84%
that they believe are
flares, aircraft in distress,

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:47.950 align:middle line:90%
boat gone down.

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:48.940 align:middle line:90%
Nothing to be seen.

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.890 align:middle line:90%
False alarm with good intent.

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:55.280 align:middle line:84%
These are the light forms,
the ILFs, in my opinion.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.530 align:middle line:90%
So he said he'd not seen them.

00:23:56.530 --> 00:24:00.122 align:middle line:10%
He'd fished the
clifftops 49 to 50 years.

00:24:00.122 --> 00:24:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And then he turned
around, he says,

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.840 align:middle line:84%
but I have seen a spaceship
land on that hill there,

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:05.870 align:middle line:90%
which is crazy.

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And I already had
heard the story

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:12.040 align:middle line:84%
from a rock angler who
was-- a rock angler's son

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.920 align:middle line:84%
who was with him that
night in November 1998

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.870 align:middle line:84%
because it was a
match, fishing match.

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:18.243 align:middle line:90%
And they all left the clifftops.

00:24:18.243 --> 00:24:19.660 align:middle line:84%
Some of them even
left the fishing

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.640 align:middle line:90%
tackle all in close proximity.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.880 align:middle line:84%
First, he thought it
were a combine harvester.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Human interpretation,
we're trying

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:28.035 align:middle line:90%
to fit this thing we can see.

00:24:28.035 --> 00:24:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And then he realized
he could see

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:31.355 align:middle line:84%
sky between the
land and the object.

00:24:31.355 --> 00:24:32.605 align:middle line:90%
So this is what he had to say.

00:24:32.605 --> 00:24:33.405 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:24:33.405 --> 00:24:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you tell us
what you saw in 1998?

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I was walking along here, and
I saw over the top of the hill,

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:42.130 align:middle line:84%
there was a bright light
with load of lights flashing.

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:44.740 align:middle line:84%
It was end of November time,
actually, but I thought,

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.048 align:middle line:84%
it can't be a combine
harvester at this time of year

00:24:47.048 --> 00:24:49.090 align:middle line:84%
because there's no noise
with it or anything, not

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:50.800 align:middle line:90%
20 or 30 feet off the ground.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.060 align:middle line:90%
It landed in the field.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And all we could see
was the lights of it.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.210 align:middle line:90%
It were strange.

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>> But it definitely
wasn't a helicopter.

00:24:57.490 --> 00:24:58.925 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no, no noise whatsoever.

00:24:58.925 --> 00:25:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you say there was sparks
and things coming off it?

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, there was.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was strange.

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:03.880 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.463 align:middle line:84%
>> If we'd have carried on, he'd
of said a circle of flame lit

00:25:06.463 --> 00:25:08.380 align:middle line:84%
up around it when
it touched down.

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:11.140 align:middle line:84%
They gathered everything they
could, all in close proximity

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:12.020 align:middle line:90%
and left.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.020 align:middle line:90%
So that's the story in 1998.

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:17.110 align:middle line:10%
I wish I could talk more about
1998, but I'm mindful of time

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:19.720 align:middle line:10%
because everything--

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.220 align:middle line:10%
they were very active in 1998.

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:25.000 align:middle line:10%
So before we leave this slide,
the ghost of big railings--

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.530 align:middle line:10%
for decades now,
people have talked

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:30.670 align:middle line:10%
about the ghost of a fisherman
that walks the clifftops up

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:32.980 align:middle line:10%
around Bempton and Speeton.

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:34.930 align:middle line:10%
But when you actually
speak to the people who

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:37.210 align:middle line:10%
claim to have seen the
ghost of big railings,

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:38.740 align:middle line:10%
he's light form phenomena.

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.480 align:middle line:10%
They've seen a sphere
of white light.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.855 align:middle line:10%
And they see this
light, and they

00:25:41.855 --> 00:25:44.920 align:middle line:10%
assume it's a headlight of a
man or he's carrying a light.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:48.910 align:middle line:10%
But they're not actually
seeing this form of a person.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:51.150 align:middle line:90%
So we'll move on.

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:54.810 align:middle line:84%
The disconnected connections
and the guy in the picture

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:58.650 align:middle line:84%
is Lee Hayward, really
switched on, articulate guy.

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:00.730 align:middle line:84%
Very skeptical
but in a good way.

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:03.090 align:middle line:90%
There's no sarcasm with Lee.

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:05.550 align:middle line:90%
And back in 2019--

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:07.900 align:middle line:84%
November the 14th is
when we went up there.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:11.200 align:middle line:84%
But back in 2019, he spoke to
me because we're good friends.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.172 align:middle line:84%
And he said he'd like to see
these lights for himself.

00:26:14.172 --> 00:26:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Come up, he says,
because he thinks

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:18.240 align:middle line:84%
he can find an earthly
explanation for them.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.470 align:middle line:90%
And say I like Lee.

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:21.570 align:middle line:84%
Loads of time for
him, and why not?

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:23.940 align:middle line:84%
Come up two or three
times a week in winter.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.742 align:middle line:84%
The very first night that we
went to up, the very first--

00:26:26.742 --> 00:26:28.200 align:middle line:84%
and this is like
what we're talking

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.380 align:middle line:84%
about with Chris Turner,
as Chris seeing them

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.130 align:middle line:90%
when he came up.

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:35.640 align:middle line:84%
We're driving up Cliff
Lane, a single track

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.010 align:middle line:84%
road that leads to the
nature reserve, nothing

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:41.310 align:middle line:84%
either side but open fields,
no streetlights, no properties.

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:42.810 align:middle line:90%
It's devoid of everything.

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:44.100 align:middle line:90%
He said, come on then, Paul.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.598 align:middle line:90%
What do these lights look like?

00:26:45.598 --> 00:26:46.890 align:middle line:90%
And I looked out of the window.

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.110 align:middle line:84%
There's an orange sphere
about the size of a pea

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:50.445 align:middle line:90%
at arm's length in the sky.

00:26:50.445 --> 00:26:51.940 align:middle line:90%
I said, like that.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:55.530 align:middle line:84%
I didn't expect to see it, but
Lee admitted afterwards, he

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:59.820 align:middle line:84%
said, I didn't really know what
I was looking at even then.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Over the course of that
night, three to four hours

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:06.240 align:middle line:84%
that we stayed up
there, the light forms

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.940 align:middle line:84%
presented over the sea
three or four times.

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:12.517 align:middle line:84%
One would switch on, become
two, become three, switch off,

00:27:12.517 --> 00:27:14.100 align:middle line:84%
appear in a different
part of the sky.

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Not fly away, appear in a
different part of the sky.

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Instantly, you just
look, and it's there.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.790 align:middle line:84%
This happened three
or four times.

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:23.780 align:middle line:90%
Lee stood behind me.

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:24.905 align:middle line:90%
I've got the camera set up.

00:27:24.905 --> 00:27:26.090 align:middle line:90%
I can't catch him on camera.

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:28.520 align:middle line:84%
I did the night that
Chris Turner came up,

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.598 align:middle line:84%
and Chris and Jerry
had cameras with them.

00:27:30.598 --> 00:27:31.640 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't catch them.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.870 align:middle line:90%
But they saw them.

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:36.050 align:middle line:84%
So no sound, totally silent,
not flying from anywhere,

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:37.460 align:middle line:90%
just appearing.

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:40.430 align:middle line:84%
I turned around to look at
Lee, and that was in the field.

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:41.980 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, that's
a representation

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:44.780 align:middle line:84%
of what Les Drake, who was
making "Wolflands" with me,

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:47.390 align:middle line:90%
as made for this talk.

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:50.270 align:middle line:84%
About 80 yards away, I couldn't
believe what I were looking at.

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:51.510 align:middle line:90%
It was huge.

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:52.760 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't touching the ground.

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:53.885 align:middle line:90%
It was just off the ground.

00:27:53.885 --> 00:27:55.220 align:middle line:90%
It was very, very bright.

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't illuminating
the area around it

00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:59.960 align:middle line:84%
for the brightness
of what it should be.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.440 align:middle line:90%
And this is what Lee had to say.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.240 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.060 align:middle line:84%
>> The surrounding of the light
itself was about the size,

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.460 align:middle line:84%
I would say, now looking
at it and thinking back,

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.950 align:middle line:84%
then about the size of
a Volkswagen Beetle.

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:11.860 align:middle line:84%
That was the influence
that the light had.

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And you couldn't see
anything in the light

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:16.520 align:middle line:84%
except for undulating
light patterns,

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.470 align:middle line:84%
almost as if you
were staring at lava.

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So there was
definitely, again,

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.860 align:middle line:84%
some kind of definite
feeling inside me that this

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:26.600 align:middle line:90%
wasn't man-made.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.965 align:middle line:84%
But it was something that
was beyond my explaining.

00:28:28.965 --> 00:28:29.765 align:middle line:90%
I can't explain.

00:28:29.765 --> 00:28:30.560 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.602 align:middle line:84%
>> I love the fact that
he can't explain, people.

00:28:32.602 --> 00:28:33.830 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:38.018 align:middle line:84%
So that was November
the 14th, 2019.

00:28:38.018 --> 00:28:39.560 align:middle line:84%
So the next picture
you're looking at

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.110 align:middle line:90%
is Speeton Cliffs, 420 feet.

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Just a bit lower down, you go
to the next village of Ryton.

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:49.105 align:middle line:84%
They started about 30 degrees
and slowly become vertical.

00:28:49.105 --> 00:28:50.480 align:middle line:84%
This will make
sense in a moment.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.600 align:middle line:84%
After lockdown eased
its rules, we still

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.430 align:middle line:84%
couldn't go to the
nature reserve.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:57.470 align:middle line:84%
So I rang a farm--
because there would

00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:00.860 align:middle line:84%
have been more people than
just twos taking exercise.

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:02.963 align:middle line:84%
So I rang a farmer who
I know and asked him

00:29:02.963 --> 00:29:04.130 align:middle line:90%
if I could park on his land.

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And myself and Bob
walked across the field,

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:10.820 align:middle line:84%
took a golf trolley, a couple
of chairs, flasks, and cameras.

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And we set up on the
edge of the cliffs,

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.450 align:middle line:84%
set the camera up, put
the heavy towel over it.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:17.840 align:middle line:84%
It was fabulous, just
freedom, to be honest.

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.190 align:middle line:90%
It were really good.

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:21.620 align:middle line:84%
We'd been there about 20
minutes, and a man walked down,

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:24.650 align:middle line:84%
a great tall chap about six
foot six with a gun dog.

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:26.570 align:middle line:90%
He'd got a pointer dog with him.

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:29.650 align:middle line:84%
I says, if we were
having a nice evening.

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Are we enjoying
looking at the seabirds

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.740 align:middle line:84%
because we know it's
a seabird colony.

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.530 align:middle line:84%
November, there weren't
many there any route.

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:38.750 align:middle line:90%
But this is 2020, sorry.

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:43.390 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, he walks down
towards Flamborough.

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:47.180 align:middle line:84%
About 45 minutes passed,
and he's coming back.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:49.180 align:middle line:84%
We've already told him
that-- we didn't tell him

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.680 align:middle line:84%
we weren't looking
at the sea birds,

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.390 align:middle line:84%
but we didn't tell
him anything else.

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:53.710 align:middle line:90%
It's dark.

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:54.893 align:middle line:90%
So he's curious.

00:29:54.893 --> 00:29:56.560 align:middle line:84%
There's a camera set
up even though it's

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:57.735 align:middle line:90%
got the towel over it.

00:29:57.735 --> 00:29:59.110 align:middle line:84%
He says, what
you're doing, lads,

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:00.070 align:middle line:84%
he said, because
obviously you're

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.270 align:middle line:90%
not looking at the seabirds.

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:02.830 align:middle line:84%
So I told him, I am
after documenting

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:05.340 align:middle line:90%
these spheres of light.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And he explained, he
says, I live at Ryton,

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:09.590 align:middle line:90%
the next village down.

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:11.563 align:middle line:84%
And I've got windows
that overlook the sea.

00:30:11.563 --> 00:30:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And all the time that I've lived
there, I've never seen a thing.

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:15.330 align:middle line:90%
But he weren't sarcastic.

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:16.700 align:middle line:90%
He was just stating a fact.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:18.450 align:middle line:90%
Not everybody does.

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that
were end of it.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And as he's walking
away, Bob says to him,

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.130 align:middle line:90%
what about unusual animals?

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever seen
anything unusual,

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:30.965 align:middle line:84%
citing the big cat that's been
seen up there for many years.

00:30:30.965 --> 00:30:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And he asked him if he'd
seen this black cat.

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, he just stopped and
told his dog to sit down.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:38.780 align:middle line:84%
He said, I can't believe
I'm going to tell you this,

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.420 align:middle line:84%
he said, but I've got two
guys here talking to me,

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:43.400 align:middle line:84%
asking about UFOs
and strange animals.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.650 align:middle line:84%
He says, I have seen
something unusual.

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:49.120 align:middle line:84%
He says, it was
November of last year.

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.190 align:middle line:84%
So we know where
we're going with this.

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I parked the car
up near Ryton Holiday Camp,

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.392 align:middle line:84%
walked onto the beach,
down towards Speeton.

00:30:58.392 --> 00:31:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And just before-- you can
see that black shape there,

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.270 align:middle line:84%
there's a ravine
called Black Cliff.

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:07.202 align:middle line:84%
A lot of strange stuff
happened there as well.

00:31:07.202 --> 00:31:08.910 align:middle line:84%
He said, this dog--
it's hard to explain.

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And he says, my dog's
really clever, he says.

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And I can kind of
read him, he says.

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And if he's in a certain stance,
I know by his body language

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:17.340 align:middle line:90%
he's seen a rabbit.

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:19.563 align:middle line:84%
Something else-- he might
have seen a pheasant.

00:31:19.563 --> 00:31:20.980 align:middle line:84%
He said, but I
can't work him out.

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:22.772 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what he's
looking at, he said.

00:31:22.772 --> 00:31:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And he's looking up
halfway up this hill.

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:26.520 align:middle line:84%
So I got my
binoculars, had a look.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.980 align:middle line:84%
He said, and there's
an animal on all fours.

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.400 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thinking it's a very
big goat or a small pony.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
it is, he said.

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:36.060 align:middle line:90%
But there's a lot of moonlight.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.010 align:middle line:90%
It's the full moon.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:41.383 align:middle line:84%
And with this, it
stood on two legs.

00:31:41.383 --> 00:31:42.300 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm looking--

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.800 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe
what I'm looking at.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.650 align:middle line:84%
He says, have you ever seen
the werewolf from Harry Potter?

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So me and Bob just
looked at each other

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:51.160 align:middle line:84%
and grinned because this
explanation, obviously,

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.790 align:middle line:84%
in recent years,
after the film, has

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:56.820 align:middle line:84%
been given to us about
what's been seen at Flixton.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:58.647 align:middle line:84%
So we said we knew
what he meant.

00:31:58.647 --> 00:32:00.480 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I didn't
see no glowing eyes.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.772 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see no gnashing teeth.

00:32:01.772 --> 00:32:03.300 align:middle line:10%
I could just see

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.280 align:middle line:10%
was the full moon of November.

Said he turned and ran on
two legs over the cliff tops.

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:09.810 align:middle line:90%
He says, I've never told nobody.

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:12.960 align:middle line:10%
What I find interesting,
just like the paratroopers

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.280 align:middle line:10%
in Gemma's experience
the year before,

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:21.120 align:middle line:10%
the full moon in November
2019 was November the 12th,

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.670 align:middle line:10%
two days before
myself and Lee Heywood

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:28.015 align:middle line:10%
saw this huge sphere of light
less than two miles away.

00:32:28.015 --> 00:32:29.640 align:middle line:10%
Now, please don't
think that I'm trying

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:32.340 align:middle line:10%
to say that the cryptids are
traveling around in spheres

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:33.950 align:middle line:10%
of light because I'm not.

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:37.387 align:middle line:84%
That's entirely the
opposite of what I'm saying.

00:32:37.387 --> 00:32:38.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying that
there's something

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:41.880 align:middle line:84%
enabling the phenomena to
present, as I've said before.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:42.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I am.

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:46.140 align:middle line:84%
It's finding out what that is,
I think, the key that we all

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:48.490 align:middle line:90%
need to be looking for.

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:49.290 align:middle line:90%
The next slide.

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:51.670 align:middle line:84%
The guy in the picture,
a former police officer,

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:54.180 align:middle line:84%
a good friend of
mine Dave Barnes.

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:58.590 align:middle line:10%
On this night in
2018, myself and Dave

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:01.650 align:middle line:10%
were walking the
clifftops early evening.

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:04.020 align:middle line:10%
I've got a Sony, an X80
camcorder in my hand.

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:05.790 align:middle line:90%
It weren't switched on.

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:08.785 align:middle line:84%
And Dave suddenly-- six
miles away suddenly said,

00:33:08.785 --> 00:33:10.410 align:middle line:84%
something's just come
out of the water.

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:13.350 align:middle line:90%
I caught it midpoint.

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:16.830 align:middle line:84%
It was about 100 foot, 150
foot in the air, we believe.

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Difficult to see
when you're looking

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:20.010 align:middle line:90%
at something six miles away.

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:21.690 align:middle line:90%

fill us in on this.

this bright white light.

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:36.900 align:middle line:10%
It did come out of the sea.

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.340 align:middle line:10%
It come straight
up into the air.

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:43.050 align:middle line:10%
It did a 90-degree turn to the
right and headed towards us.

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:45.480 align:middle line:10%
It carried on in a
level trajectory,

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.790 align:middle line:10%
and then it went down into
the sea quite near to us.

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:51.030 align:middle line:10%
We both took some footage of it.

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:53.430 align:middle line:10%
We estimate this about
six miles away from where

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:55.200 align:middle line:10%
we're standing to Filey Brigg.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.410 align:middle line:10%

that would be something

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:01.380 align:middle line:10%
like 360 mile an hour.

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:04.260 align:middle line:10%
It was definitely
flying against the wind.

than a sighting or anything and

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:48.416 align:middle line:90%
He's not a UFO enthusiast.

to look at the stars.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.290 align:middle line:84%

the northern lights.

And when the
weather's favorable,

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:56.190 align:middle line:84%
when the conditions are
right, from Scalby Mills,

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:58.470 align:middle line:90%
you can see the northern lights.

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:01.757 align:middle line:84%
And he'd been up
there in the darkness,

00:36:01.757 --> 00:36:03.090 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, a number of hours.

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:06.300 align:middle line:84%

something strange, the raised

awareness.

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:12.010 align:middle line:84%

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:40.380 align:middle line:84%
hear this large animal crashing
about in the undergrowth.

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And then it started
coming towards him.

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.540 align:middle line:84%
He said, have you
been to the races

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:47.580 align:middle line:84%
and listened to the
racehorses as they

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:49.860 align:middle line:84%
come thundering towards
you, that influence

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:51.220 align:middle line:90%
that they have on the ground?

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:52.928 align:middle line:84%
He said that's what
it was like, he said.

00:36:52.928 --> 00:36:55.100 align:middle line:90%
But it was one animal.

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:57.153 align:middle line:90%
He said, it's coming towards me.

00:36:57.153 --> 00:36:58.570 align:middle line:84%
He says, I put my
hands on my head

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:00.880 align:middle line:84%
and dropped into
the fetal position.

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And there's no sound of
anything else now but this.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.110 align:middle line:84%
He said, and just as I thought
I was going to get whacked--

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:06.640 align:middle line:90%
and that were his exact words--

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:09.040 align:middle line:84%
everything just
snapped back to normal.

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.690 align:middle line:90%
I can hear the waves.

00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Everything's normal,
he says, almost

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:14.885 align:middle line:84%
like the phenomena
is playing with him.

00:37:14.885 --> 00:37:16.510 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way
I could look at it.

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Behind me is a massive
bay called Jackson's Bay.

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
in the third book.

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:23.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm not certain.

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.120 align:middle line:84%

about cryptid reports

this concentrated pocket

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:33.880 align:middle line:90%
in this area.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Before we leave this, you can
see Scalby Mills on the map.

for myself and Les

the map that we transition
through the documentary with.

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the red dot
to the left is Hackness,

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:51.460 align:middle line:84%
and that's the entrance
to the Forge Valley

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.920 align:middle line:84%
and the North Yorkshire
Moors National Park, which

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:58.810 align:middle line:84%
is 525 miles of moor,
forest, woodland,

with farms and little
villages interspersed.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:02.440 align:middle line:90%

And that's where we're
going to go next.

00:38:05.597 --> 00:38:07.180 align:middle line:84%
But before we go to
it, just below it,

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.420 align:middle line:84%
there's another village
called East Ayton.

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:12.940 align:middle line:10%

in an archive in Bridlington

with glowing eyes that

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:27.940 align:middle line:10%
were said to
frequent the forests

and moor around where
we're going to go next.

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:32.440 align:middle line:90%
So it's all there.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.790 align:middle line:90%
This has never gone away.

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:36.520 align:middle line:84%
We're just treading in
other people's footsteps.

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:41.150 align:middle line:84%
So Broxa Forest, or very
close to Broxa Forest.

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:44.450 align:middle line:84%
This is in a ravine, a
700 to 800-foot ravine.

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:46.190 align:middle line:10%
The guy on the left
is Chris Wright

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:48.860 align:middle line:10%
who was making "Wolflands"
with myself and Les.

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:50.720 align:middle line:10%
Chris has been
absolutely invaluable

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:54.150 align:middle line:10%
because he knows the area of the
landscape as well as anybody.

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:58.190 align:middle line:10%
The guy in the middle, witness
Steve, Jimmy on the right.

00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:01.670 align:middle line:10%
And there were three men in
2018 went into the forest.

00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:05.150 align:middle line:10%
Jim used to find places
where the three of them,

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:08.540 align:middle line:10%
we'll call the third witness,
witness C. The three of them

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:11.270 align:middle line:10%
could go and do some wild
camping, a bit of fishing.

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:15.700 align:middle line:10%
The river Derwent was about 20
yards away from where they sat.

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:17.710 align:middle line:10%
And it's just an
adventure for a weekend.

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:20.140 align:middle line:10%
Hard working men that just go
and do something like that.

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:22.060 align:middle line:10%
No interest in
unexplained phenomena.

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:24.210 align:middle line:10%
None of our witnesses have.

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:26.060 align:middle line:10%
It's come to them.

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:29.110 align:middle line:10%
So on this night, they
arrive quite late.

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:32.080 align:middle line:10%
It's not quite dark, and
they go into the ravine.

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.420 align:middle line:10%
In places, because
it's so steep,

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:36.340 align:middle line:10%
Les has had an
experience in the ravine

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.260 align:middle line:10%
where it collapsed at the top.

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:40.360 align:middle line:10%
He might tell you about
it if you ask him.

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.073 align:middle line:10%
It's 700 to 800 feet.

00:39:42.073 --> 00:39:43.990 align:middle line:10%
In places, they're coming
down on the bottoms,

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.650 align:middle line:10%
it's that steep.

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:46.108 align:middle line:10%
And when they arrive
at the bottom,

00:39:46.108 --> 00:39:48.040 align:middle line:10%
they want to light a small fire.

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:49.180 align:middle line:10%
They want to set up camp.

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:51.580 align:middle line:10%
And witness C suddenly starts
saying, I don't like it.

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:52.540 align:middle line:10%
We're being watched.

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:53.860 align:middle line:10%
Something's watching us.

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:55.320 align:middle line:10%
Totally out of character.

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.570 align:middle line:10%
They're looking at each other.

00:39:56.570 --> 00:39:58.360 align:middle line:10%
They can't work it out.

00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.180 align:middle line:10%
We've got to go.

00:39:59.180 --> 00:39:59.980 align:middle line:10%
We need to go.

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.685 align:middle line:10%
He said, well, it's
just about dark now.

00:40:01.685 --> 00:40:02.810 align:middle line:10%
And then it's getting dark.

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:04.820 align:middle line:10%
He says, it were going
on like this for an hour.

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:05.680 align:middle line:90%
And we're trying to comfort him.

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.630 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to console
him because he's just

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:09.160 align:middle line:90%
out of character.

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, a pair
of huge amber eyes

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.030 align:middle line:84%
lit up in the darkness,
self-illuminating eyes,

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:20.587 align:middle line:84%
is what they said, human shaped,
about three foot off the floor.

00:40:20.587 --> 00:40:22.170 align:middle line:10%
And he's getting
even more frightened,

00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:23.480 align:middle line:10%
absolutely terrified.

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:26.057 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, Jim
said, I couldn't stand it

00:40:26.057 --> 00:40:27.890 align:middle line:84%
any more because we're
frightened he's going

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:29.210 align:middle line:90%
to run off into the darkness.

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:30.470 align:middle line:90%
And I stood up.

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:32.660 align:middle line:84%
I took a few paces
towards these eyes,

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:35.780 align:middle line:84%
and I made a few hissing
sounds and shooing sounds.

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:37.440 align:middle line:10%
And just let him go.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:38.240 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:42.210 align:middle line:10%
>> We're going on for
at least an hour saying,

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:43.070 align:middle line:10%
I don't like it.

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:44.760 align:middle line:10%
I don't feel comfortable.

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.096 align:middle line:10%
>> This was prior to--

00:40:46.096 --> 00:40:46.896 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:40:46.896 --> 00:40:49.890 align:middle line:10%
Something's watching.

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:52.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Also, so it's actually
before these eyes were on you.

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.735 align:middle line:84%
>> --sort of perceived
this feeling.

00:40:54.735 --> 00:40:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>> He would tell you
it was like just--

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:58.460 align:middle line:84%
there's someone watching,
and I don't like it.

00:40:58.460 --> 00:40:59.260 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So we've got an example
there of the phenomena--

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:05.290 align:middle line:84%
we'll call it the phenomena
regardless of what it is--

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:08.800 align:middle line:84%
putting its influence onto
an individual before he's

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.090 align:middle line:90%
even seen it.

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:13.240 align:middle line:90%
Jim stood up, made these sounds.

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And we'll come back to
that slide in a moment.

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:17.380 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to
go to Brown head?

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:20.030 align:middle line:90%
Farm Stape six miles away.

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:21.280 align:middle line:90%
So we've got Scalby Mills.

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:25.030 align:middle line:84%
We've got to Broxa, and
then we've got Stape.

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Incidentally, a Broxa,
in some cultures,

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.400 align:middle line:90%
is a shapeshifting demon.

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And they're in a forest
called Broxa Forest, which

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:34.330 align:middle line:90%
is fascinating in itself.

00:41:34.330 --> 00:41:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Brown Head Farm, that's the
ruins of Brown Head as it

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:37.940 align:middle line:90%
is today.

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:41.350 align:middle line:84%
But back in 2002,
it had a roof on.

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:45.130 align:middle line:84%
It had windows in, and the
doors, one could be barricaded.

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:46.060 align:middle line:90%
One could be bolted.

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:46.930 align:middle line:90%
But it was derelict.

00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:50.740 align:middle line:84%
It had been derelict since
1952 until a young gamekeeper

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:53.200 align:middle line:84%
came across it in the
forest when he stepped out

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.280 align:middle line:90%
into a clearing.

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.650 align:middle line:84%
Back in the day, it had pine
trees tall to the back of it

00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:01.630 align:middle line:84%
and at the sides and a
clearing of land in the front.

00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And things started to change and
get strange for the gamekeeper

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.840 align:middle line:90%
in 2002.

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:11.680 align:middle line:10%
One night, whilst walking
home with his cousin who'd

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.510 align:middle line:10%
come to stay for a
few days, he said

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:14.740 align:middle line:10%
he'd just about gone feral.

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:15.880 align:middle line:10%
That were his words.

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:19.030 align:middle line:10%
So there's a fire in the
farmhouse and a well for water.

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:21.010 align:middle line:10%
And I'm living off the land.

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:22.580 align:middle line:10%
But he's walking home.

00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:23.380 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:24.338 align:middle line:10%
>> It were pitch black.

00:42:24.338 --> 00:42:29.487 align:middle line:84%
It had been 10:00,
11:00 at night, maybe.

00:42:29.487 --> 00:42:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And we're coming
down this track here.

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, all this
was-- it was all clear felled.

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:34.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, OK.

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:36.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And as we got to
middle of the clear fell,

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:40.333 align:middle line:90%
this light shot up sort of--

00:42:40.333 --> 00:42:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>> From about this location.

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it was about the middle
of where the clear fell was.

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>> And it just shot apart--

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:46.840 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>> The light shot up
baseball-sized sphere of light,

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:52.220 align:middle line:84%
shot up from the ground,
and carried on going.

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:53.830 align:middle line:84%
He thought it was
a trip wire flare.

00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:56.080 align:middle line:84%
He thought they'd caught it,
and he expected squaddies

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:57.670 align:middle line:90%
to come out and surround them.

00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:59.170 align:middle line:84%
Not that they'd
done anything wrong,

00:42:59.170 --> 00:43:01.150 align:middle line:84%
but we're very close
to area Fylingdales.

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:04.078 align:middle line:84%
So we've got the military
installation connection

00:43:04.078 --> 00:43:05.870 align:middle line:84%
as well where all the
things are happening.

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:08.350 align:middle line:84%
They're very close as
well, within a few miles,

00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:09.970 align:middle line:90%
of Goathland.

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Probably, people have watched
the program "Heartbeat"

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:13.750 align:middle line:90%
and the program "Goath."

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:15.340 align:middle line:90%
That's based in Goathland.

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.440 align:middle line:84%
But what that wouldn't
tell you is they

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:20.680 align:middle line:84%
have the Legend of the
Gytrash, huge phantom hound

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:24.440 align:middle line:84%
that haunts the forests
and moors around that area.

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:25.540 align:middle line:90%
So it's all there.

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:27.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's seen the
sphere of light.

00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:28.660 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happened.

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:31.780 align:middle line:84%
They check next day for scorch
marks in case it was a flare.

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:32.980 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And then everything
became weird.

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:36.670 align:middle line:84%
His cousin went home,
not because of that,

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:38.650 align:middle line:90%
because he just was going home.

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And he said,
wherever he went, he

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:42.980 align:middle line:90%
felt like he were being watched.

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:44.380 align:middle line:90%
Eyes are upon him.

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:46.610 align:middle line:84%
If he's chopping logs
outside the farmhouse,

00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:48.777 align:middle line:84%
he said, it's like there's
something on my shoulder.

00:43:48.777 --> 00:43:50.420 align:middle line:90%
It's that intense.

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Another gamekeeper with him
on this occasion and they

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:56.890 align:middle line:84%
hear a baby crying
in the forest.

00:43:56.890 --> 00:43:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And don't forget,
these are gamekeepers.

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:01.390 align:middle line:84%
They're used to a hedgehog being
attacked and making squealing

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:03.200 align:middle line:90%
sounds and the sounds of foxes.

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.210 align:middle line:90%
So this was an infant.

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:06.400 align:middle line:90%
It sounded like a human infant.

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And we went to the edge of where
it was crying, and it stopped.

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.170 align:middle line:90%
And started further in.

00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:14.030 align:middle line:84%
I realized this is probably
Bigfoot type phenomena

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:15.280 align:middle line:90%
that people are talking about.

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.100 align:middle line:84%
But this guy I don't think
that's what we're interacting.

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:20.380 align:middle line:90%
So we'll come back to him.

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:24.610 align:middle line:84%
We'll go back to the
forest close to Broxa,

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:27.070 align:middle line:90%
and we'll just finish this off.

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:30.700 align:middle line:84%
So Jim has stood up, made the
hissing sounds and shooing

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:33.430 align:middle line:84%
sounds, and the
eyes of disappeared.

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:34.240 align:middle line:90%
Relief.

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Turns back around and looks
at witness C and Steve,

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:43.490 align:middle line:84%
and they've got looks of
absolute terror on their faces.

00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And when he looks,
the eyes, which

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:49.220 align:middle line:84%
were three foot off the
ground, should I say,

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:51.290 align:middle line:90%
are now in the air.

00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:52.090 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:55.855 align:middle line:84%
>> From the eyes being lowered
down to being seven foot

00:44:55.855 --> 00:44:59.770 align:middle line:84%
in the air, it was just like,
now I don't know what it is.

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:02.410 align:middle line:90%
And now I'm afraid.

00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>> You saw it stand up in there.

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>> The eyes rose perfectly
as if it were a machine.

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:09.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Just don't all
get in a fight.

00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:14.650 align:middle line:90%
It just went like a machine.

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:17.930 align:middle line:90%
It just-- just rose.

00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:21.290 align:middle line:90%


00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:22.280 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolute terror.

00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:26.780 align:middle line:84%
All night it stood
watching them.

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:29.930 align:middle line:84%
They described it as
being bigger than two men.

00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:31.580 align:middle line:84%
He said-- Steve in
the middle says,

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:33.560 align:middle line:84%
if you'd have asked
me to draw a werewolf,

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:35.060 align:middle line:90%
I would not have drawn that.

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:36.410 align:middle line:90%
He says, it looked--

00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:39.560 align:middle line:84%
its proportions were just
ridiculous, absolutely--

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:41.370 align:middle line:90%
and the self-illuminating eyes.

00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Said, we thought it was
growling, but it wasn't.

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:45.230 align:middle line:84%
We realized after a
while it's breathing.

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:46.440 align:middle line:90%
We can hear it's breathing.

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Says only about 30
foot away from them.

00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:52.740 align:middle line:84%
Huge ears, ridiculously long
with tufts of fur on the top,

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:53.540 align:middle line:90%
they said.

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:55.940 align:middle line:84%
It turned to the
right occasionally.

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:58.790 align:middle line:84%
They could see this elongated
muzzle that looked, once again,

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:00.650 align:middle line:90%
ridiculous, like Wile E. Coyote.

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:02.880 align:middle line:90%
Said, it was just ridiculous.

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.220 align:middle line:90%
And this thing is there.

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And there's also this
communication taking place

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:11.110 align:middle line:84%
again because witness C
is absolutely terrified.

00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:13.820 align:middle line:84%
But he's saying to Jim,
it wants you to go, Jim.

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:15.170 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't want you here.

00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:16.280 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't want you here.

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:17.690 align:middle line:90%
And he's telling him.

00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:20.960 align:middle line:84%
Looked at Steve and
told him the same.

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:22.970 align:middle line:84%
In the end, Steve
said-- because we were--

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:24.710 align:middle line:84%
luckily, he said,
we were so pleased

00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:27.840 align:middle line:84%
that we had witness
C to try and restrain

00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:29.840 align:middle line:84%
because it would have
been even more terrifying.

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:31.850 align:middle line:84%
That took their mind
off what they were--

00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:33.170 align:middle line:90%
the terror of what were there.

00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:35.390 align:middle line:84%
He said, but in the end,
I couldn't look at it.

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:38.510 align:middle line:84%
He said, it were pouring
out so much anger and vile

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:39.590 align:middle line:90%
towards them.

00:46:39.590 --> 00:46:41.158 align:middle line:90%
He said, I wanted it to end.

00:46:41.158 --> 00:46:42.200 align:middle line:90%
And he meant life ending.

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:45.170 align:middle line:90%
I wanted it to end.

00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:46.190 align:middle line:90%
Morning came.

00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:47.585 align:middle line:90%
It left.

00:46:47.585 --> 00:46:49.960 align:middle line:84%
As they're leaving the forest,
they pack up everything's.

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:50.530 align:middle line:90%
It's first light.

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:52.197 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to get
out of the forest.

00:46:52.197 --> 00:46:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Witness C still saying,
it's still here.

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:55.540 align:middle line:90%
It's still watching us.

00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:57.290 align:middle line:84%
They got to a certain
point in the forest,

00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:58.498 align:middle line:90%
he said, we're all right now.

00:46:58.498 --> 00:46:59.350 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:03.500 align:middle line:84%
So we've got, in my opinion,
some kind of communication.

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:07.030 align:middle line:84%
This intermind connection
with the witness.

00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:08.570 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's this guy's mindset.

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:09.370 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:10.960 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it can't do
it with everybody.

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it knows exactly
what we're thinking,

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:16.750 align:middle line:84%
and maybe some people just are
wired up slightly different,

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:18.070 align:middle line:90%
and they can--

00:47:18.070 --> 00:47:19.880 align:middle line:84%
it might have been
interested in him.

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:22.422 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:47:22.422 --> 00:47:24.380 align:middle line:84%
I think that first slide
is probably giving you

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:26.600 align:middle line:90%
an indication of what happened.

00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:29.420 align:middle line:90%
So he's in the farmhouse.

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:32.840 align:middle line:84%
He's had all these feelings
of being watched, the fear.

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And he's lit a
fire in the hearth,

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:37.212 align:middle line:90%
got in his sleeping bag.

00:47:37.212 --> 00:47:39.170 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, it's a lot
darker than that picture.

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:42.050 align:middle line:90%
I just did that for the book.

00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:44.570 align:middle line:90%
He wakes up in the early hours.

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:48.370 align:middle line:84%
He's not frightened, just aware,
just sort of, ugh, something

00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:49.170 align:middle line:90%
wrong here.

00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:50.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And he's taking in this kind of
atmosphere, and this happened.

00:47:55.770 --> 00:47:56.570 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:47:56.570 --> 00:47:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And I just remember looking
at it thinking it was looking

00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:00.020 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:01.340 align:middle line:90%
It was huge.

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:04.460 align:middle line:84%
So it had to duck
under the window lintel

00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:05.510 align:middle line:90%
in order to see me.

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:07.298 align:middle line:90%
So it was like that.

00:48:07.298 --> 00:48:08.840 align:middle line:84%
So I'm laying on
the floor looking up

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:11.090 align:middle line:84%
at it thinking what
am I going to do?

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:12.690 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:13.755 align:middle line:90%
>> What am I going to do?

00:48:13.755 --> 00:48:16.130 align:middle line:84%
Hey, I think we'd have all
had to wash our sleeping bags,

00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:16.700 align:middle line:90%
won't we?

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:18.950 align:middle line:84%
That would have been absolutely
terrifying experience.

00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:21.950 align:middle line:90%
So this thing watched him.

00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, very dark, just the
glowing embers of the fire.

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:28.730 align:middle line:84%
It watched him
five or 10 minutes,

00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:31.110 align:middle line:90%
went back into the forest.

00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:33.330 align:middle line:84%
He's already considering
his future here now,

00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:35.110 align:middle line:90%
and he is a great guy.

00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:37.530 align:middle line:84%
He's not a man that
frightens easily.

00:48:37.530 --> 00:48:41.430 align:middle line:84%
But I said to him, I said,
well, the door's locked.

00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:43.590 align:middle line:84%
He said, but-- the
front door was bolted.

00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:45.630 align:middle line:84%
The back door were
barricaded, but this thing

00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:47.130 align:middle line:84%
could have just
come through a wall.

00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:48.600 align:middle line:84%
He said, seriously,
he said, I've

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:51.000 align:middle line:84%
never seen anything as big,
the shoulders, the arms,

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.040 align:middle line:84%
didn't see glowing
eyes, didn't see teeth.

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:54.990 align:middle line:84%
That's what I like
about these witnesses.

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:56.160 align:middle line:90%
He's not elaborating.

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.230 align:middle line:84%
For "Wolfland,"
myself and Les, we've

00:48:58.230 --> 00:49:01.490 align:middle line:84%
put it over just like the
witnesses have told us.

00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:03.980 align:middle line:84%
But we've tried to
portray them respectfully.

00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:06.980 align:middle line:84%
There's no tongue in cheek
jokes for these people.

00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:11.420 align:middle line:84%
We want to do a good job at
putting over their accounts

00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:12.860 align:middle line:90%
best way we can.

00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:19.490 align:middle line:10%
So 24 hours later,
he's decided already

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:21.920 align:middle line:10%
that he's going to wait outside.

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:24.320 align:middle line:10%
So back in the day,
we've got pine trees,

00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:27.180 align:middle line:10%
40 foot pines behind the
farmhouse, tall, at the sides

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:27.980 align:middle line:10%
as well.

00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:30.320 align:middle line:10%
But that clearing
roughly where he stood,

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:32.420 align:middle line:10%
there would have been
forest behind him.

00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:35.660 align:middle line:10%
He lights a fire in the
hearth, packs his sleeping bag

00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:41.700 align:middle line:10%
with clothes, sets a tarpaulin
down on the ground, and waits.

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:43.810 align:middle line:10%
Anticipation, and this happened.

00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:44.610 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>> And as I'm down there
just watching the front

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:53.310 align:middle line:84%
of the building, it came in from
the right to the left and just

00:49:53.310 --> 00:49:54.480 align:middle line:90%
moved along.

00:49:54.480 --> 00:50:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And it came in here, kind
of just above the gutter

00:50:00.090 --> 00:50:02.533 align:middle line:90%
level on the outbuilding.

00:50:02.533 --> 00:50:03.450 align:middle line:90%
But it came in slowly.

00:50:03.450 --> 00:50:04.590 align:middle line:10%
It came in in one motion.

00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:05.100 align:middle line:10%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:06.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Which is fascinating.

00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:08.998 align:middle line:84%
And we know that it's well over
7 foot tall because it's come--

00:50:08.998 --> 00:50:11.040 align:middle line:84%
and we've been there and
measured and everything.

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:13.320 align:middle line:84%
We've even measured for
the guys close to Broxa,

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:16.020 align:middle line:84%
took a surveyor's tape
for the distance away.

00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:18.990 align:middle line:90%
But he didn't see leg movement.

00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:21.150 align:middle line:84%
That takes it away from
some kind of normal animal.

00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:22.440 align:middle line:90%
He said it just arrived.

00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:24.420 align:middle line:84%
His analogy was it was
like running a torch

00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:25.830 align:middle line:90%
beam down the wall.

00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:29.160 align:middle line:84%
So I can see these huge
shoulders, neck, and head.

00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And it arrives turned and
looks in the window, where

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:36.450 align:middle line:90%
he's sleeping bag's packed out.

00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:38.070 align:middle line:90%
But he's outside.

00:50:38.070 --> 00:50:40.470 align:middle line:84%
He says, I believe it
knew exactly where I was.

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:43.290 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't know why, but
that's what he believes.

00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:46.200 align:middle line:84%
He said, either that or there
was another one watching me.

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:48.930 align:middle line:84%
He said, I just can't explain
it, but I felt it knew.

00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Before we leave
this slide, there's

00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:54.390 align:middle line:84%
a forest a few miles
away called Harwood Dale.

00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And they're only
separated by names.

00:50:56.970 --> 00:50:59.460 align:middle line:90%
They said, Harwood Dale Forest.

00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And I have an account
from three mountain bikers

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:04.680 align:middle line:84%
that were going
down a logging road,

00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:06.930 align:middle line:84%
and about 30 foot
away in the bracken

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:11.160 align:middle line:84%
where you've got fallen
trees, huge stones, all manner

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:16.620 align:middle line:84%
of obstacles, there's a
creature not unlike he describes

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:18.500 align:middle line:90%
pacing them.

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:20.690 align:middle line:84%
But they said, it must have
been on a sliding track.

00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:22.280 align:middle line:84%
That's the only
thing they can say

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:26.762 align:middle line:84%
because there was no movement,
no shoulder movement, nothing.

00:51:26.762 --> 00:51:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And he says, we
can see this thing.

00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:29.510 align:middle line:90%
He said, it just looked like--

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:32.637 align:middle line:84%
there it was, but it looked
like a huge upright gorilla.

00:51:32.637 --> 00:51:33.720 align:middle line:90%
And it's just pacing them.

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:36.980 align:middle line:84%
So we've got Steve in
Broxa Forest saying

00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:38.360 align:middle line:90%
it just rose like a machine.

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:40.250 align:middle line:84%
He gave another
analogy saying its eyes

00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:43.850 align:middle line:84%
were like two ping pong balls in
glass tubes filling with water.

00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:45.410 align:middle line:90%
That's how smooth it was.

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:49.670 align:middle line:84%
So they're over and
above any normal animal

00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:51.290 align:middle line:90%
that we could conceive.

00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:53.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm absolutely certain of this.

00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:57.802 align:middle line:84%
So just before we end this,
just look at the map once again.

00:51:57.802 --> 00:52:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And we've got close to where
the gamekeeper has encountered

00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:01.060 align:middle line:90%
Goathland.

00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:03.410 align:middle line:10%
And we've got the
stories of the Gytrash.

00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:04.910 align:middle line:10%
We've got Howl Moor.

00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:06.200 align:middle line:10%
We've got Wolf Howl.

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.720 align:middle line:10%
There's lots of connotations
to the wolf up there,

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:11.270 align:middle line:10%
and there's a strong
Norse influence.

00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:12.590 align:middle line:10%
And we've got Moor Rigg.

00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:14.960 align:middle line:10%
A rig is an outcrop of stone.

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:17.060 align:middle line:10%
But Moor Rigg,
there's no signposts.

00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:18.260 align:middle line:10%
These are deep in forests.

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:21.420 align:middle line:10%
You'd need a guide to
find you these places.

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:23.060 align:middle line:10%
So there's nothing
that says Moor Rigg.

00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:26.330 align:middle line:10%
But that's very close to
where the guys close to Broxa

00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:27.630 align:middle line:10%
had their experience.

00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:31.700 align:middle line:10%
And I find it fascinating
M-A-W, the Maw,

00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:33.920 align:middle line:10%
because the Moor
is often associated

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:36.380 align:middle line:10%
with Fenrir, the
Viking hound that was

00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:39.530 align:middle line:10%
said to eat Odin in Ragnarok."

00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:44.480 align:middle line:10%
So we've got the huge wolf
influence again even closer

00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:46.490 align:middle line:10%
to where they had
their encounter.

00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:52.310 align:middle line:10%
In between Moor Rigg and
Broxa is Wars Man's head.

00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:53.810 align:middle line:10%
Now, where are we
going with this?

00:52:53.810 --> 00:52:56.270 align:middle line:10%
Norse once again.

00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:58.020 align:middle line:10%
A warg is a wolf.

00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:04.230 align:middle line:10%
So if we replace the S with a
G, it becomes Wolf Man's Head.

00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:07.430 align:middle line:10%
That's my play on words, but
I just find it fascinating.

00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:10.880 align:middle line:10%
We've got Dalby Forest
slap bang in the middle.

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:13.070 align:middle line:10%
And we've not touched on
Dalby throughout the talk,

00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:15.020 align:middle line:10%
and I didn't know
what my time would be,

00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:16.430 align:middle line:10%
if I could even speak about it.

00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:18.050 align:middle line:10%
So we'll just touch
on it briefly.

00:53:18.050 --> 00:53:22.310 align:middle line:10%
Back in the late 1990s
and the early 2,000s,

00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:26.360 align:middle line:10%
the now deceased UFO
investigator Tony Dodd,

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:28.250 align:middle line:10%
who many in the
audience will remember.

00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:31.490 align:middle line:10%
He wrote "Alien Investigator,"
and I did some work with him

00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:33.890 align:middle line:10%
on a lightning that
crashed years ago.

00:53:33.890 --> 00:53:37.040 align:middle line:10%
But he was actively
investigating

00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.790 align:middle line:10%
animal mutilations in the
forest, human mutilations,

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:42.470 align:middle line:10%
and strange creatures.

00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:43.620 align:middle line:10%
Never met the gamekeeper.

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:44.870 align:middle line:10%
We were looking for witnesses.

00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:47.720 align:middle line:10%
So we know that these
people are out there.

00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:53.440 align:middle line:10%
It took that gamekeeper 20 years
to come forward and tell me

00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:54.240 align:middle line:10%
about it.

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.820 align:middle line:10%
And so there'll be more people.

00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:58.310 align:middle line:10%
There's more people having
reports, having experiences.

00:53:58.310 --> 00:54:01.880 align:middle line:10%
There's a who lives in a cottage
in the middle of these forests.

00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:04.130 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to say where,
but he's contacted me.

00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:05.555 align:middle line:10%
He's not seen anything.

00:54:05.555 --> 00:54:07.430 align:middle line:10%
But he says, on three
occasions, in the years

00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:10.290 align:middle line:10%
that he's lived there, I've
been woken up in the night.

00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:12.320 align:middle line:10%
And I go to my
back door, he says,

00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:15.230 align:middle line:10%
and if you told me there was a
pride of lions in the forest,

00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:16.520 align:middle line:10%
I would believe you.

00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:20.330 align:middle line:10%
I'm used to fallow deer, roe
deer, all manner of animals.

00:54:20.330 --> 00:54:21.690 align:middle line:10%
I know the sounds, he says.

00:54:21.690 --> 00:54:22.940 align:middle line:10%
But I don't know what this is.

00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:24.440 align:middle line:10%
He said, I've stood
listening to them, he says.

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:25.690 align:middle line:10%
And there's branches breaking.

00:54:25.690 --> 00:54:26.600 align:middle line:10%
There's roaring.

00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:31.310 align:middle line:10%
This is absolutely deserted in
the middle of nowhere places.

00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:35.300 align:middle line:10%
There we've got Hackness, the
entrance to the Forge Valley.

00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:37.550 align:middle line:10%
In ancient times, it
was called Hacanos,

00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:39.590 align:middle line:10%
which means with the whiskers.

00:54:39.590 --> 00:54:42.710 align:middle line:10%
We've got East Ayton, and we've
talked about Harwood Brierley

00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:45.560 align:middle line:10%
120 years before talking
about the Barghest of East

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:47.180 align:middle line:10%
Ayton, the huge phantom hound.

00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:48.510 align:middle line:10%
It's all there.

00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:51.310 align:middle line:10%
We've got Flixton,
which is "Wolfland,"

00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:55.150 align:middle line:10%
and the village next to Flixton,
Hunmanby, which quite literally

00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:57.460 align:middle line:10%
means Farmstead
of the Hound Man,

00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:00.170 align:middle line:10%
hund man, which is fascinating.

00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:01.503 align:middle line:10%
I think all the clues are there.

00:55:01.503 --> 00:55:02.587 align:middle line:10%
We've just got to look at.

00:55:02.587 --> 00:55:04.930 align:middle line:10%
And then we've got Speeton,
Bempton, and Flamborough,

00:55:04.930 --> 00:55:07.630 align:middle line:10%
my primary areas of research.

00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:09.070 align:middle line:10%
And we've done the full circle.

00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:10.230 align:middle line:90%
And thank you very much.

00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:11.063 align:middle line:90%
Hope you've enjoyed.

00:55:11.063 --> 00:55:12.380 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:13.180 align:middle line:90%


00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:16.530 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:19.000 align:middle line:90%
