00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.570 align:middle line:10%
Hello, everybody.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you
for having me here.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.330 align:middle line:84%
What an amazing event
this is turning out to be.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.510 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really honored
to be here with such

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.150 align:middle line:84%
a series of luminaries sharing
the stage with me up here.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.470 align:middle line:84%
So for today, we're going to
get into something a little bit

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.390 align:middle line:90%
weird, a little bit strange.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be
looking at something

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.590 align:middle line:84%
I've been researching
for many years

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.350 align:middle line:84%
with my co-author Jim Vieira,
who's in America at the moment,

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.520 align:middle line:84%
and looking at the giants
of ancient Britain.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's lots
of myths, there's

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.670 align:middle line:84%
lots of stories, lots of legends
about these giants related

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.010 align:middle line:84%
to megalithic sites,
but there's also

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.650 align:middle line:84%
a lot of connections
with the Bible lands.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And more recently,
I found connections

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.570 align:middle line:84%
between many of the sites
here, which are often

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.710 align:middle line:84%
related to giants, and
sites such as Gobekli Tepe

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.380 align:middle line:84%
and Karahan Tepe in
Southeast Turkey.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.300 align:middle line:84%
So some of this is
brand new research

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm really presenting
here for the first time.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.492 align:middle line:10%
But really, the most
inspirational site area

00:01:17.492 --> 00:01:19.450 align:middle line:10%
on the planet at the
moment, and my good friend

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.075 align:middle line:10%
Andrew Collins will
back me up on this,

00:01:21.075 --> 00:01:25.900 align:middle line:10%
is Gobekli Tepe and Karahan
Tepe in Southeast Turkey,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.480 align:middle line:10%
which is a place we've
visited many times.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.640 align:middle line:84%
We do tours there
every September,

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.270 align:middle line:90%
and May next year as well.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And we are-- there's
just something

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.870 align:middle line:84%
about this place because
of the sheer antiquity,

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.020 align:middle line:84%
but also the sheer
quality of the stonework.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And now, there's connections
with ancient Britain,

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.190 align:middle line:84%
which have completely
blown my mind.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.440 align:middle line:10%
But previously, Jim and I
published this book, "Giants

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.290 align:middle line:10%
On Record" back in 2015.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.440 align:middle line:10%
And we had 250
accounts in the book

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.860 align:middle line:10%
of seven-foot,
18-foot tall skeletons

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.610 align:middle line:10%
in the historical record often
recorded in the Smithsonian's

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.410 align:middle line:10%
own annual reports.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And even there, we
found connections

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.100 align:middle line:84%
with the Bible lands in
some of the discoveries.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.898 align:middle line:84%
This is our famous top 10
giants of North America.

00:02:17.898 --> 00:02:20.190 align:middle line:10%
And you can see, there's me
actually down on the bottom

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.990 align:middle line:10%
left.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.190 align:middle line:90%
Well, my skeleton perhaps.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And it just shows you the
range we're dealing with here.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.150 align:middle line:90%
And many of these--

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the 18-foot one
is a hard one to prove.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.110 align:middle line:84%
We haven't got the
bones to prove that one.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.970 align:middle line:84%
But some of them,
like the Smithsonian,

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.820 align:middle line:84%
have been recording seven
to eight-foot skeletons.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Other academics have recorded
up to 10-foot skeletons

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.160 align:middle line:90%
in North America.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.880 align:middle line:84%
But previously, authors like
L. A. Marzulli, Steve Quayle,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Timothy Alberino, and others,
have found a connection,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.560 align:middle line:84%
they think, to the nepheline
in ancient North America.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.040 align:middle line:84%
One example is this, this
is Chief Joseph who's

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.010 align:middle line:90%
a Nez Perce leader from 1877.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.810 align:middle line:10%
And when he was kind of
arrested by the incomers

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.810 align:middle line:10%
at the time, the Western
coming over from Europe,

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.690 align:middle line:10%
they found this
strange tablet, which

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.190 align:middle line:10%
was said to have
been from ancient--

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.180 align:middle line:10%
the ancient Middle
East basically.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.850 align:middle line:10%
And it was recorded
in 1877 this.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.030 align:middle line:10%
And basically, he said
it had been passed down

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.760 align:middle line:10%
in his family for
many generations.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.080 align:middle line:10%
And they inherited it from
their ancient white ancestors

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.500 align:middle line:10%
who had come amongst those
people very long ago.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.030 align:middle line:84%
It was later discovered
from Dr. Robert Biggs, who's

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.520 align:middle line:84%
a professor of assyriology
at the Oriental

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Institute in Chicago, that
it actually dated to 2042 BC.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.390 align:middle line:84%
So we have some
connection, some kind

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.870 align:middle line:84%
of proof of this ancient
connection with the Bible

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.210 align:middle line:90%
lands in North America.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.160 align:middle line:10%
You also have this
very interesting site

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.220 align:middle line:10%
in West Virginia called
Grave Creek Mound.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.430 align:middle line:10%
And it was here that a
potentially 7 foot 4 inch

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.310 align:middle line:10%
female skeleton and an
8 foot male skeleton

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.830 align:middle line:10%
were found in the 1800s.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.380 align:middle line:10%
And the bones were
extremely large.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.720 align:middle line:10%
Even a local resident
was described

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.720 align:middle line:10%
as fitting the jaw of the
male skeleton over his face.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.649 align:middle line:84%
It was so big, something we find
a lot in our giant research.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.570 align:middle line:84%
But they found what's
called the Grave Creek

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.620 align:middle line:90%
tablet that you can see here.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And it was decoded really as
potentially Phoenician or Punic

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.440 align:middle line:84%
according to various
researchers, which

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.410 align:middle line:84%
is basically, again,
from the Bible lands.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And it connects, I
think, to the Canaanites,

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.040 align:middle line:90%
which we'll get on to later.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.603 align:middle line:84%
So there's more
accounts like this.

00:04:40.603 --> 00:04:42.270 align:middle line:84%
There's more than
this in North America,

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.180 align:middle line:84%
but I wanted just to present
that to you initially.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.090 align:middle line:84%
Because in our book "The Giants
of Stonehenge and Ancient

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Britain," we go
further with this.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.400 align:middle line:84%
We find more connections
to the Bible lands

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.630 align:middle line:84%
and other areas
around the world.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.220 align:middle line:10%
And what I find really
interesting about this

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.990 align:middle line:10%
it seems that Britain, the
giants here-- now often,

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.750 align:middle line:10%
they're described as cannibals
or bumbling oafs and things

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:07.630 align:middle line:10%
like this.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.240 align:middle line:84%
But actually, we
believe they were

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.870 align:middle line:84%
masters of surveying
astronomy and landscape

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.870 align:middle line:84%
knowledge to an
extremely high degree,

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.110 align:middle line:84%
with similar ideas and
technologies coming

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.640 align:middle line:90%
from the Middle East.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Many were remembered as
high kings and rulers

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.750 align:middle line:84%
of the country, often inhabiting
mountain tops, hill forts,

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.110 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And they were held
in high esteem

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.350 align:middle line:84%
by the people here
and possibly by people

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.520 align:middle line:90%
from the rest of the world.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And so we're dealing with here
a real kind of elite status

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.510 align:middle line:90%
class of giants.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is very similar
to the kind of thing

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.410 align:middle line:84%
we find in North
America as well.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.140 align:middle line:10%
And we do know that
all over the country,

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.580 align:middle line:10%
and you can see the map
here and the artwork here

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.030 align:middle line:10%
created by our good friend Dan
Lish, that all over the country

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.900 align:middle line:10%
we're finding this, in England,
Scotland, Ireland, and Wales

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.400 align:middle line:10%
in equal measures.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.890 align:middle line:10%
And we even have skeletons
gone up to 21 feet tall.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.800 align:middle line:10%
But in the newspaper accounts
and the academic journals

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.482 align:middle line:10%
and town account,
histories, ancient texts

00:06:14.482 --> 00:06:16.690 align:middle line:10%
that some of them that we
had to translate from Welsh

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:22.360 align:middle line:10%
and so forth, we found at least
250 accounts of 7 foot to 21

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.300 align:middle line:10%
foot tall skeletons, bones,
skulls, teeth, everything,

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:31.240 align:middle line:10%
in the historical record, often
recorded by doctors, academics,

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.270 align:middle line:10%
and so on.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.360 align:middle line:90%
And these were from--

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.470 align:middle line:84%
there's even like royal
engineering survey data.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And people when they're digging
up foundations of homes,

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.440 align:middle line:84%
they're finding these
giant skeletons.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.690 align:middle line:90%
And yet it's not talked about.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:45.940 align:middle line:90%
It's completely covered up.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.290 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing about it.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:48.790 align:middle line:84%
Now we know there's
a conspiracy,

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.030 align:middle line:84%
a cover up in North America with
the Smithsonian institution.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.470 align:middle line:84%
But here, it seems
to be very similar.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's very hard
to find this data.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Although, we think we've
pulled most of it together

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.130 align:middle line:90%
and put it in the book.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And then we even have a
top 10 giants of Britain

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.620 align:middle line:84%
as well just for
good measure here.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.710 align:middle line:10%
And you'll see that there are
some very famous sites here

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.160 align:middle line:10%
where these giant skeletons
and bones have been unearthed,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.400 align:middle line:10%
like Stonehenge for
instance, Maeshowe, Orkney,

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.340 align:middle line:10%
even St. Michael's
Mount down in Cornwall.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.300 align:middle line:10%
This one is particularly
interesting,

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.880 align:middle line:10%
because this was
recorded and it's

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:27.130 align:middle line:10%
been published in National
Trust handbooks of a eight

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.840 align:middle line:10%
or nine-foot skeleton
being found there.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And so we go into detail in
the book about this obviously.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.860 align:middle line:10%
But even when you look at
the myths and the foundation

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.690 align:middle line:10%
stories of Britain, we have
the earliest inhabitants

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.230 align:middle line:10%
are recorded as being
of the tool persuasion.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:47.260 align:middle line:10%
Some say they were descendants
of Noah's son, Ham,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.130 align:middle line:10%
and they came from Africa or the
Middle East thousands of years

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:50.930 align:middle line:10%
ago.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.230 align:middle line:10%
Others say it was
Noah's son, Japheth,

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.000 align:middle line:10%
who arrived even earlier.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.430 align:middle line:10%
And Noah's lineage is
linked with giants.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.190 align:middle line:10%
And it's worth noting that he
was the great-great-great-great

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:04.720 align:middle line:10%
grandson of Enoch who we'll
talk about later in the lecture.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.430 align:middle line:10%
But Albion was banished from
his homeland in ancient Greece.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.590 align:middle line:10%
He was said to be
a giant himself.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.540 align:middle line:10%
And he was begotten
by the sea-god

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.630 align:middle line:10%
whom the Greeks called
Poseidon, or the Romans Neptune.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:20.470 align:middle line:10%
This was recorded back
in the 17 and 1800s.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And it said that he
established a colony here.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And the giants who were
with him ruled the country

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.340 align:middle line:90%
for many thousands of years.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:32.590 align:middle line:10%
We have another parallel
story of a princess

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.400 align:middle line:10%
called Albina, or Albina,
who also came from Greece.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.690 align:middle line:10%
And she was banished here.

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.210 align:middle line:10%
And there were 33 of
her and her sisters

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:43.270 align:middle line:10%
who basically when they were
in Greece, they become--

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.240 align:middle line:10%
they were forced
to marry 33 princes

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.370 align:middle line:10%
and decided against that
and slit their throats

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:50.980 align:middle line:10%
and then fled.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.640 align:middle line:10%
And they landed in the
country of Britain.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And when they got here, they
basically became very bored.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.580 align:middle line:84%
There was no one
around and they started

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.490 align:middle line:84%
noticing these strange
demonic entities that

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:04.750 align:middle line:90%
were called the Incubi.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, they
started breeding with them

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and they gave birth
to what became

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.590 align:middle line:90%
known as the giants of Britain.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And these giants bred between
themselves, the Albina

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.350 align:middle line:84%
and her sisters bred
with their sons.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:19.720 align:middle line:84%
It all became a bit
incestuous, shall we say.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.412 align:middle line:84%
But it became so much giants
occurring and spreading

00:09:23.412 --> 00:09:25.120 align:middle line:84%
through ancient Britain
that they kind of

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.410 align:middle line:90%
took over the land.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:30.190 align:middle line:84%
They became cannibals and they
started like fighting even

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:31.900 align:middle line:90%
between themselves.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:36.520 align:middle line:10%
Even Merlin himself was
said to have been fathered

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.460 align:middle line:10%
by one of these Incubi
whom he inherited

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.680 align:middle line:10%
is supernatural powers from.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.960 align:middle line:10%
But he also had
prophetic abilities

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.680 align:middle line:10%
and shapeshifting talent.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.290 align:middle line:10%
So he was like a shaman
in his own right.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:49.990 align:middle line:10%
And this is who
these Incubi were

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:52.640 align:middle line:10%
thought to be connected with.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And he also had
his mother who was

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.270 align:middle line:90%
said to have been a sorceress.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.120 align:middle line:84%
So you can see how Merlin
got all his traits.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And we'll come on
to Merlin later

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:06.530 align:middle line:84%
because he's connected also
with the giants of Stonehenge.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.480 align:middle line:10%
These giants who
were born of Albina,

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:14.150 align:middle line:10%
or the earlier giants of
Albion, later kind of eventually

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:17.000 align:middle line:10%
some of them survived
when Brutus, the Trojan

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.720 align:middle line:10%
turned up with his army after
they had fled from Greece

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.300 align:middle line:10%
after the Trojan War.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:27.170 align:middle line:10%
And it said that
Carinus and Brutus

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.080 align:middle line:10%
himself met giants
on the South Coast

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.690 align:middle line:10%
and actually battled
with a giant, Gogmagog,

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:36.230 align:middle line:10%
who him and his clan were
said to be the remaining

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:40.280 align:middle line:10%
giants from Albina's offspring,
or in some other traditions,

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.410 align:middle line:10%
from Albion's offspring.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, the
army defeated the giants

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:47.990 align:middle line:90%
and they captured Gogmagog.

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:50.240 align:middle line:10%
And some stories, they
say they threw him

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.200 align:middle line:10%
off the cliffs of the South
Coast and he died there.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:58.010 align:middle line:10%
And others say he was captured
and taken to London where

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:02.000 align:middle line:10%
now they kind of founded
London called Trinovantum,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.890 align:middle line:10%
or Londinium, and so forth.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:07.220 align:middle line:10%
And eventually, they have
them placed at the Guildhall

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.940 align:middle line:10%
to protect London.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And so it became-- later it
became Gog and Magog rather

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:12.560 align:middle line:90%
than Gogmagog.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.660 align:middle line:10%
And we know that Gogmagog,
or Gog and Magog,

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.060 align:middle line:10%
were actually kind of
referred to in the Bible

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.590 align:middle line:10%
in the whole book of Revelation.

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:20.630 align:middle line:84%
So we have yet more
connections there.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And they've been guarding
that up until the present day.

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And even today, they are
paraded around London

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.210 align:middle line:84%
at the Lord Mayor's
Show every November.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
they're in the Guildhall

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.660 align:middle line:84%
is interesting because a
giant bone, a giant femur

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:37.140 align:middle line:84%
bone, a thigh bone, was on
display there for many years.

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.440 align:middle line:84%
But if we go back
to the traditions

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:44.678 align:middle line:84%
of Merlin and earlier, we
have this story of Stonehenge.

00:11:44.678 --> 00:11:46.970 align:middle line:10%
And this is where it kind of
gets a little bit strange.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.220 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people don't
realize that the earliest

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.710 align:middle line:10%
name of Stonehenge
was the giant's

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.420 align:middle line:10%
dance, or Choreogigantum.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:57.320 align:middle line:10%
And I mentioned this briefly
in the panel the other day.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.202 align:middle line:10%
And this is an image.

00:11:58.202 --> 00:11:59.660 align:middle line:10%
This is actually
the earliest image

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.370 align:middle line:10%
on the left here of Stonehenge.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:04.460 align:middle line:10%
And it has a giant
and King Ambrosius

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.660 align:middle line:10%
and Merlin, who Tony
just pointed out,

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.580 align:middle line:10%
he's kneeling there on the left.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.830 align:middle line:10%
And he actually looks like
he could be a giant himself

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.680 align:middle line:10%
if he was standing upright.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:17.060 align:middle line:10%
And it said that thousands of
years ago, giants of Africa

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.760 align:middle line:10%
brought the stones of
Stonehenge over from there

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.160 align:middle line:10%
to a place called
Killaraus in Ireland,

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.150 align:middle line:10%
where they stood for
thousands of years.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, King
Ambrosius summoned his army

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:31.100 align:middle line:84%
after a great defeat in one of
their battles in the Wiltshire

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.130 align:middle line:84%
area to bring the stones
over and build a monument

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:35.900 align:middle line:90%
to the slain.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And basically, the
15,000 strong army

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.960 align:middle line:84%
went over there with Uther
Pendragon as the leader.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't budge
one stone from Killaraus.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.860 align:middle line:90%
So they had to send for Merlin.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's said that he used magic
and sleight to move the stones.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Other traditions have him
using gears and engines.

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:54.980 align:middle line:84%
So either he was
using levitation magic

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.380 align:middle line:84%
or he was using some
kind of high technology.

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, he moved
all the stones on his own

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:04.430 align:middle line:84%
and reconstructed them in the
landscape of the Salisbury

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:07.060 align:middle line:84%
Plain, where they were known
then as the giant stars.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And this was recorded in the
history of the Kings of Britain

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.410 align:middle line:90%
in the 1100s.

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Now the fact that these stones
came from North Africa always

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:14.720 align:middle line:90%
compelled me.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.160 align:middle line:84%
I always wondered, is there
any kind of proof of this?

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you actually
look in some of the sites

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.160 align:middle line:84%
in Libya, for
instance, near Tripoli,

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.280 align:middle line:84%
we have these remarkably
Stonehenge-like trilithons

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.190 align:middle line:84%
found all over the
landscape there.

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:30.620 align:middle line:10%
Now these-- and they even
have mortise and tenon joints,

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:34.490 align:middle line:10%
like we find in Stonehenge,
where the tops of the stones

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:36.350 align:middle line:10%
have a little nub
on them so they

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:40.000 align:middle line:10%
connect to the stones,
the lintels above them.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.240 align:middle line:84%
We even have some from just
over the border in Tunisia,

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.310 align:middle line:90%
we have these trilithons.

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:48.460 align:middle line:10%
Orthodox archeologists
claim their great presses,

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.530 align:middle line:10%
but actually there's
actually stories

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:52.930 align:middle line:10%
that they go back many
thousands of years.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.120 align:middle line:10%
And there's even evidence
of giants here at a site

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:59.200 align:middle line:10%
called Dougga in Tunisia, where
supposedly giant slaves were

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.910 align:middle line:10%
kept by the Romans at this time.

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:04.450 align:middle line:10%
So we actually have giants
and we have trilithons

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:05.620 align:middle line:10%
in North Africa.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.395 align:middle line:10%
And this is where the stones
of Stonehenge came from.

00:14:08.395 --> 00:14:11.490 align:middle line:90%


00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.610 align:middle line:10%
So this is obviously Stonehenge.

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:16.610 align:middle line:10%
And you can see there
are trilithons here,

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:18.580 align:middle line:10%
just like we find here.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:22.640 align:middle line:10%
Now Stonehenge is the
premier megalithic site

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:23.780 align:middle line:10%
in ancient Britain.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.700 align:middle line:10%
It's by far not the largest.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.150 align:middle line:10%
It's actually quite small
compared to Avebury or Stanton

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:30.480 align:middle line:10%
Drew, and other sites.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.530 align:middle line:10%
But it's unique.

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:34.580 align:middle line:10%
It's the only place here that
really has these trilithons,

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.800 align:middle line:10%
has this style connected.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.450 align:middle line:10%
They have carved
beautiful stones.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:41.210 align:middle line:10%
And as we'll see,
there are connections

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:42.860 align:middle line:10%
in Stonehenge with
the measurements

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.160 align:middle line:10%
and with the way they've shaped
the stones to Egypt, Peru,

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:50.240 align:middle line:10%
and other ancient
cultures around the world.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:56.050 align:middle line:84%
One of these stories about
Stonehenge goes back to 1666.

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:57.670 align:middle line:10%
It was recorded by
a Reverend Robert

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:02.350 align:middle line:10%
Gay who wrote "A Fool's Bolt
Soon Shot at Stonehenge".

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:06.340 align:middle line:10%
And this was a really
interesting and obscure book.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.830 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't really
published until 1725.

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:12.130 align:middle line:10%
And it talked about a race
of giants called the Cangi,

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:15.400 align:middle line:10%
or the Cangi, also known
as the Cangick giants.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.010 align:middle line:10%
And this gentleman
lived in Somerset.

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:20.290 align:middle line:10%
He was an interesting
fellow himself.

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.480 align:middle line:10%
He was-- although
he was a reverend,

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.310 align:middle line:10%
he was also a bit
of an anarchist.

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And he actually set fire
to government buildings

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:31.450 align:middle line:84%
during the Civil War in 1643
and went to prison for it.

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:35.252 align:middle line:84%
So got a little bit of
respect for this guy as well.

00:15:35.252 --> 00:15:37.210 align:middle line:84%
So when he wrote this
book, it kind of came out

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and this was a time
when lots of books

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:43.480 align:middle line:84%
were coming out about Stonehenge
in the late 16, early 1700s.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.390 align:middle line:84%
He actually influenced John
Aubrey and William Stukeley,

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:47.260 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote about
Stonehenge and he

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.990 align:middle line:84%
wrote about these giants who are
said to have built Stonehenge

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:55.990 align:middle line:84%
as like a monument
to a battle that they

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:58.060 align:middle line:90%
won against an invading army.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:00.460 align:middle line:10%
And the stones themselves,
that configuration,

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:04.840 align:middle line:10%
was said to represent like
a circle of dancing giants

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.670 align:middle line:10%
dancing around in this circle.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Hence, the name
the giant's dance.

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:11.290 align:middle line:90%
And so this really intrigued me.

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:16.630 align:middle line:84%
He also found this
connection with the can name.

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:20.200 align:middle line:10%
He believed it was connected,
not only with-- it was recorded

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.940 align:middle line:10%
in local sites, local areas.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
some of the examples

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.770 align:middle line:84%
here, like Bishops Canning, All
Canning, Calne, Canford Magna,

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:28.690 align:middle line:90%
Little Canford, and so forth.

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:30.070 align:middle line:90%
Cannington, et cetera.

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:33.220 align:middle line:84%
But he also believed it was
connected with the Canaanites.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And he even, back then,
he thinks in tradition,

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:38.860 align:middle line:84%
there was this sort
of vague association

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.260 align:middle line:84%
that he recorded in his
book linking it again

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.970 align:middle line:90%
with the Bible lands.

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:45.730 align:middle line:10%
He believed the Canaan
was like-- the C-A-N came

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:48.678 align:middle line:10%
from Cangi, or Cangi,
or the other way around.

00:16:48.678 --> 00:16:50.470 align:middle line:10%
And because he believed
both had traditions

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:53.110 align:middle line:10%
of sacrificing their
victims, descriptions

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.395 align:middle line:10%
of skeletal remains, the
size of the kind of skeletons

00:16:56.395 --> 00:16:58.270 align:middle line:10%
that were being discovered
were very similar.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And they both traditions
had 10 principal commanders

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:02.410 align:middle line:90%
in their army.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.450 align:middle line:84%
So he put it all
together and believed

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:05.890 align:middle line:90%
there was this connection.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:08.140 align:middle line:10%
And I believe he might
be right, as we'll

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.210 align:middle line:10%
see as we go through this talk.

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:13.540 align:middle line:10%
One of the things you might
notice Stonehenge, which

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:17.980 align:middle line:10%
is weirdly recorded by Reverend
Robert Gay back in 1666,

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.380 align:middle line:10%
in Stonehenge, if you
look go inside the stones,

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.230 align:middle line:10%
you see lots of these
almost like striations,

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:25.480 align:middle line:10%
these scoop marks in the stone.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.530 align:middle line:10%
It's almost like the
stone has been softened

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:30.040 align:middle line:10%
and they've used like an
ice cream scoop to shape it.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.610 align:middle line:10%
And you can see that here.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:34.900 align:middle line:10%
You can see it on
various stones here.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.860 align:middle line:10%
You've got this
one here as well.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:40.840 align:middle line:10%
And this is kind of intriguing
because in his book,

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.840 align:middle line:10%
he wrote that the giants,
the Cangick giants actually

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.630 align:middle line:10%
softened the stone,
turned it to powder,

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.000 align:middle line:10%
and reformed it
into any shape they

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.980 align:middle line:10%
wanted to create Stonehenge.

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:52.630 align:middle line:84%
So what he's basically
talking about

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:56.020 align:middle line:84%
is geopolymer, something that
Joseph Davidovitz only came up

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:59.560 align:middle line:84%
with as an idea, a
hypothesis for the pyramids

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:02.930 align:middle line:84%
and other megalithic sites
like 20 or 30 years ago.

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And so he was talking
about this in 1666.

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:07.600 align:middle line:84%
So did they really
soften the stones?

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.970 align:middle line:10%
And you can see like this
strange shaping in the stones

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:11.590 align:middle line:10%
here.

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:13.060 align:middle line:10%
And we find very
similar-- we even

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.460 align:middle line:10%
find a shepherd's crook
carved in one of the stones

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.720 align:middle line:10%
here at Stonehenge.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:20.380 align:middle line:10%
And even like a nub like
you find in Peru and Egypt.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.930 align:middle line:10%
And you can see some of
the comparisons here.

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:25.990 align:middle line:10%
So he kind of really talked
about this in great detail

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:28.450 align:middle line:10%
that it was one of
their special qualities

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:29.560 align:middle line:10%
that these giants had.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.590 align:middle line:10%
And we must remember that even
the Cyclops of ancient Greece

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:35.050 align:middle line:10%
had the same kind of
technology, where they

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:39.130 align:middle line:10%
could soften and manipulate,
and reform stone any way

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:40.490 align:middle line:10%
they wanted.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:43.540 align:middle line:10%
And so there's a new science
has emerged potentially

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.540 align:middle line:10%
claiming that this is how
these stone structures were put

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:48.430 align:middle line:10%
together, and yet
there's traditions

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:51.320 align:middle line:10%
that go back hundreds and
possibly thousands of years.

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:55.030 align:middle line:84%
So this is a technology we don't
really understand just yet.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:57.280 align:middle line:10%
And here on the top,
you can see these

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.200 align:middle line:10%
are the different
kind of shapings

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.700 align:middle line:10%
you find at Stonehenge.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.730 align:middle line:10%
On the bottom left,
you have Machu Picchu.

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:07.840 align:middle line:10%
On the bottom right, you
have Aswan Quarry from Egypt.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.040 align:middle line:10%
And they all look very similar.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Is it the same people
doing it perhaps,

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.630 align:middle line:84%
or is it just a
tradition or a technique

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:19.800 align:middle line:84%
of these ancient master builders
sharing this information?

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.460 align:middle line:10%
Even at Stanton Drew
Stone Circle in Somerset,

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.440 align:middle line:10%
we have triple stone circle.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.540 align:middle line:10%
It's an incredible site.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:31.320 align:middle line:10%
It goes back to
2,700 to 3,000 BC.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.750 align:middle line:10%
And it's thought that
the Cangi in tradition

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:36.570 align:middle line:10%
built this site as well
because the stones here

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:38.160 align:middle line:10%
are like conglomerate.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.737 align:middle line:10%
They're like kind
of Millstone Grit,

00:19:39.737 --> 00:19:41.820 align:middle line:10%
but they're also-- there's
various different types

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:42.620 align:middle line:10%
of stone there.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.880 align:middle line:10%
But actually, it's like
they've been reformed.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.150 align:middle line:10%
You've got Pebbles in them.

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:50.580 align:middle line:10%
And so the tradition, which
is recorded back in the 1600s,

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.090 align:middle line:10%
that they also build this site.

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:54.940 align:middle line:10%
It was one of their
primary sites in the area.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:56.760 align:middle line:10%
Now, this has
interesting geometry

00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:00.450 align:middle line:10%
linking along the edges of the
circles, advanced astronomy,

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.240 align:middle line:10%
and geodesy, linking
it with other sites

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:06.510 align:middle line:10%
across the landscape, as well as
intricate measurement systems,

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:09.840 align:middle line:10%
very similar to what we
find at Stonehenge and even

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.990 align:middle line:10%
at places like Gobekli Tepe.

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:16.320 align:middle line:10%
So this just shows you the
domain really of these Cangick

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.220 align:middle line:10%
giants.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.720 align:middle line:10%
This is like the West Country.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.390 align:middle line:10%
These skulls represent
giant accounts

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:22.890 align:middle line:10%
we've discovered in this area.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:25.740 align:middle line:10%
There's a famous nine-foot
skeleton from Glastonbury.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:29.910 align:middle line:10%
We have some from
Portland down South.

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:33.240 align:middle line:10%
We have others up from
even Weston-super-Mare,

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.520 align:middle line:10%
we have an over nine-foot
giant discovered there,

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.920 align:middle line:10%
as well as a seven-foot
skeleton found

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.520 align:middle line:10%
chained up in the dungeon
in Dunster Castle.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.620 align:middle line:10%
If we go slightly
to the East, we

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.630 align:middle line:10%
have the whole
Stonehenge Wiltshire,

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:49.720 align:middle line:10%
kind of Salisbury area, where
obviously we have Stonehenge.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.000 align:middle line:10%
We have Avebury.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.690 align:middle line:10%
We have the Salisbury Giant,
which we'll talk about shortly.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:59.310 align:middle line:10%
But even here, we find many
accounts of actual skeletons,

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:01.920 align:middle line:10%
even right in the
vicinity of Stonehenge.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:06.990 align:middle line:84%
The first one we came across
in our research was from 1719.

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And it recorded a 9
foot 4 inch skeleton

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:14.070 align:middle line:84%
found in a mound called the
giant's grave in Salisbury,

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:17.460 align:middle line:84%
which is basically the
closest city to Stonehenge.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is really part of the
greater Stonehenge landscape.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.570 align:middle line:90%
And this was recorded.

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:23.580 align:middle line:84%
We found two or three
accounts of this

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:26.530 align:middle line:84%
and it became like a bit
of a sensation at the time.

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:28.650 align:middle line:10%
And so a 9 foot 4
inch skeleton found

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:30.510 align:middle line:10%
in a mound called
the giant's grave is

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:32.290 align:middle line:10%
compelling information.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:33.750 align:middle line:10%
We also found this account.

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:35.670 align:middle line:10%
This goes back to 1508.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.890 align:middle line:10%
And I mentioned this briefly
in the panel as well.

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:41.760 align:middle line:10%
This is recorded and
documented again in 1802,

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.040 align:middle line:10%
but we think it was
1508 we worked it

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.600 align:middle line:10%
out as to when it was found.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:49.680 align:middle line:10%
And this was discovered by
the father and Thomas Elyot

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.390 align:middle line:10%
himself in 1508.

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:53.130 align:middle line:10%
It was also recorded
and witnessed

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:54.705 align:middle line:10%
by William Camden
and John Leland.

00:21:54.705 --> 00:21:56.760 align:middle line:10%
And these were well-known
authors and scholars

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.260 align:middle line:10%
at the time.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.480 align:middle line:10%
Thomas Elyot, he was
an MP for Cambridge.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.440 align:middle line:10%
He was a sir.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.550 align:middle line:10%
He was knighted.

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:04.440 align:middle line:10%
He wrote the first
Latin dictionary.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.270 align:middle line:10%
He was a very smart,
very interesting guy.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:10.470 align:middle line:10%
And when he came out that he'd
witnessed and been involved

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:13.470 align:middle line:10%
in the discovery of a 14
foot 10 inch skeleton,

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:15.360 align:middle line:10%
you can imagine it
caused a sensation.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And you also have
to question, would

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.320 align:middle line:90%
someone of this caliber lie?

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.570 align:middle line:90%
It's highly unlikely.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:25.110 align:middle line:84%
This is what the discovery
we think looked like.

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:27.690 align:middle line:84%
It was found at a place
called Ivychurch Priory, just

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:29.122 align:middle line:90%
South of Salisbury.

00:22:29.122 --> 00:22:30.330 align:middle line:10%
It's all been built over now.

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:31.380 align:middle line:10%
We've checked it out.

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:34.650 align:middle line:10%
But the story states that
they found this strange book

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:37.380 align:middle line:10%
at the foot of this 14
foot 10 inch skeleton.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.090 align:middle line:10%
They also found this lid--

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:41.520 align:middle line:10%
sorry, this metal disk.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.520 align:middle line:10%
It was described as
a lid or a tabletop.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:48.180 align:middle line:10%
It was like this big and it
was made of lead and tin.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.405 align:middle line:84%
And it had these same
strange inscriptions on it

00:22:50.405 --> 00:22:51.780 align:middle line:84%
that none of them
could decipher.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.863 align:middle line:84%
None of these scholars
could decipher at the time.

00:22:53.863 --> 00:22:56.850 align:middle line:84%
I suggest that it was
Canaanite script or Phoenician

00:22:56.850 --> 00:23:00.090 align:middle line:84%
script because it kind of fits
in with all the stories that

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:02.050 align:middle line:90%
are coming out from this area.

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And so this kind of
intrigued me that we

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:07.800 align:middle line:84%
found two really interesting
very big skeletons

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.300 align:middle line:90%
found in the Stonehenge area.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And we started looking
into other traditions.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.340 align:middle line:10%
And I visited the
Salisbury Museum

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:16.770 align:middle line:10%
and found something
quite interesting there.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.210 align:middle line:10%
There was an actual
giant on display.

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:22.950 align:middle line:84%
However, this giant was
made of papier mache.

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:24.570 align:middle line:90%
And it had been paraded--

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:25.890 align:middle line:90%
well, variations of it.

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:27.900 align:middle line:84%
It's been rebuilt
over the years.

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.510 align:middle line:10%
It's 24-foot giant
kind of effigy

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:32.610 align:middle line:10%
this had been part
of this pageant

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:38.970 align:middle line:10%
since the 1400s in Salisbury
paraded around the city

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:41.250 align:middle line:10%
every Saint John
the Baptist Day,

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:44.250 align:middle line:10%
which is two or three days
after the summer solstice.

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And there was all this
secret guild of tailors,

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:51.600 align:middle line:84%
this kind of secret society
was involved in creating this.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.040 align:middle line:84%
All the different
kings and queens

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.960 align:middle line:84%
would come and
witness this giant.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:58.740 align:middle line:84%
He had a giant sword, a mace
head, this strange hobby horse

00:23:58.740 --> 00:23:59.980 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And it would be paraded around
and revered and kind of honored

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:04.330 align:middle line:90%
every year.

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:06.840 align:middle line:84%
He would come out for
special occasions as well.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:10.350 align:middle line:10%
Eventually, he became
known as Saint Christopher.

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:13.305 align:middle line:10%
And this kind of intrigued
us because if any of you

00:24:13.305 --> 00:24:17.310 align:middle line:10%
know Saint Christopher, he
was also known as Reprobus.

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:20.250 align:middle line:10%
He was also a Canaanite
from the Bible lands.

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:21.990 align:middle line:10%
And so this really got us.

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:24.540 align:middle line:10%
He was said to be five
qubits or 7 and 1/2 feet tall

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:25.860 align:middle line:10%
in some accounts.

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.540 align:middle line:10%
Other accounts have him
up to 12 qubits tall,

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.510 align:middle line:10%
which would be 18 feet.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:33.600 align:middle line:10%
He was said-- he was famous for
carrying Jesus on his shoulder

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.840 align:middle line:10%
across a river and he wanted to
leave this Canaanite army-- he

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.240 align:middle line:10%
was one of their kind
of primary warriors--

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.438 align:middle line:10%
and follow Christ basically.

00:24:41.438 --> 00:24:43.980 align:middle line:10%
So he carried Christ across this
river, became famous for it.

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:45.090 align:middle line:10%
He became sainted.

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:47.880 align:middle line:10%
He's now the patron saint of
traveling and exploration,

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.100 align:middle line:10%
so he's one of my heroes.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:54.390 align:middle line:84%
But why is there a
Canaanite giant associated

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:57.450 align:middle line:90%
with this area near Stonehenge?

00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:00.430 align:middle line:84%
It all just starts
fitting together.

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:02.770 align:middle line:10%
The other thing about
Stonehenge as well,

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:05.940 align:middle line:10%
which is one of my
favorite areas of research,

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:08.460 align:middle line:10%
is this geodetic
connection with other sites

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.350 align:middle line:10%
and what this means.

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:13.410 align:middle line:10%
It links up with something
that Robin Heath discovered

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:16.280 align:middle line:10%
called the Lunation Triangle
between Lundy Island, which

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.815 align:middle line:10%
is actually shaped like an
elbow, the Preseli Bluestone

00:25:18.815 --> 00:25:20.940 align:middle line:10%
site where the bluestones
from Stonehenge came from

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:22.060 align:middle line:10%
and Stonehenge itself.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:25.890 align:middle line:10%
It forms a 5, 12, 13
Pythagorean triangle.

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:28.770 align:middle line:10%
And I kind of found
this interesting

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:31.710 align:middle line:10%
because these giants are often
associated with surveying.

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:33.660 align:middle line:10%
They are often
associated with geodesy,

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:36.870 align:middle line:10%
which means the placement of
sites across the landscape.

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:39.390 align:middle line:10%
Often, they're
astronomical sight lines.

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:43.380 align:middle line:10%
Often, it's a measuring
system across huge areas, even

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.310 align:middle line:10%
the whole planet.

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And we keep finding
giant connections each

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:49.183 align:middle line:90%
of these points.

00:25:49.183 --> 00:25:51.600 align:middle line:10%
Preseli, for instance, I'm not
going to read all this out,

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:55.950 align:middle line:10%
but we found two or
three giant skeletons,

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:57.600 align:middle line:10%
bones, and skulls,
and teeth being

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:01.050 align:middle line:10%
discovered in this direct area
where these bluestones came

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:02.730 align:middle line:10%
from.

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:05.330 align:middle line:10%
We also found an 8 foot
and an 8 and 1/2, 8

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:07.940 align:middle line:10%
foot 7 inch skeleton
being found on Lundy

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.850 align:middle line:10%
Island, the other point
on this giant triangle.

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:14.000 align:middle line:10%
And this is interesting
because the bottom line

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.860 align:middle line:10%
of the actual alignment here
passes through Glastonbury

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:20.810 align:middle line:10%
and through Dunster
Castle, both where

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:22.250 align:middle line:10%
giants have been discovered.

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:25.940 align:middle line:10%
Lundy Island itself is a
very interesting place.

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:29.480 align:middle line:10%
And strangely, just
for geodetic purposes,

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:34.970 align:middle line:10%
from Stonehenge to this point on
Lundy Island, it's 123.4 miles.

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:37.322 align:middle line:10%
So 1, 2, 3, 4 miles basically.

00:26:37.322 --> 00:26:38.780 align:middle line:10%
So you've got little
things they're

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:42.200 align:middle line:10%
playing with here to
do with measurements,

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:46.040 align:middle line:10%
which we'll come on to as
being a very important soon.

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.950 align:middle line:10%
Lundy Island was
seen by the Celts

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:50.390 align:middle line:10%
as the Island of the Dead.

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:55.400 align:middle line:10%
Great kings were ferried to
the West to the sacred island

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.680 align:middle line:10%
to be buried.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.920 align:middle line:84%
It's said that it was
always shrouded in mist.

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.810 align:middle line:84%
It was rarely seen
from the mainland

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:04.760 align:middle line:90%
and hidden from the profane.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And it was only known about
by an ancient priestly elite.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.660 align:middle line:10%
Even the Romans
spoke of the island

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:14.510 align:middle line:10%
as having a specially
Holy race of men

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:16.040 align:middle line:10%
who refused trade
and had visions

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.120 align:middle line:10%
of the future resided there.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And so the Romans spoke
about this like druidic elite

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:21.630 align:middle line:90%
that were there.

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And I believe these were the
8 foot and 8.7 foot skeletons,

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:29.130 align:middle line:84%
which were found at
this part of the island.

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:32.390 align:middle line:10%
This is myself when I had
longish hair and Robin Heath.

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:34.355 align:middle line:10%
We were over there in 2007.

00:27:34.355 --> 00:27:37.637 align:middle line:10%
We actually discovered or
found a egg-shaped stone circle

00:27:37.637 --> 00:27:40.220 align:middle line:10%
when we were on the island on a
late hunter's trip over there.

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:41.690 align:middle line:10%
That's on the
bottom right there.

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:42.960 align:middle line:10%
There's the view of it.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:47.210 align:middle line:10%
These are the actual burials
of the skeletons that

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:50.150 align:middle line:10%
were found or reported in 1876.

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:53.270 align:middle line:10%
Funnily enough, they were
from a place called Paradise

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:55.280 align:middle line:10%
on the island and
they were discovered

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.500 align:middle line:10%
by a Mr. Heaven,
which I thought was

00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:00.470 align:middle line:10%
quite an interesting anomaly.

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:02.210 align:middle line:10%
But it was reported
over and over again

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:03.440 align:middle line:10%
and witnessed by many people.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.020 align:middle line:10%
It ended up being
about 25 different news

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:07.190 align:middle line:10%
accounts that we uncovered.

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:09.270 align:middle line:10%
So there's probably many more.

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:11.190 align:middle line:84%
So Lundy Island is
a fascinating place.

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:12.780 align:middle line:90%
It's really a fascinating place.

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And there's more--
there's more to this.

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:18.540 align:middle line:10%
We have these connections,
these geodetic connections

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:19.560 align:middle line:10%
we keep finding.

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.030 align:middle line:10%
This is, again,
Robin Heath who's

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:22.965 align:middle line:10%
like an absolute master,
one of my mentors.

00:28:22.965 --> 00:28:25.590 align:middle line:10%


00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:27.270 align:middle line:10%
So what is going on here?

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:30.105 align:middle line:10%
Why are these giants connected
with this kind of surveying?

00:28:30.105 --> 00:28:31.860 align:middle line:10%
And we'll come onto
that a bit later,

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:35.320 align:middle line:10%
but there's much more to
this than meets the eye.

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.610 align:middle line:10%
So the Cangick giants, they
were flourishing in Somerset.

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:41.460 align:middle line:10%
We know the nine-foot skeleton
was found in Glastonbury

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.410 align:middle line:10%
Abbey in the late 1100s.

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:47.220 align:middle line:10%
We have other accounts
from Sturton Caundell.

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:51.030 align:middle line:10%
We have Wedmore where giant
teeth and skull fragments were

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:54.810 align:middle line:10%
found, and many more, so
where these so-called Cangick

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:56.370 align:middle line:10%
giants were said to reside.

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And this was mainly
up on the Mendip Hills

00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.908 align:middle line:84%
where there's huge
amounts of earthworks,

00:28:59.908 --> 00:29:01.440 align:middle line:90%
like the pretty Earth circles.

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.550 align:middle line:90%
There's mounds up there.

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:07.770 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole tin mining
complex up there as well.

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And they were said
actually, strangely,

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.520 align:middle line:84%
to have originated
from a place called

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Mold in North Wales,
which is where we're

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:19.800 align:middle line:84%
going to head to next because we
find more traditions of giants

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.380 align:middle line:84%
that seem to have
these odd connections

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:23.760 align:middle line:90%
with the biblical giants.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.670 align:middle line:10%
And these are some
of the skulls.

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:30.990 align:middle line:10%
Shows you some of the accounts
that we found in Wales.

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:34.830 align:middle line:10%
But also, there's a story
of the Children of Don.

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:37.110 align:middle line:10%
Now these are really
important people

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:39.390 align:middle line:10%
who are said to come
from this lost land.

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:43.230 align:middle line:10%
Described as immortal,
superhuman, strong, vital,

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:47.320 align:middle line:10%
and wielded magic as normally as
later warriors wielded swords.

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.890 align:middle line:10%
And they were said to have
come from a home kind of lost

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:51.270 align:middle line:10%
in the sea somewhere.

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:52.950 align:middle line:10%
They settled in the
mountains of Wales,

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:55.860 align:middle line:10%
what we know as Gwynedd, which
my good friend Hugh Evans

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.660 align:middle line:10%
has done amazing research on.

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:00.300 align:middle line:10%
And they establish
these citadels

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:04.790 align:middle line:10%
and they were surveying the land
from these particular areas.

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:06.622 align:middle line:84%
So these were like
the gods of Wales,

00:30:06.622 --> 00:30:08.080 align:middle line:84%
and no one really
knows about this.

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I didn't know
about this before I

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:10.708 align:middle line:90%
started researching this.

00:30:10.708 --> 00:30:12.250 align:middle line:84%
This is very similar
to the Tuatha De

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Danann, or the Fomorians
of ancient Ireland.

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:17.740 align:middle line:84%
We also have the
story of Hu Gadarn

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:21.700 align:middle line:84%
as well, who was a very early
culture hero of ancient Wales.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:23.560 align:middle line:90%
Also called Hu the Mighty.

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.320 align:middle line:10%
And he was often
associated with the serpent

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:29.830 align:middle line:10%
power or the alchemical form of
Earth magic and weather magic

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:33.820 align:middle line:10%
even, which is something we find
a lot of these giant graves,

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:36.050 align:middle line:10%
if you disturb them,
great storms occur.

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:38.800 align:middle line:10%
So they're protected
by this weather magic.

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.690 align:middle line:10%
And he was actually
said, strangely,

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:44.630 align:middle line:10%
to come from the Bosphorus
area of Turkey many thousands

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:45.430 align:middle line:10%
of years ago.

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:47.080 align:middle line:10%
He was associated with the plow.

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:52.870 align:middle line:10%
He was associated with fertility
and working with the landscape,

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:55.060 align:middle line:10%
and teaching, and
bringing iron--

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:58.180 align:middle line:10%
sorry, bringing metals and
stone from within the Earth

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:00.680 align:middle line:10%
and constructing
sites, and so forth.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:03.580 align:middle line:84%
So even this culture
hero of ancient Wales

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:06.070 align:middle line:84%
who was kind of linked
with the Children of Don,

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:08.950 align:middle line:84%
but it was actually a
different giant kind of ruler.

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And so it just
gets strange and we

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:14.320 align:middle line:84%
keep finding more and
more of these connections.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.080 align:middle line:10%
And it's just lots
of text, which

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.020 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to read out,
but I kind of explained this.

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:22.730 align:middle line:10%
But it just-- the more
you look into this,

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:25.880 align:middle line:10%
the more you find
these odd connections.

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:28.660 align:middle line:84%
This is just one
of the areas that

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:31.120 align:middle line:84%
was supposed to be inhabited
by the Children of Don.

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.460 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps the most
interesting area

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:35.170 align:middle line:84%
that I'm absolutely
fascinated by

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:37.750 align:middle line:84%
and I know Andrew Collins
is, and Hugh Evans, we've

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:41.440 align:middle line:84%
been up there a few times is
a site called Cadair Idris.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:44.380 align:middle line:10%
This is the sacred
mountain of North Wales

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:46.300 align:middle line:10%
in the location of Snowdonia.

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:50.140 align:middle line:10%
It translates as Idris is
chair, or Idris is seat.

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:55.270 align:middle line:10%
And this Idris character
is very, very interesting.

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:58.420 align:middle line:10%
He's certainly connected
with the Bible lands.

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:02.680 align:middle line:10%
There are traditions from
these kind of modern day druids

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:06.160 align:middle line:10%
back in the 17
and 1800s who talk

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:09.550 align:middle line:10%
about Idris being one of the
Holy astronomers of Britain,

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:10.630 align:middle line:10%
one of three.

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:13.240 align:middle line:10%
And he was so great, was
their knowledge of the stars

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.375 align:middle line:10%
and of their natures
and influences

00:32:15.375 --> 00:32:16.750 align:middle line:10%
that they could
foretell whatever

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:20.180 align:middle line:10%
anyone might wish to know
till the day of judgment.

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.990 align:middle line:84%
So these were master
astronomers observing

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:24.880 align:middle line:84%
from their mountaintop
fortresses.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And Idris was always known
as a giant, a giant ruler.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:31.100 align:middle line:84%
He would toss stones
from his mountain top.

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:34.030 align:middle line:84%
They would land in
triangular configurations

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:34.905 align:middle line:90%
across the landscape.

00:32:34.905 --> 00:32:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually visit
some of these sites now.

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:39.280 align:middle line:84%
There's a site called
[INAUDIBLE] There's other ones.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And stones would
fall out of his shoe,

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:43.810 align:middle line:90%
which were like 20 feet tall.

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And he was basically able to
see all the coasts of the land.

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:51.190 align:middle line:84%
He would be able to see into
the future and the past.

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And Idris himself was this
master astronomer and surveyor.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.320 align:middle line:10%
And so we've actually
created this image here.

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.210 align:middle line:10%
This image actually--
Andrew gave me.

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:02.800 align:middle line:10%
This is from a farm
just at the South

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.750 align:middle line:10%
of Cadair Idris
where they actually

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:08.770 align:middle line:10%
found some giant skeletons
with hazel rods in the burial.

00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:11.530 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
this legendary giant ruler

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:13.720 align:middle line:84%
astronomer, but at the
base of the mountain

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.990 align:middle line:84%
actually find the skeletons
that match the legend.

00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:18.040 align:middle line:90%
This is Llyn Cau.

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.780 align:middle line:84%
This is like the
sacred lake of-- this

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:22.360 align:middle line:84%
is a view from the top and you
can see the coast from here.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.930 align:middle line:10%
And on the left there where
there's a dip in the mountains,

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:29.020 align:middle line:10%
sort of cliff head, cliff
face, is Idris's seat.

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:32.560 align:middle line:10%
This is where the giant would
sit and survey and observe

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.810 align:middle line:10%
his land from.

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:36.850 align:middle line:84%
This is the actual
account of the skeletons

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:39.910 align:middle line:90%
being discovered in the 1600s.

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:42.190 align:middle line:10%
And this hazel rod
thing is interesting

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:44.830 align:middle line:10%
because hazel rods are always
associated with dowsing.

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:46.840 align:middle line:10%
These are the
traditional dowsing tools

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:49.600 align:middle line:10%
of the ancient people of
Britain and in other parts

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.710 align:middle line:10%
of the world.

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Now Idris is-- in
earlier traditions,

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:56.420 align:middle line:90%
he was also known as Enoch.

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.435 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that some of us

00:33:58.435 --> 00:34:00.310 align:middle line:84%
have been researching
for a little while now,

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:02.050 align:middle line:90%
Andrew and Hugh, and myself.

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:05.140 align:middle line:10%
And we've been to
an area down called

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:06.820 align:middle line:10%
Haran, which
Andrew's traveled to

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:08.750 align:middle line:10%
and researched a
lot over the years.

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:12.310 align:middle line:10%
And there's a mound of Idris
or tell Idris down there.

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And Idris himself
was said to have

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:15.699 align:middle line:90%
been the founder of geomancy.

00:34:15.699 --> 00:34:18.130 align:middle line:84%
He was also said to be
connected with Hermes.

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:19.750 align:middle line:84%
He was connected--
he was possibly

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:22.630 align:middle line:84%
the builder of the pyramids
and so on and so forth.

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And he was said
to have come over

00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:28.870 align:middle line:84%
to possibly Britain written
about in the Book of Enoch

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:31.572 align:middle line:90%
because Enoch is Idris.

00:34:31.572 --> 00:34:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's just an
image of him here.

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:36.219 align:middle line:84%
This is a William Blake's
lithograph from 1807.

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:38.219 align:middle line:10%
He was a seventh
in line from Adam.

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:40.530 align:middle line:10%
And it was said to
have been the scribe

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:44.130 align:middle line:10%
of the watchers of
the Book of Enoch

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:48.420 align:middle line:10%
or the Anunnaki of
Sumerian tradition.

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:51.420 align:middle line:10%
And he became kind of
entrusted as their kind

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:54.030 align:middle line:10%
of scribe, their kind of--

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:57.640 align:middle line:10%
almost like kind of following
them around and observing what

00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.440 align:middle line:10%
they were doing.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And he became a kind
of master himself

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:04.470 align:middle line:84%
from being taught by
these angelic beings

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:middle line:90%
in the biblical tradition.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.970 align:middle line:84%
But actually, I believe
these were human beings

00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:12.420 align:middle line:84%
and they may have been involved
in a very early phase at sites

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:13.505 align:middle line:90%
like Gobekli Tepe.

00:35:13.505 --> 00:35:14.880 align:middle line:10%
But there's a few
little passages

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.700 align:middle line:10%
which have always
fascinated me, like this

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:18.900 align:middle line:10%
from the Book of Enoch.

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:20.910 align:middle line:10%
And this is one of the
lost books of the Bible

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:22.535 align:middle line:10%
if you're not aware,
but I think people

00:35:22.535 --> 00:35:25.230 align:middle line:10%
have been talking about this
over the weekend anyway.

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And it claims that--
and I saw in those days

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.930 align:middle line:84%
how long cords were given to
the Angels, or the watchers.

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And they took themselves
wings and flew,

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.590 align:middle line:90%
and went towards the north.

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And I asked an Angel,
saying unto him,

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.310 align:middle line:84%
why have they taken
cords and gone off?

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And he replied, they
have gone to measure.

00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And these measures shall
reveal all the secrets

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:45.240 align:middle line:90%
of the depths of the Earth.

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:50.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, as you go through this
part of the Book of Enoch,

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.790 align:middle line:84%
you find kind of
references going

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:56.170 align:middle line:84%
to these northern latitudes
and like flying there.

00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Now this is kind of
ancient aliens territory

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:00.020 align:middle line:90%
we're getting into now.

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:03.290 align:middle line:10%
But I'll stick with what we
know, the aspects that I'm

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:04.767 align:middle line:10%
fascinated by here.

00:36:04.767 --> 00:36:06.350 align:middle line:84%
We've got things
like the North winds.

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:10.100 align:middle line:84%
It was cold, hail, frost,
snow, dew, and rain, very much

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:13.460 align:middle line:84%
like Blackpool, ancient
Britain, et cetera.

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And I really believe-- and
my good friend Robin Heath

00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:18.530 align:middle line:90%
wrote about this in 1999.

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:20.750 align:middle line:84%
It was also published in
"Uriel's Machine" the year

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:21.650 align:middle line:90%
later--

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:24.920 align:middle line:84%
that they were trying to work
out or calculate because it was

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.680 align:middle line:84%
quite detailed kind
of lengths of the day,

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.690 align:middle line:84%
making observations
from within what

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:32.630 align:middle line:84%
appear to be stone circles from
going through these portals

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:35.000 align:middle line:84%
or windows, which could
be in between the stones

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.170 align:middle line:90%
of Stonehenge.

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:39.650 align:middle line:10%
And they worked out--
he basically worked out

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:43.820 align:middle line:10%
that the latitude could be that
of very close to Stonehenge

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:46.940 align:middle line:10%
or somewhere between
Cornwall and North Wales

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:50.460 align:middle line:10%
really, so anywhere
in that region.

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Now the fact that
this was written

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:56.060 align:middle line:84%
about in this lost book of the
Bible is very, very intriguing.

00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:58.100 align:middle line:10%
This is actually the
analysis that Robin

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:02.120 align:middle line:10%
did from his book, "Sun,
Moon, and Stonehenge."

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.800 align:middle line:10%
And it took a long while
trying to calculate this.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.280 align:middle line:10%
And he came up really with this.

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.610 align:middle line:10%
And also one of the
old books of some

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:12.650 align:middle line:10%
of the old stories
from Wales talk

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:15.830 align:middle line:10%
about in the tales
of Taliesin actually

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:18.110 align:middle line:10%
state-- they actually
talk about Enoch.

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And it reads, I was
instructor to Eli or Enoch.

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And this was written
in the Mabinogion,

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:27.380 align:middle line:84%
going way back several
years and recorded

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:31.100 align:middle line:84%
from earlier oral traditions of
the druids and the Welsh baths.

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And so why is Enoch
even mentioned

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:36.290 align:middle line:84%
in these early
accounts from Wales

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:38.600 align:middle line:84%
if there's not some
connection here?

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:42.200 align:middle line:10%
Even in Carn Enoch, in the
Preseli Bluestone area,

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:47.300 align:middle line:10%
we actually find these calendar
grooves carved in stone.

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:48.500 align:middle line:10%
So what's that doing here?

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.570 align:middle line:10%
Were they marking
this particular spot?

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:52.730 align:middle line:10%
Were they marking
calendrical information

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:54.620 align:middle line:10%
at the spot they were
going to then build

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:59.070 align:middle line:10%
Stonehenge from location-wise?

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:00.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm absolutely
fascinated by this.

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:01.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously,
we go into more

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:02.720 align:middle line:90%
detail in the book about this.

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm just trying to summarize
some of the information here.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:09.030 align:middle line:10%
But even up at Callanish in
the outer Hebrides, there's

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:12.600 align:middle line:10%
a tradition that talks about
that sunrise or midsummer's

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:17.340 align:middle line:10%
day, the shiny one, a person,
walked along the avenue.

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:20.730 align:middle line:84%
He's coming heralded by the call
of the cuckoo, the bird of Tir

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Nan Og, which is a lost land out
somewhere out in the Atlantic,

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:26.160 align:middle line:90%
or the Celtic land of youth.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.770 align:middle line:84%
Another tradition is that a
priest king came to the island,

00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:32.550 align:middle line:84%
bring him with him stones
and men to raise them.

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:34.200 align:middle line:84%
He was attended to
by other priests

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:38.070 align:middle line:84%
and the whole company wore robes
of bird skins and feathers.

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And not only is there kind of
like druid kind of traditions

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:45.310 align:middle line:84%
kind of mentioned here, but also
this bird skin and feathers,

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:48.070 align:middle line:84%
which is something that we find
with the watchers of the Bible

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:48.870 align:middle line:90%
lands.

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:50.490 align:middle line:84%
They're described
not really as having

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:52.680 align:middle line:84%
wings as such, but
more like they're

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.330 align:middle line:90%
wearing feathered robes.

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:56.190 align:middle line:84%
So this absolutely
fascinates me.

00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:58.110 align:middle line:10%
And there's also the
story up in this--

00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:00.150 align:middle line:10%
potentially, he's
talking about Callanish.

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:02.220 align:middle line:10%
Is that the god Apollo
from Greek tradition

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:03.930 align:middle line:10%
was said to have
flown to this region

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:06.120 align:middle line:10%
every 19 years to rejuvenate.

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:09.540 align:middle line:10%
And this is really an analogy
of the 18.6-year cycle

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:13.470 align:middle line:10%
of the moon, where at
these northerly latitudes,

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:16.152 align:middle line:10%
you have the sleeping
beauty that every year--

00:39:16.152 --> 00:39:18.360 align:middle line:10%
it's actually a next year
I think or the year after--

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.810 align:middle line:10%
we can observe the sun
rolling across the landscape.

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:23.970 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't quite
set because it's

00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:27.060 align:middle line:84%
at its most extreme
position during these 18.6

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:28.830 align:middle line:90%
or 19-year cycles.

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And so we have Apollo associated
with this land as well.

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:34.020 align:middle line:84%
We have other suggestions
that this was even

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Hyperborea of the
ancient Greek traditions.

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:39.390 align:middle line:10%
We even have stories
of potentially

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:41.880 align:middle line:10%
in the Book of Enoch,
of the shining ones

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:45.850 align:middle line:10%
visiting Newgrange as well
in Ireland, which is, again,

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:46.870 align:middle line:10%
very, very interesting.

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:49.710 align:middle line:84%
It talks about
these ancient texts,

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:54.030 align:middle line:84%
these ancient Irish animals
talk about a group of sages

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:58.410 align:middle line:84%
who sometime in the
third Millennium BC,

00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:02.920 align:middle line:84%
they were described as the
men of science who were gods

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.040 align:middle line:90%
and the laymen no gods.

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.000 align:middle line:84%
So whatever that
means, we don't know.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.940 align:middle line:90%
But they talk about, strangely--

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:11.580 align:middle line:84%
in the description, they talk
about really bad weather.

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:15.690 align:middle line:84%
They talk about going into this
dark chamber and fire or kind

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:20.070 align:middle line:84%
of flames of light
occurring and it lighting up

00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:21.540 align:middle line:90%
the interior of this chamber.

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:23.430 align:middle line:84%
They also talk about
a crystal floor,

00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:26.370 align:middle line:84%
like a tessellated
crystal floor and walls,

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:28.890 align:middle line:90%
all these described Newgrange.

00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:30.790 align:middle line:84%
So this, again,
really fascinated me.

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:34.470 align:middle line:10%
So were these surveyors,
were these master builders,

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:36.690 align:middle line:10%
these watchers, coming
over from the Bible lands

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:39.600 align:middle line:10%
as part of their
surveying of the world

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.970 align:middle line:10%
possibly after the
Great Flood as part

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:44.960 align:middle line:10%
of a kind of early
tradition of doing this?

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.440 align:middle line:10%
And I believe this
might be the case.

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:51.350 align:middle line:10%
I think there's more to
this than meets the eye.

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:53.390 align:middle line:10%
And for those that have
visiting Newgrange,

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:55.490 align:middle line:10%
you'll know that
the light shines

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:58.730 align:middle line:10%
through the kind of portal
stone, the kind of light box

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:00.950 align:middle line:10%
above the main chamber.

00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:02.630 align:middle line:10%
And we'll see that
that is actually

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:05.060 align:middle line:10%
a similar thing as being
found at Karahan Tepe

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:07.130 align:middle line:10%
on the exact same
time of the year,

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:12.340 align:middle line:10%
but potentially 6,000
or 7,000 years earlier.

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:14.730 align:middle line:10%
So let's jump over to
this part of the world

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:18.300 align:middle line:10%
because we've seen
potential ideas

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:21.810 align:middle line:10%
that these people from the Bible
lands, from the Garden of Eden

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:25.980 align:middle line:10%
area, from Gobekli Tepe even,
the influence may have emerged

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:28.410 align:middle line:10%
or reached ancient Britain.

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:31.200 align:middle line:84%
Gobekli Tepe, we probably
know all about it.

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.930 align:middle line:90%
It's like at least 9600 BC.

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Andrew has written multiple
books and papers on this.

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:40.500 align:middle line:84%
I've been visiting
there since 2013.

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:42.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of obsessed
with the place,

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:45.000 align:middle line:84%
as I am with the other sites
that are now occurring there.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.940 align:middle line:84%
These are so old and
so sophisticated.

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:49.980 align:middle line:84%
It's like another world
when you see this.

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:52.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you visit there,
immediately I just thought,

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.230 align:middle line:90%
this is aliens.

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:56.290 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't cope with it.

00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:58.740 align:middle line:84%
It was too much because
it's so sophisticated.

00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:02.220 align:middle line:84%
It's so advanced for
such an early date.

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And now, they found
all these sites.

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:06.090 align:middle line:10%
So it's not just one site.

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:07.380 align:middle line:10%
It's like a civilization.

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:09.690 align:middle line:10%
What I call a super
civilization that

00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:11.910 align:middle line:10%
links with all these
ancient stories

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:14.035 align:middle line:10%
we've been talking about.

00:42:14.035 --> 00:42:15.660 align:middle line:10%
Only some of these
have been excavated,

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:16.827 align:middle line:10%
but they know they're there.

00:42:16.827 --> 00:42:19.440 align:middle line:10%
They've done scans
of all these sites.

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:24.480 align:middle line:10%
This is an overview of the main
enclosures at Gobekli Tepe.

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:27.600 align:middle line:10%
Enclosure C and D are
the prominent ones here.

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.270 align:middle line:10%
And they're between
60, 75 feet wide.

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:32.170 align:middle line:10%
They're big-- they're
big enclosures.

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:32.970 align:middle line:10%
These are big.

00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:35.735 align:middle line:10%
They're not small stone circles.

00:42:35.735 --> 00:42:37.110 align:middle line:10%
These are bigger
than Stonehenge.

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:38.220 align:middle line:10%
These are huge.

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:41.373 align:middle line:10%
And that's only a
small part of it.

00:42:41.373 --> 00:42:43.290 align:middle line:10%
The rest of it hasn't
even been excavated yet.

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:45.810 align:middle line:10%
So we're talking about what's
been discovered is amazing.

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:48.750 align:middle line:10%
What's yet to be discovered is
going to be world shattering.

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:51.480 align:middle line:10%
And so you can see here some
of the enclosures that are yet

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:53.820 align:middle line:10%
to be uncovered are
even bigger and look

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:59.190 align:middle line:10%
more sophisticated than the
ones that have been excavated.

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:01.950 align:middle line:10%
And so this is an
artist's impression of--

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:03.810 align:middle line:10%
they believe they
may have had roofs.

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:04.830 align:middle line:10%
I don't buy that at all.

00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:07.470 align:middle line:10%
I know Andrew doesn't really
buy that too much either.

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:08.890 align:middle line:10%
Maybe they were added later.

00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:11.550 align:middle line:10%
This is just what they put up
in the museum at the site now.

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:14.070 align:middle line:10%
But this shows you what
was going on there.

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:15.840 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of
half-decent explanation.

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:19.050 align:middle line:84%
We have these giant T
pillars up to 18 feet tall,

00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:21.420 align:middle line:84%
then a circle of
pillars usually 11 or 12

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:23.550 align:middle line:84%
or different numbers
around the perimeter.

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:25.170 align:middle line:84%
They look almost
circular, but they're

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:27.510 align:middle line:84%
kind of oval or elliptical,
but there's actually

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:30.660 align:middle line:84%
interesting geometries
we'll look at in a moment,

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:33.330 align:middle line:84%
proving there may be more
sophisticated than people

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:34.390 align:middle line:90%
realize.

00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:37.670 align:middle line:84%
Enclosure D is being
reconstructed at the museum.

00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:38.910 align:middle line:10%
This is very impressive.

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:40.470 align:middle line:10%
This is one of the
central pillars.

00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:43.500 align:middle line:10%
And they're resting in
this kind of shallow base.

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:45.060 align:middle line:10%
Somehow they were being held up.

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:47.083 align:middle line:10%
That's why people suggest
they had roofs on.

00:43:47.083 --> 00:43:48.000 align:middle line:10%
But we're not so sure.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.260 align:middle line:10%
They could have been
held up by ropes.

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:51.330 align:middle line:10%
They could have been held
up by something else.

00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:53.490 align:middle line:10%
But just to give you--
and you have pillar 43,

00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:55.920 align:middle line:10%
the most famous one on
the bottom right there,

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:58.987 align:middle line:10%
which has got stunning amount
of carvings on it as well.

00:43:58.987 --> 00:44:00.945 align:middle line:10%
And this just gives you--
this is my partner J.

00:44:00.945 --> 00:44:04.260 align:middle line:10%
J. This is the actual-- it's
not actually enclosure J. J.

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:06.982 align:middle line:10%
It's actually enclosure
D. But this shows you

00:44:06.982 --> 00:44:08.940 align:middle line:10%
the scale we're talking
about because you can't

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:11.160 align:middle line:10%
get inside the
enclosure at the site,

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:15.300 align:middle line:10%
but they've created
this interesting kind

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:18.160 align:middle line:10%
of reconstruction at the
museum, which is really cool.

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:20.010 align:middle line:84%
The only thing is
the back stone there,

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:21.968 align:middle line:84%
the one with a hole in
it, is actually slightly

00:44:21.968 --> 00:44:23.490 align:middle line:90%
in the wrong place.

00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:26.130 align:middle line:90%
But this is a huge site.

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:28.560 align:middle line:84%
To me, this is a
very sacred site.

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:31.050 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people claim it's
like a mundane site used

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:33.960 align:middle line:84%
for food storage and boring
things like that, but it's not.

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.720 align:middle line:84%
This is something
special about this site.

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.720 align:middle line:10%
Andrew and Rodney
Hale, Andrew Collins,

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:41.970 align:middle line:10%
went and found that they
had elliptical geometry,

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:44.910 align:middle line:10%
so it probably had
acoustic properties.

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:46.650 align:middle line:10%
But this absolutely
fascinated me

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:49.560 align:middle line:10%
because this is
acoustic experiments

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:52.680 align:middle line:10%
were carried out there and they
found some remarkable things

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:53.800 align:middle line:10%
when they were there.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:58.140 align:middle line:10%
They found that some researchers
from the University of Trieste

00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:02.610 align:middle line:10%
found that enclosure D
between the central pillars

00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:06.230 align:middle line:10%
resonated around 68 to 69
Hertz with a harmonics of 91

00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:07.980 align:middle line:10%
to 138 Hertz.

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:09.870 align:middle line:90%
This is the basic musical fifth.

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And also, they found that the
shallow pit they're resting in

00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:18.390 align:middle line:84%
was to go much like to create
a kind of vibration, or hum,

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:20.730 align:middle line:84%
so they would move
slightly, almost

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:22.530 align:middle line:90%
like tuning forks in the wind.

00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:25.200 align:middle line:84%
When pillar 18, one of the main
central pillars was tapped,

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.030 align:middle line:90%
it sung and sounded hollow.

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:28.920 align:middle line:84%
So they've even
suggested that part

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:31.830 align:middle line:84%
of the lower part of the
interior of one of the T

00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:33.660 align:middle line:90%
pillars might be hollowed out.

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:37.080 align:middle line:84%
No one's ever tested or checked
this because they can't really.

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:39.360 align:middle line:10%
So there's proven
acoustics there.

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is what Andrew and
Rodney were saying all along.

00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:46.390 align:middle line:84%
So this is advanced
almost 12,000 years ago.

00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:48.320 align:middle line:10%
They also found a
spiral magnetic field

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.070 align:middle line:10%
when they were doing
their research there.

00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:52.140 align:middle line:10%
And they recorded this
from all different angles

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:53.780 align:middle line:10%
and it came up on
all their data.

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:55.530 align:middle line:10%
So we're not just
talking about acoustics.

00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:59.460 align:middle line:10%
We're recording about a
magnetic anomaly being recorded

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:03.390 align:middle line:10%
within in between the two
main pillars at enclosure D.

00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:05.070 align:middle line:90%
So this is mind-blowing.

00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:07.230 align:middle line:84%
So this opens up
a whole new thing.

00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:10.140 align:middle line:84%
This is like the work of John
Burke and the Earth energies

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:13.600 align:middle line:84%
research him and his team
have done over the years.

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that it's
now occurring much,

00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:18.090 align:middle line:84%
much earlier than
people realize may

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:21.420 align:middle line:84%
emphasize why the agricultural
revolution took place here

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.840 align:middle line:84%
because they were able to
enhance their seeds by placing

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:26.280 align:middle line:90%
them in these spots.

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:29.090 align:middle line:84%
The same kind of magnetic energy
compared with the acoustics,

00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:30.840 align:middle line:84%
it's going to affect
your brain chemistry.

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:33.210 align:middle line:84%
It's going to affect your
consciousness as well.

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:36.300 align:middle line:10%
So this was like a sacred
site they were doing things

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:38.130 align:middle line:10%
here that people don't realize.

00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:40.920 align:middle line:10%
This is kind of the image that
they came up with about this.

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:43.950 align:middle line:10%
They found similar results,
same magnetic anomalies,

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:47.400 align:middle line:10%
the same acoustics in Newgrange,
they found it in places.

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:48.870 align:middle line:90%
Parts of Stonehenge have it.

00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:50.790 align:middle line:90%
Even Avebury avenues have it.

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:53.490 align:middle line:84%
They found it in Malta
at the hypogeum chambers

00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:55.300 align:middle line:90%
there as well.

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:58.710 align:middle line:10%
And with all these serpents
carved all over the stones,

00:46:58.710 --> 00:47:01.620 align:middle line:10%
were these recordings
of these natural kind

00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:03.870 align:middle line:10%
of energy lines, these
telluric currents that

00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:05.610 align:middle line:10%
cause these
magnetic-- potentially

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:07.530 align:middle line:10%
cause these magnetic anomalies?

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:10.410 align:middle line:10%
Because we find the serpent
symbolism everywhere.

00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:13.780 align:middle line:10%
This is the sign of-- the
symbol of Enki on the left,

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:15.810 align:middle line:10%
which I believe there's--

00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:20.070 align:middle line:10%
now I'm believing that all
the stories of Enki and Enlil

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:23.400 align:middle line:10%
and the Sumerian
traditions of the Anunnaki

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:27.270 align:middle line:10%
do go back to the
time of Gobekli Tepe.

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:29.520 align:middle line:10%
And Karahan Tepe
makes sense now.

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:32.100 align:middle line:10%
In the left, in the middle left
there, we have Gobekli Tepe.

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:36.150 align:middle line:10%
In the middle right we have
Gozo Ggantija in Malta.

00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:37.860 align:middle line:10%
On the far right,
we have Saqqara.

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:41.040 align:middle line:10%
So they're all representing
this serpent going up in stone,

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:43.720 align:middle line:10%
which I believe is a
representation of these Earth

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:44.520 align:middle line:10%
energies.

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:47.730 align:middle line:10%
We also have geometries
that have been discovered,

00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:49.410 align:middle line:10%
like equilateral
triangles linking

00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:52.950 align:middle line:10%
the centers of these sites,
which perfectly align

00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:55.650 align:middle line:10%
with the two green entrances
you can see on the bottom right

00:47:55.650 --> 00:47:56.790 align:middle line:10%
there.

00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:58.680 align:middle line:10%
They're perfectly symmetrical.

00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:00.800 align:middle line:10%
What's interesting
about this is not

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.927 align:middle line:10%
only it suggests these were
all laid out at the same time,

00:48:03.927 --> 00:48:06.260 align:middle line:10%
because archeologists have
say they might be at slightly

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:09.890 align:middle line:10%
different times, it could have
been at least designed and put

00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:11.720 align:middle line:10%
in place at the same time.

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:15.060 align:middle line:84%
But the orientations of it all
really interesting as well.

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And this links back to Andrew's
research on Cygnus in the sky,

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:20.645 align:middle line:90%
back at this kind of era.

00:48:20.645 --> 00:48:23.180 align:middle line:90%


00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:25.040 align:middle line:10%
This was then
analyzed and worked

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:29.060 align:middle line:10%
on by myself and my good
friend Adam Tetlow, who's

00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:32.120 align:middle line:10%
a master ancient meteorologist
from the School of John

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:33.830 align:middle line:10%
Michelle and John Neil.

00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:38.060 align:middle line:10%
And he found out
that if you decode

00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:41.450 align:middle line:10%
the measurements that were
found from that equilateral

00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:42.740 align:middle line:10%
triangle--

00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:46.070 align:middle line:10%
this blew my mind because
this is the first evidence

00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:49.310 align:middle line:10%
of them using Earth measurements
at any site on the planet--

00:48:49.310 --> 00:48:53.270 align:middle line:10%
he found evidence of the
Persian foot, the Sumerian foot,

00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:56.420 align:middle line:10%
the Sumerian palm, and
the royal Egyptian foot,

00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:59.960 align:middle line:10%
all found within the
enclosures at Gobekli Tepe.

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Now we've just
started work on this.

00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to be
published later this year

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:07.130 align:middle line:84%
or early next year in
a small wooden book

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:08.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm writing on this.

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Because if that's
the case, then these

00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:13.040 align:middle line:90%
are based on Earth measurements.

00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And so they must have known
the circumference and shape

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:20.350 align:middle line:84%
and size of the Earth back
at the time of Gobekli Tepe

00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:22.430 align:middle line:90%
to get these measurements from.

00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:24.420 align:middle line:84%
These aren't chance
measurements.

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:27.990 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to be looking
more into this as time goes by.

00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:30.350 align:middle line:10%
But other things, I just
want to just highlight

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:33.320 align:middle line:10%
some of the geometries that
Alexander Thom found in Britain

00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:38.540 align:middle line:10%
because I decided
to look carefully

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:41.870 align:middle line:10%
at the geometries of Gobekli
Tepe and Karahan Tepe

00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:45.168 align:middle line:10%
to see if anything that
Alexander Thom had decoded

00:49:45.168 --> 00:49:46.460 align:middle line:10%
from the British stone circles.

00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:48.920 align:middle line:10%
And they surveyed
like 600 of these

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:52.070 align:middle line:10%
and found pretty much eight
different geometries as well as

00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:57.650 align:middle line:10%
the perfect circle, including
the ellipses, including type A,

00:49:57.650 --> 00:50:01.070 align:middle line:10%
type B flattened circles,
egg-shaped circles

00:50:01.070 --> 00:50:03.840 align:middle line:10%
with elliptical ends,
and so on and so forth.

00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:06.380 align:middle line:10%
And so this is new ish research.

00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:08.160 align:middle line:10%
We're just starting
to put this together.

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:09.618 align:middle line:10%
We're going to keep
working on this

00:50:09.618 --> 00:50:11.450 align:middle line:10%
until we get it
absolutely bang on.

00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:16.580 align:middle line:84%
But we found that enclosure D
is an egg-shaped circle type 1,

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:18.200 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:22.040 align:middle line:10%
If this is correct,
then this is basically

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:25.670 align:middle line:10%
the first evidence of them using
these very specific geometries.

00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:28.190 align:middle line:10%
And does it then suggest they
influenced the slow circle

00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:30.080 align:middle line:10%
builders of ancient Britain?

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:32.690 align:middle line:10%
There are several
egg-shaped circles type 1

00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:34.220 align:middle line:10%
in the British Isles.

00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Now these are constructed
from a 3, 4, 5 triangle, which

00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:39.110 align:middle line:90%
is a Pythagorean triangle.

00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:42.440 align:middle line:10%
So they would certainly
working with geometry.

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.960 align:middle line:84%
The ones we find in England,
and we have some examples here,

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:47.990 align:middle line:84%
the Lundy one we found, for
instance, on Lundy Island

00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:50.240 align:middle line:90%
is this shape.

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:53.160 align:middle line:84%
With Allan Water, which
certainly the Scottish borders.

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:57.260 align:middle line:10%
And we have a Twelve Apostles
Circle and various other ones

00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:00.185 align:middle line:10%
up in Cumbria, up in Scotland,
some not too far from here.

00:51:00.185 --> 00:51:04.700 align:middle line:10%
But these only date back to
3,000 BC at the most, probably.

00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:07.760 align:middle line:10%
But we have one which is
slightly older, a slightly

00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:09.770 align:middle line:10%
closer to Gobekli Tepe.

00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:13.290 align:middle line:10%
And this is Nabta
Playa found in Egypt.

00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:17.420 align:middle line:10%
Now this dates back potentially
to 7,500 to 5,000 BC.

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:20.600 align:middle line:10%
There's a big debate about
the exact dates of this.

00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.670 align:middle line:10%
But this is the same
kind of geometry,

00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:27.160 align:middle line:10%
if we're correct, with
enclosure D, B, and this shape.

00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:29.280 align:middle line:10%
And so what was going on here?

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:32.570 align:middle line:10%
So we're looking at the
design, the construction

00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:35.180 align:middle line:10%
using 3, 4, 5 triangles
and astronomical sight

00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:39.540 align:middle line:10%
lines to create these
particular shapes.

00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:44.270 align:middle line:10%
We have an enclosure C, appears
to be a flattened circle

00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:46.760 align:middle line:10%
modified type B. It's
a bit of a mouthful.

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.710 align:middle line:10%
But this one is the
most compelling to

00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:51.710 align:middle line:10%
me because it fits
really, really well.

00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:53.810 align:middle line:10%
It all precisely aligns
with the inner circle.

00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:55.530 align:middle line:10%
There's an outer
circle there as well,

00:51:55.530 --> 00:51:59.800 align:middle line:10%
which we need to get
more accurate a plan of.

00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:03.250 align:middle line:10%
And you can see a close up here,
just to get a sense of that.

00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:05.110 align:middle line:10%
There were numerous
stone circles

00:52:05.110 --> 00:52:08.200 align:middle line:10%
across the British Isles that
have this type of geometry.

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:11.170 align:middle line:10%
And even the construction lines
go through the centers of the T

00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:13.120 align:middle line:10%
pillars and it
orientate perfectly

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:14.570 align:middle line:10%
with the entrance to it as well.

00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:16.540 align:middle line:10%
So that gives it
good evidence this

00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:20.640 align:middle line:10%
is an actual deliberate design.

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:23.280 align:middle line:10%
Possibly an enclosure A. This
one's a bit more speculative.

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:24.240 align:middle line:10%
This is a hypothesis.

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:27.310 align:middle line:10%
Remember, we're not claiming
this is all fact just yet.

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:28.480 align:middle line:10%
We're still working on this.

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:31.770 align:middle line:10%
We have a flattened circle
type D. This aligns, again,

00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:35.520 align:middle line:10%
perfectly with the
central T pillars.

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:37.170 align:middle line:10%
And this is one of
the eight variations

00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:39.750 align:middle line:10%
that Alexander
Thom came up with.

00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And we have examples
not too far from here,

00:52:42.130 --> 00:52:43.380 align:middle line:90%
Greycroft in Cumbria.

00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Even Newgrange has a very
similar geometry as well.

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:50.370 align:middle line:10%
So are we looking at
these builders going over,

00:52:50.370 --> 00:52:52.830 align:middle line:10%
as the tradition
state, to construct

00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:54.720 align:middle line:10%
these sites in
Britain with Enoch,

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:58.720 align:middle line:10%
the watchers, the shining
ones, and so on and so forth?

00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:01.840 align:middle line:10%
And this is what they kind
of all looked like together.

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:05.415 align:middle line:10%
And so to me, this is very
compelling information.

00:53:05.415 --> 00:53:09.690 align:middle line:10%
I'm a kind of obsessive number
and geometry person who kind

00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:12.390 align:middle line:10%
of always finds these
kind of strange patterns

00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:13.950 align:middle line:10%
which absolutely fascinates me.

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:15.880 align:middle line:10%
But just to put
it in perspective,

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:18.630 align:middle line:10%
we're talking about
such a small amount

00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:20.458 align:middle line:10%
of this has been uncovered.

00:53:20.458 --> 00:53:21.750 align:middle line:90%
What else are we going to find?

00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:22.980 align:middle line:10%
I'm kind of
predicting we're going

00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:24.750 align:middle line:10%
to find more of these
geometries, possibly

00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:28.150 align:middle line:10%
some of the other ones that
Alexander Thom came up with.

00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:31.350 align:middle line:10%
And you can see the scale of
it here in comparison to what

00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:33.300 align:middle line:10%
is yet to be discovered.

00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:36.020 align:middle line:10%


00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:38.300 align:middle line:10%
And then even up
at the Callanish,

00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:41.150 align:middle line:10%
all the different Callanish
circles, there's more than one.

00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:43.565 align:middle line:10%
Many of these show all
these different geometries

00:53:43.565 --> 00:53:45.650 align:middle line:10%
we have looked at Gobekli Tepe.

00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:50.450 align:middle line:10%
And that absolutely fascinates
me that we have that there.

00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:51.410 align:middle line:10%
The Karahan Tepe.

00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:56.270 align:middle line:10%
This is a site that I've been
visiting since 2014 with Andrew

00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:58.190 align:middle line:10%
and with J. J. Since 2018.

00:53:58.190 --> 00:54:01.640 align:middle line:10%
Andrew has been traveling
there since 2004,

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:05.460 align:middle line:10%
so he's been at it for a lot
longer than me in that area.

00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:08.000 align:middle line:10%
But this is an absolutely
fascinating site.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.800 align:middle line:10%
I'm kind of very
interested in this site

00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:13.400 align:middle line:10%
because we've been visiting
there before it was excavated.

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:16.325 align:middle line:84%
It was just like a hill
with these T pillars

00:54:16.325 --> 00:54:17.450 align:middle line:90%
sticking out of the ground.

00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:20.900 align:middle line:10%
We were having lunch
and tea with the kind

00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:22.820 align:middle line:10%
of family for many years.

00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:24.290 align:middle line:10%
It's in the Tektek Mountains.

00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:28.730 align:middle line:10%
It's like 25 miles
Southeast of Gobekli Tepe.

00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:32.030 align:middle line:10%
It's a little bit younger
than Gobekli Tepe,

00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:33.590 align:middle line:10%
just a few years really.

00:54:33.590 --> 00:54:36.150 align:middle line:10%
There's 250 at least
of these T pillars.

00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:38.400 align:middle line:10%
But since then, they've
actually uncovered some of it.

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:42.260 align:middle line:10%
This is a reconstruction someone
has created of it with a roof

00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:44.360 align:middle line:10%
again, which we don't know
if it was there or not.

00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:47.750 align:middle line:10%
But we have this massive
enclosure and this--

00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:49.580 align:middle line:10%
a pit called the
AB pit, which we'll

00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:51.870 align:middle line:10%
look at a moment,
which also had,

00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:53.120 align:middle line:10%
of course, the pillar shrine.

00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:55.100 align:middle line:10%
But interestingly, I
started carefully--

00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:57.410 align:middle line:10%
I thought, well, I'll apply
Alexander Thom's geometries

00:54:57.410 --> 00:54:58.640 align:middle line:10%
to this one as well.

00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:02.990 align:middle line:10%
And it appears to be
an egg-shaped circle

00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:06.890 align:middle line:10%
with semi-elliptical
and type 2, I think.

00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:08.730 align:middle line:10%
Was it type 3?

00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:09.530 align:middle line:10%
Type 3.

00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:11.760 align:middle line:10%
And so what's going on here?

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:14.278 align:middle line:10%
Why are they creating
these specific geometries?

00:55:14.278 --> 00:55:16.070 align:middle line:10%
And so these are some
of the artifacts that

00:55:16.070 --> 00:55:17.780 align:middle line:10%
have being found at the site.

00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:21.030 align:middle line:10%
I made videos about this all
up on my YouTube channel.

00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:22.700 align:middle line:10%
And so if this is
correct, we're going

00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:26.090 align:middle line:10%
to have this analyzed properly,
this is, again, evidence

00:55:26.090 --> 00:55:29.540 align:middle line:10%
of this very sophisticated
level of geometry

00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:32.090 align:middle line:10%
going on at a very
early day, just

00:55:32.090 --> 00:55:34.730 align:middle line:10%
after the end of
the last Ice Age.

00:55:34.730 --> 00:55:36.303 align:middle line:10%
So this absolutely blew my mind.

00:55:36.303 --> 00:55:37.970 align:middle line:10%
But on the top right
there, you can just

00:55:37.970 --> 00:55:40.470 align:middle line:10%
see this pit with all
these little pillars in it.

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:46.310 align:middle line:10%
This is called the AB
pit or the AB enclosure.

00:55:46.310 --> 00:55:49.280 align:middle line:10%
And it's got 10 upright
pillars carved out of bedrock

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:52.220 align:middle line:10%
with this protruding head
and this freestanding pillar,

00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:54.530 align:middle line:10%
looks almost like
half a portal stone.

00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:55.850 align:middle line:90%
And this really intrigued us.

00:55:55.850 --> 00:55:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Myself and J. J. Had a
chance to visit there.

00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:02.150 align:middle line:10%
And we synchronistically
and serendipitously ended up

00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:04.190 align:middle line:10%
going there on the
winter solstice morning.

00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:06.800 align:middle line:10%
We didn't really want to get
up that early, but we did.

00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:08.570 align:middle line:10%
We were forced to
go there because we

00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:10.700 align:middle line:10%
had a rumor they were going to
close down the site so we had

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:12.560 align:middle line:10%
to get there before the
officials got there,

00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:14.060 align:middle line:10%
and we were going
to get in trouble.

00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And we witnessed something
quite remarkable.

00:56:16.580 --> 00:56:19.430 align:middle line:84%
On the left of this, you can
actually see a portal stone

00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:22.650 align:middle line:84%
where a light is coming in and
hitting the side of the face.

00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:25.910 align:middle line:10%
This was taken about 50
minutes after sunrise.

00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:28.610 align:middle line:10%
And so we thought, why is this
blade of light illuminating

00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:31.650 align:middle line:10%
this side of this
protruding stone head?

00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:32.900 align:middle line:10%
And this kind of intrigued us.

00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:35.120 align:middle line:10%
So we set the camera
up and recorded it

00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:37.160 align:middle line:10%
as this light went
through this portal

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:41.600 align:middle line:10%
and lit up the head over
probably a 45-minute period.

00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:45.350 align:middle line:10%
And we realized, we discovered
a winter solstice sunrise

00:56:45.350 --> 00:56:51.270 align:middle line:10%
alignment, illumination of the
stone head at the site itself.

00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:53.840 align:middle line:10%
Now, it completely
blew our minds

00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:56.210 align:middle line:10%
because this is kind of
what it looks like here.

00:56:56.210 --> 00:56:59.660 align:middle line:10%
It will come through
the portal and it

00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:02.390 align:middle line:10%
would illuminate head, only at a
certain height in the sky, only

00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:03.410 align:middle line:10%
at a certain angle.

00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:06.770 align:middle line:10%
Andrew and Rodney Hale, they
analyzed this using stellarium

00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:09.440 align:middle line:10%
and found that it
fits even better when

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:11.720 align:middle line:10%
the site was built in 9,000 BC.

00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:15.650 align:middle line:10%
So this, again, could be
the oldest winter solstice

00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:17.340 align:middle line:10%
alignment recorded
on the planet.

00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:19.160 align:middle line:10%
So we were privileged
to have been there

00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:21.770 align:middle line:10%
at just the right
time to observe this.

00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:24.860 align:middle line:10%
And as the sun rose and
rose over the portal stone,

00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:27.770 align:middle line:10%
it illuminated the top
of the head, like a halo.

00:57:27.770 --> 00:57:29.420 align:middle line:10%
So that really
intrigued us as well

00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:32.270 align:middle line:10%
because was this
like the shining one?

00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:36.320 align:middle line:10%
Was this like illuminating the
head of this great ancient god

00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:37.250 align:middle line:10%
or goddess?

00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:39.460 align:middle line:10%
Because these pillars
look very phallic.

00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:40.710 align:middle line:10%
There's a big suggestion that.

00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:42.380 align:middle line:10%
So we believe, J.
J. And I believe

00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:45.050 align:middle line:10%
this is like a fertility
site with the kind

00:57:45.050 --> 00:57:49.730 align:middle line:10%
of solar male light
beaming through the female,

00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:51.950 align:middle line:10%
into the female womb-like
chamber like you get

00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:54.440 align:middle line:10%
at Newgrange, and
illuminating it

00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:58.200 align:middle line:10%
and kind of giving birth to
this new part of the year, which

00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:00.680 align:middle line:10%
is the winter solstice is
traditionally the new year

00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:03.050 align:middle line:10%
in many ancient cultures,
potentially here

00:58:03.050 --> 00:58:04.980 align:middle line:10%
in Southeast Turkey as well.

00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:08.032 align:middle line:10%
Now I'm kind of jumping
into speculation mode

00:58:08.032 --> 00:58:08.990 align:middle line:10%
just for a moment here.

00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:11.300 align:middle line:10%
Well, probably quite a
lot of this is already.

00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:14.573 align:middle line:10%
But I found it looks
strangely similar, this head,

00:58:14.573 --> 00:58:16.490 align:middle line:10%
and there's some other
artifacts as well, they

00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:19.310 align:middle line:10%
look like these chalk drums
that are found in Britain.

00:58:19.310 --> 00:58:21.050 align:middle line:10%
Why I'm going to go
into this, I'm just

00:58:21.050 --> 00:58:23.600 align:middle line:10%
going to finish the lecture off
with this just for a few more

00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:26.420 align:middle line:10%
minutes, is that
these chalk drums

00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:30.080 align:middle line:10%
which are found up in Yorkshire
and also some down South,

00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:31.820 align:middle line:10%
when you run a
string around them,

00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:34.110 align:middle line:10%
it comes up with a
specific measurement.

00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:34.910 align:middle line:10%
And they call it--

00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:36.620 align:middle line:10%
In British, it's
called the Long Foot.

00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:39.480 align:middle line:10%
But in earlier traditions,
it's called the Persian foot,

00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:41.360 align:middle line:10%
which is 12.7 inches.

00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:45.380 align:middle line:10%
That this is the same foot
that was found at Gobekli Tepe

00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:47.100 align:middle line:10%
we're finding in
ancient Britain.

00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:48.870 align:middle line:10%
And this proves it.

00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:53.170 align:middle line:10%
And so what else we found was,
as we started looking around,

00:58:53.170 --> 00:58:55.243 align:middle line:10%
and this is someone
shared this with me.

00:58:55.243 --> 00:58:56.410 align:middle line:10%
I didn't catch who that was.

00:58:56.410 --> 00:58:59.980 align:middle line:10%
But there's basically phi,
or the golden section,

00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:03.610 align:middle line:10%
the golden ratio, being recorded
in the proportions of the T

00:59:03.610 --> 00:59:06.400 align:middle line:10%
pillars at Gobekli Tepe.

00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:09.230 align:middle line:10%
And we have to question, why
was all this information being

00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:10.030 align:middle line:10%
recorded?

00:59:10.030 --> 00:59:12.820 align:middle line:10%
And why was the site then
completely covered over?

00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:15.100 align:middle line:10%
And we think maybe there
was cataclysms going on

00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:16.030 align:middle line:10%
at this time.

00:59:16.030 --> 00:59:18.370 align:middle line:10%
There were perhaps recording
comet impacts, the Younger

00:59:18.370 --> 00:59:19.240 align:middle line:10%
Dryas.

00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:22.450 align:middle line:10%
We have stories obviously of
the Great Flood going back

00:59:22.450 --> 00:59:24.610 align:middle line:10%
then as well.

00:59:24.610 --> 00:59:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And to me, this just
suggests that there

00:59:28.350 --> 00:59:32.220 align:middle line:84%
was some kind of urgency
about recording and placing

00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:34.830 align:middle line:84%
all this knowledge
in these sites

00:59:34.830 --> 00:59:37.440 align:middle line:90%
as much as they possibly could.

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:39.900 align:middle line:84%
So we have these
beautiful portal stones

00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:43.440 align:middle line:84%
as well we find at Gobekli
Tepe and at Karahan Tepe.

00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:44.562 align:middle line:10%
We saw that already.

00:59:44.562 --> 00:59:46.270 align:middle line:10%
But we also have them
in Britain as well.

00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:48.130 align:middle line:10%
And these are always-- the one
of the left is from Gobekli

00:59:48.130 --> 00:59:49.338 align:middle line:10%
Tepe, but this is Men-an-Tol.

00:59:49.338 --> 00:59:52.200 align:middle line:10%
These are always related to
fertility and regeneration,

00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:53.220 align:middle line:10%
and healing.

00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:56.350 align:middle line:10%
Same with the cup marks we find
at Gobekli and Karahan as well.

00:59:56.350 --> 00:59:57.850 align:middle line:10%
These are found in
Britain as well.

00:59:57.850 --> 01:00:00.690 align:middle line:10%
And so these are often
related to the same thing.

01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:02.610 align:middle line:10%
We even find them on
the top of the pillars.

01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:04.560 align:middle line:10%
We find these knobs
and cup marks,

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:07.020 align:middle line:10%
much like we find
at Gobekli Tepe,

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:11.080 align:middle line:10%
at our favorite site
here, Stonehenge.

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.420 align:middle line:10%
And what's interesting
about Stonehenge

01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:16.810 align:middle line:10%
as well is that there's these
giant wooden post holes that

01:00:16.810 --> 01:00:20.260 align:middle line:10%
contain these 30-foot tall
pine posts, like totem poles,

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:22.450 align:middle line:10%
potentially found a Stonehenge.

01:00:22.450 --> 01:00:25.790 align:middle line:10%
Now the thing is, these
date back to 10,000 years.

01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:28.900 align:middle line:10%
So this could be the time
when Enoch and his watchers

01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:32.080 align:middle line:10%
came over and actually
marked that spot as part

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:35.230 align:middle line:10%
of their geodetic survey
because Stonehenge encodes

01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:39.430 align:middle line:10%
all the same kind of information
we've just looked at at Karahan

01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:41.680 align:middle line:10%
Tepe and Gobekli Tepe.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And there's even evidence
of DNA research coming over.

01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:48.940 align:middle line:10%
This is potentially a few--
a couple of years later,

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:52.000 align:middle line:10%
but it proves there was
these migrations coming over

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.630 align:middle line:10%
from this part of the world.

01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:59.460 align:middle line:10%
And even there are stories of
Enlil, Enki, and so on, Inanna.

01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:02.940 align:middle line:10%
And myself and J. J. Are working
on this very large article

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:05.280 align:middle line:10%
and eventually a
book about all this

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.610 align:middle line:10%
because you will find that
Enlil and Enki are linked

01:01:08.610 --> 01:01:10.800 align:middle line:10%
with these fertility
cults as well that we

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:14.010 align:middle line:10%
find in all these different
parts of the world.

01:01:14.010 --> 01:01:15.870 align:middle line:10%
Obviously, William
Blake as well,

01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:19.860 align:middle line:10%
who I believe, with his
stories about Enoch,

01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:23.370 align:middle line:10%
realized there was something
going on with ancient Britain,

01:01:23.370 --> 01:01:26.070 align:middle line:10%
as well as other
parts of the world.

01:01:26.070 --> 01:01:29.250 align:middle line:10%
Some new research we're working
on with Howard Crowhurst

01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:31.500 align:middle line:10%
is we're finding all
these geodetic connections

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:34.260 align:middle line:10%
between Gobekli Tepe, Karahan
Tepe, and other major sites

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:35.080 align:middle line:10%
around the world.

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:37.260 align:middle line:10%
One example here is Baalbek.

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:40.110 align:middle line:10%
This will be coming
soon, this research.

01:01:40.110 --> 01:01:42.510 align:middle line:10%
Obvious connections with
Easter Island with this type

01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:43.470 align:middle line:10%
of iconography.

01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:45.900 align:middle line:10%
They're also both
naval sites, talking

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:48.540 align:middle line:10%
about pointing their fingers
towards the naval or the belly

01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:49.590 align:middle line:10%
button.

01:01:49.590 --> 01:01:51.060 align:middle line:10%
Also, I noted this.

01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:53.820 align:middle line:10%
If you draw a line
between Gobekli Tepe

01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:56.520 align:middle line:10%
and the Coricancha
in Cuzco, Peru,

01:01:56.520 --> 01:02:00.240 align:middle line:10%
it measures 7,928
miles, which is

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:04.050 align:middle line:10%
the exact equatorial
diameter of the Earth.

01:02:04.050 --> 01:02:07.140 align:middle line:10%
So were they-- and this is
also a naval site as well.

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:09.240 align:middle line:10%
And you have exactly the
same kind of carvings.

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:12.450 align:middle line:10%
On the right hand side of
that image is Gobekli Tepe.

01:02:12.450 --> 01:02:15.780 align:middle line:10%
On the left hand side, you've
got Cutimbo and Sillustani.

01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:18.030 align:middle line:10%
And so we're finding more
and more connections.

01:02:18.030 --> 01:02:20.940 align:middle line:10%
And I hope this has given
you some idea of where

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:23.760 align:middle line:10%
we're going with our research,
but there's more to come.

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.740 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of like
the introduction

01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:27.360 align:middle line:90%
to where we're going with this.

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And we are-- if you'd
like to join us,

01:02:30.370 --> 01:02:33.420 align:middle line:84%
we do go to Turkey twice
a year, May and September.

01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:34.620 align:middle line:90%
You can see that here.

01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And thanks so much
for listening.

01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:37.660 align:middle line:10%
I really appreciate your time.

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:38.460 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:41.640 align:middle line:90%
