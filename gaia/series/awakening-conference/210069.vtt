>>ERICH VON DANIKEN: Well.

[WHISTLING]

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.070 align:middle line:90%
Good evening.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.000 align:middle line:90%
[WHISTLING]

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.192 align:middle line:90%
Good evening, everybody.

00:00:21.192 --> 00:00:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.840 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for the honor.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.810 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, I'm 87 years
old, but the gods love me.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.820 align:middle line:90%
So I'm very happy to be here.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And I have my problems
with some part

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.390 align:middle line:90%
of our scientific community.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.720 align:middle line:10%
Our astronomers are
brilliant personalities,

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.170 align:middle line:10%
but they are still looking
for life in the universe.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.710 align:middle line:84%
They are seeking for molecules
and microscopic forms of life

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.740 align:middle line:90%
in meteorites.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.540 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.830 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.240 align:middle line:84%
But why do they not accept that
extraterrestrials were here

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.550 align:middle line:90%
thousands of years ago?

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.580 align:middle line:90%
They are looking--

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.230 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.630 align:middle line:10%
Because obviously, they
don't have the courage

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.910 align:middle line:10%
to say yes, we've
already seen that.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.750 align:middle line:10%
We have enough indications,
enough proof, clearly,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.970 align:middle line:10%
to make the statement
they were here.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.440 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.350 align:middle line:84%
In my speech today, I will
come to a few personalities

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.770 align:middle line:84%
of the past who were in
contact with extraterrestrials.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow, I have
another speech that I'll

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.350 align:middle line:84%
show you some clear proof
of extraterrestrials

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.640 align:middle line:84%
on this planet Earth, different
old cultures, et cetera.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.940 align:middle line:84%
So life out there,
why do we have

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.180 align:middle line:90%
problems to accept life, life--

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.800 align:middle line:90%
intelligent life out there?

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.570 align:middle line:90%
Because we are too arrogant.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.740 align:middle line:90%
We are too stubborn.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.900 align:middle line:90%
We think we are the greatest.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.640 align:middle line:10%
Only humans, we
are the greatest.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.090 align:middle line:10%
We are the top of evolution
or the crown of creation.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.930 align:middle line:10%
We think there is
nothing out there.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.080 align:middle line:10%
We have a psychological
problem with extraterrestrials.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.960 align:middle line:10%
But of course, they were here.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.720 align:middle line:10%
And we can prove it.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.220 align:middle line:10%
In the past, some of our
humans were taken away

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.140 align:middle line:10%
by extraterrestrials.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.410 align:middle line:10%
These extraterrestrials
took-- come down,

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.930 align:middle line:10%
took some of the young
boys, bring them up

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.070 align:middle line:10%
in their spaceship.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.220 align:middle line:10%
One of these young boys
was young Abraham, the one

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.390 align:middle line:10%
from the Bible.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.320 align:middle line:10%
And Abraham clearly
says, they took me up

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.370 align:middle line:10%
and I saw the round
ball of the Earth.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.430 align:middle line:84%
This is a statement made before
the Great Flood, Stone Age,

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.280 align:middle line:90%
the round face of the Earth.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.790 align:middle line:10%
They bring him up there.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.370 align:middle line:10%
He sees the round Earth.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.920 align:middle line:10%
And they bring him to
a place, and he writes,

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.370 align:middle line:10%
the place where we were,
once, he turned up,

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.950 align:middle line:10%
and then he turned down.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.390 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes, I saw the Earth up,
and then I saw the Earth down.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.420 align:middle line:10%
Then I saw the stars
down and the Earth up.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.440 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.660 align:middle line:10%
When you are in a
spaceship, which

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.070 align:middle line:10%
moves around its own axis, you
get exactly that impression

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.170 align:middle line:10%
that sometimes, the
Earth is up there,

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.050 align:middle line:10%
and sometimes, the
stars are down.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.820 align:middle line:10%
Because this is turning all
the ways around its own axis.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.885 align:middle line:10%
But no one in the Stone Age
time could have known this.

00:03:19.885 --> 00:03:22.480 align:middle line:90%


00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrials visited
definitive our planet.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, was it 5,000,
6,000, or 10,000 years ago,

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.040 align:middle line:90%
or even longer, I have no idea.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.490 align:middle line:84%
But we know that they were
here because our ancestors have

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.030 align:middle line:90%
written about it.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And our ancestors, at
that time, were not

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.530 align:middle line:90%
science fiction writer.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.650 align:middle line:10%
The ones who could
write, wrote the truth,

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.750 align:middle line:10%
the correct, the honest thing.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.200 align:middle line:10%
And they did not tell us
fairy tales, what happened.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.050 align:middle line:10%
And they clearly
say, we were visited

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.670 align:middle line:10%
by these guardians of the
sky or watchman's of the sky.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.060 align:middle line:10%
And in many of the old texts,
they never used the word "God."

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.120 align:middle line:10%
They always say the
highest, not God.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.820 align:middle line:10%
God is something different.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.340 align:middle line:10%
In all Indian, there,
we have gigantic books

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.140 align:middle line:10%
called the Mahabharata.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.260 align:middle line:10%
And one of these gigantic books
is the fifth book, the Udyoga

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.160 align:middle line:10%
Parva.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.490 align:middle line:10%
And there, a young man
with the name of Arjuna

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.070 align:middle line:10%
was taken up by the
extraterrestrials.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.080 align:middle line:10%
They bring him up there.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.380 align:middle line:10%
And he learns the language
of the extraterrestrials.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.650 align:middle line:10%
He's more than 10 years
in this spaceship.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.210 align:middle line:10%
And then he clearly says that
they teach him the language,

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.340 align:middle line:10%
they teach him in astronomy.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.140 align:middle line:10%
And he saw the Earth
beneath of him.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.560 align:middle line:10%
He was in gigantic rooms.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And even, he says these
extraterrestrials,

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.630 align:middle line:84%
he says the
guardians of the sky,

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.420 align:middle line:84%
they had fights
among each other.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Some of these ETs wanted to
make slaves out of us humans.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.040 align:middle line:90%
Other was against it.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.360 align:middle line:84%
Some of these ETs wanted
to steal our raw material

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.560 align:middle line:90%
of the planet Earth.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.910 align:middle line:90%
Others were against it.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.700 align:middle line:84%
Some of it want to infect us
to make us some kind of slave,

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.960 align:middle line:90%
and others were against.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.990 align:middle line:84%
So they had a fight
among each other.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And Arjuna describes that
one day, he realized, there

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.470 align:middle line:90%
were three cities in the sky.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.410 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't use the word
spaceship because he has no--

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.580 align:middle line:90%
has no word spaceship.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.300 align:middle line:90%
Three cities in the skies.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.940 align:middle line:90%
And there was a war in heaven.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And one of the cities
exploded completely.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.550 align:middle line:10%
And from the-- for the
humans of the Earth,

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.380 align:middle line:10%
it looks as if thousands and
thousands of little stars,

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.440 align:middle line:10%
stones, are falling down.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Now this impression is
written in the Mahabharata

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.080 align:middle line:90%
in the fifth book.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.150 align:middle line:84%
A war in heaven, this must
all be fantasy, imagination.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.180 align:middle line:90%
There can't be a war in heaven.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.010 align:middle line:84%
When I was a boy,
they teach me, Erich,

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.890 align:middle line:84%
when you leave correctly,
one day you will die

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.540 align:middle line:90%
and you come to heaven.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you have
not made big sins,

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.320 align:middle line:84%
you will probably
go to paradise.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.110 align:middle line:84%
Paradise is the place
of absolute happiness.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.420 align:middle line:84%
In paradise, you are
reunited with God.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.490 align:middle line:84%
In paradise, there
are the angels.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.970 align:middle line:90%
So it's a place of peace.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.440 align:middle line:84%
But don't you remember, even in
our Christian Jewish tradition,

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.700 align:middle line:84%
there was a fight,
a war in paradise.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember the story
of Arc Angel Lucifer?

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.190 align:middle line:84%
One day, he came to the throne
to the Almighty God, and said,

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.830 align:middle line:90%
we don't serve you anymore.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:42.090 align:middle line:10%
And the Almighty God ask for the
help of the Archangel Michael,

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:48.520 align:middle line:10%
and put Lucifer out of-- and
his disciples out of the place.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.840 align:middle line:90%
So the word "Heaven" is wrong.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.680 align:middle line:84%
We must change the word
"Heaven" into "Space."

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.800 align:middle line:84%
A war in heaven makes
absolutely no sense.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.670 align:middle line:84%
A war in space makes
sense, of course.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Then we have to change simply
a few words of antiquity,

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.330 align:middle line:84%
the antique text
into modern terms.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And the situation
changes completely.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.210 align:middle line:84%
I just made the example,
change heaven into space.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.340 align:middle line:90%
What are angels?

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Peaceful, wonderful
beings with wings.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.970 align:middle line:84%
They have halos
around their heads.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And they are at the
servants of God.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.390 align:middle line:84%
But some of these angels
were terrible killers.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Read the Bible, the
second book of the Kings.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:40.640 align:middle line:84%
One angel killed
185,000 Sumerians--

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.550 align:middle line:90%
Assyrians, just like this.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:44.480 align:middle line:90%
No fight.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.530 align:middle line:90%
No war.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:46.430 align:middle line:90%
No weapons.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Just from heaven, he
killed 185,000 Assyrians.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.790 align:middle line:90%
Hey, what kind of angel that is?

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And funny enough, the
same story we find in

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.460 align:middle line:84%
hieroglyphics, so
from the Egyptian part

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.380 align:middle line:90%
on the temple wall in Edfu.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.730 align:middle line:84%
There, it says,
again, they killed--

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:12.770 align:middle line:84%
the guardians of the sky, they
killed humans just like this.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:16.550 align:middle line:84%
So heaven is probably
space, definitely.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.920 align:middle line:90%
And angels are not angels.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.440 align:middle line:90%
Angels are extraterrestrials.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.580 align:middle line:90%
Cherubins.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.740 align:middle line:84%
All these wars of
antiquity, which

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.840 align:middle line:84%
we adored because they
have a religious meaning.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.460 align:middle line:84%
We simply have to
change the words

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:34.710 align:middle line:84%
into our today's knowledge,
and we change it completely.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.799 align:middle line:84%
As I said, a war in heaven
is practically impossible,

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:41.360 align:middle line:84%
but the war in
space is possible.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:46.880 align:middle line:84%
By the way, even in the Bible
and in the apocryph text,

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:52.250 align:middle line:84%
different humans were
taken into the heavens

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:53.690 align:middle line:90%
and were teached there.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.300 align:middle line:84%
You remember Elijah,
one of the prophets?

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.220 align:middle line:84%
He was the first
who left our planet.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Enoch, the prophet of Enoch,
I'll speak about him later,

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.080 align:middle line:90%
he went into heaven.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Heaven, they teached him, and he
returned from heaven to Earth.

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:14.570 align:middle line:84%
One of the absolute,
most sensational reports

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:19.710 align:middle line:84%
we have in antiquity
is "The Book of Enoch."

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Who is that Enoch?

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Enoch, in the Bible, is
mentioned very shortly,

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.800 align:middle line:90%
just two phrases.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.330 align:middle line:84%
They said, Enoch
was the first one

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:33.070 align:middle line:84%
who disappeared with his
body from this planet Earth.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And Enoch was the seventh
patriarch or the seventh

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:38.770 align:middle line:90%
after Adam.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's all what you
read in the Bible, no more.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.540 align:middle line:84%
But 230 years ago, in the
past, a British Explorer

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.230 align:middle line:90%
came to Ethiopia.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.450 align:middle line:90%
He was looking for God.

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.910 align:middle line:84%
He was seeking
for the truth God.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And he ended in a
convent in Ethiopia.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And this British
explorer stood there

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.930 align:middle line:84%
in the convent for
30 years in Ethiopia.

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:00.450 align:middle line:90%
He learned the Coptic language.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.130 align:middle line:90%
He learned the Coptic writing.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And in the Library
of this convent,

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.400 align:middle line:84%
he found a book with a
title "The Book of Enoch."

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Now he knew the name
Enoch from the Bible,

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.150 align:middle line:90%
but now "The Book of Enoch."

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.720 align:middle line:90%
He could read it.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And to his astonishment, "The
Book of Enoch" was written,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:20.560 align:middle line:84%
handed down in the first
person, in the I form.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:26.400 align:middle line:84%
I did, I saw, I watched,
I moved, et cetera.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Now Enoch tells an incredible
story, what happened to him.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.450 align:middle line:90%
He says, I was 12 years old.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And the whole village
wanted to go to sleep.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Then they saw a light
in the firmament.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And then they saw this
light is coming down.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And then they hear
the terrible noise.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:46.090 align:middle line:90%
And all the villagers run away.

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:46.890 align:middle line:90%
They were afraid.

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Just Enoch, he says, I stand
there, bravely, strong.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:55.170 align:middle line:84%
Then the noise disappeared,
and two strange being

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.880 align:middle line:90%
came close to Enoch.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And Enoch clearly say,
they were not humans.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:03.300 align:middle line:90%
They did not breath like humans.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.300 align:middle line:84%
If they did not breath
like humans, what are they?

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.230 align:middle line:84%
If not humans,
must be non humans.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Enoch now is afraid also, and
he fell down on his ground--

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:19.660 align:middle line:84%
feet, on his knees, with
respect to the two strangers.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.600 align:middle line:84%
One of the stranger
speaks to Enoch

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.310 align:middle line:84%
and says, don't
be afraid, human.

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:24.450 align:middle line:90%
Don't be afraid.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.275 align:middle line:90%
We won't hurt you.

00:11:26.275 --> 00:11:28.650 align:middle line:84%
But the first critic-- the
first question from the critic

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:32.730 align:middle line:84%
comes, why do extraterrestrials
speak the language of Enoch?

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:35.450 align:middle line:90%
How is this possible?

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:38.480 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of years ago, I
repeat myself, they came down.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.780 align:middle line:90%
They beheld themselves.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.720 align:middle line:90%
I like ethnologist too.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.850 align:middle line:84%
They observed a
few of our groups.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.590 align:middle line:90%
They learn the language.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And the language
was never a problem.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Simply remember our
ethnologists today.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.020 align:middle line:84%
They go to the
upper Amazon River

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.850 align:middle line:90%
or somewhere to the upper Nile.

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And they came together with
Stone Age culture, which

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.440 align:middle line:90%
still exists today up there.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.910 align:middle line:90%
It takes a few months.

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And then the
ethnologist of today

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.260 align:middle line:84%
speak the language
of the natives.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.880 align:middle line:84%
The language was
never a problem.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.660 align:middle line:84%
So of course, to me,
it's not a surprise

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.750 align:middle line:84%
if extraterrestrial
ethnologist observe the group,

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:20.770 align:middle line:84%
and the one speaks to Enoch and
say, don't be afraid, human.

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:22.750 align:middle line:90%
We won't hurt you.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:24.820 align:middle line:90%
But Enoch still is afraid.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And then one of the strangest
say to Enoch, human,

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:32.360 align:middle line:90%
you smell terribly.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.860 align:middle line:90%
You stink.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:38.120 align:middle line:84%
So-- and then they ask Enoch
to put all his clothes off

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:38.990 align:middle line:90%
completely.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:42.470 align:middle line:84%
He stands there, the
12-year-old boy, naked.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And then they put
him into the water.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:49.070 align:middle line:84%
He said-- they say, you go
and wash your body completely,

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:52.290 align:middle line:90%
including your hair, everything.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And when he comes out of the
water, one of the stranger

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:57.350 align:middle line:90%
gives him clothes.

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:59.000 align:middle line:90%
They put his clothes on.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And Enoch doesn't know
how he must do that.

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:03.350 align:middle line:90%
But the stranger explains him.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:04.760 align:middle line:90%
He put the clothes on.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:09.560 align:middle line:10%
And then he looks and says,
now I looked exactly like them.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.380 align:middle line:10%
He has the same
clothes as they had.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:14.330 align:middle line:10%
Because in his
stinking human clothes,

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.070 align:middle line:10%
he could not go to
a mother spaceship

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.960 align:middle line:10%
or to a space
shuttle, et cetera.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.170 align:middle line:10%
So he has the clothes on
of the extraterrestrials.

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:23.300 align:middle line:90%
Then they bring him up.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:27.050 align:middle line:84%
They bring him up
slowly over the Earth.

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:31.280 align:middle line:84%
In "The Book of Enoch" again,
the word "God" is not used.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.500 align:middle line:84%
I know English and
German translations

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.150 align:middle line:90%
where they always says God.

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:37.760 align:middle line:84%
In the original,
God is never used.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:42.410 align:middle line:84%
They always speak about the
highest or the stranger,

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:43.580 align:middle line:90%
but not God.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.990 align:middle line:90%
The translations are wrong.

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:47.300 align:middle line:90%
Why are the translations wrong?

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Because our ancestors
had no other ideas.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:50.780 align:middle line:90%
They had no possibility.

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.660 align:middle line:84%
They believed it must
be God, and Enoch

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.490 align:middle line:90%
was taken into the heavens.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:57.140 align:middle line:84%
He was not taken
into the heavens,

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.410 align:middle line:84%
he was taken into
the-- into space.

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Up there, he sees
gigantic buildings.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.190 align:middle line:90%
He used the word "Buildings."

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:06.920 align:middle line:90%
He has no word for spaceship.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.140 align:middle line:84%
They came close
to it, doors open

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.360 align:middle line:90%
and doors close automatically.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Enoch passes different gardens
with vegetables, and fruits,

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.760 align:middle line:84%
and colors which he had
never seen on Earth.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And then he came
into a big hole.

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:24.170 align:middle line:84%
In the center of
hole, was a throne.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:25.490 align:middle line:90%
A throne is chair.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:29.390 align:middle line:84%
On the throne was sitting
the highest majesty.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Now these three, two
stranger and Enoch,

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:35.990 align:middle line:84%
came in to close to the
throne, and the highest

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:40.700 align:middle line:84%
stands up from the throne,
makes a few step to Enoch,

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:45.180 align:middle line:90%
and welcomes him at the place.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:49.080 align:middle line:84%
Now all what I
just told is really

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.760 align:middle line:90%
part of "The Book of Enoch."

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Now "The Book of Enoch" is
part of the apocryphic text.

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:56.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't know an English
version, but in Germany, it

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.000 align:middle line:90%
looks like this.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So if you have to look for "The
Book of Enoch" in the original,

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:06.100 align:middle line:84%
don't look for one of
these modern books.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.530 align:middle line:84%
They are not telling
the real story.

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:12.340 align:middle line:84%
The original Enoch from
Ethiopia's old library

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:13.420 align:middle line:90%
is in here.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Even in English, you have
copies of the apocryphic text.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And there, you can find
the complete book of Enoch.

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:24.270 align:middle line:10%
And of course, our
ancestor who translated

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:26.550 align:middle line:10%
Enoch more than
250 years ago, they

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.370 align:middle line:10%
were brilliant translators,
brilliant professors,

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:31.950 align:middle line:10%
brilliant scientists.

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:34.620 align:middle line:10%
It was never a question
of conspiracy or something

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.430 align:middle line:10%
like this, but they had
no other way to translate.

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:41.700 align:middle line:10%
At that time, something like
space travel did not exist.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.860 align:middle line:84%
Something like flying
machines did not exist.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.590 align:middle line:90%
Now they have an old text here.

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And somebody was
taken up into the sky.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.930 align:middle line:84%
So in their meaning, he
must have gone into heavens.

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And the ones who came down
must have been angels.

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:03.660 align:middle line:84%
So the translations were wrong,
not because of conspiracy,

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:08.160 align:middle line:84%
simply because of the time, the
spirit of time was not ripe.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.860 align:middle line:84%
They could not translate
it in another way.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:13.680 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, the
spirit of time has changed,

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.920 align:middle line:84%
and we are able to translate
"The Book of Enoch"

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.260 align:middle line:90%
in modern way.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:23.730 align:middle line:84%
The teachers up there teach
Enoch in their language.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:26.580 align:middle line:84%
He finally speaks
their language.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:30.700 align:middle line:84%
They teach him in
astronomy, in every detail.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.850 align:middle line:90%
They teach him in engineering.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:35.340 align:middle line:84%
In astronomy, one
of the strangers

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:39.510 align:middle line:84%
says to young Enoch,
human, look out there.

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Do you see this little
light out there?

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.580 align:middle line:10%
You humans call it the moon.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.920 align:middle line:10%
But the moon has
no light by itself,

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.020 align:middle line:10%
the moon receives his
light from the sun.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.420 align:middle line:10%
And then he explains to Enoch
why the moon, sometimes,

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:54.810 align:middle line:10%
is full, and half, and
half empty, et cetera.

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:57.810 align:middle line:90%
This is scientific knowledge.

00:16:57.810 --> 00:16:59.580 align:middle line:90%
This is not fantasy.

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.850 align:middle line:84%
We are still speaking
about Stone Age people.

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:04.829 align:middle line:84%
They could not
known, the Stone Age

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:08.280 align:middle line:84%
people, that the moon receives
his light from the sun.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.800 align:middle line:84%
They were thinking the
moon has his own light.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.900 align:middle line:84%
No, this was
scientific teaching.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And this-- only
with this phrase,

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:19.290 align:middle line:84%
you can prove that it must
have been extraterrestrials.

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:22.849 align:middle line:90%
Remember, look out there, human.

00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:25.220 align:middle line:90%
Do you see this little light?

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:28.730 align:middle line:90%
You, humans, you call it moon.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.490 align:middle line:84%
But the moon has
no light by itself.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.800 align:middle line:84%
The moon receives its
light from the sun.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And then he explains him
how the changing of the moon

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.360 align:middle line:90%
takes place.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.540 align:middle line:84%
All of this is in
"The Book of Enoch."

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Enoch is the only one
who gives even the

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.120 align:middle line:90%
names of the extraterrestrials.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.860 align:middle line:90%
And these are the names.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:55.270 align:middle line:84%
So I ask my skeptics and my
critics, what do you want more?

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Enoch keeps the names
of their teachers.

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, he
realizes that these strangers,

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:05.750 align:middle line:84%
they want to have
sex with humans.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:08.230 align:middle line:84%
But sex with humans,
with the beautiful,

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:09.970 align:middle line:90%
is this not ridiculous?

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:11.890 align:middle line:90%
Extraterrestrials have sex?

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:15.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, the same story
you find in the Bible.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.380 align:middle line:90%
Just read the Bible here.

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And he says, when the sons of
heaven saw the daughters of men

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.410 align:middle line:84%
were beauty, they
took them to wife.

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:28.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not Erich Von
Daniken's imagination,

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:31.010 align:middle line:84%
it's not the coming
out of my brain

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:35.300 align:middle line:84%
that they had sex with
humans, it's part of the Bible

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:38.000 align:middle line:84%
and part of "The Book
of Enoch," and part

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.820 align:middle line:84%
of the Ethiopian Holy
book, the so-called Kebra

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Nagast, the oldest book
of the Ethiopian kings.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:45.470 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:50.270 align:middle line:84%
So they had sex with
humans, even in the Bible.

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Now in the present language,
I say, they teach him writing,

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:57.070 align:middle line:90%
they teach him every detail.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:19:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And then after all, he comes
back to the planet Earth,

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.120 align:middle line:84%
and he describes,
and he writes what

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:09.540 align:middle line:84%
his experience was with the ETs,
with the guardians of the sky.

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.870 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have
"The Book of Enoch."

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, he,
himself, not me,

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:16.250 align:middle line:84%
he writes in "The
Book of Enoch,"

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:18.200 align:middle line:84%
the one from Ethiopia,
which we have,

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.950 align:middle line:90%
that he has written 200 books.

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Where are the 200
books of Enoch?

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:26.660 align:middle line:84%
We only have the
one from Ethiopia.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.820 align:middle line:90%
Where are the others?

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Before Enoch disappears with
the guardians of the sky,

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:37.610 align:middle line:84%
he gives his 200 books
to his son, Methuselah,

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:38.570 align:middle line:90%
with the other.

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's written in
"The Book of Enoch."

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:44.540 align:middle line:10%
And now, my son, Methuselah,
I give you all these books,

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:47.090 align:middle line:10%
written by your father's hand.

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:52.790 align:middle line:10%
Keep them carefully for
generations of the far future.

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:55.940 align:middle line:10%
What are the books of Enoch?

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.850 align:middle line:10%
Methuselah, this is
written down again,

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:03.290 align:middle line:10%
he was the one who constructed
with the knowledge of Enoch,

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:05.060 align:middle line:10%
the Great Pyramid.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.450 align:middle line:10%
And he said, we did this
because in there, we

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:12.950 align:middle line:10%
deposited all the books
of my father, Enoch,

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:16.370 align:middle line:10%
including some
objects, some gifts

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:18.750 align:middle line:10%
of the guardians of the sky.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:23.390 align:middle line:84%
So still today, the books
of Enoch, 200 books,

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:27.320 align:middle line:84%
are in the Great
Pyramid, including object

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.240 align:middle line:90%
of the extraterrestrials.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.270 align:middle line:90%
The spirit of time, we changed.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And sooner or later, they will
accept that in the pyramid,

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.660 align:middle line:84%
there are not only rooms,
but in the pyramid,

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:44.990 align:middle line:84%
there are objects and writings
of the extraterrestrials.

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:50.230 align:middle line:10%
So Enoch is complicated
to find for you,

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.780 align:middle line:10%
except if you go to
a library and look

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.400 align:middle line:10%
for the appropriate text.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.820 align:middle line:10%
Another figure, which is
easy to control for you,

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.390 align:middle line:10%
is very known to every
one of us, is Ezekiel.

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Everyone can come--
can read the Bible.

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.680 align:middle line:90%
Ezekiel.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel, by the
way, by profession,

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:11.590 align:middle line:84%
he was a high priest at
the Temple of Jerusalem.

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And at his time, Jerusalem was
taken over by the Babylonians.

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And all the high society
of the Israelites

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.900 align:middle line:90%
was captured by the Babylonians.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.490 align:middle line:90%
Ezekiel was high priest.

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:28.240 align:middle line:90%
He belonged to the high society.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.390 align:middle line:90%
So he was captured too.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:32.830 align:middle line:90%
And he's captured, and he's--

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:37.050 align:middle line:84%
they work together, probably
a few hundred persons,

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:39.150 align:middle line:84%
near a river with
the name of Chebar.

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's when Ezekiel
starts and says,

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:46.230 align:middle line:84%
I was captured near
the river of Chebar

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:48.750 align:middle line:90%
when the heavens were opened.

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, like Enoch
before, read Ezekiel.

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel writes in
the first person.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:22:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Not somebody told me or I hear
in the third person, I did.

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:02.370 align:middle line:90%
He stands there.

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And he clearly describes that
they saw a light in the sky.

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And the light came down,
and the light was brighter.

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And then they hear the
noise, a terrible noise.

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:15.900 align:middle line:84%
He compares the noise with
the thundering of a waterfall,

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:18.540 align:middle line:84%
with the noise of
an army, et cetera.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Must have been very
terrible noise.

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And finally, this vehicle come
down, comes to a standstill.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.230 align:middle line:84%
Now again, Ezekiel
is high priest.

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:32.010 align:middle line:84%
He believes that this is
God, the true almighty God.

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:35.290 align:middle line:84%
So first, he fell on his
ground, on his knees,

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:38.730 align:middle line:84%
and then he stands up to give
honor to the Almighty God.

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And then he realized
that this is not God.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.710 align:middle line:90%
It's something different.

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And Ezekiel describes in
every detail the vehicle

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.000 align:middle line:90%
which stands behind him.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.240 align:middle line:90%
Read it in the Bible.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.480 align:middle line:84%
He describes the wings who
made the terrible noise.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.010 align:middle line:90%
He describes the legs.

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:58.340 align:middle line:84%
He clearly said the
legs were out of metal.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:02.450 align:middle line:10%
I took a few pictures
out of an old Bible,

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:03.710 align:middle line:10%
more than 200 years old.

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Just five pictures to give
you an imagination what

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:10.430 align:middle line:84%
our forefathers had in mind
when they read Ezekiel.

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Then I will show
you and tell you

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.110 align:middle line:84%
the modern explanation,
the modern reconstruction

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:16.700 align:middle line:90%
of everything.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:19.820 align:middle line:84%
So again, Ezekiel
sees this vehicle.

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.290 align:middle line:90%
He says upright.

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:23.990 align:middle line:84%
There was something like
a glittering, a lightning.

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And in the center
of it was a throne.

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:28.070 align:middle line:90%
A throne is a seat.

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And on this throne
was someone sitting,

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:34.400 align:middle line:84%
looking like a human
in glittering clothes.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.250 align:middle line:90%
Looking like a human?

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.290 align:middle line:90%
Are extraterrestrials like us?

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:40.610 align:middle line:90%
Do they look like we?

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:43.940 align:middle line:84%
Should extraterrestrial not
be completely different to us,

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:47.000 align:middle line:84%
growing up from another
planet in different forms?

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes and no.

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:53.270 align:middle line:84%
We have no idea
how it all started.

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:56.570 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how
and why and where

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:58.940 align:middle line:84%
the first intelligent
form of life started.

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:02.060 align:middle line:84%
We simply have the
fact, it is the case.

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:03.990 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, it wouldn't be here.

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:05.720 align:middle line:90%
It started somehow.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.730 align:middle line:84%
The first intelligent
form of life

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:12.530 align:middle line:84%
had an interest to spread
out their own form of life.

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:13.580 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Part of intelligence
is curiosity.

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.170 align:middle line:84%
If you are not curious,
you are not intelligent.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.630 align:middle line:84%
That's automatically
part of intelligence.

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:24.530 align:middle line:84%
So they wanted to find
out, are we alone?

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:25.940 align:middle line:90%
Are there others?

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.480 align:middle line:90%
Are there other forms of life?

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:31.100 align:middle line:84%
So they want to spread
out the universe.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.500 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, you
don't use spaceships.

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.760 align:middle line:90%
That's much too complicated.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.130 align:middle line:10%
They learn that the
distances between the stars

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:39.500 align:middle line:10%
are much, much too
high, measured in light.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.270 align:middle line:10%
So it makes no sense.

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:44.060 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning,
they simply infect

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:48.750 align:middle line:84%
a part of their Milky
Way with their own DNA.

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Just rub on your
fingers, now you

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.500 align:middle line:84%
have millions of
cells on the way.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.720 align:middle line:84%
In every cell,
you have your DNA.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And DNA is resistant
against heat, against cold,

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.060 align:middle line:90%
against everything.

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:03.630 align:middle line:84%
So if you send billions and
billions of your own DNA

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:06.720 align:middle line:84%
out into the universe, you
know exactly the biggest

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:10.620 align:middle line:84%
part of this DNA will come into
the gravity of the sun, will

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:13.440 align:middle line:90%
burn, destroyed.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.590 align:middle line:10%
Another part of it will come to
the gravity of planets, which

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:17.910 align:middle line:10%
are completely wrong for it.

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:19.740 align:middle line:10%
For example, in
our solar system,

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.420 align:middle line:10%
we have a planet like Mercury.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:22.980 align:middle line:90%
Mercury is too hot.

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:26.070 align:middle line:84%
If DNA comes into
mercury, it burns out.

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:27.630 align:middle line:90%
Or a planet like Jupiter.

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:28.500 align:middle line:90%
It's too big.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Its gravity would
kill it immediately,

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.890 align:middle line:84%
and atmospheric conditions,
methane, ammonia, et cetera.

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:36.160 align:middle line:90%
So it's nothing.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:40.710 align:middle line:84%
So part of the DNA will
land on planets which are

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:43.590 align:middle line:90%
similar than our planet Earth.

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:47.100 align:middle line:84%
Are there planets which
are similar than ours?

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Until about 10 years ago,
humans believed in science.

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Science believed that Earth
is unique in the universe.

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:55.890 align:middle line:84%
We have the right
distance to the sun.

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:58.080 align:middle line:84%
It's not too hot, it's
not too cold, et cetera.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.610 align:middle line:90%
And we have water.

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:02.610 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, NASA
has declared that

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:05.880 align:middle line:84%
only in our Milky Way,
not in the whole universe,

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:10.200 align:middle line:84%
just in our Milky Way, there
are at least four billions

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.780 align:middle line:90%
of Earth-like planets.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.360 align:middle line:84%
So some of the DNA,
which they spread out,

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.670 align:middle line:90%
would reach Earth-like planets.

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:20.670 align:middle line:90%
And now evolution starts.

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And evolution has, as I
said, unchangeable form.

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Evolution can bring out,
as we have it on Earth,

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:33.450 align:middle line:84%
millions of forms of
life, beetles, crocodiles.

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:37.770 align:middle line:10%
But unchangeable forms means,
when you become intelligent,

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:39.870 align:middle line:10%
you have to have hands.

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:42.450 align:middle line:90%
For example, you have two eyes.

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And the two eyes
always look in front.

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:45.810 align:middle line:90%
Two eyes.

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:48.450 align:middle line:84%
We not have one eye, it
doesn't matter, or three.

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:50.470 align:middle line:84%
It does not help
you in the back.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:51.990 align:middle line:90%
You have to see what you catch.

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:53.940 align:middle line:90%
Or you have arms and fingers.

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:56.400 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if
you have one or five,

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.750 align:middle line:90%
they are always in front of you.

00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:59.250 align:middle line:90%
You have to see what you catch.

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:01.470 align:middle line:90%
You have to run away, et cetera.

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine, for
example, crocodiles

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:06.270 align:middle line:90%
would be very intelligent.

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:13.090 align:middle line:84%
But with crocodile fingers, you
cannot construct the computer.

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:14.860 align:middle line:90%
It helps not.

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Imagine dolphins, the fishes,
are extremely intelligent,

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:19.520 align:middle line:90%
which they are.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.190 align:middle line:90%
So they jump out of the water.

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And they see the little
lights up there at night.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And they come together and
say, what are these lights?

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:27.750 align:middle line:90%
We are intelligent.

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:28.550 align:middle line:90%
We are curious.

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:29.800 align:middle line:90%
We want to find it out.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.470 align:middle line:84%
But to find it out, they
must make spaceships.

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:37.780 align:middle line:84%
To make spaceships, they must
create spaceship technology,

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:39.130 align:middle line:90%
they must create iron.

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:42.520 align:middle line:84%
To make-- to create iron,
you have to make fire.

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.370 align:middle line:84%
To make fire, you have
to come out of the water.

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:47.300 align:middle line:84%
In the water, you
cannot make fire.

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.040 align:middle line:90%
So it's unchangeable forms.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:49.840 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.450 align:middle line:84%
If you have different
animals, unchangeable forms.

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:55.040 align:middle line:90%
So finally, they come out.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:59.710 align:middle line:84%
But again, if dolphins would be
very intelligent, in the water,

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:01.870 align:middle line:90%
you cannot invent the computer.

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:04.570 align:middle line:84%
In the water, you cannot invent
something which functions with

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:05.650 align:middle line:90%
electricity.

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:06.700 align:middle line:90%
It's not possible.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:09.380 align:middle line:84%
You have to come
out of the water.

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:12.010 align:middle line:84%
So these unchangeable
forms force

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:17.080 align:middle line:84%
you to be similar than the ones
who started this whole game.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:20.320 align:middle line:84%
I said extraterrestrials
had sex with humans.

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.820 align:middle line:90%
Are extraterrestrial the same?

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:23.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes, of course.

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:25.000 align:middle line:84%
There are many
extraterrestrials,

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.290 align:middle line:90%
forms of life out there.

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Some of them can be
completely different to ours.

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, I don't know,
on some planets,

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:35.710 align:middle line:84%
there might be extraterrestrials
with tentacles and crazy forms,

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:38.980 align:middle line:84%
which we-- maybe they can
fly, whatever, or looking

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.570 align:middle line:90%
like flying elephants.

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:42.940 align:middle line:84%
But there are also
extraterrestrials

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:45.220 align:middle line:84%
who are similar
to us because they

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:50.200 align:middle line:84%
are the offsprings of the DNA
which the original race spread

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.430 align:middle line:90%
out in the universe.

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:53.090 align:middle line:90%
And we are part of it.

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:57.280 align:middle line:84%
So the question I started all
this was, extraterrestrial has

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.660 align:middle line:90%
sex with humans?

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.220 align:middle line:90%
Is this possible?

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:03.070 align:middle line:84%
Do they have the same
sexual apparatus as we?

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:06.610 align:middle line:84%
In that case, yes, because
they are the offsprings of it.

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:08.760 align:middle line:90%
It makes no sense.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Now Ezekiel described
this vehicle,

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:16.974 align:middle line:84%
which stands before him,
the wings, the wheels,

00:29:16.974 --> 00:29:18.570 align:middle line:90%
every detail.

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And I, in "Chariots
of the Gods,"

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.580 align:middle line:84%
55 years ago, I came
up with the idea,

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.370 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel was describing
a spaceship.

00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:31.950 align:middle line:10%
Of course, I was crushed down
and laughed by-- especially

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:33.450 align:middle line:10%
by the religious people.

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:36.870 align:middle line:10%
They said, this is not correct,
what this Mr. Von Daniken does.

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And simply to explain,
from my family,

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.510 align:middle line:84%
we come out of the
hotel business.

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:45.240 align:middle line:84%
So it was normal that
after my high school,

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.370 align:middle line:90%
I went into the hotel business.

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:49.170 align:middle line:84%
There were some
times I was a waiter.

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:51.600 align:middle line:84%
There were some times I was
sitting at the reception desk.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.060 align:middle line:84%
There were some times
I was behind the bar.

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:55.860 align:middle line:84%
There was some time
I was in the kitchen.

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And finally, when I wrote
"Chariots of the Gods,"

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:01.410 align:middle line:84%
I was the managing director
of a first class hotel.

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, "Chariots of the
Gods" is on the market.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And the critics come
and say, come on.

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:08.850 align:middle line:84%
This man from the hotel
business, he was even a waiter.

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:11.160 align:middle line:84%
How can he come
up with such idea?

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.420 align:middle line:90%
He must be crazy.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:15.210 align:middle line:84%
So I was crashed
down completely.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And there, I made the
suggestion that Ezekiel

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:22.320 align:middle line:84%
saw, in reality, a spaceship,
because he describes it

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.180 align:middle line:90%
in the first--

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:26.760 align:middle line:90%
in the first term.

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:30.740 align:middle line:90%
I did, I saw, et cetera.

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Again, roughly 40 years ago,
I had a secret speech at NASA

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:38.000 align:middle line:84%
in Huntsville, American
Space Administration.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.830 align:middle line:90%
Why secret?

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:43.020 align:middle line:84%
Some scientists from NASA
asked me privately, Erich,

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:45.890 align:middle line:84%
would you be willing to
have a speech among us,

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:47.870 align:middle line:90%
just a few group of scientists?

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:50.120 align:middle line:84%
But it should not
go to the public.

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:52.490 align:middle line:84%
They were afraid to
be ridiculed if they

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:55.250 align:middle line:84%
go to public that Erich Von
Daniken comes to the secret

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:57.230 align:middle line:90%
closed circle of NASA.

00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:58.100 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:00.650 align:middle line:84%
That's why we did not went
to public at that time.

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:04.520 align:middle line:84%
On that speech, I was also
talking about Ezekiel.

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.370 align:middle line:84%
At the end of my speech,
we had a wonderful dinner.

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And the chief of the
construction section

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:11.330 align:middle line:84%
came to me, and
Mr. Joe Blumrich,

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:13.880 align:middle line:84%
and he said, Erich,
that was wonderful.

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:17.090 align:middle line:84%
But Ezekiel, this
is imagination.

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:18.320 align:middle line:90%
This is visions.

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.490 align:middle line:90%
This is Bible.

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:21.770 align:middle line:84%
This has nothing to
do with technology.

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:24.815 align:middle line:90%
And he said, Erich, I have--

00:31:24.815 --> 00:31:25.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm from the profession.

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:28.845 align:middle line:84%
My profession is to
construct rockets.

00:31:28.845 --> 00:31:30.470 align:middle line:84%
He was the one who
constructed together

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:33.830 align:middle line:84%
with others who sat on the five,
who finally went to the moon.

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:38.040 align:middle line:84%
So I-- unfortunately, I
tried to disprove you.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And he started to
read the Bible.

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:43.340 align:middle line:84%
He confessed me that he
never read the Bible before.

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:45.140 align:middle line:90%
And of course, not Ezekiel.

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:48.380 align:middle line:84%
So now he has the Bible,
in two different languages,

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:49.770 align:middle line:90%
English and German.

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And he was very shocked because
Ezekiel wrote a lot of details,

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:59.420 align:middle line:84%
which they had on a construction
table for their planning

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:02.330 align:middle line:84%
to the moon and
planning to later, Mars.

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:06.230 align:middle line:84%
So Joe Blumrich
reconstructed every detail

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:10.020 align:middle line:84%
according to the
measurement of Ezekiel.

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:13.160 align:middle line:90%
And this was the outcome of it.

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:17.420 align:middle line:10%
That was Blumrich's NASA's
reconstruction of Ezekiel.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:21.470 align:middle line:10%
Ezekiel said that this
whole thing on the top--

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:24.200 align:middle line:10%
you can see with the
laser here, on the top,

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:27.680 align:middle line:10%
there was something
like a glittering thing,

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.360 align:middle line:10%
and inside was a chair.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And on the chair
was someone sitting,

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:34.100 align:middle line:84%
looking like a human
in glittering clothes.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, the command in his
spacesuit, and of course,

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:38.440 align:middle line:90%
he's sitting there.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:42.530 align:middle line:84%
He has to have a view
around everything.

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:44.960 align:middle line:84%
He describes the
body of the thing.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.680 align:middle line:84%
He describes the wings, which
made this terrible noise.

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And he even clearly says,
when the wings stood still,

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.050 align:middle line:90%
they were hanging down.

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:56.930 align:middle line:84%
When the noise started, when
the wings started again,

00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:58.310 align:middle line:90%
the wings went up.

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:02.120 align:middle line:84%
He even say, when the
splenderness of the highest.

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.970 align:middle line:84%
He calls this whole thing the
splenderness of the highest.

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:07.160 align:middle line:84%
When the wings started,
the noise started,

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:10.170 align:middle line:84%
and when it lifted up from
the Earth, the wings--

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:13.130 align:middle line:90%
the wheels lifted up too.

00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And then he
describes the wheels.

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel's times, they had
a wheel which go forward

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:20.300 align:middle line:90%
and backward.

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:25.280 align:middle line:84%
But the wheel which he sees
here on Ezekiel's vehicle,

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:29.030 align:middle line:84%
could go forward,
backward, right,

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:33.590 align:middle line:84%
and left at the same time,
without making any steering

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:35.270 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:38.450 align:middle line:84%
When you are sitting in your car
and you want to take a curve,

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:39.800 align:middle line:90%
so you steer.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And the wheels make
a steering movement.

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:46.220 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel describes a wheel which
goes forward, backward, right,

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:48.510 align:middle line:90%
and left without any movement.

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:51.860 align:middle line:84%
So-- And he's so astonished
that he described this wheel

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:53.420 align:middle line:90%
four times.

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Now at NASA, they reconstructed
the wheel of Ezekiel.

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:58.580 align:middle line:10%
And that was the outcome.

00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:00.560 align:middle line:84%
They have the wheel and
they separate the wheel

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:02.070 align:middle line:90%
into different segments.

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Now each segment
has an own axis.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And each axis can turn
in both directions.

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:13.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's clear, with that kind
of wheel, you can go forward,

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:17.330 align:middle line:84%
you can go backward if you
want to go in your direction.

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Just the axis turns in your
direction or away from you.

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:26.179 align:middle line:84%
And with that wheel, you
can go without the curve,

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:31.530 align:middle line:84%
without making a curve in
right angle, into every place.

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:33.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you land
on a strange planet,

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:36.590 align:middle line:84%
you probably don't have
just a plane with grass

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:38.570 align:middle line:90%
where you can move in a curve.

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:43.159 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you have to move
around right angle.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:47.420 align:middle line:84%
This is what this wheel can,
which Ezekiel describes.

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And the funny thing
is NASA has received

00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:53.980 align:middle line:90%
a patent for that wheel.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And that wheel today is used
on Mars on the Mars Rover.

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:03.340 align:middle line:84%
But the whole idea came out of
the Bible, the book of Ezekiel.

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:04.920 align:middle line:90%
I think that's not bad.

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:08.802 align:middle line:84%
If you have your followers
or ancestors of Ezekiel,

00:35:08.802 --> 00:35:10.510 align:middle line:84%
you should ask for
money in the meantime.

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:13.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Now Ezekiel describes
every detail of the wheel.

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:18.490 align:middle line:90%
And the wheel was reconstructed.

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And then at the second
time, a second part

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:23.890 align:middle line:84%
of the book from
chapter 44, he says,

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:27.460 align:middle line:84%
the splenderness of the
Lord arrived a second time.

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:30.430 align:middle line:84%
The splenderness of the
highest a second time.

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And this time, they took me
up-- they put me on a chair,

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:38.620 align:middle line:84%
and they brought me on a
very, very high mountain.

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:40.360 align:middle line:90%
Read this in the Bible.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:44.320 align:middle line:84%
He does not say, they
brought me on a mountain.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:47.920 align:middle line:84%
They brought me on a
very, very high mountain.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.060 align:middle line:90%
In the Bible.

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:52.660 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't know what his
mountain is, where they go.

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Scholars-- biblical
scholars said, well,

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:56.270 align:middle line:90%
Ezekiel had a vision.

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:59.710 align:middle line:84%
He had a dream of a
Jerusalem in the future.

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:01.480 align:middle line:90%
This is nonsense.

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:03.790 align:middle line:90%
Ezekiel grew up in Jerusalem.

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:05.950 align:middle line:84%
If they would have
brought him to Jerusalem,

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:08.960 align:middle line:84%
he would describe, yes, they
brought me to Jerusalem.

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.240 align:middle line:90%
It's not Jerusalem.

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:14.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Jerusalem, there are
no very, very high mountain.

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:16.600 align:middle line:84%
He was at some complete
different place.

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.520 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't know where it is.

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And when they came to a landing,
there is a big building.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel sits on the
splenderness of the highest.

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And the captain asked the human
Ezekiel, look down, human,

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:31.330 align:middle line:90%
what do you see?

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And Ezekiel says, there was
something like a big village

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:35.890 align:middle line:90%
or a small city.

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And in the center of it was
something like a temple.

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:44.640 align:middle line:84%
He does not say it was a
temple, something like a temple.

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Ask yourself, what
was the meaning

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:50.130 align:middle line:90%
of the word temple in antiquity?

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:51.300 align:middle line:90%
A place for the gods.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:52.770 align:middle line:84%
A place for the
extraterrestrials.

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Honor them, worshipped them, a
place where they were living.

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.170 align:middle line:90%
Something like a temple.

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:01.920 align:middle line:84%
They came down and they make
a landing inside the building

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.810 align:middle line:90%
which looks like a temple.

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:05.430 align:middle line:90%
They come to a standstill.

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:06.930 align:middle line:90%
Ezekiel goes out.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And there comes a stranger
in white glittering clothes

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:13.170 align:middle line:90%
and says to Ezekiel, oh, humans.

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:16.590 align:middle line:84%
You, humans, you have eyes
to see, but you see nothing.

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:19.740 align:middle line:84%
You have ears to hear,
but you hear nothing.

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And then the stranger
gives Ezekiel

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.320 align:middle line:84%
a measuring device,
whatever it is, something

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.550 align:middle line:90%
which you can measure.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And the stranger says
to Ezekiel, humans,

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:32.510 align:middle line:90%
now measure this whole building.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:34.910 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel, in the
meantime, has clearly

00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:37.610 align:middle line:90%
understood that this is not God.

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:40.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- it's
something different.

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:41.330 align:middle line:90%
So he has courage.

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:45.050 align:middle line:84%
He asked the stranger, he
asked back, why should I

00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:46.380 align:middle line:90%
measure this building?

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:47.330 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And the stranger
in white clothes,

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:52.460 align:middle line:84%
said, that's why we
brought you up here.

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Now Ezekiel starts to measure,
long, large, different steps,

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:58.310 align:middle line:90%
every detail.

00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:04.490 align:middle line:84%
Read the Bible, pages of
pages of measuring in Ezekiel.

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:07.640 align:middle line:84%
In the whole Bible,
you find this amount

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:13.720 align:middle line:84%
of measuring device
date only on Ezekiel.

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:18.370 align:middle line:10%
Now I just said NASA
reconstructed the spaceship

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:20.770 align:middle line:10%
of Ezekiel in every detail.

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:22.990 align:middle line:10%
And then a German engineer came.

00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:25.660 align:middle line:10%
His name is Hans Herbert Beier.

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And he stumbled over
these measurement dates

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:31.420 align:middle line:90%
at the book of Ezekiel.

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And he asked himself,
is this reality

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:37.480 align:middle line:84%
or was this just a dream,
a vision of Ezekiel?

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:41.080 align:middle line:84%
He started to take Ezekiel's
measurements for real,

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:45.070 align:middle line:84%
and reconstructed, and
designed exactly the building.

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:49.960 align:middle line:84%
One day, I had a yellow envelope
on my desk, a long time ago.

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:54.130 align:middle line:10%
And there, a letter
from this, at that time,

00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:58.030 align:middle line:10%
unknown Dr. Hans Herbert Beier.

00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:00.850 align:middle line:10%
And he said, Dear Mr.
Van Daniken, I just

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:03.010 align:middle line:84%
took the real
measurement of Ezekiel.

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:04.750 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know
if this building is

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:06.740 align:middle line:90%
real or just a fake.

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:08.630 align:middle line:90%
And here is the result.

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:09.430 align:middle line:90%
Incredible.

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:11.080 align:middle line:90%
I was completely shocked.

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:13.310 align:middle line:90%
So the reconstruction was there.

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:18.040 align:middle line:84%
I asked back immediately to
this Mr. Hans Herbert Beier,

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:21.310 align:middle line:84%
do you know the story of
Mr. Joe Blumrich of NASA,

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:24.790 align:middle line:84%
who reconstructed the
spaceship of Ezekiel?

00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Now the German engineer,
Hans Herbert Beier,

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:31.180 align:middle line:84%
have never heard the word of
the NASA engineer, Joe Blumrich.

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:33.250 align:middle line:10%
I brought these two
people together.

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:37.660 align:middle line:10%
And funny again, the
spaceship of Ezekiel from NASA

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:40.810 align:middle line:10%
fit perfectly into
the reconstruction

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:44.110 align:middle line:10%
of the German engineer,
Hans Herbert Beier.

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:48.160 align:middle line:10%
So the so-called temple was
nothing else than the base

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:51.430 align:middle line:10%
camp of the extraterrestrials.

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:55.220 align:middle line:90%
It all fits perfectly.

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:57.890 align:middle line:90%
No coincidence.

00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:59.520 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.680 align:middle line:90%
Now what can we do?

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Again, our translations
in the past

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:06.650 align:middle line:84%
were made from a
biblical standpoint,

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:10.130 align:middle line:84%
from a religious and
psychological standpoint.

00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Our professionals at that
time who translated Ezekiel

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:16.940 align:middle line:84%
were real, famous beings,
but they could not

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.260 align:middle line:90%
translate it the other way.

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:20.810 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, we
know what happened.

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:24.870 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel sees the light up
there, with his captured people.

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:26.600 align:middle line:90%
They hear the noise.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.490 align:middle line:90%
Some vehicle came down.

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel, by
profession, is priest.

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:34.820 align:middle line:84%
He thinks in the beginning
that this must be God,

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:37.010 align:middle line:84%
so he fell to
himself on the knees.

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And then he realized,
this is not God.

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Now he stands up and
he starts to describe

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:48.330 align:middle line:84%
every details, the wings with
their noise, the feet who

00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:49.620 align:middle line:90%
were metallic.

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:54.660 align:middle line:84%
Then of course, the wheel, which
could go in every direction,

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:57.060 align:middle line:84%
forward, backward,
right, and left

00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:59.020 align:middle line:90%
without a steering movement.

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:02.160 align:middle line:84%
All of this is handed
down in the Bible.

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And in the meantime,
we can reconstruct it.

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:07.560 align:middle line:84%
He says, between the
living creatures,

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:10.800 align:middle line:84%
there was something
glittering like a fire.

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.710 align:middle line:84%
It was simply the cooler
from the atomic reactor,

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:17.010 align:middle line:84%
because the energy comes
from a little atomic reactor.

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:21.780 align:middle line:84%
We have these small atomic
reactors too in our day.

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:23.760 align:middle line:90%
And he describes every detail.

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:28.620 align:middle line:84%
He's completely upside down
when he sees the wheel.

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:31.410 align:middle line:84%
The wheel, who could
go in every direction

00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:33.690 align:middle line:90%
without a steering movement.

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:36.532 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the meantime,
we know what it was.

00:41:36.532 --> 00:41:37.365 align:middle line:90%
Everything is clear.

00:41:37.365 --> 00:41:40.130 align:middle line:90%


00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:43.610 align:middle line:84%
So I always ask
our scholars again,

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:46.550 align:middle line:84%
you are looking for evidence
of extraterrestrials.

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:50.520 align:middle line:84%
We have evidence of
extraterrestrials, not only in

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:51.320 align:middle line:90%
the Bible.

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.180 align:middle line:90%
And we can reconstruct it.

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:56.780 align:middle line:84%
We know how all of this
took place in the meantime.

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:59.300 align:middle line:10%
But these scholars, who
are brilliant person,

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.910 align:middle line:10%
simply don't know it.

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:04.460 align:middle line:10%
The spirit of time has changed.

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:07.320 align:middle line:10%
Our scholars, I said at
the beginning of my speech,

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.890 align:middle line:10%
they are looking
for traces of life

00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:15.680 align:middle line:10%
in microscopic forms, molecules,
bacterias, and meteorites.

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:18.260 align:middle line:10%
But in reality, they were here.

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:21.350 align:middle line:10%
And it is handed down
in different old books,

00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:22.370 align:middle line:10%
with old books.

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:25.640 align:middle line:10%
I mean, books which are
thousands of years old.

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:29.060 align:middle line:10%
"The Book of Enoch," he clearly
described what happened.

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:30.590 align:middle line:10%
They brought him up there.

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:32.190 align:middle line:10%
They teach him.

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the stranger say to
Enoch, human, look out there.

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:38.180 align:middle line:84%
Do you see this little
light out there?

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.340 align:middle line:84%
You, humans, call it
the moon, but the moon

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:41.690 align:middle line:90%
has no light by itself.

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:43.640 align:middle line:84%
The moon receives its
light from the sun.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.830 align:middle line:90%
All this is enough.

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And we have many of these
old books in ancient India

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:50.780 align:middle line:90%
in the Mahabharata.

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:52.370 align:middle line:90%
But they don't know it.

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:54.347 align:middle line:84%
Our scholars, who
are brilliant people,

00:42:54.347 --> 00:42:55.430 align:middle line:90%
they simply don't know it.

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:57.410 align:middle line:90%
They don't have the information.

00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:59.600 align:middle line:84%
The information
are here, and they

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.010 align:middle line:90%
know what I'm talking about.

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:05.360 align:middle line:84%
I have so far published
44 titles on this subject.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:08.840 align:middle line:84%
I really know what's going
on in old holy texts,

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.940 align:middle line:84%
and they know the
archeological mysteries.

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:13.190 align:middle line:84%
You will see some
of them tomorrow.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:16.190 align:middle line:84%
But our scientific
community doesn't know it.

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:17.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not bad will.

00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:19.310 align:middle line:90%
They are simply not interested.

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:21.843 align:middle line:90%
They say this can't be possible.

00:43:21.843 --> 00:43:24.260 align:middle line:84%
This can't be-- we don't have
to read books like Erich Von

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:25.910 align:middle line:90%
Daniken or others.

00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:29.690 align:middle line:84%
They are all making mistakes
or dreams or wishes.

00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:32.900 align:middle line:84%
It's not dreams or
wishes, the descriptions

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:35.240 align:middle line:90%
are absolutely clear.

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.680 align:middle line:90%
Now to come to this--

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.620 align:middle line:84%
to an end, I want to
show you something which

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:43.330 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely sensational.

00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:47.260 align:middle line:84%
You all have heard about
the plain of Nazca in Peru.

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:49.330 align:middle line:90%
Everyone knows what Nazca is.

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And I nerve myself,
practically every year,

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:56.680 align:middle line:84%
every second of the year
on world television.

00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:02.200 align:middle line:84%
We see a so-called documentary
on Nazca, by scientists.

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:04.030 align:middle line:84%
When you hear the
word "Documentary,"

00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:06.280 align:middle line:84%
you think, well,
it's documentary,

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:07.940 align:middle line:90%
scientific knowledge.

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:09.760 align:middle line:90%
And what are they telling us?

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:12.700 align:middle line:84%
They're showing us
the desert of Nazca.

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.190 align:middle line:84%
The desert of Nazca is
about 500 kilometers

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:17.830 align:middle line:90%
South of Lima in Peru.

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And the desert of Nazca is
flat, more or less flat.

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:22.390 align:middle line:90%
There are a few hills in there.

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:23.590 align:middle line:90%
And it's very hot.

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And the stones on
the desert are brown

00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:27.940 align:middle line:84%
because from the heat
for thousands of years,

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:29.750 align:middle line:90%
10 miles from the sun.

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Now if you simply
put the stones away,

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:35.200 align:middle line:84%
you crash the stones away,
you receive a brighter shining

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.390 align:middle line:90%
surrounding on the ground.

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Now they show us on television,
on their documentary, how easy

00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:43.870 align:middle line:90%
it is to make these figures.

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:46.870 align:middle line:84%
On Nazca, when you stand
there as a tourist,

00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:48.700 align:middle line:90%
you see first, nothing.

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:51.340 align:middle line:84%
You just see the desert
with the brown stones.

00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Soon, as you fly a little
over Nazca in a helicopter,

00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:56.650 align:middle line:84%
and you see out of
the desert figures,

00:44:56.650 --> 00:45:00.880 align:middle line:84%
figures like fishes, monkeys,
spiders, ape, humans, et

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.730 align:middle line:84%
cetera, figures that of
such overdimensional side

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:05.860 align:middle line:84%
that you can see them
only from the air.

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Then you go higher
and higher again.

00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And then you see, between
the figures, gigantic lines.

00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:13.870 align:middle line:10%
Some of the lines are small.

00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:17.760 align:middle line:84%
The longest of it is
26 kilometers long.

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Stride the head of
hills and mountains.

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:24.890 align:middle line:10%
And then you see something
which looks like air strips.

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Now what nerves me, every
year, scientific documentation,

00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:33.250 align:middle line:90%
they show you the small lines.

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:36.940 align:middle line:84%
They show you how easy
it is to construct

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:41.890 align:middle line:84%
these figures by scratching away
the stones, which is all true.

00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:46.160 align:middle line:84%
But they do not show
you these pictures.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.560 align:middle line:84%
These pictures,
which you see here

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:51.500 align:middle line:90%
is Nazca or regional Nazca.

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:55.280 align:middle line:84%
You never see them on a
television documentation.

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:57.200 align:middle line:90%
You never see them somewhere.

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.180 align:middle line:90%
This is Nazca.

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we have
these small figures.

00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:06.410 align:middle line:84%
We have these spiders, fishes,
monkeys, labyrinths, et cetera.

00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:10.820 align:middle line:84%
But the biggest mystery
of Nazca is this.

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:12.890 align:middle line:84%
High, you don't see
them in television.

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:15.440 align:middle line:90%
This is impressive.

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.650 align:middle line:84%
I said in "Chariots of the
Gods," some of these lines

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:20.780 align:middle line:90%
look like airstrips.

00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:23.960 align:middle line:90%
I never said they are airstrips.

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:26.060 align:middle line:90%
I said they look like airstrips.

00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:29.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, what
do they look like?

00:46:29.570 --> 00:46:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And they show us only the
pictures of the fishes,

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:32.900 align:middle line:90%
of the monkeys.

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:35.240 align:middle line:84%
They don't show
us these figures.

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.040 align:middle line:90%
This is original Nazca.

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:39.440 align:middle line:84%
What has the scientific
community, so far,

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:40.370 align:middle line:90%
come up with Nazca?

00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:44.360 align:middle line:84%
They said-- and I read
all the Nazca books,

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:47.650 align:middle line:84%
it's all an
astronomical calendar.

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:50.770 align:middle line:84%
The next say, it's a
cult for the water gods.

00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:53.320 align:middle line:84%
No, it's a cult for
the mountain gods.

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:56.120 align:middle line:90%
It's a cult for agriculture.

00:46:56.120 --> 00:47:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Look at that picture,
beaming into your brain.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:02.560 align:middle line:90%
This is Nazca.

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:06.490 align:middle line:84%
But you never see it on
scientific documentations

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:07.720 align:middle line:90%
on TV.

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:09.910 align:middle line:90%
You only see the figures.

00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:13.060 align:middle line:84%
The next say, no, it's
a cult for agriculture.

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:17.740 align:middle line:84%
I even read in a super book,
Nazca was a pre-Inca sport

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:22.870 align:middle line:84%
place, some sort of pre-Inca
Olympia, or they say,

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:25.540 align:middle line:90%
this is a copy of Fata Morgana.

00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Now look at this
picture a little closer.

00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:30.850 align:middle line:84%
You see one of these lines
looking like an airstrip.

00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And under the line,
you see a zig zag line.

00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And this zig zag line,
definitely, is under this--

00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:40.330 align:middle line:90%
looking like an airstrip.

00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:42.960 align:middle line:90%
Now come closer to it.

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:46.040 align:middle line:84%
They cut off the
mountain artificially.

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:47.940 align:middle line:84%
You see, these are
normal mountains.

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:50.360 align:middle line:84%
You see, from both
sides, the mountain

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:52.070 align:middle line:90%
comes through the top of it.

00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:56.570 align:middle line:84%
But this mountain was
cut off artificially.

00:47:56.570 --> 00:47:59.270 align:middle line:90%
Stone Age people.

00:47:59.270 --> 00:48:01.430 align:middle line:84%
My friend, Charles
Schultz, always

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:03.410 align:middle line:84%
said, with chicken
bones or what?

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:04.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:08.090 align:middle line:84%
They scratched up complete
mountains, Stone Age people,

00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:09.420 align:middle line:90%
to put this.

00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
zig zag line under it.

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And they don't show
it to the public.

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:18.470 align:middle line:84%
They just say, there are
only fishes, monkeys, birds,

00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:19.730 align:middle line:90%
spiders.

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:22.700 align:middle line:84%
These kind of pictures
are never shown.

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:24.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a shame.

00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:28.760 align:middle line:84%
So they say, this is a pre-Inca
sport place of Olympia.

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:31.070 align:middle line:90%
It's copies of Fata Morgana's.

00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:34.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a start place
for hot air balloon.

00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:36.920 align:middle line:90%
These are acre plots.

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:39.570 align:middle line:90%
These are boundary makers.

00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:42.530 align:middle line:90%
These are procession streets.

00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Where are the pathways to
the procession streets?

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:48.380 align:middle line:90%
You find nothing.

00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:51.200 align:middle line:84%
They say this is an
astronomical map.

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:53.780 align:middle line:90%
They say it's a cultural Atlas.

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:57.270 align:middle line:84%
It's all coming from the
scientific community.

00:48:57.270 --> 00:49:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And I often have the idea,
they never were in Nazca.

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:03.490 align:middle line:84%
They all-- one copies
what the other says.

00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:07.420 align:middle line:84%
They never were there in the
original to look at Nazca.

00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:09.100 align:middle line:90%
These pictures speak for--

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:11.520 align:middle line:90%
speak for themselves.

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And we close our eyes and
says, this can't be true.

00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:17.690 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes, all this is true.

00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:21.400 align:middle line:90%
Now we live in a time.

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:23.430 align:middle line:90%
Time has to change.

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:25.620 align:middle line:84%
The scientific
community, which I adore,

00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:28.260 align:middle line:84%
and our astronomers, who
are brilliant people,

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:30.990 align:middle line:84%
they have simply to
change their mind.

00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Finally, they have to accept the
changing of the spirit of time.

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Until today, they don't
look at our indications.

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:40.140 align:middle line:90%
They don't look at this.

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:42.330 align:middle line:90%
They simply ignore it.

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:45.840 align:middle line:84%
But we, not only I, many
of my brilliant colleagues

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:49.260 align:middle line:84%
have brought a lot of
evidence and proves

00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:52.680 align:middle line:84%
that extraterrestrials were here
some thousands of years ago.

00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:55.270 align:middle line:90%
You cannot deny this anymore.

00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Our scientific, I said
it not the first time,

00:49:58.050 --> 00:50:02.780 align:middle line:84%
look for primitive molecules,
primitive bacterias

00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:04.170 align:middle line:90%
in meteorites.

00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:05.190 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And they ignore that
they were here already.

00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:08.850 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Why are they afraid to
say that they were here?

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:15.900 align:middle line:84%
First, they simply
don't know it.

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:17.460 align:middle line:90%
I say, they ignore the fact.

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:19.890 align:middle line:90%
They don't know about the facts.

00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:22.020 align:middle line:84%
Real scientists
never really read

00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:23.820 align:middle line:90%
a book of Erich Von Daniken.

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:25.150 align:middle line:90%
Come on, this is all rubbish.

00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:25.950 align:middle line:90%
That's all garbage.

00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:26.880 align:middle line:90%
You don't read it.

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:29.520 align:middle line:84%
They don't read books of
some of my colleagues.

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:31.272 align:middle line:90%
They don't-- are not interested.

00:50:31.272 --> 00:50:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And if they are
interested, they're

00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:34.600 align:middle line:84%
all, come on,
that's imagination.

00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:35.700 align:middle line:90%
This is Bible.

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:36.810 align:middle line:90%
This is wishes.

00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:38.220 align:middle line:90%
These are dreams.

00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:41.820 align:middle line:84%
Now our ancestors some
thousands of years ago

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:44.820 align:middle line:90%
were not liars, not scientific--

00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:46.230 align:middle line:90%
science fiction writer.

00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:47.970 align:middle line:90%
They wrote the truth.

00:50:47.970 --> 00:50:50.490 align:middle line:84%
The first persons who
were able to write,

00:50:50.490 --> 00:50:53.160 align:middle line:84%
wrote what they knew
at that time, what

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:57.810 align:middle line:84%
the high priest or the king
told them to write, and not

00:50:57.810 --> 00:51:01.260 align:middle line:84%
the stories from
their imagination.

00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:05.340 align:middle line:84%
We should take all this
into our consequences.

00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:08.250 align:middle line:90%
We should learn from our past.

00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Humanity is not
unique in the world.

00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:14.310 align:middle line:84%
Out there, there are
many forms of life.

00:51:14.310 --> 00:51:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And we can prove that at
least one form of life

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:19.680 align:middle line:90%
was here on planet Earth.

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:23.950 align:middle line:84%
We can prove it by the
scientific literature

00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:24.750 align:middle line:90%
from the past.

00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And we can prove it by the
documents and monuments,

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:30.850 align:middle line:90%
which I will show you tomorrow.

00:51:30.850 --> 00:51:33.430 align:middle line:90%
The spirit of time has changed.

00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And we have to accept, and
we have to become humble,

00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:40.060 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, we are not
unique on this planet.

00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:44.740 align:middle line:84%
Somebody is out there, and
somebody was here already.

00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And this somebody
promised to return.

00:51:47.410 --> 00:51:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And we should prepare
for this return.

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:53.770 align:middle line:84%
If we are not prepared,
we will be shocked.

00:51:53.770 --> 00:51:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine, one day,
a spaceship arrives,

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.060 align:middle line:90%
and you see it on television.

00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:00.580 align:middle line:84%
All humanity see it
in their countries.

00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:04.090 align:middle line:84%
What a shock, especially
for religious communities,

00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:06.280 align:middle line:84%
like for example,
the Muslim society.

00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:07.720 align:middle line:90%
They are completely shocked.

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:08.520 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:09.490 align:middle line:90%
We are not alone?

00:52:09.490 --> 00:52:11.530 align:middle line:90%
Extraterrestrials were here.

00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Or the Jewish or the
Christian community,

00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:16.630 align:middle line:84%
we all have learned in the
Bible that there is Moses.

00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:18.700 align:middle line:90%
And Moses had contact with God.

00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And I said God descended
from the holy mountain

00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:24.040 align:middle line:84%
with smoke, fire,
trembling, loud noise.

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Now it turns out,
it was not God.

00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:30.250 align:middle line:90%
It was extraterrestrials.

00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:32.920 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm a deep
believer in God.

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:35.890 align:middle line:84%
I am one of these figures
who pray every day.

00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:38.230 align:middle line:84%
Although, I have no
idea what God is.

00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:41.320 align:middle line:84%
I pray to the
almighty grand spirit

00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:43.570 align:middle line:90%
of the universe, which is God.

00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:46.060 align:middle line:84%
But my God does
never use a vehicle

00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:50.210 align:middle line:84%
in which to move from point
A to point B in a vehicle.

00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:53.080 align:middle line:84%
My God is omnipotent,
is all over.

00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:56.230 align:middle line:10%
So now we have this
old text, and we should

00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:58.270 align:middle line:10%
change our religious belief.

00:52:58.270 --> 00:53:01.060 align:middle line:84%
When you accept something
like our theory,

00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:03.520 align:middle line:90%
you do not become an unbeliever.

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:08.350 align:middle line:10%
You still know that God does
exist and you admire God,

00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:11.020 align:middle line:10%
but you lose the
religious knowledge.

00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Moses has not seen
the Almighty God

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:16.420 align:middle line:84%
coming down on the mountain
with smoke and fire,

00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:17.680 align:middle line:90%
and trembling, and louder.

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:19.790 align:middle line:90%
He saw extraterrestrials.

00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:25.300 align:middle line:84%
So this new truth will shock
us, will shock the community,

00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:26.920 align:middle line:90%
will shock mankind.

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:30.580 align:middle line:84%
That's why we should prepare
them slowly, slowly, slowly.

00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:33.040 align:middle line:84%
It will probably
take one generation.

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:36.790 align:middle line:84%
I guess within the next 10
years, the situation is clear,

00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:40.520 align:middle line:84%
and everyone knows
we are not alone.

00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:43.570 align:middle line:84%
They were here some
thousands of years ago.

00:53:43.570 --> 00:53:45.490 align:middle line:90%
And we can prove them.

00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:48.670 align:middle line:90%
We can definitely prove this.

00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:51.730 align:middle line:10%
Ladies and gentlemen, as
I said at the beginning,

00:53:51.730 --> 00:53:53.950 align:middle line:10%
in the meantime,
I'm 87 years old,

00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:58.600 align:middle line:10%
but I have the impression
that almighty God protect me.

00:53:58.600 --> 00:53:59.920 align:middle line:90%
I feel very perfect.

00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:01.480 align:middle line:90%
My brain is still working.

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:03.710 align:middle line:90%
I admire to speak to you.

00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:07.810 align:middle line:84%
I am happy to be here, to
give a few of my words to you.

00:54:07.810 --> 00:54:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And I hope, with a little of
my knowledge, you grow up too

00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:14.920 align:middle line:84%
and you, yourself,
become researchers,

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:18.830 align:middle line:84%
and look for more
knowledge in this field.

00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:20.090 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for listening to me.

00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:20.890 align:middle line:90%
Bye bye.

00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:22.540 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:23.900 align:middle line:90%
So-- OK.

00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:24.700 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:28.050 align:middle line:10%
