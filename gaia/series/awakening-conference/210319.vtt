00:00:14.127 --> 00:00:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, good evening, everyone.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Good evening.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm really excited to talk
to you about a subject that is

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.670 align:middle line:90%
very near and dear to me.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.440 align:middle line:90%
One that I think is fascinating.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.180 align:middle line:90%
And that is the Inner Earth.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.050 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.450 align:middle line:10%
Raise your hand if
you have an inkling

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:37.740 align:middle line:10%
about what I refer to when I
mentioned the term Inner Earth.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.180 align:middle line:10%
That's pretty good.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.430 align:middle line:10%
About 1/3 of the people.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.080 align:middle line:10%
So what we're talking about is
this notion that, in mythology

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.160 align:middle line:10%
or reality, there is the
belief that just like there's

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.230 align:middle line:10%
continents on the
surface of the Earth,

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.590 align:middle line:10%
with countries and states
and different regions,

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.350 align:middle line:10%
there are also realms
under the Earth where

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.349 align:middle line:10%
real people are living
with suns and rivers

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.640 align:middle line:10%
and oceans just like ours.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.990 align:middle line:10%
And as incredible
as that sounds,

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.060 align:middle line:10%
that's not really what I'm
going to talk about tonight.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.570 align:middle line:10%
We're going to touch upon
that, a bit of an overview.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.720 align:middle line:10%
But what I really want to do
is ask the audacious question,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.700 align:middle line:10%
are we living in
the Inner Earth?

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.360 align:middle line:10%
Now, before you call for
the men in the white jackets

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.060 align:middle line:10%
to come and escort
me off the stage,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.430 align:middle line:10%
let me submit to
you that the amount

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:46.210 align:middle line:10%
of scientific, technological,
theological, mythological

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.950 align:middle line:10%
evidence to support
this outlandish claim

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.410 align:middle line:10%
is greater than
you might expect.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.580 align:middle line:84%
So let's just dive
right into it.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.760 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk a
little bit about somebody

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.970 align:middle line:84%
who is flying way under the
radar and shouldn't be--

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.220 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Heinrich Kusch.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.150 align:middle line:84%
He is a scholar of great
renown, archaeologists working

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.730 align:middle line:90%
in Austria but all over Europe.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And his books, which
are lavish books

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.230 align:middle line:84%
with great big pictures,
really expensive stuff,

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.600 align:middle line:90%
they sold out instantly.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.050 align:middle line:84%
But they were only
available in German.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.690 align:middle line:90%
Never printed in English.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And guess what, they will
never ever be republished.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.020 align:middle line:90%


00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.640 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Might there be censorship
in this day and age?

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.180 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes, there is.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.750 align:middle line:10%
It's because of his
shocking findings.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.400 align:middle line:10%
He befriended a PhD, a
doctorate four times,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.390 align:middle line:10%
who was a monk, who managed
a library, and said,

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.930 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to show you
some things, Heinrich.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.530 align:middle line:10%
But you can't talk about
them until I'm dead.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.600 align:middle line:10%
And he showed him
a documentation

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.820 align:middle line:10%
that, in 1580, the
church shut down

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.360 align:middle line:10%
all the tunnels that were
leading to the Inner Earth.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.750 align:middle line:10%
There was trade agreements
between the Inner Earth

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.840 align:middle line:10%
people and the people
above, the humans.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.260 align:middle line:10%
And what happened--
spoiler alert--

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.698 align:middle line:10%
the trade agreement
was violated.

00:03:23.698 --> 00:03:25.740 align:middle line:10%
And it wasn't violated by
the Inner Earth people,

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.150 align:middle line:10%
it was violated by the humans.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.560 align:middle line:10%
Things got really messy.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.580 align:middle line:10%
It kicked off.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.500 align:middle line:10%
They had to close the tunnels.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.960 align:middle line:10%
And there's documentation
that proves that.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.180 align:middle line:10%
There is pieces of land, one
called the Twelve Apostles,

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.710 align:middle line:10%
where technology has
validated that there

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.080 align:middle line:10%
is deep tunnels that
have been filled just

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.420 align:middle line:10%
like the documentation says.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.260 align:middle line:84%
The Vatican has tried to
buy that property six times,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.630 align:middle line:84%
so is Mossad, so is the world's
biggest mining companies.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.800 align:middle line:84%
So here's a modern day story
about the Inner Earth that's

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.110 align:middle line:90%
being totally suppressed.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.360 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm not into the subjects.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.380 align:middle line:84%
I think it's cool, and
I like to research it.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm into it because an excuse
is sort of sideways discussion

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.220 align:middle line:84%
here, but I think it's
important to tell you

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.360 align:middle line:90%
about why I care about it.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's because I'm involved
in an archaeological quest

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.000 align:middle line:84%
in England for a
Knights Templar.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.260 align:middle line:90%
I'll call it treasure.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's a project
that I'm working

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.850 align:middle line:84%
with someone who couldn't be
here this weekend, Klaus Dona.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And the project
has revealed to us

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.730 align:middle line:84%
that where we have identified
the Knights Templar treasure

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:46.530 align:middle line:90%
is buried--

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.180 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, I have validated
that it's there with SpaceX

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.070 align:middle line:90%
satellite technology.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.910 align:middle line:90%
Just a matter of getting it out.

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:55.710 align:middle line:90%
It's rather deep.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.530 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.830 align:middle line:84%
We were also able to validate,
with our own technology

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.180 align:middle line:84%
and with the SpaceX satellites,
that there are other deposits

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.860 align:middle line:90%
already there.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.730 align:middle line:90%
Roman Celtic, they're deeper.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.300 align:middle line:84%
But there's one deposit
that's really deep.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen deposits at
that level all over the world.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.120 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, how did
the Knights Templar know,

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.760 align:middle line:84%
how did the Romans know,
how did the Celtic people

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.850 align:middle line:84%
know that here are
repositories of the arts

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.760 align:middle line:84%
and sciences of
lost technologies

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.850 align:middle line:84%
that will be available
to us when we need them?

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.550 align:middle line:84%
How did they know to put
them all in the same place?

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.540 align:middle line:90%
I don't have that answer.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.700 align:middle line:84%
But it has come to our attention
that that is the reality of it.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:55.510 align:middle line:84%
So in my quest to
find these sites,

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.860 align:middle line:84%
I've come across this stained
glass window of William Ufford.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:05.690 align:middle line:10%
Now, he is a long line of
noblemen, of crusading knights.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.280 align:middle line:10%
He's awarded the
Order of the Garter.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.155 align:middle line:10%
He's really esteemed.

00:06:08.155 --> 00:06:13.390 align:middle line:10%
He worked for two English kings,
including the very young King

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.670 align:middle line:10%
Richard.

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.330 align:middle line:84%
During the Peasants' Revolt,
the peasants were so impressed

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.170 align:middle line:90%
with this guy.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.555 align:middle line:10%
They said, we want
you to represent us.

00:06:22.555 --> 00:06:24.430 align:middle line:10%
And he said, no, I
couldn't possibly do that.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.263 align:middle line:10%
I work for the king.

00:06:25.263 --> 00:06:26.823 align:middle line:10%
In fact, I've got to leave.

00:06:26.823 --> 00:06:28.240 align:middle line:10%
I've got to leave
Bury St. Edmunds

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.000 align:middle line:10%
and go to London with the
most important documents

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.170 align:middle line:10%
of the realm.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.110 align:middle line:10%
And that's what's shown here.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.360 align:middle line:10%
But to sneak out, he had
to dress like one of them.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.740 align:middle line:10%
He dressed like a stable boy.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:39.750 align:middle line:10%
And that's what you see.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.333 align:middle line:10%
But I looked at this
thin glass window

00:06:41.333 --> 00:06:43.000 align:middle line:10%
and I thought,
what's going on here?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.640 align:middle line:10%
We have man bags in the
14th century, really?

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.920 align:middle line:10%
And the straps are blue?

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.330 align:middle line:10%
I never read about that.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:51.220 align:middle line:10%
So I thought, OK.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.890 align:middle line:10%
Well, the blue strap,
that must be a river.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.490 align:middle line:10%
Figure it out, Andrew.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:56.290 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.830 align:middle line:10%
I identified some rivers based
upon where this stained glass

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:00.955 align:middle line:10%
window resided.

00:07:00.955 --> 00:07:03.570 align:middle line:90%


00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:84%
But to make a long
story short, we

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.500 align:middle line:84%
realized that the blue
strap is not a river.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.400 align:middle line:10%
It's a tunnel.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.130 align:middle line:10%
A tunnel that's used by
the Inner Earth people.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:16.830 align:middle line:10%
And it goes over 10 miles.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And it empties out where
there is a huge chamber

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:24.780 align:middle line:84%
that I have visited and
validated the existence of.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:30.930 align:middle line:10%
So what I find fascinating,
and it's a working hypothesis,

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:35.580 align:middle line:10%
is that that man bag of
the king's right-hand man,

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.790 align:middle line:10%
during a time when
it's all kicking off

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.470 align:middle line:10%
and the most important
documents need

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.680 align:middle line:10%
to be preserved and brought to
the 14-year-old King Richard

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:50.550 align:middle line:10%
II, represent an inventory
of all the sacred burial

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:54.870 align:middle line:10%
sites of treasure in the UK.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.230 align:middle line:10%
Each sheet is a site,
each box is a chamber,

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.560 align:middle line:10%
and the symbol in that box
represent the kind of thing

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.840 align:middle line:10%
that's buried in that chamber.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.080 align:middle line:10%
That is our working hypothesis.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.950 align:middle line:10%
That is why, organically,
I've had to become interested

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:13.078 align:middle line:10%
in the Inner Earth.

00:08:13.078 --> 00:08:14.870 align:middle line:10%
So what are the legends
of the Inner Earth?

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:15.470 align:middle line:90%
Are they real?

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:15.980 align:middle line:90%
Are they fact?

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:16.780 align:middle line:90%
Are they fiction?

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.310 align:middle line:84%
Here's a whole bunch of
stuff from Wikipedia.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, Wikipedia is not
the sole source of truth.

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:24.000 align:middle line:90%
We all know that.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.660 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that every
country and every epoch

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.390 align:middle line:84%
has a story about the
Inner Earth, they all do.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps, the most popular
of all are the ones in the East.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:38.840 align:middle line:10%
And famously, they've
been called names.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.919 align:middle line:10%
And they kind of blur.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And if we had more time, we
can decompose why they blur.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.870 align:middle line:84%
But Shangri-La,
Shambhala, Agharta.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.860 align:middle line:10%
Again, for all the regions above
the Earth, all the countries

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:55.980 align:middle line:10%
and states and continents,
there are as many,

00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:01.010 align:middle line:10%
if not more, of those beneath
the Earth as legend purports.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:04.130 align:middle line:10%
But what I love about this
is the Dalai Lama, who

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:06.260 align:middle line:10%
is the terrestrial
representative

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.230 align:middle line:10%
of the Inner Earth, had
this to say in 1985.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:13.190 align:middle line:84%
He says, the Inner Earth
is a real physical place

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.420 align:middle line:90%
in the human realm.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.530 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:19.130 align:middle line:10%
You can't go there unless
you have karmic connections.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.750 align:middle line:10%
In other words,
you can't go there

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:25.050 align:middle line:10%
unless your ancestry
is from there.

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:27.920 align:middle line:90%
But it's real.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Not far from where we're
meeting this weekend is

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:37.357 align:middle line:84%
a great site of an
amazing story, in England,

00:09:37.357 --> 00:09:38.190 align:middle line:90%
of the Inner Earth--

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:39.270 align:middle line:90%
Saint Martin's Land.

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Just a little bit
over to the east.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And here, we have a fantastic
story of two children who

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.630 align:middle line:84%
appear in the 12th
century, dressed funny,

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:53.240 align:middle line:84%
can't speak English,
cannot eat human food.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.480 align:middle line:90%
It's a boy and a girl.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.220 align:middle line:84%
The boy would die because
he can't eat human food.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.210 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.140 align:middle line:90%
Their skin is green.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Because there's no vitamin
D inside the Earth.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, not enough because the
sun's a bit different, right?

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:12.300 align:middle line:84%
So what they went on to say--
well, the boy dies, right,

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.080 align:middle line:84%
but the girl grows up and
lives a relatively normal life.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's embarrassing
that they say, well.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:21.300 align:middle line:84%
She was rather loose and
wanton in her conduct.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.830 align:middle line:90%
That's a bit unfair, I think.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.810 align:middle line:10%
But that was the
only observation

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:26.940 align:middle line:10%
about her not being as
normal as everyone else

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.210 align:middle line:10%
that she grew up with.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.960 align:middle line:84%
But William of Newburgh, who
is the blogger of his day,

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.250 align:middle line:90%
interviews them.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And they say, well, we're
from Saint Martin's Land.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And Saint Martin's Land,
under the Earth, is--

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:44.100 align:middle line:84%
it's not like your Earth,
it's not like your sun,

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.430 align:middle line:90%
it's lit like dawn and dusk.

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:51.750 align:middle line:10%
But over a great body of
water, there is another realm

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.190 align:middle line:10%
that it's more luminous.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:54.580 align:middle line:90%
It has its own sun.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:11:00.780 align:middle line:84%
So they describe in detail a
lot of things about the world

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:01.665 align:middle line:90%
that they came from.

00:11:01.665 --> 00:11:04.260 align:middle line:90%


00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.870 align:middle line:10%
So OK, great.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:09.530 align:middle line:10%
That is the overall
premise of the Inner Earth.

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.710 align:middle line:10%
But how do we know
about these details?

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:14.690 align:middle line:84%
A couple of pieces
from mythology.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:17.610 align:middle line:90%
But who are the whistleblowers?

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:24.470 align:middle line:84%
So we'll start with Alexander
Saint-Yves D'Alveydre who

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:27.020 align:middle line:84%
is a really important
figure, who is

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.330 align:middle line:90%
visited by Eastern initiates.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And they tell him all kinds
of secrets about Agharta.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.300 align:middle line:90%
And he writes the book.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And he's all really
excited about it.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.490 align:middle line:84%
But basically, what
the initiates have said

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:44.540 align:middle line:84%
is, the history of
arts and sciences

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.690 align:middle line:84%
and lost technologies
and virile energy,

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:51.200 align:middle line:84%
and all these wonderful ways
that exist in the Inner Earth

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.030 align:middle line:90%
will be available to you.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.160 align:middle line:90%
They'll be waiting for you.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.410 align:middle line:90%
And you're going to need them.

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:57.680 align:middle line:84%
But we can't give them to
you now because your world

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.080 align:middle line:90%
is ruled by an evil cabal.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.890 align:middle line:84%
When that cabal is
gone, you can have it.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:09.230 align:middle line:10%
So what he says what
the initiates say

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:13.160 align:middle line:10%
is that the human
race, our ancestors,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:17.510 align:middle line:10%
descended into the
Earth in 3,200 BCE

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:21.710 align:middle line:10%
where they're ruled by the ruler
of the world and priest-kings.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:23.280 align:middle line:10%
They have their own language.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:29.280 align:middle line:10%
Now, what gets interesting
about this is, he panics.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.550 align:middle line:84%
He's like, well, I've
just revealed too much.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:35.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go and take
all those books back.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:40.090 align:middle line:10%
And he does, except for one.

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:44.770 align:middle line:10%
And that is what Gerard
Vincent publishes.

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:46.570 align:middle line:10%
And Gerard Vincent,
bless him, goes on

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.040 align:middle line:10%
to create the Martinist Order.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.340 align:middle line:10%
He goes on to really
found the occult.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:56.080 align:middle line:10%
And really important that
he preserved that tradition.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.440 align:middle line:10%
I also have, as
incredulous as it sounds,

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.850 align:middle line:10%
my own whistleblower.

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:04.840 align:middle line:10%
Somebody who informed me where
I should look, where I should

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.720 align:middle line:10%
think to excavate.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.980 align:middle line:10%
And has told me
numerous stories,

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.410 align:middle line:10%
absolutely detailed
and fascinating

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:18.370 align:middle line:10%
about the Inner Earth in England
and things his parents showed

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:22.870 align:middle line:10%
him and took him to, and what he
saw when he went into that barn

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.790 align:middle line:10%
with the car, and
the car went down

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:27.730 align:middle line:10%
a hydraulic lift 100 meters
into the ground, and it came out

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:30.220 align:middle line:10%
and he saw a huge crystal the
size of a football pitch that

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:33.010 align:middle line:10%
was shaped like the
continents on Earth,

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:34.930 align:middle line:10%
except it had a
continent off of Ireland

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.660 align:middle line:10%
that doesn't exist today, and
all kinds of stories like that.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.250 align:middle line:90%


00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.940 align:middle line:84%
He's also validated to
me that he's authentic.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.190 align:middle line:90%
But we have fallen out.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:49.490 align:middle line:84%
This is somebody who's
actually threatened

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:53.300 align:middle line:84%
to have me whacked if I
talk about it, in his words.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.950 align:middle line:90%
So I said, no, thank you.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:56.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to continue
that relationship.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.190 align:middle line:90%
It's been nice knowing you.

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:00.420 align:middle line:84%
But these whistleblowers
are out there.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.290 align:middle line:10%
Another one is a
Polish scientist,

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:05.900 align:middle line:10%
Ferdinand Ossendowski.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:10.610 align:middle line:10%
And what he has to say,
his source tells him

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:15.080 align:middle line:10%
that in 1890, the
ruler of the world,

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.630 align:middle line:10%
the ruler of the Inner
Earth from our Agharta,

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.750 align:middle line:10%
visits the Tibetan Lamas
and tells them, listen,

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.450 align:middle line:10%
you're going to have
50 years of strife.

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:24.980 align:middle line:10%
Well, there's two world wars.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:29.540 align:middle line:10%
It's going to be followed by 71
years and three great kingdoms.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.210 align:middle line:10%
That takes you to 2012.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:35.390 align:middle line:10%
But then you're going
to have 18 years of war

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:38.710 align:middle line:10%
before we come back
and bail you out.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:43.690 align:middle line:10%
Now, some people believe
we're in that war right now.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:49.100 align:middle line:10%
And not just a war of countries,
a war of good and evil.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.670 align:middle line:10%
I won't dwell on
that, but I think

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.700 align:middle line:10%
that is what he's referring to.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:59.080 align:middle line:10%
And we have Edward
Bulwer-Lytton who

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:03.280 align:middle line:10%
is also a figure of a
really great renown.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:07.300 align:middle line:10%
And he writes a story that
some people think is fiction.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.350 align:middle line:10%
Other people think
it's a true story.

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:10.150 align:middle line:10%
It's two miners.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.820 align:middle line:10%
One, in particular, is obsessed
with this luminous light

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.530 align:middle line:10%
at the bottom of his mind.

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:17.890 align:middle line:10%
So he creates this sort
of makeshift dumbwaiter

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:19.750 align:middle line:10%
that lowers him down.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.790 align:middle line:10%
The whole gizmo
falls and collapses.

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.260 align:middle line:10%
And boom, he's in
the Inner Earth.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.390 align:middle line:10%
And there's all kinds
of strange stuff.

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:28.820 align:middle line:10%
There's craft, there's tall
people, there's virile energy.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.550 align:middle line:10%
Everyone's just a
little bit different.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.590 align:middle line:10%
It's very, very idyllic.

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:36.310 align:middle line:10%
And it's an Aryan race
that would inspire Hitler

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:40.248 align:middle line:10%
when he writes "Mein Kampf."

00:15:40.248 --> 00:15:41.290 align:middle line:10%
Then we have Jules Verne.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:43.240 align:middle line:10%
People don't think Jules
Verne's an initiate.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.040 align:middle line:10%
Oh my gosh.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.820 align:middle line:10%
Go back and look at Jules Verne.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.310 align:middle line:10%
This man gets no credit at all.

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:51.480 align:middle line:10%
If you're into the Dan Brown,
"The Da Vinci Code," then you

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.752 align:middle line:10%
know that the mystery
of the Rennes-le-Chateau

00:15:53.752 --> 00:15:55.210 align:middle line:10%
in the South of
France was probably

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:56.650 align:middle line:10%
the inspiration for that.

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:59.740 align:middle line:10%
And just for example, so
many important place names

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.080 align:middle line:10%
in that mystery
are character names

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.300 align:middle line:10%
in the Jules Verne novels.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:09.370 align:middle line:10%
So he's infusing information
for people who have eyes to see.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:12.670 align:middle line:10%
And in "Journey to the
Centre of the Earth,"

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.410 align:middle line:10%
he's talking about
incredible things,

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.780 align:middle line:10%
where the protagonist
go down a volcano

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:20.590 align:middle line:10%
in the north of Greenland.

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:22.360 align:middle line:10%
And what's north of that?

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.070 align:middle line:10%
Well, the North Pole.

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.720 align:middle line:10%
And they come up
with another volcano.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.053 align:middle line:10%
And while they're down there
in the center of the Earth,

00:16:28.053 --> 00:16:29.950 align:middle line:10%
they see amazing things,
including a mammoth.

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:33.140 align:middle line:10%
And we'll come back to
that a little bit later.

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.240 align:middle line:10%
So there's a little
bit about the mythology

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.040 align:middle line:10%
of the Inner Earth.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.260 align:middle line:10%
Some examples of it,
some whistleblowers,

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.690 align:middle line:10%
my own whistleblower.

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:43.960 align:middle line:10%
But what do real
men of science have

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.110 align:middle line:10%
to say about this notion of
people living inside the Earth?

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:48.840 align:middle line:10%
Well, let's start
with Edmund Halley.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.590 align:middle line:10%
I mean, if there was
anyone more credible,

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.300 align:middle line:10%
they named a comet
after him, right?

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.970 align:middle line:10%
He talks about these
multiple spheres.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:57.370 align:middle line:10%
And these spheres are
moving at different speeds

00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:01.430 align:middle line:10%
inside the Earth, and
that they're luminous.

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:04.280 align:middle line:10%
And they are probably inhabited.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:08.599 align:middle line:10%
An aurora borealis is
escaping from these entrances.

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:11.609 align:middle line:84%
He's followed by
Euler, who says, well,

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:13.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about these
concentric circles.

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:19.800 align:middle line:84%
But I do know there's an
inner sun inside the Earth.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:24.329 align:middle line:84%
Is that a reference
to the Black Sun?

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:26.760 align:middle line:10%
Then we have
Friedrich Gauss who is

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.380 align:middle line:10%
a really interesting character.

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.840 align:middle line:10%
And he begins this
sort of process of,

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:35.550 align:middle line:10%
the entrance to the Inner
Earth is at the poles.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:38.070 align:middle line:10%
And he gets that party started.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:39.750 align:middle line:10%
And others join in.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.510 align:middle line:10%
John Cleves Symmes,
who's not a scientist,

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:44.257 align:middle line:10%
but he's a real enthusiast.

00:17:44.257 --> 00:17:46.340 align:middle line:10%
And he uses the information
of the scientists that

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:51.880 align:middle line:10%
have preceded him to
develop a theory that yes,

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.290 align:middle line:10%
the entrances to the Inner
Earth are at the poles.

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:59.920 align:middle line:84%
But they are so big, so
gargantuan that if you

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.690 align:middle line:84%
enter them, you're
not going to go, boom.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:02.620 align:middle line:90%
Oh, this is weird.

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.100 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a real gradual
process of understanding, well,

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.962 align:middle line:90%
the sky is starting to invert.

00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:09.920 align:middle line:10%
There was snow and ice
back there a moment ago,

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:10.878 align:middle line:10%
and now it's all green.

00:18:10.878 --> 00:18:12.200 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.850 align:middle line:84%
So this is going to become
a real common observation

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:21.310 align:middle line:84%
in the expeditions
that would follow.

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And one of those expeditions,
he wanted to do himself.

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:25.720 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't quite get it funded.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:31.990 align:middle line:84%
But years later, a chap
who is really unknown--

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:33.970 align:middle line:84%
here, he's called
Captain Seaborn.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:37.570 align:middle line:84%
But that's a pseudonym for an
author whose identity is still

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:38.410 align:middle line:90%
debated.

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:40.780 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, they
have an expedition.

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:45.760 align:middle line:84%
They go into one of these
great, huge openings.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, we don't
have time to cover it today.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.270 align:middle line:84%
But google the
images of the poles

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:54.100 align:middle line:90%
before they became redacted.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Look at NASA, ESA, the
Russian Mir missions.

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Look at the poles
before they became

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.730 align:middle line:84%
redacted with all white
nondescript coloring.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.380 align:middle line:90%
They're wide open.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this
guy said they found.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And gradually, everything
looked different slowly, slowly.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And they met a civilization
that they believed-- well,

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:23.800 align:middle line:84%
that claim to be
rulers of the world.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.775 align:middle line:84%
But it's this guy that
really got me thinking.

00:19:27.775 --> 00:19:30.500 align:middle line:90%


00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:35.660 align:middle line:84%
He gets discredited because
he's a bit of a cult leader.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And he creates a
commune in Florida.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And they believe a lot
of interesting things.

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:46.650 align:middle line:84%
But none more
interesting than this.

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:51.030 align:middle line:84%
I'll read it to you, and
then I'll come back to it

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:52.290 align:middle line:90%
in about a half hour.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And you tell me if it resonates
then more than it does now.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:00.060 align:middle line:84%
"To know of the
Earth's concavity

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:05.870 align:middle line:84%
and its relation to Universal
form, is to know God.

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:09.290 align:middle line:84%
But to believe in the
Earth's convexity--

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:13.100 align:middle line:84%
that is living on the
Earth's outside surface--

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.590 align:middle line:90%
is to deny God."

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.420 align:middle line:90%
Strong words.

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:18.890 align:middle line:90%
Quite articulate as well.

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:21.760 align:middle line:90%


00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:27.060 align:middle line:10%
So we'll pivot off of
that evocative statement

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:31.440 align:middle line:10%
to now turn and say, OK,
that was the Inner Earth.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.710 align:middle line:10%
The concepts, a few
examples of them,

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:37.170 align:middle line:10%
all countries have stories about
them, scientists support it,

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:41.060 align:middle line:10%
whistleblowers support it.

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:41.860 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.330 align:middle line:10%
You're kind of persuading me.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:48.320 align:middle line:10%
I can maybe believe that there
is life beneath our planet.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.850 align:middle line:10%
But how could we possibly
also be on the inside?

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:53.770 align:middle line:10%
And to begin to
comprehend that, we're

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.110 align:middle line:10%
going to have to talk
about the firmament.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.820 align:middle line:84%
So an introduction
to the firmament

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:03.190 align:middle line:84%
starting with the Latin word
firmamentum, meaning a firm

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:04.710 align:middle line:90%
object.

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is written
about, extensively,

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:10.680 align:middle line:90%
in biblical theology.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And on the second
day of creation,

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:16.710 align:middle line:90%
God created the firmament.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:21.660 align:middle line:84%
Picture a snow globe
going over the Earth,

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.810 align:middle line:84%
created the
firmament to separate

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:33.360 align:middle line:84%
the waters in the abyss with
a water-based structure that

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:38.010 align:middle line:84%
allows us to have dry
land and some water.

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:39.810 align:middle line:10%
And if that sounds
weird, then let's

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:41.790 align:middle line:10%
just take a look at
where that comes from.

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:45.660 align:middle line:10%
Here's the Geneva 1599
Bible before it really

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:48.360 align:middle line:10%
started to get edited.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:52.500 align:middle line:10%
And here, you can see where
the references to the firmament

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.760 align:middle line:10%
come from.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.650 align:middle line:10%
They're quite explicit.

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:57.772 align:middle line:10%
"Again, God said, let
there be a firmament

00:21:57.772 --> 00:21:59.730 align:middle line:10%
in the midst of the
waters, and let it separate

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:01.710 align:middle line:10%
the waters from the waters."

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:05.250 align:middle line:84%
"And God called the
firmament Heaven."

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And God said, let there be
a moon, a sun, and the stars

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:13.980 align:middle line:90%
inside the firmament.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:17.040 align:middle line:90%


00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:22.300 align:middle line:10%
Early Hebrew has
the same concept.

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.950 align:middle line:10%
The Raqia.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:28.030 align:middle line:10%
It is, again, a
water-based structure

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:30.100 align:middle line:10%
that encloses the Earth.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.450 align:middle line:10%
Does it touch the Earth?

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:32.830 align:middle line:90%
Does it come close to it?

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:35.960 align:middle line:90%


00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:42.170 align:middle line:10%
And the water that goes
all around it, the Tehom,

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:44.430 align:middle line:10%
is still there.

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:49.740 align:middle line:10%
But we're insulated from it just
like the worlds beneath ours

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:54.810 align:middle line:10%
are insulated from
where we live.

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:59.190 align:middle line:84%
The Quran mentions the
firmament nine times.

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And there are seven
levels of the firmament

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.775 align:middle line:84%
just like there were
seven days of creation.

00:23:05.775 --> 00:23:10.220 align:middle line:90%


00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.720 align:middle line:10%
We're going to stop for a moment
and talk about the Red Mini

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:13.520 align:middle line:10%
Syndrome.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.830 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if you know what
the Red Mini Syndrome is,

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:17.780 align:middle line:10%
but if you have a
friend and they say,

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:19.310 align:middle line:10%
oh, look at that
Red Mini Cooper.

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.925 align:middle line:10%
Isn't that amazing?

00:23:19.925 --> 00:23:20.960 align:middle line:10%
And then I say, yeah, I know.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:21.380 align:middle line:10%
I love them.

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:22.797 align:middle line:10%
I'm too tall, I
can't fit in them.

00:23:22.797 --> 00:23:24.770 align:middle line:10%
But it's a great car.

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:27.530 align:middle line:10%
My attention has been
focused on the Red Mini.

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:30.320 align:middle line:10%
And now, guess what I'm
going to see about 10 times

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.490 align:middle line:10%
in the next 24 hours?

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:33.290 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to see Red
Minis everywhere.

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:35.580 align:middle line:10%
And it's not
necessarily a bad thing.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.730 align:middle line:10%
But what you're doing
is allowing your senses

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:40.280 align:middle line:10%
to focus on something
that was always there

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.960 align:middle line:10%
but you weren't really
conscious of it.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:46.070 align:middle line:84%
So with the Red Mini
Syndrome in mind,

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
toss some ideas out.

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:50.250 align:middle line:84%
They might be right,
they might be wrong.

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:52.910 align:middle line:90%
I don't have the answers.

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:53.968 align:middle line:90%
The Nebra Sky Disk.

00:23:53.968 --> 00:23:56.260 align:middle line:10%
I had the pleasure of seeing
that at the British Museum

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:57.310 align:middle line:10%
recently.

00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:00.040 align:middle line:10%
If its Bronze Age
dating is correct,

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:04.890 align:middle line:10%
then it's the oldest
depiction of the cosmos ever.

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:09.330 align:middle line:10%
And it has been enhanced
over time intentionally.

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:14.280 align:middle line:10%
And I have to wonder if that
enhancement has also included

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.810 align:middle line:10%
the removal of that arc.

00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:17.670 align:middle line:10%
Because there's holes
around the end of it

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:21.900 align:middle line:10%
that indicate there should be at
least a half dome going around,

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:25.740 align:middle line:10%
if not a full dome,
with stars and moons

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.570 align:middle line:10%
and planets beneath it.

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:31.530 align:middle line:10%
So does the Nebra Sky Disk
represent the firmament?

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:33.280 align:middle line:90%
It might.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:37.690 align:middle line:84%
The Enuma Elis, the Mesopotamian
source for all things

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:41.810 align:middle line:90%
cosmological, 1750 BCE.

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's very similar
into the early Hebrew text

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:47.320 align:middle line:90%
and into Genesis.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.840 align:middle line:84%
It talks about the watery
abyss and different levels

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.340 align:middle line:90%
of separation of water.

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And there's seven
tablets just like there's

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:55.150 align:middle line:84%
seven levels of the
firmament in the Quran

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:58.090 align:middle line:84%
and seven days of
creation in Genesis.

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Very, very interesting
similarities.

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:04.440 align:middle line:10%
And the Book of Job.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.590 align:middle line:10%
Again, we're starting
ancient and coming back

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:08.760 align:middle line:10%
a little bit more current.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:12.990 align:middle line:10%
But this is also the
fifth, sixth century BCE.

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:17.100 align:middle line:10%
"Can you join him in
spreading out the skies, hard

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:21.620 align:middle line:10%
as a mirror of cast bronze?"

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:27.210 align:middle line:10%
Could that refer to the
firmament, the snow globe

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:30.900 align:middle line:10%
structure that protects
our level of the Earth

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.900 align:middle line:10%
from whatever is beyond us?

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.150 align:middle line:10%
Sounds like it.

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:39.810 align:middle line:10%
The Babylonian world map.

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.790 align:middle line:10%
Also, every time I go
to the British Museum,

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:44.760 align:middle line:10%
I just stare at this and
I'm just mesmerized by it.

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:47.040 align:middle line:10%
But now, with that
Red Mini Syndrome,

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.870 align:middle line:10%
I'm thinking, look at the
way you're portraying things.

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:52.200 align:middle line:10%
I know it's a Euphrates-centric
view of the world

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:56.490 align:middle line:10%
that you've portrayed here, but
the text that go along with it

00:25:56.490 --> 00:26:00.840 align:middle line:10%
talk about the creation of Earth
and the separation of the water

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.410 align:middle line:10%
from the waters.

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:06.380 align:middle line:10%
And it shows explicitly
that Euphrates.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.690 align:middle line:10%
And the god of the Euphrates.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:13.070 align:middle line:10%
And we know from works of Dr.
Temple in "The Sirius Mystery"

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:16.430 align:middle line:10%
that so many of the
gods in Mesopotamia

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:21.200 align:middle line:10%
were either sages who wore
these kind of fish-like regalia

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:26.000 align:middle line:10%
or were, allegedly,
real amphibious beings.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.820 align:middle line:10%
And what make
sense, if the people

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.530 align:middle line:10%
who have created our world--

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:33.470 align:middle line:10%
imagine we live in a
greenhouse, and the people who

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:36.575 align:middle line:10%
created it are a little
bit different from us.

00:26:36.575 --> 00:26:39.480 align:middle line:10%


00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.510 align:middle line:10%
Then we have the Book of Enoch.

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:46.150 align:middle line:10%
This incredible book that talks
about the giants, the Nephilim.

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:49.220 align:middle line:10%
It talks about why
there are fallen angels

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:52.730 align:middle line:10%
and why, morally, a
flood was required.

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:54.920 align:middle line:10%
And it was written
down about 300 BCE.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:58.760 align:middle line:10%
And Enoch, of course, is the
great grandfather of Noah.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.650 align:middle line:10%
And we look in
the Book of Enoch.

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:04.100 align:middle line:10%
And he talks, surprisingly,
about the firmament.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.300 align:middle line:10%
But he says some things
that are really interesting.

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.080 align:middle line:10%
He says, "I see the
treasures of all the winds.

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:13.610 align:middle line:10%
I saw how He had furnished
them with the whole of creation

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:16.100 align:middle line:10%
and the firm boundaries
of the Earth.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.290 align:middle line:10%
And I saw the
corner-stone of the Earth.

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:20.750 align:middle line:10%
And I saw the four
winds which bear

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:24.840 align:middle line:10%
the firmament of the heaven."

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:28.720 align:middle line:10%
"I saw, at the end of the Earth,
the firmament of the heaven

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.520 align:middle line:10%
above."

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:35.100 align:middle line:10%
So did Enoch stand
in front of the spot

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:40.410 align:middle line:10%
where the snow globe hits Earth?

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:44.170 align:middle line:10%
Sounds like it, doesn't it?

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:45.610 align:middle line:10%
And the astrolabes.

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:47.620 align:middle line:10%
Again, moving from
really ancient times

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.660 align:middle line:10%
to more modern times.

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:53.320 align:middle line:10%
These hand-held
astronomical devices.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.270 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if this
is correct or not,

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:58.320 align:middle line:10%
but I do know when
I look at it now,

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:02.280 align:middle line:10%
with an understanding of
the firmament, that they

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.610 align:middle line:10%
could represent a
knowledge of its existence.

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:08.280 align:middle line:10%


00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:12.390 align:middle line:10%
For a long time, I wanted
to really understand

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:13.710 align:middle line:10%
the mysteries of Freemasonry.

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:14.910 align:middle line:10%
So I joined Freemasonry.

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:15.870 align:middle line:10%
I became a Freemason.

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:17.198 align:middle line:10%
I'm no longer a Freemason.

00:28:17.198 --> 00:28:18.990 align:middle line:10%
I'm here to tell you,
they're not bad guys.

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:22.490 align:middle line:10%
Don't believe everything
you read in the books.

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:25.550 align:middle line:10%
But I was obsessed
with their symbolism.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:27.680 align:middle line:10%
Here, we see a
tracing board showing

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.130 align:middle line:10%
the cosmos, the sun and
the moon and the stars

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:32.660 align:middle line:10%
in a checkerboard.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:36.800 align:middle line:10%
Now, the Inner Earth initiates--
and we'll cover this more

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.100 align:middle line:10%
in a few minutes--

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:41.870 align:middle line:10%
talk about the Earth being
covered like a checkerboard

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:46.310 align:middle line:10%
full of chambers, holding the
history of arts and sciences

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:49.900 align:middle line:10%
from hundreds of
thousands of years

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:52.330 align:middle line:10%
that were preserved by the
people who went underground

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:53.890 align:middle line:10%
to preserve them.

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:56.810 align:middle line:10%
And they're going to give them
to us once the bad guys are out

00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:57.610 align:middle line:10%
of the way.

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:00.850 align:middle line:10%
That's kind of what
they're telling us.

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:05.890 align:middle line:10%
And I also, you may know,
have written a lot about bees.

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:08.320 align:middle line:10%
Now, I didn't intend
to write about bees.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:12.730 align:middle line:10%
But I studied with a
cabalist in Catalan

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:15.400 align:middle line:10%
who worked for Salvador
Dali and Jean Cocteau.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And she said, just use
the source material.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
allow you to google.

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:24.340 align:middle line:84%
So for three years, we studied
the esoteric history of bees.

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And at the end, when I
went to write about it,

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.210 align:middle line:90%
I googled a little bit.

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was amazed that all
these incredible conclusions

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:35.990 align:middle line:84%
I had come to, other
people had as well.

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.790 align:middle line:90%
Some of it.

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:38.780 align:middle line:90%
But I came to it organically.

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:42.310 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm about to show you,
I thought I had discovered.

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:44.360 align:middle line:84%
But actually, others have
come into this as well.

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And it makes me feel
good because it just

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:49.300 align:middle line:84%
validates that other people
are seeing what I see.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:53.370 align:middle line:10%
But if you look at
some of the symbolism,

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:57.420 align:middle line:10%
particularly on the
regalia, the apron.

00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:03.150 align:middle line:10%
You have what appears to be
an inverted dome structure.

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:08.150 align:middle line:10%
And beneath it, the sun and
the moon and the planets.

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:12.290 align:middle line:10%
You have two columns, which
Freemasonry will tell you is

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:15.320 align:middle line:10%
Boaz and Jachin,
but what if that's--

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:18.950 align:middle line:10%
I don't know-- North
Pole and South Pole?

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:23.030 align:middle line:10%
And that checkerboard floor
that the Inner Earth mythology

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:26.150 align:middle line:10%
tells us represents the
preservation of the histories

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:28.940 align:middle line:10%
of arts and sciences.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:34.700 align:middle line:10%
And of course, the all-seeing
eye looking down upon it.

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:37.870 align:middle line:10%
So could Earth be
like a snow globe?

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:41.800 align:middle line:10%
I know that sounds
ridiculous, right?

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:46.330 align:middle line:10%
But all the ancient
cultures believed it.

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:49.390 align:middle line:10%
Why aren't we taught this?

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:50.860 align:middle line:10%
Look at the Egyptian.

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.620 align:middle line:10%
I've just skipped over the
whole Egyptian creation myth.

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:55.720 align:middle line:10%
It's exactly the same,
right, as all the ones

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:56.560 align:middle line:10%
we've talked about.

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.620 align:middle line:10%
But look at the goddess
Nut, the goddess of the sky.

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:03.400 align:middle line:10%
Look at the position in the
lower left of what she's doing.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:07.000 align:middle line:10%
She's representing
protection of Earth.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.170 align:middle line:10%
She is the snow globe.

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:10.830 align:middle line:10%


00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:12.075 align:middle line:10%
We're living on the inside.

00:31:12.075 --> 00:31:15.000 align:middle line:10%


00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.390 align:middle line:10%
Or is that just
a bit of fantasy?

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:19.550 align:middle line:10%
So in the modern era now.

00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:22.050 align:middle line:10%
Let's come up to
speed, up to date.

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:26.003 align:middle line:10%
What are the operations, and
who are the operators who

00:31:26.003 --> 00:31:27.170 align:middle line:10%
are exploring the firmament?

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:30.590 align:middle line:10%
Because I would really
expect that people

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:34.220 align:middle line:10%
like NASA, other
scientists, they

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:37.670 align:middle line:10%
would know about this, right?

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:42.890 align:middle line:10%
These declassified
documents are gold dust.

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:48.140 align:middle line:10%
They were declassified in 2000
to show the Russian mindset

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.670 align:middle line:10%
during the Cold War.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:53.780 align:middle line:10%
And they're all about
all kinds of projects

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:57.110 align:middle line:10%
the Russians have with nuclear
weapons and this and that.

00:31:57.110 --> 00:32:01.040 align:middle line:10%
And embedded in
all those pages are

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:05.690 align:middle line:10%
obscure references, but real
references, to the firmament.

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:09.750 align:middle line:10%
And they probably never expected
anybody to pick up on it.

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:13.970 align:middle line:10%
And in this case, we're looking
at measuring the brightness

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:15.260 align:middle line:10%
of the firmament.

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:19.970 align:middle line:10%
And this is sort of 1960, 1961.

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:23.990 align:middle line:10%
But the events that are being
described occurred in the past.

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:26.900 align:middle line:10%
Here, they're talking
about the color temperature

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:27.770 align:middle line:10%
of the firmament.

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:29.450 align:middle line:10%
They're calling it by name.

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:31.070 align:middle line:10%
It's a physical thing.

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:33.200 align:middle line:10%
They're studying it.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Here, we have proof of a camera
that can measure and photograph

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:41.060 align:middle line:84%
the firmament down
to the horizon

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:45.000 align:middle line:84%
just like Enoch
was talking about.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.480 align:middle line:10%
So have they been
somewhere where the snow

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:50.150 align:middle line:10%
globe meets and touches Earth?

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:51.680 align:middle line:10%
And have they photographed that?

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.080 align:middle line:10%
Sounds like it.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:59.960 align:middle line:84%
Then we have evidence of echoes
and glows in the firmament.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:04.940 align:middle line:10%
Some heavy duty analysis
for the late 1950s.

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:13.110 align:middle line:10%
Naval contents page of a manual
that talks about the firmament.

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:17.460 align:middle line:10%
And declassified
documents that talk

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:22.310 align:middle line:10%
about how the Earth is
stationary and the sun

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:24.650 align:middle line:10%
and the moon and the
planets are moving.

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:27.275 align:middle line:10%
Just the opposite of
what we've been told.

00:33:27.275 --> 00:33:30.840 align:middle line:90%


00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:34.230 align:middle line:84%
So if that's the
late '50s, what would

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:39.000 align:middle line:84%
have prompted the world
to discover the firmament

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.320 align:middle line:90%
and want to study it?

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have the
amazing Admiral Byrd.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:50.580 align:middle line:84%
One of the most highly
medalled and honored American

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:52.440 align:middle line:90%
military individuals.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And in Operation Highjump in
1946 and 1947, man, oh man,

00:33:56.970 --> 00:34:00.810 align:middle line:84%
4,000 people on the
team, ships and airplanes

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:03.150 align:middle line:84%
and infrastructure like
you wouldn't believe

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:07.820 align:middle line:90%
to go to the Antarctica.

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:09.290 align:middle line:90%
And what does he say?

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:12.210 align:middle line:90%
I think this is so interesting.

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:14.810 align:middle line:84%
He does two things right
after Operation Highjump.

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:16.790 align:middle line:84%
He does an interview
that says, we

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:19.489 align:middle line:84%
need to be really
concerned about craft

00:34:19.489 --> 00:34:22.977 align:middle line:84%
coming from both poles, because
we can't handle this stuff.

00:34:22.977 --> 00:34:24.560 align:middle line:84%
We don't have that
kind of technology.

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And they shut him right
down for saying that.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.580 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is
he said, I can't

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:32.090 align:middle line:84%
believe the incredible speed at
which the world is shrinking.

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:34.824 align:middle line:90%


00:34:34.824 --> 00:34:36.199 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's ever
thought about that.

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:38.270 align:middle line:90%
What did he mean?

00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:39.670 align:middle line:90%
What did he mean?

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Could he mean the
firmament is getting

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:51.130 align:middle line:90%
thinner or lower or smaller?

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:54.020 align:middle line:84%
A lot of talk about
global warming.

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Some people believe
in it, some don't.

00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:00.660 align:middle line:90%
But who does it serve?

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that the
references to global warming

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:06.720 align:middle line:84%
are a reference to
what Byrd was observing

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.685 align:middle line:90%
about the world getting smaller?

00:35:08.685 --> 00:35:11.382 align:middle line:90%


00:35:11.382 --> 00:35:13.840 align:middle line:10%
Byrd knew that he wouldn't be
able to talk about the things

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.700 align:middle line:10%
that he saw in
Operation Highjump.

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:17.200 align:middle line:10%
So he kept a secret diary.

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.320 align:middle line:10%
And that secret diary only
came out decades later

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.790 align:middle line:10%
after his death.

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:24.220 align:middle line:10%
And he's in his plane.

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:27.580 align:middle line:10%
As ice and snow below him, and
all of a sudden, there isn't.

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:31.150 align:middle line:10%
Just like Symmes and
Friedrich Gauss said.

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:35.890 align:middle line:10%
A slow, gradual entrance
into another world.

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:36.850 align:middle line:10%
And what's that?

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:39.730 align:middle line:10%
It's a mammoth down below just
like Jules Verne was talking

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:42.670 align:middle line:10%
about many years before.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:47.020 align:middle line:10%
And then, craft with swastikas
on them, ancient sacred symbol,

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:50.050 align:middle line:10%
come right next to his
plane, take over the controls

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:51.700 align:middle line:10%
of his plane, land his plane.

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:54.160 align:middle line:10%
And he meets the ruler
of the Inner Earth,

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:58.930 align:middle line:10%
in this region, who says, we are
here, my son, waiting for you.

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:01.880 align:middle line:10%
And we see, at a great distance,
the ruins of your world.

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:02.680 align:middle line:10%
But don't worry.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:04.347 align:middle line:10%
We have the history
of arts and sciences

00:36:04.347 --> 00:36:06.130 align:middle line:10%
and free technologies--

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:08.500 align:middle line:10%
free energies to help you.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:10.450 align:middle line:10%
When you're ready,
we will be here.

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:13.380 align:middle line:10%


00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.940 align:middle line:10%
And then, his last entry.

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:20.160 align:middle line:10%
"I have seen that land
beyond the pole, that center

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.150 align:middle line:10%
of the great unknown."

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:25.090 align:middle line:10%
Was he talking about what's
beyond the Arctic Circle?

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:26.140 align:middle line:10%
You can google him.

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:28.390 align:middle line:10%
There's interviews on him
on YouTube that are amazing.

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:32.080 align:middle line:10%
He's talking about a continent
larger than the United States,

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:36.040 align:middle line:10%
beyond our world, that's
never been explored.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.650 align:middle line:10%
Or is he talking
about the firmament?

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:42.290 align:middle line:10%
Because he is in Antarctica.

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:46.320 align:middle line:10%
And is Antarctica one of the
pillars in the Freemasonry

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.120 align:middle line:10%
regalia?

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:53.030 align:middle line:10%
Is that one of the places where
the snow globe touches Earth?

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Contemporaries with
Byrd is James Van Allen.

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And we all know about the
Van Allen Belt, right?

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:01.580 align:middle line:84%
This whole radiation area,
it's really difficult,

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:02.900 align:middle line:90%
it's full of live debris.

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And to get a spaceship
past it is very difficult.

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:06.860 align:middle line:90%
That's what we've been taught.

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:09.560 align:middle line:10%
This guy was sending
up balloons that

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:13.670 align:middle line:10%
would launch rockets up into
the air and create explosions.

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And the military said, hey,
that sounds pretty cool.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.190 align:middle line:90%
Come work for us.

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:19.310 align:middle line:84%
We have this thing
called Operation Dominic.

00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:22.730 align:middle line:10%
And part of Operation Dominic
is Operation Fishbowl.

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:24.800 align:middle line:10%
I mean, just the
name of it implies

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.450 align:middle line:10%
a firmament-like structure.

00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:27.720 align:middle line:10%
And what are they doing?

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.440 align:middle line:10%
They're setting
off nuclear bombs--

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:35.680 align:middle line:10%
nuclear bombs-- at the
highest end of the atmosphere.

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:39.540 align:middle line:10%
Why would you do that
if you weren't trying

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.370 align:middle line:10%
to blow a hole into something?

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:44.740 align:middle line:90%


00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:47.170 align:middle line:10%
And of course, President Nixon.

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:48.520 align:middle line:10%
I'm from Chicago.

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:53.030 align:middle line:10%
I can't Skype back home without
all kinds of static and losing

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.830 align:middle line:10%
my connection.

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:59.150 align:middle line:10%
But Nixon was able
to phone the moon

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:05.840 align:middle line:10%
and speak clearly while he had
a photograph of Earth taken

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:09.920 align:middle line:10%
from the moon in his office.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.810 align:middle line:10%
And he spoke to the astronauts.

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:16.790 align:middle line:10%
Astronauts that would later
have stars on the Hollywood

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:17.680 align:middle line:10%
Walk of Fame.

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:18.480 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:21.050 align:middle line:10%


00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:24.990 align:middle line:10%
I think you'd have to ask
Francis Ford Coppola that.

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:28.560 align:middle line:10%
I think you'd have to
ask Stanley Kubrick that.

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:33.860 align:middle line:10%
When Stanley Kubrick
had just finished "2001,

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:37.490 align:middle line:10%
A Space Odyssey" in 1968.

00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:40.280 align:middle line:10%
There's photos of
him, after the film

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:43.430 align:middle line:10%
was released, walking with
the executives of NASA

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:45.380 align:middle line:10%
like the "Reservoir Dogs."

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:48.065 align:middle line:10%
The next year, the
US goes to the moon.

00:38:48.065 --> 00:38:50.650 align:middle line:10%


00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:55.160 align:middle line:10%
We could ask Kubrick if he
filmed the moon landing.

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:59.180 align:middle line:10%
But after he released "Eyes Wide
Shut," and the director's cut

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:06.020 align:middle line:10%
just revealed a little too much
about what that cabal gets on

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:07.400 align:middle line:10%
with.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:11.760 align:middle line:10%
And he was dead
shortly thereafter.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:18.060 align:middle line:10%
Obama, in 2010, says, oh,
we're going to invest in NASA

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:19.350 align:middle line:10%
and rejuvenate it.

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:23.410 align:middle line:10%
Because the goal is to
get past low-Earth orbit.

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:27.660 align:middle line:10%
We need to find a way
to get to the moon.

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:30.960 align:middle line:10%
I thought you already did that.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:35.280 align:middle line:10%
Low-Earth orbit,
the Van Allen Belt.

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:41.800 align:middle line:10%
It's some physical element that
NASA, with all its trillions,

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.590 align:middle line:10%
can't figure out
a way to get past,

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:50.553 align:middle line:10%
even though it did it
between 1969 and 1972.

00:39:50.553 --> 00:39:51.970 align:middle line:10%
Does that make
sense to you, guys?

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:56.220 align:middle line:90%


00:39:56.220 --> 00:40:00.780 align:middle line:84%
Bill Nye has a science show
in the United States funded

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:03.450 align:middle line:90%
by National Science Foundation.

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Very well-respected,
lot of degrees.

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:10.230 align:middle line:90%
What does he have to say?

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:13.620 align:middle line:90%
"The Earth is a closed system.

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:15.690 align:middle line:90%
We cannot leave the Earth.

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:17.925 align:middle line:90%
There is no place to go."

00:40:17.925 --> 00:40:21.710 align:middle line:90%


00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's no place
to go, then we're inside.

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:27.170 align:middle line:90%


00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:31.700 align:middle line:10%
NASA gets formed with
the guidance of a charter

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:35.210 align:middle line:10%
to provide for research
into problems of light

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:37.230 align:middle line:10%
within the outside of
the Earth's atmosphere,

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:38.490 align:middle line:10%
and for further purposes.

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:42.220 align:middle line:90%


00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:45.640 align:middle line:90%
They hire Wernher von Braun.

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're all familiar
with Operation Paperclip.

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:49.750 align:middle line:90%
If you're not, just google it.

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:52.840 align:middle line:84%
That's how all the great German
thought leaders and scientists

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:57.070 align:middle line:84%
were incorporated into the
American programs such as NASA.

00:40:57.070 --> 00:41:02.080 align:middle line:84%
So he is the "Father
of Rocket Science."

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:06.370 align:middle line:90%
He lives into the '70s.

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:10.760 align:middle line:84%
So man's already been
to the moon, allegedly.

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't he have a reference
to that on his tombstone as

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:18.110 align:middle line:90%
opposed to Psalm 19:1?

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:20.510 align:middle line:84%
"The heavens declare
the glory of God.

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And the firmament
shows his handiwork."

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:27.110 align:middle line:84%
He must have spend his
life trying to figure out

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:33.510 align:middle line:84%
how to get past that watery
snow globe that allegedly covers

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:36.180 align:middle line:90%
our planet.

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:39.450 align:middle line:10%
2004, civilians,
who aren't censored,

00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:41.910 align:middle line:10%
who have the
technology-- google this.

00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:43.780 align:middle line:10%
It's a fantastic video.

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:46.930 align:middle line:10%
It's on their website,
it's on YouTube.

00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:50.190 align:middle line:10%
You can see the rocket
going up 72 miles.

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:51.510 align:middle line:10%
It's got a camera on it.

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:53.640 align:middle line:10%
It's going, it's going,
it's going, it's going,

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:54.930 align:middle line:10%
then it hits something.

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:55.800 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't explode.

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:59.250 align:middle line:10%
It didn't hit something that
was totally like a brick wall.

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:01.380 align:middle line:10%
It hit something that was firm.

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:03.060 align:middle line:10%
And they couldn't wedge past it.

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:05.130 align:middle line:10%
And then, it falls down.

00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:06.420 align:middle line:10%
It's really interesting.

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:12.120 align:middle line:10%
And another, and aside, is,
there is a great television

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:16.650 align:middle line:10%
show Richard Attenborough
presented about the oceans.

00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:19.890 align:middle line:10%
And there's a guy who
manned a submarine.

00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:24.420 align:middle line:10%
And he's down as far down
in the ocean as you can go.

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:26.820 align:middle line:10%
And there was a sea of
mussels in front of him.

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:31.680 align:middle line:10%
And beyond the mussels,
they said was another ocean.

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.740 align:middle line:10%
And you could see this guy on
YouTube talking about this.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:37.230 align:middle line:10%
And he's so excited,
and he's so weirded out.

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:39.960 align:middle line:10%
He's like, we're in the ocean,
but there's another ocean.

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:43.260 align:middle line:10%
So I say, let's go over
and let's go in that ocean.

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:45.510 align:middle line:10%
So they bring the
submarine over there.

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:48.210 align:middle line:10%
But they can't penetrate it.

00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:52.680 align:middle line:10%
It's like it's some kind
of water-based something

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:57.060 align:middle line:10%
or other that is unpenetratable.

00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:02.090 align:middle line:10%
Sounds a lot like
what this rocket hit.

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:04.700 align:middle line:10%
So look at NASA's rockets.

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:07.340 align:middle line:10%
Why are they all arched?

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:09.680 align:middle line:10%
Aren't you going up?

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.900 align:middle line:10%
Why are rainbows arched?

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:17.510 align:middle line:10%
Why do the images of rockets,
at their highest atmosphere,

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:21.080 align:middle line:10%
look like a boat on the water?

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.450 align:middle line:10%
Could it be because they're
a rocket on the water?

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:27.990 align:middle line:90%


00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:29.650 align:middle line:10%
Couple more slides.

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:33.310 align:middle line:10%
Now, the Great Flood.

00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:34.570 align:middle line:10%
It's the Red Mini Syndrome.

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:36.862 align:middle line:10%
Now we need to think of it
differently, perhaps, right?

00:43:36.862 --> 00:43:39.880 align:middle line:10%
We need to think of the fact
that, could the flood, which

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:43.510 align:middle line:10%
was universal, every
part of the Earth

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:45.010 align:middle line:10%
experienced this
Great Flood, right?

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:50.890 align:middle line:10%
So did God, whoever that
is, open up the firmament

00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:53.680 align:middle line:10%
and let the waters in?

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:59.020 align:middle line:10%
Or because these so-called
craters, a lot of them

00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:01.500 align:middle line:10%
are filled with water.

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:05.680 align:middle line:10%
Vegetation as though the
water came from down below.

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:09.060 align:middle line:10%
Remember the image of the
early Hebrew cosmology.

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:12.180 align:middle line:84%
So now, we need to start
to ask these questions.

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I
call, respectfully,

00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:16.560 align:middle line:90%
"The Timeline of Deceit."

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:19.260 align:middle line:90%
We have Operation Highjump.

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:24.210 align:middle line:84%
So in 1946, they discover that
there's something in Antarctica

00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:28.230 align:middle line:90%
that is just spectacular.

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Admiral Byrd makes his
warning about craft coming

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:36.990 align:middle line:90%
from both poles in March 1947.

00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:45.670 align:middle line:84%
By July 1947, Roswell happens
just like Byrd warned.

00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Three weeks, only three
weeks after Roswell,

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:57.450 align:middle line:84%
we have the CIA and the
Department of Defense.

00:44:57.450 --> 00:44:59.310 align:middle line:90%
NASA's created.

00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:00.960 align:middle line:90%
The Antarctica Treaty.

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:04.410 align:middle line:84%
We can't agree on
trade, currency,

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:07.620 align:middle line:84%
what backs currency, languages,
we can't agree on anything

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:08.980 align:middle line:90%
except for one thing--

00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:12.540 align:middle line:84%
stay the heck away
from Antarctica.

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:14.520 align:middle line:90%
We'll shoot you down.

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:19.190 align:middle line:84%
All countries agree
to a no-go zone.

00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:20.945 align:middle line:90%
Wernher von Braun is hired.

00:45:20.945 --> 00:45:23.900 align:middle line:90%


00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:27.110 align:middle line:84%
The report that talks about the
photographing of the firmament

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:28.580 align:middle line:90%
comes out around this time.

00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:32.280 align:middle line:84%
But that work had been
done in the late '50s.

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Then we have James Van
Allen, the Van Allen Belt.

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:39.810 align:middle line:84%
But he's sending up balloons
with rockets on them

00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:41.670 align:middle line:84%
and doing nuclear
explosions trying

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:46.860 align:middle line:84%
to break through the thing that
keeps us glued to our planet.

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick directs "2001,
A Space Odyssey."

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:57.210 align:middle line:84%
The next year, they go to the
moon multiple times until 1972.

00:45:57.210 --> 00:46:02.260 align:middle line:84%
The civilians send
up a rocket, film it,

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:07.270 align:middle line:84%
it's available on the internet,
they hit something in 72 miles.

00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:08.440 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't explode.

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:09.460 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of soft.

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:11.500 align:middle line:90%
Then it just falls down.

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:15.430 align:middle line:84%
Obama expresses his desire,
as does NASA this year,

00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:17.830 align:middle line:84%
last year or the year
before, if we could only

00:46:17.830 --> 00:46:22.030 align:middle line:84%
find a way to get past low-Earth
orbit i.e. the firmament, that

00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:25.310 align:middle line:90%
would be amazing.

00:46:25.310 --> 00:46:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And I might be way out
in left field on this,

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:29.640 align:middle line:84%
but this talk of climate
change, I get it.

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:30.440 align:middle line:90%
I understand it.

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:31.982 align:middle line:84%
I'm not making a
political statement.

00:46:31.982 --> 00:46:34.140 align:middle line:90%
I don't have an opinion on it.

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:36.090 align:middle line:84%
But is it another way--
because sometimes they

00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:37.350 align:middle line:90%
don't tell us the full truth.

00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Is it another way of
talking about what

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Byrd was talking about when
he said, the incredible rate

00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.320 align:middle line:90%
the world is shrinking?

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Is the firmament getting
smaller, tinier, thinner?

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:48.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:51.525 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to toss
that one out there.

00:46:51.525 --> 00:46:57.210 align:middle line:84%
A quick return to our
friend Cyrus Teed.

00:46:57.210 --> 00:47:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And we'll ask the question,
did he get it right?

00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:02.310 align:middle line:84%
"To know of the
Earth's concavity,

00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:06.850 align:middle line:84%
and its relation to universal
form, is to know God.

00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:08.950 align:middle line:84%
But to believe in the
Earth's convexity, that

00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:14.020 align:middle line:84%
is living on the Earth's outside
surface, is to deny God."

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:17.890 align:middle line:84%
Because God, according to
everything we just reviewed,

00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:23.880 align:middle line:84%
created a snow globe so
that we could have life

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:27.580 align:middle line:90%
in our nice little greenhouse.

00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:29.870 align:middle line:10%
And they're telling us this.

00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:31.370 align:middle line:10%
They're telling
this to our face.

00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:32.240 align:middle line:10%
The Truman Show.

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:33.490 align:middle line:10%
Don't we love the Truman Show?

00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:35.090 align:middle line:10%
But what is that all about?

00:47:35.090 --> 00:47:38.990 align:middle line:10%
He wakes up and realizes
his world is not

00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:40.060 align:middle line:10%
what he thinks it is.

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:42.410 align:middle line:10%
And the skies are fake.

00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:47.540 align:middle line:10%
And he goes to the end and finds
the staircase, and he leaves.

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:50.390 align:middle line:10%
He finds the exit
of the firmament.

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:52.910 align:middle line:10%
I think that's what
they're trying to tell us.

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:56.690 align:middle line:10%
We've got to pay respect to
this chap who is anonymous.

00:47:56.690 --> 00:47:59.870 align:middle line:10%
But google his work,
watch his videos.

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:01.760 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, they're five hours long.

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.830 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, not all the
material is his.

00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:07.100 align:middle line:10%
But he's pulling it together
like nobody else is.

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:12.200 align:middle line:10%
Absolute thought leader and will
change your view of the world.

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:13.175 align:middle line:10%
I promise you that.

00:48:13.175 --> 00:48:15.700 align:middle line:10%


00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:17.280 align:middle line:10%
So the Inner Earth.

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:19.360 align:middle line:10%
Are we part of it?

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:21.410 align:middle line:84%
That's absolutely
for you to decide.

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:22.660 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for your attention.

00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:23.800 align:middle line:90%
Really appreciate it, guys.

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:27.150 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:34.000 align:middle line:90%
