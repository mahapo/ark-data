00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.840 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.420 align:middle line:84%
It's like a breath,
I think, after that.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.650 align:middle line:90%
What a lineup, eh?

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Right, now, there are
two dedicated mic stands.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.520 align:middle line:90%
One is there, and one is there.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.420 align:middle line:84%
If you would like
to ask a question,

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.450 align:middle line:84%
please proceed to
the microphones.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.020 align:middle line:84%
State who the question is for,
and then ask your question.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.840 align:middle line:84%
OK, so it would be great if
you could ask all our guests

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.700 align:middle line:84%
questions rather than
just one, perhaps.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.160 align:middle line:84%
But let's see how
we get on, shall we?

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.190 align:middle line:90%
So yes?

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.430 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to ask Richard.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.660 align:middle line:84%
Did man ever walk
on the moon in 1969?

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And if they did, can they
prove whether the Earth

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.215 align:middle line:90%
is flat or a sphere?

00:01:45.215 --> 00:01:46.580 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.490 align:middle line:90%


00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.710 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHARD DOTY: Good question.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.980 align:middle line:10%
To the best of my
knowledge, Neil Armstrong

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.200 align:middle line:10%
did walk on the moon in 1969.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.190 align:middle line:10%
I was young back in those days.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.260 align:middle line:10%
But everything I've seen
and all the knowledge

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.020 align:middle line:10%
I've had about
space travel proves

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.039 align:middle line:10%
that we did walk on the moon.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.370 align:middle line:10%
And I'm sure by
walking on the moon,

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.240 align:middle line:10%
we proved that the Earth
was round, not flat.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.860 align:middle line:10%
>>HOST: Does anybody
else in the panel

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.140 align:middle line:10%
want to deal with that question?

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.010 align:middle line:10%
Yes?

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.880 align:middle line:10%
Tell me.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNNY ENOCH: Yeah.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.290 align:middle line:90%
I would agree with that.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.660 align:middle line:84%
There's a great book out
called "Our Forbidden

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.450 align:middle line:90%
Moon" by David Bryant.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.250 align:middle line:90%
I think it is.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And he says that they actually
replicated those moon scenes

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.050 align:middle line:84%
out here at the
Cardington hangars.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of reasons why
we would want to replicate that

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.110 align:middle line:84%
footage, but you might
want to ask yourselves,

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.690 align:middle line:84%
why Stanley Kubrick was given
a nice gift of the Hasselblad

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.470 align:middle line:90%
cameras that he used.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And you might say
to yourself, well,

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.960 align:middle line:84%
if we went to all this
trouble to do that,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.790 align:middle line:84%
what did they find
up on the moon

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.970 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't want to show
us on their original trek there,

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:00.770 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>>THERESA BULLARD-WHYKE: Yeah.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: OK.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.100 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW GOUGH: I'd
like to just add to that

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.583 align:middle line:84%
and say that I'd like to think
that we've been to the moon.

00:03:08.583 --> 00:03:10.250 align:middle line:84%
If you look at what
NASA's saying today,

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.340 align:middle line:84%
if you look at what Obama said
in a very important speech

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.330 align:middle line:84%
in 2010, the goal today is to
get past low Earth orbit, which

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.980 align:middle line:90%
is around 100,000 miles.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.830 align:middle line:90%
The moon is 240,000 miles.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.410 align:middle line:84%
The goal is to get
past low Earth orbit.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.370 align:middle line:90%
That's the goal.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.480 align:middle line:84%
But I thought we did that
in 1969 through 1972.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.340 align:middle line:90%
50 years later, that's the goal.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.290 align:middle line:84%
So it does raise
the question, and we

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.160 align:middle line:84%
need to be inquisitive
and keep asking questions.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.340 align:middle line:90%


00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HOST: Would you like
to ask a question?

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Please, make your way
to the microphone.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.617 align:middle line:84%
Actually, there
are two questions,

00:03:49.617 --> 00:03:51.380 align:middle line:84%
but maybe I start
with the first one.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HOST: Who you like to
ask a question of, please?

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Richard, please.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.060 align:middle line:84%
We are speaking
about the Blue Book.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And the documents were
public maybe last year.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a very impressive
video with an interview

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.620 align:middle line:90%
with an ET.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.570 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know if you know it.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's from the
Secret Services.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And the story's very
interesting, what he tells us.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And I want just to hear
from you if this is a hoax,

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.303 align:middle line:90%
or is this a real video?

00:04:27.303 --> 00:04:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: What book are
you talking about?

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: These
documents, the Blue Book.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.200 align:middle line:90%
About--

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.283 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Project Blue Book?

00:04:34.283 --> 00:04:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Project
Blue Book, yeah.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: OK.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.140 align:middle line:84%
Project Blue Book started after
Project Sign was the first one.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.640 align:middle line:90%
Project Grudge was second.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.230 align:middle line:90%
Blue Book lasted up until 1969.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:54.110 align:middle line:84%
There's a number of parts
of the Project Blue Book

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.120 align:middle line:90%
that is still classified.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.330 align:middle line:90%
Most of it's been released.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.630 align:middle line:90%
You can get through FOIA.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure what film you're
talking about within Blue

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.030 align:middle line:90%
Book that shows that ET.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: This is
an interview with ET

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.250 align:middle line:84%
where he tells us
that this is us

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.290 align:middle line:90%
traveling from the future back.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
same race evolving

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.360 align:middle line:90%
after thousands and thousands--

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, I know what
you're talking about.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the knowledge
about time travel.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.810 align:middle line:84%
I think some other
people on this panel

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.420 align:middle line:84%
might be able to answer
that better than me.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.510 align:middle line:84%
During my time in,
there were time travel.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.350 align:middle line:84%
There were allegedly
some ETs that

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.230 align:middle line:84%
told other people that they
were time travelers from

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.540 align:middle line:90%
either forward or back.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.160 align:middle line:84%
But I don't have anything
officially that I had access to

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.440 align:middle line:84%
during my time in
the US intelligence

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.980 align:middle line:90%
that could answer that question.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:53.810 align:middle line:90%
But I think--

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HOST: Let's see if
the rest of the panel--

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.870 align:middle line:84%
anybody else got an
opinion on time travel?

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY CARSON: Well, I think
time travel is possible,

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.900 align:middle line:84%
just looking at physics
and quantum mechanics.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.627 align:middle line:84%
If you look at moving
at the speed of light

00:06:09.627 --> 00:06:11.210 align:middle line:84%
or a percentage of
the speed of light,

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.770 align:middle line:84%
you actually move
forward in time.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Actually if you get in an
airplane and travel at a speed

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.610 align:middle line:84%
away from us, you would
be actually moving forward

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.170 align:middle line:84%
in time by a very, very minute
amount of time, but calculable.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
is the faster you go,

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.490 align:middle line:90%
the more you move ahead in time.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.720 align:middle line:90%
Time slows down for you.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Moving into the future in time
is actually very easy to do.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Going into the past is
a little bit difficult.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.110 align:middle line:90%
And I'll tell you why.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.150 align:middle line:84%
You have the
grandfather paradox.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if you were born and
then you go back in time,

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.150 align:middle line:84%
how can you meet your
grandfather and kill him?

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.543 align:middle line:84%
Because if he
died, you shouldn't

00:06:45.543 --> 00:06:46.460 align:middle line:90%
have been born anyway.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Right, it's the
grandfather paradox.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.010 align:middle line:84%
So when you go back in time,
which I believe is possible--

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Ronald Mallett, who's been
working on the time machine

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.250 align:middle line:84%
to go back in time
for quite some time.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.440 align:middle line:90%
He's a quantum physicist.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.910 align:middle line:84%
However, when you
go back in time,

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.890 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
you actually shift

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.960 align:middle line:90%
into an alternate timeline.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.650 align:middle line:84%
So you can't affect the future
timeline from where you came.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.860 align:middle line:84%
You can only travel into the
future on your same timeline.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Going back in time, you travel
into a alternate timeline,

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.740 align:middle line:84%
not allowing you to affect
the future from the timeline

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:16.620 align:middle line:90%
you came from.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.310 align:middle line:84%
So I think that time travel
from the future to the past

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:23.580 align:middle line:84%
to alter future realities
could be very difficult.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Thank you.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.530 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Theresa Bullard-Whyke, I
notice you were nodding there.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.820 align:middle line:84%
Have you got something
to say on that subject.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD-WHYKE: Well, the
idea of many parallel timelines

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.730 align:middle line:90%
is certainly a possibility.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.490 align:middle line:84%
If you were able
to go back in time,

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.690 align:middle line:84%
who knows which timeline of
the many parallel realities

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:42.680 align:middle line:90%
you might end up in?

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.470 align:middle line:90%
Or same with the future.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Right, so there's not just one
linear time happening, even

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.050 align:middle line:90%
though that's what we perceive.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.480 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the
bigger physics of it all,

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:59.150 align:middle line:84%
there's very non-linear and
multistreams of time happening.

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.210 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to the
possibility of time travel,

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:05.040 align:middle line:84%
time and space are
an interwoven fabric.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.200 align:middle line:84%
So if you can bend
space, you can bend time.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.350 align:middle line:90%
You can speed it up.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.570 align:middle line:90%
You can slow it down.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:15.410 align:middle line:84%
We certainly know that
there were experiments done.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Like the Philadelphia
Project experiments

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.990 align:middle line:84%
were done using some Tesla
technology and so forth.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Those are pretty
well documented.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.880 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
have we harnessed it?

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Have we harnessed it where
we can control it and not

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:34.280 align:middle line:84%
have people end up cut
in half through ships

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.659 align:middle line:90%
and things like that, right?

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:36.619 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:08:36.619 --> 00:08:37.419 align:middle line:90%


00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:38.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Jonny Enoch.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ENOCH: That was great from
everyone on the panel so far.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.500 align:middle line:84%
I would say that most
certainly and I would agree

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.510 align:middle line:90%
with everything that was said.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Like Billy was talking about
also, you get time dilation.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.330 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the special
theory of relativity,

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.850 align:middle line:84%
or what Theresa was saying, when
you look at these parallel time

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:57.650 align:middle line:90%
streams.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, you might
say we could have

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.700 align:middle line:84%
something with
lineal progression

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.760 align:middle line:84%
or lineal subjugation
assessment.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.240 align:middle line:84%
When we look at these photons
that we're talking about there,

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.160 align:middle line:90%
this can exist in a dual state.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.930 align:middle line:90%
You have a particle in a wave.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at something
called quantum multiplicity,

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.300 align:middle line:84%
we start to get into a
very interesting area,

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.510 align:middle line:84%
that everything is happening
in a certain simultaneity.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.978 align:middle line:84%
So not to get all
crazy in physics term,

00:09:22.978 --> 00:09:24.395 align:middle line:84%
but let's look at
a superposition.

00:09:24.395 --> 00:09:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Or let's look at this
configuration where all of you

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.110 align:middle line:84%
are right now, tuned into
this reality on this stage.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Now we tune in to a show
like "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.755 align:middle line:90%
the show that Rick's on.

00:09:36.755 --> 00:09:39.355 align:middle line:84%
The latest season, they have
Tim, the tactical advisor,

00:09:39.355 --> 00:09:40.730 align:middle line:84%
and he's talking
about the Greys.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:42.260 align:middle line:84%
The Greys are a
very good example

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.160 align:middle line:90%
of a time traveling species.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.202 align:middle line:84%
Here's a group that's been
meddling in our affairs

00:09:47.202 --> 00:09:48.410 align:middle line:90%
and meddling with each other.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:50.120 align:middle line:90%
And it gets quite complicated.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.630 align:middle line:84%
You got one group that's about
2 to 400 years ahead of us.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.620 align:middle line:84%
When you look at these EBENs
or Extraterrestrial Biological

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.420 align:middle line:90%
Entities.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Then you have
another group that's

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.740 align:middle line:90%
millions of years advanced.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And they're at war
with each other.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:04.798 align:middle line:84%
And you might say,
just as Billy's example

00:10:04.798 --> 00:10:07.340 align:middle line:84%
and what they just talked about
with these time streams, what

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Theresa was saying, it's
like going up an escalator.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And what if one of these
paradoxical time streams

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.700 align:middle line:84%
is completely shattered
altogether because they're

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:17.940 align:middle line:90%
at war with each other?

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.870 align:middle line:84%
But they're meddling with
us because the algorithm

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.350 align:middle line:90%
for reality is quite complex.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And you can have this
cross-pollination

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.720 align:middle line:84%
of realities of one group
in the future coming back

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.470 align:middle line:84%
to fix something in
the past and one group

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:30.740 align:middle line:90%
from the past coming up here.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a Japanese sword
maker putting on layers.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:37.990 align:middle line:84%
But most certainly, we do
have time traveling species.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:39.108 align:middle line:90%
I believe so.

00:10:39.108 --> 00:10:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: That's fantastic.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:41.775 align:middle line:84%
Anybody else would
like to talk about--

00:10:41.775 --> 00:10:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Oh, let me
add one more thing.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:46.150 align:middle line:84%
During my time in
intelligence, I

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:52.780 align:middle line:84%
knew of two programs that dealt
in experimenting time travel.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.870 align:middle line:84%
One way, Sandia National
Laboratories in Albuquerque,

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:57.685 align:middle line:90%
and one by DARPA.

00:10:57.685 --> 00:11:01.180 align:middle line:90%


00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.610 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just telling you
that the government has

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:05.920 align:middle line:90%
experimented with time travel.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a scientist and I
can't go in great details,

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.370 align:middle line:84%
but I agree with
what Billy said.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many things that
it's feasible to go forward.

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:18.788 align:middle line:84%
But going to backs
would be a paradox.

00:11:18.788 --> 00:11:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HOST: Andrew Gough, I
know you wanted to speak.

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.455 align:middle line:84%
>>GOUGH: Yeah, I was
just going to add.

00:11:22.455 --> 00:11:26.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if this video
remains on the internet or not,

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.780 align:middle line:84%
but shortly after
CERN opened, there

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.840 align:middle line:84%
was an interview with a
reporter and a director.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.510 align:middle line:84%
The reporter's asking the
state of the world today.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:37.870 align:middle line:84%
All the areas that
need investment,

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:41.830 align:middle line:84%
and you've spent how much on
this atom smashing facility?

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And the director replied
very diplomatically, well,

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:48.500 align:middle line:84%
it's in the best interest of
technology and civilization

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.300 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.030 align:middle line:84%
But really, is
this the best use?

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:53.590 align:middle line:84%
It went back and
forth to the point

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.260 align:middle line:84%
where the director got so
flustered, he said, well,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.170 align:middle line:84%
what price would you
put on time travel?

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:00.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ENOCH: Wow.

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:00.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Wow.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Anybody else on this?

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ENOCH: Glad you
brought that up.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GOUGH: Yeah.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HOST: And we'll go to this
question, I think, please.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:06.953 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Good evening, panel.

00:12:06.953 --> 00:12:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And thank you very much for
a very wonderful experience

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.960 align:middle line:84%
this weekend and
very informative.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Could I just ask you, what
are your thoughts collectively

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:21.970 align:middle line:84%
or respectively
on the theory that

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:26.680 align:middle line:84%
rhesus negative human
beings are descendants

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.430 align:middle line:84%
of a particular
extraterrestrial race?

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:31.862 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Great question.

00:12:31.862 --> 00:12:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Myself and my
sister here are both Rh

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:34.903 align:middle line:90%
negative blood, I believe.

00:12:34.903 --> 00:12:37.690 align:middle line:90%
But my mother was Rh negative.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:40.960 align:middle line:84%
They've been researching Rh
negative blood for a long time.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And they've come up
with the analysis

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:47.170 align:middle line:84%
that they say that
it's alien blood.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:49.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they mean
alien because it's just unknown

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:52.448 align:middle line:84%
or that they're trying to say
it comes from somewhere else.

00:12:52.448 --> 00:12:55.930 align:middle line:90%
But it's 1 in--

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:56.890 align:middle line:90%
I think it's--

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:57.850 align:middle line:90%
20% of the world.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:59.960 align:middle line:84%
20% of the world's population
has that blood type.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:00.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 15.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: 15.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.430 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what I started
doing actually about, well,

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:05.830 align:middle line:84%
just because my father
passed away-- thank you.

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.050 align:middle line:84%
My father passed away
about four years ago--

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:09.370 align:middle line:90%
now I think we're five.

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And my cousin came to the
hospital where he was at

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.070 align:middle line:84%
and she was telling
me that, have you

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:18.310 align:middle line:90%
started saving your blood?

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Because if something
happens to me,

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.700 align:middle line:90%
then I will be in deep poop.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:22.660 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:23.460 align:middle line:90%


00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I started going
to a local plasma bank

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.403 align:middle line:84%
to do that because, if
something does happen to me,

00:13:28.403 --> 00:13:29.570 align:middle line:90%
I have to have my own blood.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:32.327 align:middle line:84%
And my mom almost passed
away because of in the past

00:13:32.327 --> 00:13:34.660 align:middle line:84%
because she didn't have any
blood transfusion available.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very, very
rare blood type.

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:40.120 align:middle line:90%
So it's alien in that way.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
they've specifically

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.037 align:middle line:84%
proved that it's
related or linked

00:13:43.037 --> 00:13:45.350 align:middle line:84%
to any other
extraterrestrial species.

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:47.020 align:middle line:84%
But it's just a very
rare blood type.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And it could be some
type of remnant blood

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:52.030 align:middle line:90%
from some ancient bloodline.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:52.900 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:53.910 align:middle line:90%
It's very rare.

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:54.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Thank you.

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:57.010 align:middle line:84%
Anybody else would like
to pick up on that?

00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:57.810 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:59.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:00.670 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:01.470 align:middle line:90%
You, sir.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you
for a wonderful weekend.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Just wanted to ask the
whole panel two questions.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.150 align:middle line:84%
The first would be, do you
think the Anunnaki will return?

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And if so, what would
the consequences

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.380 align:middle line:84%
be if there would
be consequences?

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And the second question
would be, with the narrative

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.100 align:middle line:84%
that the government's put
on the extraterrestrials,

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.830 align:middle line:84%
UFOs, the UAPs that they
see, that they class them

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:28.710 align:middle line:84%
as a threat or
potential threat to us

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.110 align:middle line:84%
could be an excuse
for space wars,

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:34.050 align:middle line:84%
do you think there's a way
out of this, for this to stop?

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.525 align:middle line:84%
Or is there another
way around this?

00:14:36.525 --> 00:14:38.592 align:middle line:90%
Can this be stopped?

00:14:38.592 --> 00:14:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Anunnaki in
my personal opinion

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.430 align:middle line:90%
are still here.

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:42.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GOUGH: Yeah.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: They've
never really left.

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:46.242 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some did flee according
to some of the tablets.

00:14:46.242 --> 00:14:48.930 align:middle line:84%
But it seems as if
some stayed here.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Some were actually banned from
going back to their home planet

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:55.200 align:middle line:84%
because they had intertangled
with human beings

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.640 align:middle line:90%
or human women.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.860 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that the
bloodline still exists.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.660 align:middle line:84%
Even the Merovingian
bloodline, which

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.180 align:middle line:84%
is the bloodline coming
down from Yashua, I believe,

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:05.590 align:middle line:90%
is still on this planet today.

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at some
of the ancient texts

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:13.560 align:middle line:84%
and what it talks about what the
Marduk in this pyramid wore--

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.510 align:middle line:84%
Marduk was also
known as Amun-Ra.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And that time of this
Second Pyramid War,

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:21.930 align:middle line:84%
he escaped but he left the
kingship and the finances

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:23.580 align:middle line:90%
to his Ra-Kam.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Kam, K-A-M, translating into
modern terminology as "shield."

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And over time, you
see that name evolving

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:32.520 align:middle line:90%
into Roth shield, Rothschild.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And who has a $700
trillion net family

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.050 align:middle line:90%
worth right now on this planet?

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:38.413 align:middle line:90%
The Rothschilds.

00:15:38.413 --> 00:15:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And so they still run
and control this planet.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.360 align:middle line:84%
So in my personal
opinion, based on what

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.740 align:middle line:90%
I've studied and researched.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.660 align:middle line:90%
So why are they returning?

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:46.870 align:middle line:90%
I think they're still here.

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think the invasion has
happened hundreds of thousands

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.100 align:middle line:90%
of years ago.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And so we are now in
a situation and we

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.920 align:middle line:84%
have the multitude of eight
billion people on the planet.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And we have 100 mysterious
families controlling

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:01.868 align:middle line:90%
eight billion people.

00:16:01.868 --> 00:16:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why we
have these conferences

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.213 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we have these
talks and these shows and all

00:16:06.213 --> 00:16:08.130 align:middle line:84%
these events, because
we have to unite as one.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Because it's up to us to take
back control of our planet.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HOST: Anybody
like to pick on up?

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:14.162 align:middle line:90%
>>ENOCH: Certainly.

00:16:14.162 --> 00:16:18.230 align:middle line:90%


00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:19.640 align:middle line:90%
I love what Billy said.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Bringing back up the
Anunnaki, the fact

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:22.880 align:middle line:90%
that they never left here.

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And we today, we
might say Anunnaki.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Those from heaven
that came to Earth.

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And in that particular story,
we learn about this group

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:36.050 align:middle line:84%
that authors like Zecharia
such and said were coming here

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:38.270 align:middle line:90%
about 500,000 years ago.

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And they were involved in
all kinds of things on Earth.

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.590 align:middle line:84%
But point in fact,
there's been many groups

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:43.790 align:middle line:90%
that came before them.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:45.320 align:middle line:90%
Groups that were here.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.223 align:middle line:84%
The whole time, they
haven't left us.

00:16:47.223 --> 00:16:48.890 align:middle line:84%
They have been getting
involved with us.

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And in the Anunnaki story,
just as Billy pointed out,

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Marduk being Amun-Ra, the
Hidden One and the Pyramid Wars.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.350 align:middle line:84%
We also bring up
Thoth over there,

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:00.830 align:middle line:84%
who's also one of Billy's
favorite guys in your book.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:02.300 align:middle line:84%
He writes about
the Emerald tablet.

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:05.630 align:middle line:84%
He was known as Ningishzida when
you go back into the Sumerian.

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:09.050 align:middle line:84%
He was also known not only as
Thoth, but Hermes Vicarious

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:10.190 align:middle line:90%
Trimsegistus.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:11.960 align:middle line:90%
He was known as Quetzalcoatl.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.250 align:middle line:90%
He was known as Kukulkan.

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:14.329 align:middle line:90%
Many different names.

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:16.589 align:middle line:84%
And he's always
saying he will return.

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And we've always had
this story that there is

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.900 align:middle line:90%
going to be a god that returns.

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Van Donegan was
talking about that today.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:25.040 align:middle line:84%
But this has also
been associated

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.510 align:middle line:90%
with these various cycles.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And Billy, since you
mentioned the Pyramid Wars,

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.000 align:middle line:84%
you get the idea of
Ningishzida or Thoth.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.560 align:middle line:84%
When you go back
in that story, you

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.900 align:middle line:90%
get this alignment with Leo.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.240 align:middle line:90%
Or you go back into a Sphinx.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And one of Sitchin's
ideas would be

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:44.160 align:middle line:84%
that these wars also started
with Marduk not getting

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:44.960 align:middle line:90%
his respect.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, Ningishzida's
face may have,

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:48.500 align:middle line:90%
in fact, been on the Sphinx.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.250 align:middle line:90%
Well, we bring that up into Leo.

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at this
procession of the equinoxes

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.560 align:middle line:84%
or this cycle, when you
look on the opposite end,

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.000 align:middle line:90%
it brings us down to Aquarius.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.040 align:middle line:84%
This is the age that
we're moving into,

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.170 align:middle line:84%
as Theresa has
eloquently shown us

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:01.610 align:middle line:84%
on shows like
"Mystery Teachings,"

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:03.210 align:middle line:90%
is we're moving into the cycle.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:05.690 align:middle line:84%
So could not the Anunnaki
also be returning

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:07.370 align:middle line:90%
in a form of our genetics?

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Could they not be influencing
us with biogenetic technologies

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:13.610 align:middle line:84%
and many things on this planet
so we're becoming part of them?

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:14.910 align:middle line:90%
We're evolving.

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:18.050 align:middle line:84%
I would like to make you think
about this tonight that just

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:21.680 align:middle line:84%
like the dinosaurs occupied
this planet at one time,

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.440 align:middle line:84%
could you not be an ant
farm for those folks

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.630 align:middle line:84%
that Billy was
just talking about?

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Could they not be
looking at all of you

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.580 align:middle line:84%
as a zoological experiment,
waiting for some of us

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:35.300 align:middle line:84%
to overcome the tribalism on
this planet so we can lift off

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:38.800 align:middle line:84%
and our descendants will go out
into the stars in the next 25

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:39.600 align:middle line:90%
years?

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HOST: Well, that's
a powerful answer.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:42.920 align:middle line:90%
Andrew.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GOUGH: Yeah, just
to add to that--

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.110 align:middle line:90%
both Jonny and Billy's comments.

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:49.620 align:middle line:84%
In regards to the
return, I mean,

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:50.870 align:middle line:90%
that's an interesting concept.

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:51.870 align:middle line:90%
So where are they today?

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.200 align:middle line:84%
Billy mentioned the
small number of families

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.800 align:middle line:90%
who rule the planet.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.080 align:middle line:84%
What if some of them
are doing just that?

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.820 align:middle line:84%
But also, some of them
went underground literally

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:05.990 align:middle line:90%
into the Inner Earth.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Now in 1890, the Tibetan Lamas
were met by, as the story goes,

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:14.960 align:middle line:84%
as the legend goes,
the ruler of the world

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.140 align:middle line:84%
from Agartha, who predicted
40 years of strife

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.310 align:middle line:90%
and misery-- two World Wars.

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:22.490 align:middle line:84%
71 years of happiness
followed by 18 years of war,

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:27.290 align:middle line:84%
then the return of the Inner
Earth people, who are probably

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:31.760 align:middle line:84%
just the ones we're talking
about now, in 2029, 2030.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, that time is something
that appears over and over again

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:39.730 align:middle line:84%
in certain prophecies as when
something really significant's

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:40.530 align:middle line:90%
going to happen.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:42.072 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's Hopi
Indian or the Mayan

00:19:42.072 --> 00:19:44.930 align:middle line:84%
prediction of the Millennium
plus a little bit.

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, 2029, 2030
is a little bit.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And some would argue
that we are at war today.

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.440 align:middle line:90%
A war of good versus evil.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.630 align:middle line:84%
If we win, if we don't
win, it's good to know

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:58.070 align:middle line:84%
that the people
who have preserved

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.350 align:middle line:84%
the history of the arts
of sciences of our planet

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:02.420 align:middle line:84%
for hundreds of thousands
of years are there

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:06.040 align:middle line:84%
and ready to come back and help
restore life in this realm.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Thank you.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Anybody else would like
to pick up on that?

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:09.830 align:middle line:90%
Richard.

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I'll take your
second question there.

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:18.770 align:middle line:84%
Is there a threat from
ETs coming to Earth?

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:22.610 align:middle line:84%
First of all, if
you go back, there's

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:24.110 align:middle line:84%
a number of different
websites where

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:26.750 align:middle line:84%
you can find the
number of satellites

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:32.900 align:middle line:84%
that we've launched into
space, from Telstar in 1959

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.340 align:middle line:90%
all the way up.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.890 align:middle line:84%
The ones that were launched
out of Vandenberg Air Force

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:43.250 align:middle line:84%
base or Cape Canaveral or
from the space shuttles.

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:44.875 align:middle line:84%
And if you did a
little mathematics,

00:20:44.875 --> 00:20:46.250 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
find that there's

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:49.610 align:middle line:84%
110 satellites that
the National Security

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Agency and the military
won't acknowledge.

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:55.610 align:middle line:90%
So what are they doing up there?

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:57.560 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
communications satellites.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:02.660 align:middle line:84%
Some are advanced GPS
satellites for the military.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.920 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of
satellites up there,

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.800 align:middle line:84%
we don't really
know what they are.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Could they be space-based
weapons systems?

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Some kind of a
high energy laser?

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:13.460 align:middle line:90%
Possibility.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Another thing you
got to think about

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:21.570 align:middle line:84%
is the ETs coming to Earth, they
have a different technology.

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:25.110 align:middle line:84%
They're thousands of years
more advanced than we are.

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:27.630 align:middle line:84%
To think that we
could mount some kind

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:30.960 align:middle line:84%
of a preventive
shield around Earth

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:35.400 align:middle line:84%
to protect all these
different ones coming in,

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't think we could.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GOUGH: Yeah.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Anybody else on that?

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.200 align:middle line:90%
Theresa.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD-WHYKE: Yeah, I'd like
to just address the narrative

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.100 align:middle line:90%
of the potential threat.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And I agree what's
been said here,

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:50.760 align:middle line:84%
that we do live in a universe
where there is duality.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Just like we have
people who are good,

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:56.130 align:middle line:84%
we have people
who are malicious.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And we have a whole
lot of other people

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:00.120 align:middle line:84%
in between who have
good intentions

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.370 align:middle line:90%
but act in ignorance.

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
we're going to find out

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.370 align:middle line:90%
in the universe as well.

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:08.227 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be
those who mean well,

00:22:08.227 --> 00:22:10.060 align:middle line:84%
and there's going to
be those who mean harm.

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And there's going
to be those who

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:13.530 align:middle line:90%
are coming to set a curiosity.

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:16.163 align:middle line:84%
Maybe have good intentions,
but their whole construct

00:22:16.163 --> 00:22:18.330 align:middle line:84%
is different from ours and
they're ignorant from us.

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:21.570 align:middle line:84%
So we might perceive them
as a potential threat

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.250 align:middle line:90%
because they're just different.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And if we're seeing
through that narrative

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:30.540 align:middle line:84%
though, if we're coming
with the expectation

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.730 align:middle line:84%
that we have to be on our
guard from anything that's

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:34.188 align:middle line:84%
different from us,
then we're going

00:22:34.188 --> 00:22:37.390 align:middle line:84%
to always assume everything
is a potential threat when

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:38.190 align:middle line:90%
it's different.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And then we might create
a self-fulfilling prophecy

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:45.630 align:middle line:84%
because we confront them with
an antagonistic expectation.

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:49.350 align:middle line:84%
So I think that we don't
want to be naive and think

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:50.520 align:middle line:90%
that it's all good.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.140 align:middle line:84%
But we also don't
want to come with

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.970 align:middle line:90%
this antagonistic approach.

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And there is a battle
happening in this world,

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:00.180 align:middle line:84%
and it is a battle
for the human mind.

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And one of the biggest places
where that battle happens

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:05.910 align:middle line:84%
is in the media
and the programming

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:07.510 align:middle line:90%
that happens in the media.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And when you see a
certain narrative being

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:12.900 align:middle line:84%
pushed and pushed
and pushed and spun,

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.690 align:middle line:84%
there's an agenda that's
happening from humans

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:17.280 align:middle line:90%
that is pushing that narrative.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.680 align:middle line:90%
And it's trying to create fear.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And when we're in
a place of fear,

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:25.950 align:middle line:84%
our old brain is
hijacking our ability

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:28.990 align:middle line:84%
to actually think for
ourselves and to discern.

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:31.980 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be very
careful around feeding

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:34.950 align:middle line:84%
into any fear, whether it's
coming from conspiracy theory,

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:36.790 align:middle line:84%
whether it's coming
from mainstream media,

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:39.690 align:middle line:84%
whether it's coming from
your own subconscious mind.

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:42.300 align:middle line:84%
Be careful around
feeding into the fear,

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:46.950 align:middle line:84%
because that only attracts
more negative or low vibrations

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:48.270 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:50.114 align:middle line:90%
So be in your heart.

00:23:50.114 --> 00:23:52.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Anybody else on that?

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:52.830 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:53.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.362 align:middle line:84%
Let's move on to
this gentleman here.

00:23:55.362 --> 00:23:56.820 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: However,
Theresa's just

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:57.750 align:middle line:90%
covered a little bit of this.

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:00.000 align:middle line:84%
But I was going to say, what
is-- to all of the panel,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.590 align:middle line:84%
what do you think our next steps
as a species should be in terms

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:07.110 align:middle line:84%
of where I'm talking about,
going to different planets

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:08.040 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that?

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.750 align:middle line:84%
How the hell can we
even think about that

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:11.790 align:middle line:84%
when we can't even
control our own prejudice

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:13.638 align:middle line:90%
and negativity on this planet?

00:24:13.638 --> 00:24:15.930 align:middle line:84%
Are we just going to spread
that throughout the cosmos?

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:17.070 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely no way.

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:19.080 align:middle line:84%
So what do you
think as a species

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.030 align:middle line:90%
our next step should be.

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:22.410 align:middle line:90%
Let's never mind the future.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:23.460 align:middle line:90%
What about now?

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.260 align:middle line:90%
What should we do now?

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:28.388 align:middle line:84%
>>HOST: Well-- anybody
want to answer that?

00:24:28.388 --> 00:24:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, I love
your passion first of all,

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:34.353 align:middle line:84%
because that is the biggest
topic really of the day.

00:24:34.353 --> 00:24:37.020 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to learn how to
have unconditional love for one

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:38.453 align:middle line:90%
another?

00:24:38.453 --> 00:24:39.870 align:middle line:84%
That's why I love
coming to events

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:42.510 align:middle line:84%
like this, because when I
come to events like this,

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:45.300 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm
part of a family.

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:46.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:48.487 align:middle line:90%
>>ENOCH: That's good.

00:24:48.487 --> 00:24:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I don't
feel any negativity.

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Maria.

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:52.428 align:middle line:84%
>>MARIA WHEATLEY:
Well, this is why

00:24:52.428 --> 00:24:55.560 align:middle line:84%
I think coming together, if we
think how the ancients actually

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.560 align:middle line:84%
came together, they
made monuments where

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.080 align:middle line:90%
you could fit 2,000 people in.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Like Avebury Henge, the largest
stone circle in the world.

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:07.470 align:middle line:84%
Now if you imagine 2,000
people all around the world

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:10.440 align:middle line:84%
at these ancient sites
set in the intent,

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.680 align:middle line:84%
then I think that goes right
through the Earth currents

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and through the memory
of the deep waters

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.130 align:middle line:84%
I've been talking about
and across the leys.

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:21.900 align:middle line:84%
But I think there is hope
I'm working for people now

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:23.640 align:middle line:90%
that are buying up the Amazon.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:27.090 align:middle line:84%
Where because in COVID, what
was happening in the Amazon,

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:28.990 align:middle line:90%
you got land invaders.

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And they were taking
over and making farms.

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:35.040 align:middle line:84%
But there are people out
there, unsung heroes.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Not on Facebook, not on
Instagram, putting money

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:41.170 align:middle line:84%
into saving our
beautiful planet.

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:41.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Brilliant.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:43.216 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:25:43.216 --> 00:25:44.460 align:middle line:90%
Anybody else on that topic?

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.570 align:middle line:90%
Andrew?

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:47.625 align:middle line:84%
>>GOUGH: Yeah, I'd just
like to add to that.

00:25:47.625 --> 00:25:51.570 align:middle line:84%
That we need to stand up,
stand up for ourselves.

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:52.710 align:middle line:90%
And just say no.

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Say no to tyranny,
say no to abuse,

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:56.700 align:middle line:84%
say no to anything
that doesn't resonate.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.860 align:middle line:84%
There's seven billion of us and
there's a few thousand of them.

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.680 align:middle line:90%
We've got this.

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Excellent.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:02.760 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:03.930 align:middle line:90%
Anybody else?

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:06.070 align:middle line:90%
Oh, Jonny?

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ENOCH: Yeah.

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:10.050 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people will bring
up a question like this.

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Where are we going next, and
what can we do right now?

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And are they going to
tell us about these UFOs?

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to land on the
front lawn of the White House,

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:20.350 align:middle line:84%
step out, and make
a press release?

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:21.520 align:middle line:90%
Are we going to hear about that?

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.077 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot more
we have to go through.

00:26:25.077 --> 00:26:27.160 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more we have
to go through before we

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.750 align:middle line:90%
get that big disclosure answer.

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you talk to Rick
Doty about this and the folks

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.120 align:middle line:84%
that he knows, he could
tell you that this

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.940 align:middle line:84%
stuff so overwhelming
what's been going on

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.000 align:middle line:90%
in the background.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And I know this might sound a
little crazy to a lot of you--

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.000 align:middle line:84%
or maybe not, that's why
we're all sitting here.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.900 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of what goes on our
planet, the directions for that

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.510 align:middle line:84%
come about 3,000 light
years away from here.

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And the things that we are
going through right now,

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.800 align:middle line:84%
these growing pains,
are very important.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.410 align:middle line:84%
But I can assure
you that everything

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:58.900 align:middle line:84%
that these folks just said
is all very important.

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And you know that at this
particular time that,

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:03.700 align:middle line:84%
to answer your question,
that to be more loving,

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.500 align:middle line:84%
to be more kind, to
be more forgiving,

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:09.100 align:middle line:84%
to be more of a compassionate,
to attempt to do no harm.

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Not only to others,
but with ourselves.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.850 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes we harm
ourselves unintentionally.

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:19.060 align:middle line:84%
But if we can get through
these next 15 years

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:21.340 align:middle line:84%
or so with these tremendous
ups and downs that we're

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:24.040 align:middle line:84%
going to go through,
incredible heights for humanity

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.240 align:middle line:84%
and breakthroughs and things
that we're going to do,

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.630 align:middle line:84%
but also the things that
we have to go through,

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:30.940 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
an amazing future.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.960 align:middle line:84%
I promise you, where
we'll go from there.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.660 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
like you said, it's

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.470 align:middle line:90%
a very vital time for us all.

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll start getting
more and more answers.

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:42.910 align:middle line:84%
But I really believe when
it comes to this disclosure

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:45.190 align:middle line:84%
topic we're all interested
in, the disclosure's

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:48.300 align:middle line:84%
going to be coming from
all of you in those seats.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.050 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to wait
for any governments

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:51.770 align:middle line:90%
to tell you about it.

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:52.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Thanks.

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:54.790 align:middle line:90%
Anybody else?

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:56.292 align:middle line:90%
Theresa.

00:27:56.292 --> 00:27:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD-WHYKE: So
I love your question,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.050 align:middle line:84%
because it's almost like the
grass is greener syndrome.

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:04.348 align:middle line:84%
People think the grass
is greener over there.

00:28:04.348 --> 00:28:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And if I just go over there,
I can leave these problems

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.090 align:middle line:90%
behind.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:09.590 align:middle line:84%
But then you go over there and
guess what is left with you.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:10.390 align:middle line:90%
Is you.

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:11.453 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: --be a first.

00:28:11.453 --> 00:28:12.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD-WHYKE: Yeah.

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:15.100 align:middle line:84%
So this is ultimately
about what's

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:18.460 align:middle line:90%
happening here within us.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.680 align:middle line:90%
And we have all the technology.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.840 align:middle line:84%
We have all the knowledge
of how to implement.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.015 align:middle line:90%
We have those things there.

00:28:25.015 --> 00:28:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're being
kept behind the scenes.

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:30.910 align:middle line:84%
But what's going to make
the shift to the point

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:34.120 align:middle line:84%
where we actually start
using those technologies

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.490 align:middle line:84%
rather than suppressing
those technologies

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:40.570 align:middle line:84%
is that humanity makes the shift
in collective consciousness

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:44.650 align:middle line:84%
to a higher level of
awareness and starts

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:49.390 align:middle line:84%
to choose to do what is
right for the whole, right

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:52.490 align:middle line:84%
for the good of all,
versus just right for me.

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And for the selfish drive
that humans tend to have.

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.140 align:middle line:90%
And where does that start?

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, that starts
within each of us.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Right, if we want to be a
part of a collective shift,

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:05.680 align:middle line:84%
then we have to do our work
to be part of that change

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.660 align:middle line:84%
that we want to
see, as Gandhi said.

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I love what
Maria was saying

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:14.500 align:middle line:84%
around gathering at
some of these sites

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.170 align:middle line:84%
where we have
amplification of the field.

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:22.240 align:middle line:84%
But if you can
take the coherence,

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:26.170 align:middle line:84%
intention experiments and
then create a coherent field

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:28.150 align:middle line:84%
within a group of
people and then do

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:31.030 align:middle line:84%
that at these sacred sites where
the energy can be amplified

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:34.390 align:middle line:84%
in a positive way and then
you coordinate that all

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:36.340 align:middle line:84%
around the planet,
now we're talking.

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:40.780 align:middle line:84%
But first, we have to
actually get into coherence

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:41.900 align:middle line:90%
within ourselves.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:44.200 align:middle line:84%
So we have to really
do the practices.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.170 align:middle line:84%
You can't just think
about it and be

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:50.200 align:middle line:84%
in awe of the fascination
with the information.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.280 align:middle line:90%
You have to do.

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.630 align:middle line:84%
You have to make the
changes in your life

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:56.650 align:middle line:84%
so that you can be a part
of helping make this shift.

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise, we are on
a path of self-destruction.

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:00.610 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:02.620 align:middle line:90%
And we don't have that long.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Thank you.

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.628 align:middle line:90%
Anybody else on this one?

00:30:05.628 --> 00:30:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: One more thing.

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:08.170 align:middle line:84%
To make the point
that I was looking

00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:12.170 align:middle line:84%
for, which was right now,
it looks like things are

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:15.290 align:middle line:84%
dark and grim and there's
a lot of divide and conquer

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:16.340 align:middle line:90%
and there's a lot of war.

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:18.000 align:middle line:90%
And there is.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000 align:middle line:84%
But right now is actually
the greatest time

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.230 align:middle line:90%
to be alive on this planet.

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:21.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD-WHYKE: Absolutely.

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: If you look into the
past and you study the past,

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:27.770 align:middle line:84%
you'll find the Black
Plague, the bubonic plague.

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:29.390 align:middle line:84%
You'll find the
papal inquisitions

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:32.630 align:middle line:84%
which killed over 80 million
people on this planet.

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:34.220 align:middle line:84%
You'll find the
American Holocaust.

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:38.720 align:middle line:84%
111 million Indigenous natives
murdered and slaughtered.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.900 align:middle line:84%
There have been far worse
times on the planet than now.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.010 align:middle line:84%
So yes, we do have
a lot of work to do.

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:47.750 align:middle line:84%
We've come a long way, and we'll
still go another way further.

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:51.860 align:middle line:84%
However, don't let it
be so grim over you.

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:54.770 align:middle line:84%
Just realize that we all need
to start looking to provide

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:56.330 align:middle line:90%
solutions to problems.

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:58.370 align:middle line:84%
If we all look to become
solutions providers

00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:59.960 align:middle line:84%
or at least link
up with somebody

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:03.140 align:middle line:84%
who is providing a solution,
try to make things better.

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And again, the biggest thing is
that frequency, that 5.8 hertz.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:07.790 align:middle line:90%
Unconditional love.

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:08.690 align:middle line:90%
And teaching that.

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:11.180 align:middle line:84%
We have to start teaching
that to our kids, now.

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:13.040 align:middle line:84%
The first seven years
that a kid is born

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.540 align:middle line:84%
is when that kid
is molded into what

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.190 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
as an adult. And so

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:18.030 align:middle line:84%
as soon as that baby
comes out of the womb,

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:20.390 align:middle line:84%
it needs to be taught
immediately everything that it

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:23.480 align:middle line:84%
needs to know, how to be loving,
how to be kind, how to not

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.800 align:middle line:90%
fall for these tricks.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.830 align:middle line:84%
How to be fully educated to ask
questions in the proper way.

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And how to solve problems
before they happen.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And if we start
doing that from now,

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:34.130 align:middle line:84%
in two or three generations,
like Johnny says,

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:37.760 align:middle line:84%
we'll be looking at a very, very
good situation on this planet.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.697 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Anything else?

00:31:39.697 --> 00:31:41.780 align:middle line:84%
That's quite fascinating
answers, I've got to say.

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:42.440 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you all.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:43.960 align:middle line:90%
Love you all.

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:47.600 align:middle line:90%


00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HOST: This
gentleman right here.

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:52.322 align:middle line:84%
My question is for Billy,
but it's pretty open-ended.

00:31:52.322 --> 00:31:54.530 align:middle line:84%
You said in your talk about
a planet whose atmosphere

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:58.040 align:middle line:84%
has been misrepresented to
us and it looks inhospitable.

00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.123 align:middle line:90%
It's probably pretty cozy.

00:31:59.123 --> 00:32:00.832 align:middle line:84%
Do you think the same
can be said for all

00:32:00.832 --> 00:32:02.190 align:middle line:90%
the planets in our system?

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And the second half
of the question

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:06.590 align:middle line:84%
is, do you think planets
like gas giants could ever

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:08.360 align:middle line:90%
support a form of life?

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
brushed over as things

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:12.840 align:middle line:84%
that could never
have beings on them.

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:15.955 align:middle line:84%
But given the right
conditions and elements

00:32:15.955 --> 00:32:18.080 align:middle line:84%
that make up those gases,
do you think beings could

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:19.678 align:middle line:90%
form on planets like that, too?

00:32:19.678 --> 00:32:20.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Great question.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.760 align:middle line:84%
So yesterday, I was
talking about Mars

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:25.735 align:middle line:84%
and I was talking about some
of the science data on Mars.

00:32:25.735 --> 00:32:27.110 align:middle line:84%
I ran out of a
little bit of time

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:30.020 align:middle line:84%
to show the deeper science that
we have from the science data

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:32.540 align:middle line:84%
from the different probes
that we've already sent

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:33.920 align:middle line:90%
to Mars and the satellite data.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:37.550 align:middle line:84%
However, Mars has oxygen. It
has a low level of oxygen,

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:40.100 align:middle line:84%
but there is oxygen. Probably
the equivalent of being

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.980 align:middle line:84%
at 18,000 feet above sea
level on Earth, which we know

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:45.620 align:middle line:90%
that you can acclimate to that.

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:46.933 align:middle line:90%
There is a magnetic field.

00:32:46.933 --> 00:32:48.600 align:middle line:84%
That's a weak magnetic
field, but it is.

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:51.950 align:middle line:84%
But because Mars spins on its
axis and as it orbits the Sun,

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:53.630 align:middle line:84%
it creates something
called bow shock.

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And that bow shock warps
the charged particles

00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:59.570 align:middle line:84%
coming from the Sun,
allowing the person who

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:01.160 align:middle line:84%
is on a low level
of the surface,

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.910 align:middle line:84%
at the very lowest level, to
not have any damage on their DNA

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:06.458 align:middle line:90%
from charged particles.

00:33:06.458 --> 00:33:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And there's so much other
science that are coming back.

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's weather patterns,
there's clouds, there's rain,

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:11.720 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And now they've also
admitted that there's

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:16.520 align:middle line:84%
billions of tons of
liquid water on Mars.

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:18.410 align:middle line:84%
They also say now
that Mars' soil

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:21.110 align:middle line:84%
is better than Earth's
soil for growing crops.

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:22.550 align:middle line:90%
How do they know that?

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:23.680 align:middle line:90%
Pretty interesting.

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And so now they have taken
their first science sample

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:30.350 align:middle line:84%
to check for life on Mars
from the New Rover that

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:32.300 align:middle line:90%
has gone there, Perseverance.

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And that Rover will announce
life, alien life on Mars.

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:38.570 align:middle line:84%
It will be in the form
of microbes most likely.

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:41.240 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to send it
back now until 2030, however.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Because they're still
on this trickle,

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:43.993 align:middle line:90%
trickle down information.

00:33:43.993 --> 00:33:46.160 align:middle line:84%
But they can send it back
right now if they want to.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.327 align:middle line:90%
They've already detected it.

00:33:47.327 --> 00:33:48.385 align:middle line:90%
They know it's there.

00:33:48.385 --> 00:33:49.760 align:middle line:84%
To answer your
question, there is

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.762 align:middle line:84%
life throughout the
entire solar system

00:33:51.762 --> 00:33:53.220 align:middle line:84%
and throughout the
entire universe.

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:56.630 align:middle line:84%
I believe life even exists in
what we would call empty space.

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Life on these gas
giants, 1,000% accurate.

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Now they're talking about
sending a mission to Venus

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:03.405 align:middle line:84%
because they
believe that there's

00:34:03.405 --> 00:34:04.945 align:middle line:90%
life in the clouds of Venus.

00:34:04.945 --> 00:34:06.320 align:middle line:84%
So now there's a
mission, I don't

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.560 align:middle line:84%
know if it's 2035 to go to Venus
and scour the clouds of Venus

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:10.790 align:middle line:90%
for life.

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:13.400 align:middle line:84%
Life persists
everywhere and anywhere.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.778 align:middle line:84%
You have extremophiles, which
can live in any condition.

00:34:16.778 --> 00:34:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Conditions that would destroy
a carbon-based life form,

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:21.650 align:middle line:90%
they thrive in those conditions.

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I really do
believe that life persists

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:26.030 align:middle line:84%
and exist throughout
the entire universe

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:27.339 align:middle line:90%
everywhere and anywhere.

00:34:27.339 --> 00:34:28.139 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Brilliant.

00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:29.040 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.070 align:middle line:90%
Anybody else on that one?

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:32.630 align:middle line:90%
Jonny.

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ENOCH: Yeah, what Billy said
about Mars is 1,000% accurate.

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.708 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people, they've
missed categorized it.

00:34:38.708 --> 00:34:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And it was brilliant when he
was showing up in his talk

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:41.969 align:middle line:90%
that we all saw it.

00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:43.699 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad you
put that in there

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:45.929 align:middle line:84%
now, Billy, because I know
you didn't to get to that.

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:47.750 align:middle line:84%
But I really believe
in the future

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:51.590 align:middle line:84%
that Elon Musk is going to be
remembered as a great pioneer.

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:54.960 align:middle line:84%
I think the ambitions to go to
Mars at this particular time,

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.570 align:middle line:84%
he has a peripheral
understanding

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:58.260 align:middle line:84%
of what's been
going on up there.

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And as you mentioned,
Billy, with the water,

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:03.080 align:middle line:84%
you had some areas that are very
deep like the Marianas Trench.

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:05.330 align:middle line:84%
But with the gravity
levels up there

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:06.830 align:middle line:84%
to hold the
significant atmosphere,

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:08.247 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
very interesting.

00:35:08.247 --> 00:35:09.930 align:middle line:84%
When you look around
our solar system,

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:12.750 align:middle line:84%
you might be interested to
find out in the near future

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:16.328 align:middle line:84%
that you will look
at Europa, let's say,

00:35:16.328 --> 00:35:18.120 align:middle line:84%
you look on the surface
of there and you're

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.800 align:middle line:84%
going to find that
there's potentially

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.920 align:middle line:84%
25-foot whale-like
creatures swimming around

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.270 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of it.

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:26.970 align:middle line:84%
You might find that there's
a crash craft on Mercury

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:28.532 align:middle line:84%
that you barely
know anything about.

00:35:28.532 --> 00:35:30.990 align:middle line:84%
You're going to find settlements
in the asteroid belt, even

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:32.880 align:middle line:84%
private contracting
companies that

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.200 align:middle line:90%
have been up there already.

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:36.720 align:middle line:84%
That, again, is going to
surprise a lot of people

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.010 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.960 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
this really, it's

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.430 align:middle line:84%
just quite amazing,
is that there

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:43.950 align:middle line:84%
are more planets
in our galaxy alone

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:47.070 align:middle line:84%
than there are grains of sand
on all our beaches on Earth.

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you go 10,000 light
years in any direction away

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:52.170 align:middle line:84%
from here, you have about
20 million solar systems.

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:56.640 align:middle line:84%
But we have just so much life
out there that's just beaming.

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:57.985 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible, right?

00:35:57.985 --> 00:35:58.785 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:35:58.785 --> 00:35:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Brilliant.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:35:59.490 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:00.450 align:middle line:90%
Anybody else?

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:01.790 align:middle line:90%
Theresa.

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD-WHYKE: I would just
add to that, because it brings

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:06.100 align:middle line:90%
up the question, what is life?

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:06.900 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:09.090 align:middle line:90%
How do we define life?

00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:12.930 align:middle line:84%
If life is the
ability to transfer

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:16.110 align:middle line:84%
some kind of genetic
information from one generation

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:18.900 align:middle line:84%
to the next, then there can
be many, many different types

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:23.790 align:middle line:84%
of forms of life that is way
different from what we consider

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:27.930 align:middle line:84%
the DNA, the
biological life that is

00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:29.400 align:middle line:90%
familiar to us on this planet.

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And there is even
forms of RNA that

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:37.740 align:middle line:84%
grow on little space dust
crystals that are floating out

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.490 align:middle line:90%
there in the empty space.

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:41.790 align:middle line:84%
So there is definitely
life abundant

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:43.210 align:middle line:90%
throughout this universe.

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole
episode that I dedicated

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:49.260 align:middle line:84%
on "Mystery Teachings"
to this question of life

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:50.200 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:51.990 align:middle line:90%
And it is abundant.

00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:54.630 align:middle line:84%
But whether some of
those other planets,

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:57.660 align:middle line:84%
even within our own solar
system, for example,

00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:59.160 align:middle line:90%
can they host our life?

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.600 align:middle line:90%
Now that's a different matter.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Because you go to Venus
or Mercury and you

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:07.140 align:middle line:84%
get that much closer to the
sun, and it's really hot.

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:11.320 align:middle line:84%
We would burn without
the proper protection.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.900 align:middle line:90%
So there's probably life there.

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:16.500 align:middle line:90%
But is it hospitable to us?

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:17.910 align:middle line:84%
Right, and that's
the other thing

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:21.240 align:middle line:84%
that scientists are looking
for and space explorers might

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:24.870 align:middle line:84%
be looking for is, what other
areas might be hospitable

00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:28.140 align:middle line:84%
to the form of life that we
would be comfortable with?

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And but there
certainly are options

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.730 align:middle line:90%
within our own solar system.

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:35.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they could be
moons around other planets.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.450 align:middle line:90%
It could be Mars.

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:39.150 align:middle line:84%
There's definitely
options out there.

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:42.090 align:middle line:84%
But again, what are we
going to do to help--

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:45.340 align:middle line:84%
we live on a potential
paradise right here.

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:48.000 align:middle line:84%
So let's also use
all that technology

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.750 align:middle line:84%
to make this a better place,
not just get out there.

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Thank you.

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:54.815 align:middle line:90%
Jonny again.

00:37:54.815 --> 00:37:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ENOCH: Can I
add one more thing

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:56.940 align:middle line:90%
to what you were just saying?

00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Because I really like that,
what you were talking about,

00:37:58.590 --> 00:37:59.370 align:middle line:90%
the RNA there.

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:01.537 align:middle line:84%
And also what Billy said
that we'll find up on Mars.

00:38:01.537 --> 00:38:04.390 align:middle line:90%
98% to 99% of all life--

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:08.250 align:middle line:84%
well, most life, exists at the
quantum subspace at the level

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:10.000 align:middle line:90%
of nanobacteria and below.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.720 align:middle line:84%
So taking just what
you were saying,

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.910 align:middle line:84%
Theresa, I was
just thinking, when

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:17.550 align:middle line:84%
we looked under that
little patch of grass,

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:20.550 align:middle line:84%
let's say, in your back
garden, as they call it out

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:22.885 align:middle line:84%
here-- in North America,
we call it backyard.

00:38:22.885 --> 00:38:24.510 align:middle line:84%
But under your backyard
and you go look

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:25.968 align:middle line:84%
under that little
bit of grass, you

00:38:25.968 --> 00:38:28.020 align:middle line:84%
could spend the rest of
your life just thinking

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:31.080 align:middle line:84%
about the life in just
that little space alone.

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:34.140 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, it's incredible
what's just under our noses,

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:35.020 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.228 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD-WHYKE: But you
could even sentience, right?

00:38:37.228 --> 00:38:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Sentience is the
ability to interact

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:41.790 align:middle line:84%
with something in
the environment

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:43.950 align:middle line:90%
and respond to it, right?

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:45.360 align:middle line:90%
Even an atom.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:46.500 align:middle line:90%
Even an electron.

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Any subatomic particle is
sentient in that sense.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.300 align:middle line:84%
It can interact
with and respond to

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:54.170 align:middle line:84%
in an intelligent way
to its environment.

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:55.020 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: So yes, thank you.

00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:00.030 align:middle line:90%
I think this young lady is next.

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:04.740 align:middle line:10%
>>AUDIENCE: Zecharia
Sitchin believed in 2024 BC

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:08.490 align:middle line:10%
that nuclear weapons have been
used on the Sinai Peninsula

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:12.270 align:middle line:10%
and that evidence have
been found of this and also

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:16.770 align:middle line:10%
that history was circular
and that in 224 AD,

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:18.570 align:middle line:10%
the same thing
would happen again.

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:19.920 align:middle line:90%
So two questions.

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Have you found any evidence
of the nuclear weapons

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:25.410 align:middle line:84%
used in Sinai, and
what's your thought

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:29.310 align:middle line:84%
on this idea of the circular
history repeating itself?

00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Good question.

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:33.480 align:middle line:84%
So we have found evidence
of an ancient nuclear war

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:34.410 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:37.710 align:middle line:84%
If you look in Mohenjo-Daro
in the Indus Valley,

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:40.500 align:middle line:84%
you're going to find that
the building structures there

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:43.080 align:middle line:84%
are vitrified, meaning that
they've already hit close

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.760 align:middle line:90%
to 3,000 degree temperature.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And the buildings there
turned into glass.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.200 align:middle line:90%
Smooth as glass.

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:53.760 align:middle line:84%
The bodies that were impacted
during that war, that strike,

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.260 align:middle line:84%
are still laying
in the street, some

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:57.000 align:middle line:90%
of them even holding hands.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.380 align:middle line:90%
Till this very day.

00:39:58.380 --> 00:39:59.220 align:middle line:90%
That's incredible.

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And there's been
evidence that there

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.990 align:middle line:84%
has been no animals that
have actually been through,

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:05.700 align:middle line:90%
try to eat those carcasses.

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:06.510 align:middle line:90%
They stay away.

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And they've taken Geiger
counters out there.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And the bodies are higher than
background radiation still

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.150 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:15.340 align:middle line:90%
You look into the Giza Plateau.

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:17.380 align:middle line:84%
You start putting
your hand in the sand.

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:18.520 align:middle line:90%
You start looking.

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:21.050 align:middle line:84%
You start coming out with
little tiny balls of glass.

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:21.850 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Because the reason why
the Nile's not up by

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:26.410 align:middle line:84%
the Pyramids anymore is
because there was a war there.

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And that area had a strike,
a nuclear strike potentially,

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:30.400 align:middle line:90%
in my opinion.

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the ancients took
the scarab beetles and turned

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:35.890 align:middle line:84%
them into special
ornaments to honor

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:37.510 align:middle line:90%
the gods, the war of the gods.

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:39.418 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting
is these wars,

00:40:39.418 --> 00:40:40.960 align:middle line:84%
they've happened
all over the planet.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:45.130 align:middle line:84%
You can go where I'm going
through Bolivia, Pumapunku.

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And you go there and you see
that that giant structure

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:51.320 align:middle line:84%
appears to have been
exploded in some kind of way.

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.870 align:middle line:84%
So all over this
planet, there have

00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:55.630 align:middle line:84%
been these super ancient wars
with super high tech weapons

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:58.510 align:middle line:84%
that you can find by reading
the Mahabharata, the Bhagavad

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:00.400 align:middle line:90%
Gita, the Indian Vedas.

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:03.760 align:middle line:84%
You can look into
the Sumerian tablets.

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.800 align:middle line:84%
These wars did happen,
in my personal opinion,

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.300 align:middle line:84%
just based on these
ancient tablets.

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:09.880 align:middle line:84%
I think the ancestors told
us exactly what it was.

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And because I think these
texts are so ancient,

00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:15.080 align:middle line:84%
they're probably
closer to the truth.

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And so in terms of it being
a secular thing that's

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:20.560 align:middle line:84%
going to happen again, I
think he was hypothesizing

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:22.600 align:middle line:84%
that it could happen
based on some cycles

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.310 align:middle line:90%
that he did see in time.

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:26.440 align:middle line:90%
It's really up to us, you know?

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.060 align:middle line:84%
There's nowhere
written that we have

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:31.960 align:middle line:84%
to continue to repeat the things
that have happened in the past.

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:34.540 align:middle line:84%
At what point do we
realize not only can we

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:38.450 align:middle line:84%
obtain a golden age, but we can
actually sustain a golden age?

00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the mission
that we're on right now.

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Anybody else on that?

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:44.020 align:middle line:90%
Maria?

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:46.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: I've done a lot
of gamma radiation tests

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:51.070 align:middle line:84%
all around ancient sites in
England and Europe, actually.

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that
I did notice, when

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:55.130 align:middle line:84%
you go to a center
of a stone circle,

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:57.610 align:middle line:84%
it has traces of
gamma radiation.

00:41:57.610 --> 00:42:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Right in front of
Stonehenge as if there's

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:03.220 align:middle line:84%
something in the land
there is gamma radiation.

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.840 align:middle line:90%
And same in Brittany.

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:07.910 align:middle line:84%
So it does seem that maybe
these sites and these places,

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:10.180 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the
Pyramids or wherever,

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:14.223 align:middle line:84%
were definitely involved in
some kind of nuclear activity.

00:42:14.223 --> 00:42:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: OK, thank you.

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:16.450 align:middle line:90%
Anybody else on that?

00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:18.590 align:middle line:90%
Jonny?

00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ENOCH: Well, Billy just
nailed that on the first try.

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:22.695 align:middle line:90%
But I was going to say--

00:42:22.695 --> 00:42:23.495 align:middle line:90%
that's phenomenal.

00:42:23.495 --> 00:42:24.500 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:27.290 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say that
is most certainly look

00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:28.760 align:middle line:84%
at where the folks
out there that

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:31.220 align:middle line:84%
got the inspiration
for the atomic bomb

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:32.600 align:middle line:90%
got their inspiration.

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Go look at Oppenheimer go
look look at these texts.

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:38.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these weren't
original ideas.

00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And as he mentioned,
there's bodies

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:43.130 align:middle line:84%
that we can't unsheathed today
because of the radiation.

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:45.020 align:middle line:90%
Go to the Indus Valley.

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:46.190 align:middle line:90%
Go to Pakistan.

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:48.200 align:middle line:84%
All these areas is
very, very interesting

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:51.710 align:middle line:84%
that it's brought us to
this point of the discussion

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:54.463 align:middle line:84%
that we don't want to repeat
those mistakes, right?

00:42:54.463 --> 00:42:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: OK, thank you.

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:56.600 align:middle line:90%
Anybody else?

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:59.420 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's move on, then.

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:00.950 align:middle line:90%
You, young lady, please.

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.760 align:middle line:90%
My question's for Richard.

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:06.710 align:middle line:84%
You seem to speak so
freely about your time

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:10.310 align:middle line:84%
as a secret agent and meeting
alien species, possibly.

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:12.838 align:middle line:84%
So my question is,
have any shadowy forces

00:43:12.838 --> 00:43:14.630 align:middle line:84%
within the government
tried to silence you,

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:16.820 align:middle line:84%
or have they made any
attempt on your life

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:18.920 align:middle line:84%
for speaking out about
your experiences?

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:21.290 align:middle line:84%
So were you warned not to
do events such as this?

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Or any of you, have you
ever had like Men in Black?

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:27.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Good question.

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:29.720 align:middle line:90%
Good question.

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:35.000 align:middle line:84%
When I first started this
speaking tour, so to speak,

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:42.570 align:middle line:84%
I was cautioned
by the government.

00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And this was back
in the early '90s.

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:49.190 align:middle line:84%
I had a nondisclosure
agreement or a security oath

00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:52.040 align:middle line:90%
that didn't expire till 2002.

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So I had to be
careful what I say,

00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:57.270 align:middle line:84%
what I said during
that time period.

00:43:57.270 --> 00:44:00.860 align:middle line:84%
But since then, I've
spoken quite freely.

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Now there was a time when
I spoke at a convention

00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:08.315 align:middle line:84%
and I said something
for quite a while

00:44:08.315 --> 00:44:09.440 align:middle line:90%
that I shouldn't have said.

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And shortly after, a few
weeks after that, the FBI

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:18.180 align:middle line:84%
came to my house, two
FBI agents, and said,

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:20.220 align:middle line:84%
a particular government
agency wanted

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:23.040 align:middle line:84%
us to speak with you
about that conference

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.677 align:middle line:90%
you were at a few weeks ago.

00:44:25.677 --> 00:44:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And I knew what they
were going to say

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:29.270 align:middle line:90%
because I realized what I did.

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:31.310 align:middle line:84%
I realized I
overstepped my bounds.

00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And when they asked me,
I told them, yeah, I did.

00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:36.830 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't have went there.

00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:38.600 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:39.650 align:middle line:90%
Won't do it again.

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:40.730 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:42.860 align:middle line:90%
They said, OK.

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:44.880 align:middle line:90%
We just wanted to warn you.

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:48.260 align:middle line:84%
That's really the only
warning I've gotten.

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:50.300 align:middle line:90%
I get hundreds of emails.

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
really vile emails

00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:59.450 align:middle line:84%
that I get from people who
say things that I didn't do,

00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:02.510 align:middle line:84%
claiming I did things
that I never did do

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:05.390 align:middle line:90%
in the area of disinformation.

00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:06.230 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Within the government,
the one time, that was it.

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HOST: OK, so let's go to
the next questioner, please.

00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:15.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:18.110 align:middle line:90%
Billy and possibly Richard.

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Yesterday Billy, you
said that our technology

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:23.300 align:middle line:84%
is about 300 years ahead
of what we know about.

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:26.750 align:middle line:84%
Is that the result of
reverse engineering

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:30.410 align:middle line:90%
from obtained alien crafts?

00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And also, several
previous officials

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:40.820 align:middle line:84%
have said that there's some
kind of galactic alliance

00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:43.550 align:middle line:84%
or federation that our
governments and militaries are

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:48.080 align:middle line:90%
all already talking with these.

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:48.980 align:middle line:90%
And is that true?

00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Because we hear a lot about
found aliens and encounters,

00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:53.610 align:middle line:90%
but not much about that.

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:57.020 align:middle line:90%
Well, she was asking about--

00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:59.260 align:middle line:84%
I talked about yesterday
that technology is about--

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:00.260 align:middle line:90%
or day before yesterday.

00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:02.090 align:middle line:90%
I forget where I'm at now.

00:46:02.090 --> 00:46:03.940 align:middle line:84%
Technology is about
300 years ahead.

00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:06.890 align:middle line:84%
The military tech is
about 300 years ahead

00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:08.153 align:middle line:90%
of what we are today.

00:46:08.153 --> 00:46:10.070 align:middle line:84%
It used to be 50, but I
think it's a lot more.

00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:12.653 align:middle line:84%
Based on some conversations that
I've had in the private space

00:46:12.653 --> 00:46:16.310 align:middle line:84%
industry or some space
symposiums with private space

00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:18.650 align:middle line:90%
engineers and CEOs.

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And so they've been
able to come up

00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:23.420 align:middle line:84%
with the most
incredible inventions.

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:27.500 align:middle line:84%
Some are just innovative
ideas and concepts.

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:30.560 align:middle line:90%
Some are reverse engineered.

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And some are just
incredible developments

00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:36.530 align:middle line:84%
where one person develops
one piece of technology

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:38.930 align:middle line:84%
that can do a specific
thing, and then somebody

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:41.750 align:middle line:84%
else over here says, oh,
if we add this to that,

00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:42.802 align:middle line:90%
it can do this.

00:46:42.802 --> 00:46:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And so all of a sudden,
it's like the guy

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:45.677 align:middle line:90%
that invented the microwave.

00:46:45.677 --> 00:46:47.730 align:middle line:84%
He was working on something
totally different.

00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:48.980 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't trying to cook food.

00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:51.587 align:middle line:84%
But he had a chocolate
bar in his pocket.

00:46:51.587 --> 00:46:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And one of the waves came out
of the device and hit his pocket

00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:55.310 align:middle line:90%
and melted the chocolate.

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:56.960 align:middle line:90%
The next thing he says, oh, man.

00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.100 align:middle line:90%
This thing can do that?

00:46:58.100 --> 00:46:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And then somebody
came along and said,

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.280 align:middle line:84%
hey, if we add this to
this, we can make this

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.988 align:middle line:84%
into a thing that can
actually cook food.

00:47:02.988 --> 00:47:07.670 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes it's
a collaboration,

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:09.830 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it's
innovation, and sometimes

00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:11.600 align:middle line:90%
it's reverse engineering.

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:15.268 align:middle line:84%
Now in terms of the second
question with this Galactic

00:47:15.268 --> 00:47:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Federation, I personally
believe that there

00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:18.595 align:middle line:90%
is a Galactic Federation.

00:47:18.595 --> 00:47:20.720 align:middle line:84%
That's just something that
I personally believe in.

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:22.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any
evidence or Intel

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:25.460 align:middle line:84%
that lets me know whether
any government agency is

00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:26.580 align:middle line:90%
communicating with them.

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:28.880 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I ever
heard was that one incident

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:32.630 align:middle line:84%
where the gentleman, I
think was in England, here

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:37.130 align:middle line:84%
who had hacked into the NASA
servers for three years.

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:38.787 align:middle line:84%
I forget his name at
this exact moment.

00:47:38.787 --> 00:47:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Gary McKinnon.

00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah, Gary McKinnon.

00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:41.740 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:46.260 align:middle line:84%
He hacked in and he was saying
that there were non-terrestrial

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:47.060 align:middle line:90%
agents--

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:49.202 align:middle line:90%
not agents, but officers.

00:47:49.202 --> 00:47:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And so that would
be the only thing

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:53.510 align:middle line:84%
that I can say that can
give me any inkling into

00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:55.550 align:middle line:84%
whether or not we are
in a communication.

00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:57.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't personally have any
deeper intel other than what

00:47:57.980 --> 00:47:59.428 align:middle line:90%
I heard on the news.

00:47:59.428 --> 00:48:00.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: And Richard, yes.

00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, I'll give
you example of technology.

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:10.580 align:middle line:10%
In 1980, being deployed
some place, I had a laptop.

00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:11.990 align:middle line:90%
I had a regular laptop.

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:16.250 align:middle line:84%
Now it was a lot cruder
than these are today.

00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:22.970 align:middle line:84%
But the military developed
laptops in the middle '70s.

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:27.140 align:middle line:84%
The laptop had the
ability to send messages.

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:28.280 align:middle line:90%
We call it DC--

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:33.440 align:middle line:84%
it was Defense Computer
information system.

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:39.170 align:middle line:10%
And we were able to send
100 bits of information

00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:43.310 align:middle line:10%
to another computer to another
location through a satellite.

00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:46.460 align:middle line:90%
So that was 1980.

00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:50.690 align:middle line:84%
So we had the ability to
do those things in 1980.

00:48:50.690 --> 00:48:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And we also in
1980, we had Telsat,

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:59.360 align:middle line:84%
which is what is now today
GPS, satellites all over.

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And we, the United
States, wouldn't

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:03.560 align:middle line:90%
share those with anybody else.

00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:08.180 align:middle line:84%
When President Reagan
came into office in '81,

00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:11.930 align:middle line:84%
he immediately opened that
up to some other countries.

00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And those things,
those satellites,

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:19.800 align:middle line:84%
were probably 20 years advanced
than anything else anybody else

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:20.600 align:middle line:90%
had.

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:25.640 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when we opened that
up to some other countries,

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:27.590 align:middle line:84%
they didn't have
the ability-- they

00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:29.870 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the
equipment, the technology

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:34.280 align:middle line:84%
to receive any signals, because
they hadn't developed it yet.

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:38.060 align:middle line:84%
So that's just an
example of how technology

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:41.660 align:middle line:84%
can be developed within the
military industrial complex

00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:46.200 align:middle line:84%
and then years later
given out to the public.

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:47.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Jonny.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.060 align:middle line:84%
Oh, sorry, and Andrew
as well afterwards.

00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:51.260 align:middle line:90%
But let's do Jonny first.

00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:53.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ENOCH: All right, either way.

00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:57.224 align:middle line:84%
I already know I'll
like his answer.

00:49:57.224 --> 00:49:58.538 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:49:58.538 --> 00:49:59.420 align:middle line:90%


00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:02.450 align:middle line:84%
If we go in our
backyard here, let's

00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:07.640 align:middle line:84%
go back to the 1400s, 1500s,
with our friend Henry VIII.

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And what he's running around
with Katherine of Aragon

00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:12.660 align:middle line:84%
and Anne Boleyn and
all those folks.

00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, back then, people
were dying pretty young.

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:19.280 align:middle line:90%
Riding around on horses.

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And there wasn't a
lot of advancements.

00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:23.690 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's look beyond that.

00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:25.310 align:middle line:90%
1600s, 1700s.

00:50:25.310 --> 00:50:27.180 align:middle line:90%
Did anything really change?

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:28.790 align:middle line:84%
We're still riding
around on horses.

00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:32.265 align:middle line:84%
And we had various
industrial revolutions

00:50:32.265 --> 00:50:33.390 align:middle line:90%
and all that sort of stuff.

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:37.490 align:middle line:84%
But we stayed at this point
where we didn't really

00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:40.115 align:middle line:90%
move beyond what we had.

00:50:40.115 --> 00:50:42.170 align:middle line:84%
We moved into things
like the locomotive

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:44.600 align:middle line:90%
and all that sort of thing.

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:48.110 align:middle line:84%
But there was a time
that things started

00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:52.580 align:middle line:84%
to really accelerate after
that period of 1947, didn't it?

00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:54.702 align:middle line:84%
And we look at what
Philip Corso said--

00:50:54.702 --> 00:50:55.910 align:middle line:90%
did I just steal your answer?

00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GOUGH: Yeah.

00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:58.048 align:middle line:90%
>>ENOCH: I know-- telepathy.

00:50:58.048 --> 00:50:59.200 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Andy.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ENOCH: So Phillip Corso--

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:04.490 align:middle line:84%
Philip Corso, the
day after Roswell.

00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And we start looking at the
idea of these things that--

00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:09.920 align:middle line:84%
little versions of
these inventions

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:11.270 align:middle line:90%
existed in different forms.

00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:12.928 align:middle line:84%
But you get things
like Velcro, you

00:51:12.928 --> 00:51:14.720 align:middle line:84%
get things like
transistors, you get things

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:17.030 align:middle line:84%
like LEDs, which we use
for Christmas lights.

00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:18.830 align:middle line:84%
It's an interesting
use for them.

00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:21.050 align:middle line:90%
You get nitinol.

00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:23.302 align:middle line:84%
Nickel and titanium,
memory metal,

00:51:23.302 --> 00:51:24.510 align:middle line:90%
and all these kind of things.

00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:26.218 align:middle line:84%
And all of this stuff
gets stripped down.

00:51:26.218 --> 00:51:27.740 align:middle line:84%
So you have the
statement you made

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:30.090 align:middle line:84%
about us being 300 years
ahead of where we should be.

00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:31.430 align:middle line:90%
It's a very accurate one.

00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:33.370 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look
around us, a lot of us

00:51:33.370 --> 00:51:35.037 align:middle line:84%
aren't really prepared
for what we have.

00:51:35.037 --> 00:51:37.550 align:middle line:84%
We should be in the T model
forward stage right now still,

00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:38.480 align:middle line:90%
but we're not.

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.730 align:middle line:84%
We're holding around
these shiny little cell

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:43.250 align:middle line:84%
phones and smartwatches
and things like that.

00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And the way that we're
evolving right now

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:48.140 align:middle line:84%
I think from this
technological standpoint

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:49.910 align:middle line:90%
is a very interesting one.

00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:53.510 align:middle line:84%
I know my conversations
I have with Billy--

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:55.612 align:middle line:84%
he sleeps four hours
a day, this guy.

00:51:55.612 --> 00:51:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And he's always reading
some kind of news

00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:58.250 align:middle line:90%
when I talk to him.

00:51:58.250 --> 00:52:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And he's probably seen
this article already.

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:04.700 align:middle line:84%
They did this experiment with
the AI with the Xenobots,

00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:06.770 align:middle line:84%
where you take these
frog eggs, right,

00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:08.930 align:middle line:84%
frog eggs, where AI
could replicate itself

00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:10.500 align:middle line:90%
very well and very fast.

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's a lot
of admonishments there.

00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:15.080 align:middle line:84%
We have to be careful
with AI and where

00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:16.070 align:middle line:90%
we're going with that.

00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Have you any of
you seen the news

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:21.410 align:middle line:84%
about Google's AI right now
that hired its own attorney?

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:24.380 align:middle line:84%
That it's showing
that it's sentient?

00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:27.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, at this current
stage war where

00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:29.960 align:middle line:84%
I live in Budapest, Hungary,
we have robots everywhere.

00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:30.973 align:middle line:90%
We walk into the mall.

00:52:30.973 --> 00:52:32.390 align:middle line:84%
There's a robot
that talks to you.

00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:33.260 align:middle line:90%
It moves its arms.

00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:34.610 align:middle line:84%
It will tell you
where the Starbucks.

00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:35.527 align:middle line:90%
It will walk with you.

00:52:35.527 --> 00:52:36.920 align:middle line:90%
We have cafes with robots.

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:37.970 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:40.040 align:middle line:84%
But when we look at
the AI right now,

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:43.700 align:middle line:84%
we were only working in
absolutes of ones and zeros.

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:45.717 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you can
fit a quantum computer

00:52:45.717 --> 00:52:47.300 align:middle line:84%
inside of a robot's
head, you're going

00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:49.010 align:middle line:90%
to have synthetic intelligence.

00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And in the next 15
to 20 years, we're

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:53.035 align:middle line:84%
going to be talking
about robot rights

00:52:53.035 --> 00:52:55.160 align:middle line:84%
like we talk about all the
other rights out there--

00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:57.098 align:middle line:84%
animal rights and
everything like that.

00:52:57.098 --> 00:52:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Where we're going to evolve
with all these technologies

00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:00.765 align:middle line:84%
is going to get
very interesting.

00:53:00.765 --> 00:53:04.040 align:middle line:84%
So going back to our
earlier conversation, that's

00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:07.160 align:middle line:84%
why we have to approach
these things in a very

00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:09.060 align:middle line:90%
responsible way, don't we?

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Now what were you
going to attack?

00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:12.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GOUGH: Am I supposed
to follow that?

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Andrew.

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:16.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GOUGH: No, I was just going
to add on to the 1947 theme,

00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:20.210 align:middle line:84%
that March 1947 saw the
most decorated and respected

00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:23.390 align:middle line:84%
military person in American
history come out and say--

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:27.613 align:middle line:84%
Admiral Byrd I'm
referring to, that--

00:53:27.613 --> 00:53:29.780 align:middle line:84%
and this is at the end of
Operation High Jump, where

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:35.060 align:middle line:84%
he had 4,000 people, 13
warships, all kinds of planes,

00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:37.620 align:middle line:84%
infrastructure he
couldn't possibly manage.

00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Imagine to go
explore Antarctica.

00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And comes back and
says, we need to be

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:47.850 align:middle line:84%
really concerned about being
attacked from advanced craft

00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:49.020 align:middle line:90%
from either pole.

00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:51.270 align:middle line:90%
So this is in March 1947.

00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:53.970 align:middle line:84%
The first week in
July 1947 is Roswell.

00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Third week in July
1947 is the CIA

00:53:56.850 --> 00:53:58.680 align:middle line:84%
and the Department of
Defense are created.

00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:02.100 align:middle line:84%
So who knows what's been
re-engineered and already

00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:07.290 align:middle line:84%
existed by our own
parallel selves who

00:54:07.290 --> 00:54:12.460 align:middle line:84%
have been living in a different
realm to us not far below?

00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Excellent.

00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:14.060 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:16.680 align:middle line:84%
OK, I've been told in
my ear that we have

00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:18.730 align:middle line:90%
only two more questions left.

00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:21.900 align:middle line:84%
So this young lady and
then that gentleman there,

00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:23.440 align:middle line:90%
and I'm afraid that is it.

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:24.240 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:26.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: So let's go.

00:54:26.550 --> 00:54:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: About Antarctica--

00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:31.290 align:middle line:84%
About Antarctica,
I've heard that there

00:54:31.290 --> 00:54:32.680 align:middle line:90%
is something about that.

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:34.260 align:middle line:90%
It's called jump rooms.

00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering if there
is really such a technology

00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:39.330 align:middle line:90%
such as jump rooms.

00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And you would be able
to use that, what would

00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:49.740 align:middle line:84%
it do to the human mind and
the physics of your person?

00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Would it damage
you if it would be

00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:54.930 align:middle line:90%
used for long periods of time?

00:54:54.930 --> 00:54:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ENOCH: There's a
gentleman out there

00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:59.310 align:middle line:84%
that was around
many years ago that

00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:01.620 align:middle line:84%
was talking about this
particular terminology

00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:02.880 align:middle line:90%
and how these worked.

00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And I believe he was interviewed
by one of the fellows that's

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:11.130 align:middle line:84%
in here, Myles Johnson at
bases, as well as Kerry

00:55:11.130 --> 00:55:12.280 align:middle line:90%
Cassidy interviewed him.

00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:15.090 align:middle line:84%
His name was Henry
Deacon, Arthur Newman.

00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And he talked about these things
in a rather serious matter

00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:19.170 align:middle line:84%
if you listen to
what he was saying.

00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And I believe these are based on
all sorts of interesting ideas.

00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:26.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have all kinds
of old ideas about star

00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:27.772 align:middle line:90%
gates around our planet.

00:55:27.772 --> 00:55:28.980 align:middle line:90%
I mentioned all around Egypt.

00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:31.900 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about them
earlier in Babylon and whatnot.

00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:33.820 align:middle line:84%
But really, if you
think about it,

00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:35.310 align:middle line:84%
it's really not
that hard when you

00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:38.460 align:middle line:84%
think of our universe like
a symphonic construct.

00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And that like we
were saying earlier,

00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:44.040 align:middle line:84%
you could take, time,
gravity, and lineal

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:47.850 align:middle line:84%
proportional distance and
transpose it on itself,

00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:49.863 align:middle line:84%
and you could move
in different places.

00:55:49.863 --> 00:55:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole other
different discussion.

00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:54.870 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to Antarctica,
it's very interesting

00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:58.360 align:middle line:90%
that when Obama was president--

00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:00.900 align:middle line:84%
do you remember back
in 2012 and those times

00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:03.867 align:middle line:84%
when there was a nice field trip
that went on over to Mumbai?

00:56:03.867 --> 00:56:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He went there.

00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:06.242 align:middle line:90%
>>ENOCH: Yeah, and Afghanistan.

00:56:06.242 --> 00:56:09.045 align:middle line:90%
They're maybe looking at Vimana.

00:56:09.045 --> 00:56:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And then do you remember
that nice field trip

00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:12.300 align:middle line:84%
where everyone, all
of a sudden, all

00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:14.425 align:middle line:84%
these guys these important
guys had to take a field

00:56:14.425 --> 00:56:15.450 align:middle line:90%
trip for no reason?

00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Just Antarctica is
such a great place

00:56:18.090 --> 00:56:21.812 align:middle line:84%
to go see with all these whales
and penguins and everything.

00:56:21.812 --> 00:56:23.520 align:middle line:84%
They said, oh, we all
got to go up there.

00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:25.645 align:middle line:84%
And even you guys remember
reading in the paper how

00:56:25.645 --> 00:56:27.300 align:middle line:90%
Buzz Aldrin got sick?

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:29.490 align:middle line:84%
They took a little
field trip up there.

00:56:29.490 --> 00:56:31.350 align:middle line:84%
There's most certainly
things up there.

00:56:31.350 --> 00:56:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GOUGH: And you have every
country on the planet,

00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:36.960 align:middle line:84%
they argue about what language,
what currency, what policy.

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:40.800 align:middle line:84%
The one single thing that
all countries agree on--

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:43.690 align:middle line:84%
stay the heck away
from Antarctica.

00:56:43.690 --> 00:56:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Yeah.

00:56:44.490 --> 00:56:46.800 align:middle line:90%
Anybody else on this?

00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, recently
there was an article--

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:51.300 align:middle line:84%
well, actually, it
was a FOIA document

00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:52.690 align:middle line:90%
that somebody had gotten.

00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think Linda Moulton
Howe talked about this

00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:59.160 align:middle line:90%
in one of her broadcasts.

00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Somebody submitted a FOIA
request about military testing

00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:04.230 align:middle line:90%
in Antarctica.

00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it
was the army, it

00:57:07.830 --> 00:57:11.040 align:middle line:84%
might have been the Air Force,
released some information.

00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:14.700 align:middle line:84%
But it was very cryptic,
highly redacted.

00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And it talked about Operation
Spartan and Operation Zeus.

00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:23.990 align:middle line:84%
They don't talk
about what they were.

00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:25.190 align:middle line:90%
Everything is redacted.

00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And now there's people
out there that immediately

00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:33.290 align:middle line:84%
jumped to the conclusion
that Spartan and Zeus,

00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:36.080 align:middle line:84%
with some knowledge
from within, were

00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:39.180 align:middle line:84%
some kind of weapons
testing that occurred down

00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:39.980 align:middle line:90%
in Antarctica.

00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:44.060 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know what time
frame this allegedly happened.

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:49.850 align:middle line:84%
But we know now that there
was a large contingent of Navy

00:57:49.850 --> 00:57:51.470 align:middle line:90%
personnel that went down there.

00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:55.550 align:middle line:84%
They spent six months
during that summer.

00:57:55.550 --> 00:57:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And they tested
Zeus and Spartan.

00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:59.810 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what that is.

00:57:59.810 --> 00:58:01.850 align:middle line:84%
So it could very well
have been some kind

00:58:01.850 --> 00:58:04.350 align:middle line:90%
of weapon or something else.

00:58:04.350 --> 00:58:05.227 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Anybody else?

00:58:05.227 --> 00:58:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: Finish
off with one thing.

00:58:06.810 --> 00:58:10.700 align:middle line:84%
In esoteric dowsing lore,
the most strongest form

00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:13.430 align:middle line:84%
of Earth energy
that Gaia produces

00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:15.020 align:middle line:90%
is called the negative green.

00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was really researched
by French diviners in about

00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:21.020 align:middle line:90%
the 1930s or the 1940s.

00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's said to
be in Antarctica.

00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And what happened in
the laboratory of two

00:58:26.570 --> 00:58:30.470 align:middle line:84%
French diviners, they
filled an object up so much

00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:32.660 align:middle line:84%
with the negative
green, he was found.

00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:34.760 align:middle line:84%
He's called Chaumery
and de Belizal.

00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And Chaumery was found
mummified in his laboratory.

00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And what I've seen the negative
green by a master dowser do,

00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:46.550 align:middle line:84%
if you've got a stake that
big, and you introduce it,

00:58:46.550 --> 00:58:49.140 align:middle line:90%
it shrinks down.

00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:53.120 align:middle line:84%
There's only a few places on
this planet that has that.

00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And Himmler, like I said
in my talk, presentation,

00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:59.870 align:middle line:84%
it was Himmler that
was looking at all

00:58:59.870 --> 00:59:03.530 align:middle line:84%
of these color frequencies
in the land of Earth energies

00:59:03.530 --> 00:59:04.460 align:middle line:90%
and ley lines.

00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And they were doing that
way, way back in the '40s.

00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:08.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: OK.

00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Thank you.

00:59:09.050 --> 00:59:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Billy.

00:59:09.850 --> 00:59:14.318 align:middle line:90%


00:59:14.318 --> 00:59:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Only one thing I
have to say about Antarctica

00:59:16.610 --> 00:59:20.990 align:middle line:84%
is there is about a 35-meter
wide opening in Antarctica.

00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:22.970 align:middle line:90%
You can find it on Google Earth.

00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:24.530 align:middle line:90%
It's very easy to locate.

00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And around this opening,
there is every major country

00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:30.560 align:middle line:84%
in the world has a
base, a research base.

00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:32.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a no war zone.

00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:33.740 align:middle line:90%
You cannot fight there.

00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:35.120 align:middle line:90%
It is guarded by military.

00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:37.820 align:middle line:84%
But the people there themselves,
there is a no war zone.

00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And you have every major
country is there with a research

00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:44.090 align:middle line:84%
base all working in
full collaboration

00:59:44.090 --> 00:59:45.500 align:middle line:90%
around this opening.

00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's only one other base
there that is not a country.

00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's owned by the
Rockefeller Foundation.

00:59:53.090 --> 00:59:54.530 align:middle line:90%
And this is very easy to find.

00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:55.590 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can look it up.

00:59:55.590 --> 00:59:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GOUGH: Yeah.

00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:57.362 align:middle line:84%
>>HOST: Right, I've
been told to make

00:59:57.362 --> 00:59:58.920 align:middle line:90%
the last question very quick.

00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:00.575 align:middle line:84%
So let's go to
the last question.

01:00:00.575 --> 01:00:01.700 align:middle line:90%
Let's hope it's a good one.

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:03.080 align:middle line:90%
Not what's your favorite color.

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:05.032 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:00:05.032 --> 01:00:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I did have
a longer question,

01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:08.210 align:middle line:84%
but I guess I'll give you
a short one then, given

01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:09.127 align:middle line:90%
the time restrictions.

01:00:09.127 --> 01:00:11.060 align:middle line:84%
So do you think
that the furthering

01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:13.130 align:middle line:84%
of our understanding
of human consciousness

01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:15.920 align:middle line:84%
and the capacity for it to be
non-local in terms of the wider

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:18.500 align:middle line:84%
universe is a
necessary component

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.060 align:middle line:84%
to understanding
and appreciating

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:21.540 align:middle line:90%
the UFO phenomenon?

01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:22.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Good question.

01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:24.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:25.750 align:middle line:90%
That is a good one.

01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:27.063 align:middle line:90%
Who wants that?

01:00:27.063 --> 01:00:27.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ENOCH: I'll take it.

01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:28.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Jonny.

01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ENOCH: OK.

01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:32.120 align:middle line:84%
If you want to expand
your consciousness

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:33.920 align:middle line:84%
to understand this
phenomena greater,

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.480 align:middle line:90%
become a Gaia subscriber.

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Yeah.

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:43.110 align:middle line:90%


01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:45.470 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, that's--

01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD-WHYKE: But
I think that for us

01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:51.320 align:middle line:84%
to make that leap in
human consciousness,

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:56.810 align:middle line:84%
we do need to start thinking
more and perceiving more

01:00:56.810 --> 01:00:58.160 align:middle line:90%
in a quantum way.

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Right, to shift out of that
old paradigm of Newtonian

01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:06.290 align:middle line:84%
linear materialistic,
rationalistic ways of thinking.

01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about the
physical and into a quantum

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:09.800 align:middle line:90%
way of thinking.

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:13.460 align:middle line:84%
Where, yeah, we can recognize
the interconnectivity of us

01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:14.720 align:middle line:90%
with the whole universe.

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:17.630 align:middle line:84%
That we can recognize
that not just the things

01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:20.840 align:middle line:84%
we do, but also the things
we think and the things we

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:25.160 align:middle line:84%
say send that quantum
entangled information out

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.270 align:middle line:90%
throughout the whole cosmos.

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to
recognize, if we

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:33.920 align:middle line:84%
want to make the leap to also
being citizens of the galaxy

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:36.020 align:middle line:84%
and citizens of the
universe and interacting

01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:38.310 align:middle line:84%
with these other
galactic beings,

01:01:38.310 --> 01:01:40.430 align:middle line:84%
then we also need to
recognize the impact

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:45.180 align:middle line:84%
that we have upon that entangled
cosmic web of consciousness.

01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:48.030 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, I would say for sure.

01:01:48.030 --> 01:01:48.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: OK.

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:51.068 align:middle line:90%
Anybody else?

01:01:51.068 --> 01:01:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Just to
add on what Theresa

01:01:52.610 --> 01:01:54.068 align:middle line:84%
said, well she said
it beautifully,

01:01:54.068 --> 01:01:55.740 align:middle line:90%
is there's a butterfly effect.

01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And so what we do here
impacts the entire universe.

01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:01.130 align:middle line:90%
Maybe even the multiverse.

01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:03.410 align:middle line:84%
So every thought we
think, every action

01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:07.012 align:middle line:84%
that we put behind that
thought, is a cause and effect.

01:02:07.012 --> 01:02:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And that cause and effect will
have a ripple in space time,

01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:11.727 align:middle line:84%
maybe throughout
even multidimensions.

01:02:11.727 --> 01:02:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And so it's important here
that we get our act together.

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:15.810 align:middle line:84%
Because what we're
doing here is affecting

01:02:15.810 --> 01:02:18.050 align:middle line:90%
everyone and everything.

01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HOST: If we finish it, I
think that is a perfect answer.

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:24.520 align:middle line:84%
So everything we do,
everything we think

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:26.530 align:middle line:90%
affects the entire universe.

01:02:26.530 --> 01:02:28.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
fantastic, isn't it?

01:02:28.730 --> 01:02:31.600 align:middle line:84%
This is what you get when
you have geniuses answering

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:32.630 align:middle line:90%
questions.

01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:36.370 align:middle line:84%
