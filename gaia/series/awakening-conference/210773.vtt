00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.388 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.388 --> 00:00:19.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Now what I'm going to be
talking about is the latest

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.550 align:middle line:84%
publication that I have written,
the Deceptions of Gods and Men.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.850 align:middle line:10%
Now, this particular book,
it will be a challenge for us

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.430 align:middle line:10%
when we review the information.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.460 align:middle line:10%
When we perceive these
fraudulent messages

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.450 align:middle line:10%
from beyond, and it reveals
a disturbing connection

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.350 align:middle line:10%
with the world of the paranormal
ufology, cryptozoology,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.060 align:middle line:10%
and the occult.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.740 align:middle line:10%
Now what we tend to find is
with this phenomena, when

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.110 align:middle line:10%
we continue to work
with it, we find

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.660 align:middle line:10%
that there is a high level of
deception that comes through.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.410 align:middle line:10%
And this is something we
need to be very aware of.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.620 align:middle line:10%
We need to listen
to what we're being

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.910 align:middle line:10%
told through our own
gift of discernment.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.090 align:middle line:10%
Now there is a lot of
phenomena that they

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.980 align:middle line:10%
use to interact with us on,
and there are many masks

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.600 align:middle line:10%
as to how that will appear.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.200 align:middle line:10%
But it's up to us
on how we decipher

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.970 align:middle line:10%
that particular
information, and if we

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.170 align:middle line:10%
wish to accept that information
is more important as well.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.880 align:middle line:10%
Now when we tend to
have this encounter,

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.630 align:middle line:10%
we have what we call
the 20-second window.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.210 align:middle line:10%
When the appearance
happens, and for instance,

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.880 align:middle line:10%
if we're looking into the area
of ufology in its truest form,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.080 align:middle line:10%
not the made stuff that
we're creating nowadays,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.320 align:middle line:10%
we tend to find this, for
instance, the light in the sky,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.640 align:middle line:10%
flashing light.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.640 align:middle line:90%
That is the hook and bait.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.530 align:middle line:84%
That's something
very, very important.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Within the 20-second
rule, what we tend to see

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.610 align:middle line:84%
is if we are not
listening to our instinct,

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.940 align:middle line:84%
our gift of discernment,
then the 20-second rule

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.110 align:middle line:90%
can be overridden.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Within the 20
seconds, our instincts

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.730 align:middle line:84%
are telling us what I'm seeing
is right, or it's wrong.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And if your body
is already engaging

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.740 align:middle line:84%
with particular key factors
that I will talk about later,

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.520 align:middle line:84%
and you're not listening to it,
then after this 20-second rule,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.900 align:middle line:84%
then all is lost because
within that, the body then

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.440 align:middle line:84%
tends to be pushed into
a theta brain rhythm

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.040 align:middle line:90%
with the observer effect.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.220 align:middle line:84%
But within the feed
of band rhythm,

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.070 align:middle line:84%
we tend to find that
this is a place where

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.140 align:middle line:84%
we would go to within
deep meditation as adults.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's also a place where we
find hypnotic suggestion works

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.400 align:middle line:90%
the best.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And also the idea of
false memory coming in

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.870 align:middle line:84%
can also be placed there during
this particular instance.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.080 align:middle line:84%
So the 20-second rule
is very, very important

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.280 align:middle line:90%
with the initial encounter.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.350 align:middle line:90%
And that comes with all of it.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.630 align:middle line:90%


00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.400 align:middle line:10%
The hook and bait is
what I talked about,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:29.170 align:middle line:10%
is to get ahead of our response,
our innate curiosity, which

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.360 align:middle line:10%
we all have when we
see this going off.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.740 align:middle line:10%
What's that?

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.820 align:middle line:10%
So we all want to see it.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.660 align:middle line:10%
And I am no more different
than everyone sitting here

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.310 align:middle line:10%
in the audience.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.490 align:middle line:10%
Our fascination is
captured by the phenomena.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.510 align:middle line:10%
And after that, after that
20-second rule, we're hooked.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.520 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.180 align:middle line:10%
Now we can see this
style of hook and bait

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.650 align:middle line:10%
across all of the
fringe research fields.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.380 align:middle line:10%
And when we consider this aspect
of the false memory, the screen

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.940 align:middle line:10%
memory, which is a term that
we tend to find within ufology.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Screen memory in itself
blocks traumatic events.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's a way for our
brain to block it out.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.990 align:middle line:84%
But you must understand, for a
screen memory to take effect,

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.580 align:middle line:84%
it's because of
something we saw.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.230 align:middle line:90%
That is the trigger.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:31.880 align:middle line:10%
Now the big question is are we
using it, or are they using it?

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
many people who have

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.040 align:middle line:84%
encounters, even within this
room, who have encounters,

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.950 align:middle line:90%
but they can't remember.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.990 align:middle line:84%
But there are key
signatures within the body

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.680 align:middle line:84%
in which we can identify
those particular encounters.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.430 align:middle line:84%
Now again, the big
question is what are you?

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.350 align:middle line:84%
When we initially
make that encounter,

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.730 align:middle line:84%
what exactly are you that's
coming through and wanting

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.770 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with us?

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.420 align:middle line:10%
Now within the greater
fields of research,

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.220 align:middle line:10%
we tend to find within ufology.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.310 align:middle line:10%
For instance, we tend
to find missing time.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.780 align:middle line:10%
That phenomena of missing time.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.340 align:middle line:10%
Someone arrives at a site.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.140 align:middle line:10%
And suddenly, two hours, three
hours later, they're back

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.040 align:middle line:10%
but they can't explain
where that time went.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.900 align:middle line:10%
This is a phenomena very, very
common within the UFO field.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.330 align:middle line:10%
The mischievous nature
behind the phenomena

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.950 align:middle line:10%
can also be a problem.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.840 align:middle line:10%
Abduction, mutilation,
conscious connection.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.040 align:middle line:10%
Again, we're back to this
aspect of the hook and bait.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.960 align:middle line:84%
They have that
conscious connection

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.450 align:middle line:84%
that they need to
link to you on.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.410 align:middle line:10%
And again, as I
indicated in the panel,

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.630 align:middle line:10%
there is an esoteric
value to this

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.510 align:middle line:10%
in which it can be summoned.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.980 align:middle line:90%
The CE5 is a perfect example.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.020 align:middle line:90%
It can be summoned.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.400 align:middle line:90%
People sitting in meditation.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.570 align:middle line:90%
There beam the lights up.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:59.860 align:middle line:90%
The intention is there.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.120 align:middle line:90%
Intention is everything.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.770 align:middle line:90%


00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is another aspect
that we need to consider.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.380 align:middle line:84%
The deception that comes
with the true phenomena.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.820 align:middle line:90%
And not only that.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that you tend

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:21.470 align:middle line:84%
not to hear within a lot
of the ufology field,

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.560 align:middle line:90%
is their aversion to iron.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.690 align:middle line:90%
The Greys hate iron.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:29.490 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.510 align:middle line:90%


00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Now when we cross this
list, a very short list

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.370 align:middle line:84%
of an extended piece of
course into Earth spirits,

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:45.560 align:middle line:84%
the world of the djinn, the
old gods, it's all the same.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.660 align:middle line:90%
The phenomena is the same.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that we
started to do within the book.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Myself and Brian
Allen, when we read it,

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.790 align:middle line:84%
we wanted to look at
the phenomena and see

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.010 align:middle line:90%
how do we identify this?

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.780 align:middle line:84%
How do we follow this phenomenon
back into the ages of time?

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Because when we were
tracking the images

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.960 align:middle line:84%
of the old gods, of the jinn, of
the Earth spirits, of the UFO,

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.320 align:middle line:84%
and of the beings said
to be in the UFOs,

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.090 align:middle line:84%
we kept arriving at a brick
wall because suddenly,

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.470 align:middle line:84%
there was nothing more after
that particular period in time.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:23.210 align:middle line:90%
We were losing them.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.630 align:middle line:10%
But when we stripped the
mask away and started

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.495 align:middle line:10%
tracking the phenomena, which
is listed here on the boards,

00:07:30.495 --> 00:07:32.370 align:middle line:10%
that's whenever we
started tracking them back

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.670 align:middle line:10%
into time and back
into the early periods

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.472 align:middle line:10%
of the Mesopotamian period.

00:07:38.472 --> 00:07:40.180 align:middle line:10%
So we can track them
back through history

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.440 align:middle line:10%
and see where they've
been interfering with us.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:49.200 align:middle line:10%
And that opened up a
whole can of worms.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.240 align:middle line:84%
Now I have to say, this
particular aversion to iron

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.240 align:middle line:84%
is something that we
really need to address.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.250 align:middle line:90%
Why iron?

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.208 align:middle line:84%
It seems that
initial investigation

00:08:00.208 --> 00:08:01.750 align:middle line:84%
into this particular
phenomenon would

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.790 align:middle line:84%
suggest that has to
do with the biofield.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.310 align:middle line:90%


00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:09.830 align:middle line:84%
When you introduce iron
into a magnetic field,

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.900 align:middle line:90%
it boosts the field.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.420 align:middle line:10%
Now when we look at
other phenomena that

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.730 align:middle line:10%
appears within the
paranormal realm,

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.800 align:middle line:10%
such as the night attacks.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.810 align:middle line:10%
Many of you will have
heard of the incubus

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.840 align:middle line:10%
and the succubus attacks
that attacked sleepers

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.680 align:middle line:10%
in the confines
of their bedrooms.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.660 align:middle line:10%
Now there is a difference
between the incubus

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:34.260 align:middle line:10%
and succubus and sleep
paralysis, the scientific term

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.070 align:middle line:10%
of sleep paralysis.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.770 align:middle line:10%
Two distinct characteristics.

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.539 align:middle line:10%
But with the incubus
and succubus,

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:42.120 align:middle line:10%
it's interesting to know that
nine times out of 10, they will

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.860 align:middle line:10%
attack women more than men.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.900 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Because when the women
enter their monthly cycle,

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.700 align:middle line:90%
many become anemic.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.980 align:middle line:90%
The iron count drops.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:90%
They wait.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:08:59.690 align:middle line:90%
They're predatorial.

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:02.420 align:middle line:84%
They will wait
until that happens.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.150 align:middle line:90%
That's when they strike.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Greys, as I said, and I've had
personal experience with this,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.400 align:middle line:84%
Greys are petrified
of this phenomenon.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.090 align:middle line:84%
We also know Brian,
of course, sitting

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:16.720 align:middle line:84%
at the back of the room,
is also aware of stories

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.660 align:middle line:84%
of the djinn in which
iron was the element that

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.880 align:middle line:90%
counteracted its approach.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:28.020 align:middle line:90%
Now, the trinity of life.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.110 align:middle line:84%
For this, we really have
to understand who we are.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is very,
very important.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.260 align:middle line:84%
You see, we live
in a modern society

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.350 align:middle line:84%
in which we use the
term soul and spirit,

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:42.250 align:middle line:90%
and it's interchangeable.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.717 align:middle line:84%
We find this within the
metaphysical fields.

00:09:44.717 --> 00:09:46.800 align:middle line:84%
My soul, this my spirit,
whatever the case may be.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.760 align:middle line:90%
And it's all the same thing.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.650 align:middle line:90%
This is our mistake.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.350 align:middle line:90%
Our ancestors spoke about this.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.620 align:middle line:90%
And the two are separate.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Two distinct aspects in us
that join within the body

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.290 align:middle line:90%
and form a trinity.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:11.150 align:middle line:84%
The soul's job is to keep the
body alive as long as possible.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.400 align:middle line:10%
This meatsuit.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.100 align:middle line:10%
And it's the source of
our psychic abilities.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:21.630 align:middle line:84%
All our psychic abilities
are signatures of the soul.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.030 align:middle line:84%
It's thriving,
and it really does

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:27.960 align:middle line:84%
thrive in our lowest
energies that deals with our

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.470 align:middle line:90%
wants, our needs, our lusts.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:35.430 align:middle line:84%
But it also keeps the
meatsuit alive as long as

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:41.190 align:middle line:84%
possible because that allows
the spirit to experience.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Now when you have a balanced
system, that is perfect.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.170 align:middle line:84%
For many of us, we do
have a balanced system.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And we go through life, and
we don't experience anything.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:56.600 align:middle line:84%
The body, of course,
as I say, is the vessel

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.070 align:middle line:90%
for the soul and spirit.

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.950 align:middle line:84%
But it should be also noted
that from the pages of the Opera

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Omnia, the texts speak of the
power, a balanced shadow, which

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:07.290 align:middle line:90%
is the soul.

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:12.260 align:middle line:84%
The balanced shadow possesses,
stating demons fear shadows.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Now that means that what's
outside is afraid of us.

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.250 align:middle line:90%
A perfectly balanced trinity.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.610 align:middle line:84%
They fear to come near
us because our soul is

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:26.320 align:middle line:90%
designed to keep us safe.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.240 align:middle line:90%


00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:35.400 align:middle line:10%
Now everything that has
lived possesses a soul.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.530 align:middle line:10%
That goes without question.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.960 align:middle line:10%
And days after
death of the vessel,

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.760 align:middle line:10%
the soul returns to its origin.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.470 align:middle line:10%
And this is a very
important point.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:49.720 align:middle line:10%
It returns to a
place of nothing.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.505 align:middle line:10%
Absolute nothing.

00:11:51.505 --> 00:11:54.230 align:middle line:10%


00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:58.430 align:middle line:10%
The Scole Experiment on
the 6th of March 1998

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:01.950 align:middle line:10%
was exceptional in what it did.

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:03.530 align:middle line:10%
Now they made contact
with an entity

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:07.400 align:middle line:10%
known as Sharoness that
came from a dimension

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.870 align:middle line:10%
of nothingness.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:11.750 align:middle line:10%
Here we start to see the
clues that is coming back

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.850 align:middle line:10%
through the veil.

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:17.990 align:middle line:10%
And this also is related
to the other experiences

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:22.700 align:middle line:10%
within ufology and the
other things as well.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.580 align:middle line:10%
So within the Scole
Experiment that

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.160 align:middle line:10%
run for a five-year
period, the centers

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.427 align:middle line:10%
were meeting twice a week.

00:12:29.427 --> 00:12:31.510 align:middle line:10%
And there are some people
here within the audience

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:34.870 align:middle line:10%
who did attend that particular
series of experiments.

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:38.650 align:middle line:10%
And they got to witness
the phenomena themselves.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:42.810 align:middle line:10%
And the information that
was in that was vital,

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:44.850 align:middle line:10%
but there were some
nuggets of information

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:48.600 align:middle line:10%
that came through that were
really essential for us

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.285 align:middle line:10%
understanding what was beyond
the veil for the shadow,

00:12:52.285 --> 00:12:53.085 align:middle line:10%
for the soul.

00:12:53.085 --> 00:12:56.470 align:middle line:90%


00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.510 align:middle line:10%
It was at point of
death, it should

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:02.360 align:middle line:10%
be noted, that when the
soul breaks from the body,

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.840 align:middle line:10%
according to the
ancient texts, they

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:10.080 align:middle line:10%
do retain knowledge of their
life of which they had lived

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:14.160 align:middle line:10%
and have access to all
knowledge within the void.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.490 align:middle line:10%
All the knowledge that
retracts back after death.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:19.710 align:middle line:10%
Today, we call it the
global consciousness,

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:23.865 align:middle line:10%
and Edgar Cayce called
it the Akashic records.

00:13:23.865 --> 00:13:26.570 align:middle line:10%


00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:32.420 align:middle line:10%
Now we can also access
the Akashic records.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.420 align:middle line:10%
Many of us in here are
practitioners, of course,

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.870 align:middle line:10%
understand that we can
tap in to the knowledge.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:39.300 align:middle line:10%
That knowledge is
beyond the veil.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:45.360 align:middle line:10%
We use our shadows, our souls
to access that, remote viewing.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.390 align:middle line:90%


00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.610 align:middle line:10%
All of this psychic
abilities are

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:56.380 align:middle line:10%
all aspects of the soul, which
manifest through the body.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.250 align:middle line:84%
So those are the
things to consider.

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And especially when we
think about that, it's us,

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:08.040 align:middle line:84%
we can open the portals and
the vortexes to the other side.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:13.830 align:middle line:84%
The doorways which lead
us to these other places.

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:16.680 align:middle line:10%
Now how do we do that?

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.870 align:middle line:10%
It's exceptionally easy.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.120 align:middle line:10%
And we've got shows,
which of course, I'm

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.520 align:middle line:10%
responsible in part.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:27.180 align:middle line:10%
We have shows that will go
into a haunted property,

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:30.830 align:middle line:10%
and we use such an easy
thing as a voice recorder.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.510 align:middle line:10%
Is there anyone there?

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:34.250 align:middle line:10%
Can you come close to me?

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:39.700 align:middle line:10%
That intent is
all that it takes.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:43.780 align:middle line:10%
That intent, even from a
euphological standpoint,

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.100 align:middle line:10%
is all that it takes.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.180 align:middle line:10%
We stand outside.

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.440 align:middle line:10%
We make that contact.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.700 align:middle line:10%
Oh, I hope I can see them.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:49.960 align:middle line:90%
I hope, I want.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.080 align:middle line:90%
That intention is there.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.170 align:middle line:10%
It's the intention
that draws it in.

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:57.490 align:middle line:10%
It opens the door to that.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:00.070 align:middle line:84%
The problem within
the modern sense

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:03.470 align:middle line:84%
of paranormal
investigating, of course,

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:09.830 align:middle line:84%
is that although we may open
the door, we forget to close it.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And that can cause
a real problem.

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Because although you go into
a property and you think,

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.670 align:middle line:84%
oh, well, there
was nothing there.

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.940 align:middle line:90%
I tried, and we left.

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:24.030 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing to say that two
days later, two weeks later,

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:26.810 align:middle line:84%
two months later, that
the phenomena will finally

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:28.580 align:middle line:90%
come through.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.520 align:middle line:84%
So we have to be very,
very aware of that.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And another aspect to this,
the paranormal investigating,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.590 align:middle line:90%
of course, is the Ouija board.

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:36.740 align:middle line:90%
It gets a bad rap.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.560 align:middle line:90%
A bad rap.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say
that that, of course,

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:46.870 align:middle line:84%
is a concentration
of the intent.

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:49.480 align:middle line:84%
You've now gone from one
person with a voice recorder

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:54.950 align:middle line:84%
to four people wanting this
communication to develop.

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:57.620 align:middle line:10%
You've created a bigger door.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
don't understand that.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And that, of course,
can be a problem.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:09.720 align:middle line:10%
The late Robert Monroe,
he was a prolific out

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.310 align:middle line:10%
of body experiencer.

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:14.280 align:middle line:10%
He is also someone
that experienced

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.750 align:middle line:10%
this place of nothing.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:23.010 align:middle line:10%
And it seems that it was a
place very, very close to us.

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:25.110 align:middle line:10%
And he talked about when
he released himself,

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:28.530 align:middle line:10%
and he could do this within
the laboratory conditions.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.060 align:middle line:10%
And eventually
ended up setting up

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.930 align:middle line:10%
the Monroe Institute
in Virginia,

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:33.930 align:middle line:10%
which is still active today.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:37.830 align:middle line:10%
But what he could do is release
himself, decouple himself

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:40.310 align:middle line:10%
from the body and go.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:41.660 align:middle line:10%
Again, this is an aspect.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:47.900 align:middle line:10%
It's the ability of the soul to
do what it was designed to do.

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:53.150 align:middle line:10%
And he talked about
this area between here

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:56.840 align:middle line:10%
and there, in which
there was almost

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.240 align:middle line:10%
like an ocean of nothingness.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.380 align:middle line:10%
Blackness.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:05.520 align:middle line:10%
But he talked about the
things that were in there.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.630 align:middle line:10%
He said, there was almost
like an entity of itself

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:12.550 align:middle line:10%
within the darkness.

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:16.540 align:middle line:84%
It was rudimentary
in its basic forms,

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:19.450 align:middle line:90%
but could think independently.

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.390 align:middle line:10%
He said, we can
attract its attention

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:26.500 align:middle line:10%
when we're passing over to
get to that other place.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.040 align:middle line:84%
He also said that when
he was crossing over,

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.970 align:middle line:90%
he got to learn to slow down.

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:37.280 align:middle line:84%
He had to travel across this
vastness of nothing, slowly.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.740 align:middle line:84%
Because if he traveled fast,
he caught their attention.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.640 align:middle line:10%
But the warning that
he gave before he died

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.700 align:middle line:10%
is that when we're
coming back, we

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:52.540 align:middle line:10%
have to be equally calm and
collected and travel back

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:53.340 align:middle line:10%
slowly.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:57.060 align:middle line:10%
Because if we don't we attract
the denizens underneath,

00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:01.570 align:middle line:10%
and we can draw them
back into this world.

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.485 align:middle line:10%
And that in itself takes
the form of the shadow.

00:18:04.485 --> 00:18:07.620 align:middle line:90%


00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.200 align:middle line:10%
In the Scole Experiments,
the researchers

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:17.060 align:middle line:10%
were informed that these things,
whatever form they came in,

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:22.020 align:middle line:10%
came from a dimension
not far from our own.

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:22.820 align:middle line:10%
So here we are.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:26.300 align:middle line:10%
We're looking at this
dimensional aspect

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.980 align:middle line:10%
to this world that
we're living in.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:31.790 align:middle line:10%
Something which is
exceptionally close to us.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:35.430 align:middle line:10%
And we could intentionally
open the door just by saying,

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:37.280 align:middle line:10%
is there anyone there?

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.230 align:middle line:10%
And that was enough
to make it happen.

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:42.080 align:middle line:10%


00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.980 align:middle line:10%
There are, of course,
improved techniques

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.580 align:middle line:10%
to detect, and communicate,
and defend ourselves

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.780 align:middle line:10%
from the shadow.

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:57.190 align:middle line:10%
And to understand our
perception and the way

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:59.620 align:middle line:10%
we understand our
bodies, we have

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:03.580 align:middle line:10%
to really look at the signals
and understand the signals that

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.980 align:middle line:10%
are coming to us
through our body, which

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.860 align:middle line:10%
are signals via the soul.

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.710 align:middle line:10%
The soul is your
first line of defense.

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:13.690 align:middle line:90%
As you enter a property.

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And for instance,
a lot of people

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:17.410 align:middle line:90%
will understand real estate.

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:19.960 align:middle line:10%
That when we go into a
property, and although there

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:26.470 align:middle line:10%
could be four walls, and there's
nothing there to stimulate us,

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:28.420 align:middle line:10%
yet we get this amazing feeling.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:30.100 align:middle line:10%
We say, that's great.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.290 align:middle line:90%
That feeling is tremendous.

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And we can buy the property
just by own feeling.

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And 75% of properties are
bought on feeling according

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:41.470 align:middle line:90%
to real estate agents.

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.710 align:middle line:10%
But yet, equally, we
can walk into a property

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:46.030 align:middle line:10%
and say, no, I don't like this.

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:47.320 align:middle line:10%
There's something
not right here.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.120 align:middle line:10%
And we leave.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.150 align:middle line:10%
Well, what is that?

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:51.890 align:middle line:10%
That's our signal.

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:56.150 align:middle line:10%
That's our shadow
telling us, be aware.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:57.530 align:middle line:90%
There's another shadow here.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:02.470 align:middle line:90%


00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:04.990 align:middle line:10%
Whenever I wrote the
book The Influence,

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:06.940 align:middle line:10%
which was available at
the back of the room,

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.110 align:middle line:10%
it is all gone now.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:10.770 align:middle line:10%


00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.800 align:middle line:10%
That, particular book,
I was given a warning.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.930 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't understand
the Warning at the time

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:16.980 align:middle line:10%
when it came through.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.730 align:middle line:10%
It said, don't become too
bright, or they see you.

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:25.520 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, what does
that actually refer to?

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.300 align:middle line:10%
And it turned out
that it was very

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.845 align:middle line:10%
prolific to what was to come.

00:20:30.845 --> 00:20:33.440 align:middle line:10%


00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.990 align:middle line:10%
Our shadow communicates
effectively,

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:39.380 align:middle line:10%
triggering biological
responses through the body,

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:42.630 align:middle line:10%
and are usually ignored.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:44.450 align:middle line:10%
Now I've talked about
the real estate,

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:48.270 align:middle line:10%
about the way that we go into
a property, and we feel it.

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.430 align:middle line:10%
And we examine that.

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:53.070 align:middle line:10%
But many of the clues
of potential dangers

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:58.270 align:middle line:10%
can actually happen before
the events took place.

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:00.780 align:middle line:10%
Now to understand the signals
that were coming through,

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.322 align:middle line:10%
there were laboratory
tests that were

00:21:02.322 --> 00:21:05.580 align:middle line:10%
being conducted on biofeedback.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.130 align:middle line:10%
And during these
tests, the computer

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:10.860 align:middle line:10%
was selecting random images.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.320 align:middle line:10%
And these images were
kitty cats, flowers,

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.340 align:middle line:10%
children laughing.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:18.510 align:middle line:10%
All of the mundane things
that made us feel great.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.970 align:middle line:10%
And as we continually
watch this,

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:27.720 align:middle line:10%
the computer randomly selected
a picture of a car accident.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.620 align:middle line:10%
Now as we were sitting on
the computer being monitored,

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.480 align:middle line:10%
and we were looking at
these wonderful happy

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:37.320 align:middle line:10%
go lucky pictures, our
skin resistance lowered.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.820 align:middle line:10%
It liked what it was seeing.

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:41.670 align:middle line:10%
It went into this state in
which everything was nice

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:43.430 align:middle line:10%
and relaxed.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:47.930 align:middle line:84%
But when the photograph came
of the car accident, suddenly,

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:50.780 align:middle line:90%
our skin resistance shot up.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Our body started
to prepare itself.

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:54.380 align:middle line:84%
The fight or flight
was cutting in.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.797 align:middle line:84%
It didn't like
what it was seeing.

00:21:55.797 --> 00:22:01.940 align:middle line:84%
That's how we understood
our gift of discernment.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:07.550 align:middle line:10%
Because as the program
continued, and the 15 minutes

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:11.390 align:middle line:10%
rolled into half an hour,
which rolled into an hour, what

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:14.930 align:middle line:10%
we started to see
was that milliseconds

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:18.860 align:middle line:10%
before the picture of the
car accident took place,

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:22.370 align:middle line:10%
the body started to react.

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:24.020 align:middle line:84%
The body was
reacting to something

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:26.920 align:middle line:90%
that still hadn't happened.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:32.140 align:middle line:84%
So we have this innate ability
to connect to this greater

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:36.066 align:middle line:84%
world that we have given
little credence to.

00:22:36.066 --> 00:22:40.020 align:middle line:10%
Now, the fight or flight,
our response, of course,

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.740 align:middle line:10%
is the manifestation
of the shadow.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:45.950 align:middle line:10%
It signals the body
of potential threats,

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:49.130 align:middle line:10%
such as other shadows
in your vicinity.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:52.010 align:middle line:10%


00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:54.710 align:middle line:10%
Modern diets, of course,
is something we really

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:56.270 align:middle line:10%
need to consider,
especially today

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:59.150 align:middle line:10%
and today's climate
because they can

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:03.770 align:middle line:10%
affect the body's triggering
signals and our ability

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:07.810 align:middle line:10%
to determine what's
actually going on.

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:10.480 align:middle line:10%
And it's been readily
known for quite some time,

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:14.740 align:middle line:10%
particular foods
and their additives,

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:19.150 align:middle line:10%
about how that can
disorientate us.

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:22.150 align:middle line:10%
Refined sugar can
actually switch off

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:23.785 align:middle line:10%
our gift of discernment.

00:23:23.785 --> 00:23:26.580 align:middle line:10%


00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:29.463 align:middle line:10%
Now when we go to an
investigative field,

00:23:29.463 --> 00:23:30.880 align:middle line:10%
and whether it be
a haunted house,

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.255 align:middle line:10%
whether it be a
urological field,

00:23:32.255 --> 00:23:35.282 align:middle line:10%
whether it be scripted field.

00:23:35.282 --> 00:23:36.740 align:middle line:10%
If we're going
there and we decide,

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:41.210 align:middle line:10%
let's go to the
fast food restaurant

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:43.190 align:middle line:10%
and get something
to eat, and we'll

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:47.240 align:middle line:10%
have a copious amount of soda.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:51.960 align:middle line:10%
That can switch off your
gift of discernment.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:56.670 align:middle line:10%
You've effectively blinded
yourself by refined sugar.

00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:58.980 align:middle line:10%
We're now moving into
a system in which we

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.410 align:middle line:10%
need our gift of discernment.

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:05.190 align:middle line:84%
What's going on daily is
going to start challenging us.

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:07.290 align:middle line:90%
Get off the sugar, folks.

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:08.190 align:middle line:10%
It's imperative.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:09.540 align:middle line:90%
Get off the sugar.

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:13.170 align:middle line:90%


00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:15.630 align:middle line:10%
Our fight or flight
only engages when

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:20.940 align:middle line:10%
a shadow that hasn't our best
intention comes toward us.

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:10%
If there's no threat
detected, our fight or flight

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.870 align:middle line:10%
does not engage.

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:28.460 align:middle line:10%
That's an important
thing to consider

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:31.790 align:middle line:10%
when you're in these
environments, in which you're

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:34.070 align:middle line:10%
depending on the 20-second rule.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:37.370 align:middle line:10%
If your body does
not react, and you've

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:40.620 align:middle line:10%
got to balance within
the 20 seconds,

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:46.230 align:middle line:10%
you will get the message, this
is not right, or this is OK.

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:48.750 align:middle line:10%
We need to listen to that input.

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:52.860 align:middle line:10%
We need to reconnect to
who we are as a species.

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:56.840 align:middle line:90%


00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:00.860 align:middle line:10%
If the conscious connection
has been established quickly,

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:04.280 align:middle line:10%
this can override the
fight or flight response.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:08.560 align:middle line:10%
After the 20-second rule,
that can be overridden.

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:12.310 align:middle line:10%
So we have to be aware of
that particular time scale

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:15.475 align:middle line:10%
when we're being introduced
to these particular places.

00:25:15.475 --> 00:25:19.150 align:middle line:90%


00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:23.230 align:middle line:10%
The combined response is
there for your safety,

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:26.230 align:middle line:10%
and should not be ignored,
and will alert you

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:29.290 align:middle line:10%
no matter what the appearance
the shadow may take.

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:32.860 align:middle line:10%
And this is a very
important key point here.

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.490 align:middle line:10%
No matter what image it takes.

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:39.710 align:middle line:10%
Whether it be of a little child
eating a lollipop or whatever

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:40.510 align:middle line:10%
the case may be.

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:45.100 align:middle line:10%
Or a dog or a gray
alien that appears.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:49.710 align:middle line:10%
If it's not true,
you will pick it up.

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:52.410 align:middle line:90%
Your shadow will alert you.

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Your soul will alert you
to the true identity.

00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:59.190 align:middle line:10%
And to prepare yourself.

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:01.170 align:middle line:10%
The fight or flight
is there for a reason.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:05.110 align:middle line:90%


00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:07.680 align:middle line:10%
The nuts and bolts
craft, of course,

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.050 align:middle line:10%
can appear in encounters.

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:12.240 align:middle line:10%
And it's just as
real as the solid arm

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.280 align:middle line:10%
that appears in the room.

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.473 align:middle line:10%
And not a lot of people
are aware of this,

00:26:16.473 --> 00:26:17.890 align:middle line:10%
that within the
Scole Experiments,

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:20.700 align:middle line:10%
there were appendages
of bodies that

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:24.780 align:middle line:10%
were appearing in solid state,
without the rest of the body,

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.800 align:middle line:10%
of course.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.080 align:middle line:10%
But that wasn't the
only place that we were

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.940 align:middle line:10%
seeing this phenomenon occur.

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:37.350 align:middle line:10%
If we lose our
ability to discern,

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:40.710 align:middle line:10%
we lose our primary defense
against the deception

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:43.830 align:middle line:10%
and attachment.

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:49.350 align:middle line:10%
That again is another
key point to consider.

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:51.000 align:middle line:10%
Now it's interesting.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.630 align:middle line:10%
I just wanted to
put this in that it

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:58.710 align:middle line:10%
has been reported that children,
of course, have an extra sense.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:04.230 align:middle line:10%
They seem to have this
ability to sense spirit,

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.900 align:middle line:10%
if you want to call them that.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:11.070 align:middle line:10%
Ghosts and everything else
that may be around the place.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:11.870 align:middle line:10%
And the shadow.

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:14.670 align:middle line:10%


00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:16.800 align:middle line:10%
And it's also said that
we train them out of it,

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.250 align:middle line:10%
but that's not
necessarily the case.

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:22.740 align:middle line:10%
You see there is a
filter that thickens

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.260 align:middle line:10%
over the eye between
the ages of 7 and 13,

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.620 align:middle line:10%
that narrows the spectral
resonance of a child.

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:32.325 align:middle line:10%
So as adults, we can no longer
see what we saw as children.

00:27:32.325 --> 00:27:35.580 align:middle line:90%


00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:40.710 align:middle line:10%
Not only that, but as a child
between the ages of 2 and 6,

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:46.410 align:middle line:10%
they also are predominantly
in the theta rhythm.

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:48.330 align:middle line:10%
That's their strongest
brain rhythm.

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:50.760 align:middle line:10%
That place where
meditation happens.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:56.430 align:middle line:10%
So they are already tuned
to what's out there.

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:59.340 align:middle line:10%
It's also the adults
that became detuned.

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:04.980 align:middle line:10%
But there may be actual
biological symptoms, of course,

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:07.180 align:middle line:10%
behind that.

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And drugs, drugs are another
thing that can really

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:13.300 align:middle line:84%
affect our gift of
discernment and something

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.260 align:middle line:90%
we should consider.

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:18.130 align:middle line:84%
You see, when we leave
the body, when we project

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:20.260 align:middle line:90%
we're leaving the body behind.

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:22.810 align:middle line:84%
The body is your
seat of discernment.

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:24.970 align:middle line:90%
We need it all.

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:27.245 align:middle line:84%
So my recommendation
is if you're going out

00:28:27.245 --> 00:28:28.870 align:middle line:84%
to locations and
everything, and you're

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:34.340 align:middle line:84%
wanting to experience this,
make sure you stay grounded.

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:36.500 align:middle line:90%
You're there.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And the effects of DMT
should not be underestimated.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.610 align:middle line:84%
I know that there's
great drive for people

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:47.570 align:middle line:84%
to head off to the Amazon
and have these encounters

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:50.300 align:middle line:84%
with reptilian
creatures and everything

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.160 align:middle line:84%
else on the other
side of reality

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.440 align:middle line:90%
after taking a wash of DMT.

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And as I said
yesterday, the idea

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:01.190 align:middle line:84%
of purging myself from
both ends is not nice.

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:03.630 align:middle line:90%
And I prefer not to do that.

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:05.750 align:middle line:84%
But it should also be
noted and something

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.600 align:middle line:84%
that's very rarely
talked about is

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:12.410 align:middle line:84%
that 4% of users who glimpse
the illusion of the other side

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:13.520 align:middle line:90%
later commit suicide.

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.967 align:middle line:90%


00:29:15.967 --> 00:29:18.175 align:middle line:10%
So there's a figure that's
not really battened about.

00:29:18.175 --> 00:29:22.230 align:middle line:90%


00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.270 align:middle line:10%
Now between the ages
of 2 and 6, as I said,

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:28.170 align:middle line:10%
they're predominantly dominant
within the theta rhythm.

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:30.390 align:middle line:10%
They also have the
spectral sensitivity

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:37.410 align:middle line:10%
that also moves into the UV
and IR sensitivity ranges.

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:42.000 align:middle line:10%
If children are so sensitive
to shadow at times when

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.090 align:middle line:10%
we need their abilities, such as
Halloween, Samhain, and Easter,

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:52.020 align:middle line:10%
where the veil is thinnest,
according to the Celts,

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:56.250 align:middle line:10%
between May and October, what
do we do with our children?

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:59.910 align:middle line:10%
We send them out, and they
go for trick or treat.

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:03.910 align:middle line:10%
We feed them full of sugar.

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:09.430 align:middle line:10%
We blind the children from
their fight or flight.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:11.340 align:middle line:10%
So I'm not saying don't do it.

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.890 align:middle line:10%
That's entirely up to yourself.

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:19.920 align:middle line:10%
But it's something I would
be very, very careful about.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:24.900 align:middle line:10%
Now extreme encounters, when we
consider the likes of abduction

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:29.130 align:middle line:10%
and things like that
within the UFO fields,

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:32.880 align:middle line:10%
we see extreme experiences.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:38.760 align:middle line:10%
And within days to weeks, many
who have had those encounters

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:43.050 align:middle line:10%
begin to report extra abilities
that they never knew they had.

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:46.620 align:middle line:10%
Prophetic dreams,
extrasensory perception.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:50.070 align:middle line:10%
All of this starts to step up.

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:52.710 align:middle line:10%
And they see this as a gift.

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:55.220 align:middle line:10%
And here is something
that we draw this back,

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.420 align:middle line:10%
to where we say,
this is not a gift.

00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:01.440 align:middle line:10%
Our hypothesis is that this
is an extension of our shadow

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:05.070 align:middle line:10%
who is now stepping
up to the line

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:08.910 align:middle line:10%
to make sure that the
trilogy or the trinity

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:12.680 align:middle line:10%
does not experience that again.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.650 align:middle line:10%
It's our self defense
that's stepping forward.

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:17.240 align:middle line:10%
It's the psychic
abilities that we

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.700 align:middle line:10%
possess that is
coming up to defend us

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:23.310 align:middle line:10%
from what's coming through.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:25.560 align:middle line:10%
And as I say, it's not a gift.

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.810 align:middle line:10%
This is our own ability.

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:31.680 align:middle line:10%
And every psychic ability,
every psychic ability

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.350 align:middle line:10%
is an extension we
believe of the soul.

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:37.550 align:middle line:90%


00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:40.850 align:middle line:10%
Now there are many
reasons as to how shadow

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:42.350 align:middle line:10%
can get back from their origin.

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:44.270 align:middle line:10%
We tapped on it,
of course, when we

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:47.720 align:middle line:10%
consider the idea
of Ouija boards,

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:51.320 align:middle line:10%
of going out into the
night sky and saying,

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:53.660 align:middle line:10%
hopefully someone will
come down, and all of that.

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.460 align:middle line:10%
The intention is there.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:32:00.470 align:middle line:10%
The intent is a key factor
here when we consider that.

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:06.140 align:middle line:10%
Now these shadows cannot exist
in this world without attaching

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:09.995 align:middle line:10%
themselves to or within us.

00:32:09.995 --> 00:32:13.200 align:middle line:90%


00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:18.270 align:middle line:10%
EVP sessions worldwide were
asking the same question.

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:19.320 align:middle line:10%
How do you see us?

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:23.060 align:middle line:10%
And this brings us back to
the influence that I wrote.

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:29.700 align:middle line:10%
Every time the question was
asked, how do you see us,

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.480 align:middle line:10%
it came back as light.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:35.015 align:middle line:10%
They see us as light.

00:32:35.015 --> 00:32:37.640 align:middle line:10%
And it's interesting that there
was some research done recently

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:41.210 align:middle line:10%
in Japan, center in
Japan, in which scientists

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:45.590 align:middle line:10%
have discovered that the
human body is producing light.

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:48.270 align:middle line:84%
In particular, light
through the face.

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:53.090 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is not light that
is representative of heat

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:56.120 align:middle line:10%
and of anything
that we're doing,

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.560 align:middle line:10%
exertion or anything like that.

00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.090 align:middle line:90%
It's totally separate.

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:03.780 align:middle line:84%
But this light is
1,000 times less

00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:07.150 align:middle line:84%
than we can see
with the human eye.

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:09.290 align:middle line:84%
With technology,
we're able to see it.

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that it
fluctuates during the day,

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:15.640 align:middle line:84%
but it becomes us most
powerful and emanates

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:20.900 align:middle line:84%
the most from the face
around 4:00 in the afternoon.

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And then it dissipates,
of course, at night.

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:25.910 align:middle line:84%
We become our lowest at
night when we're in sleep.

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:28.570 align:middle line:90%


00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:31.000 align:middle line:10%
So when we consider the
influence in which I

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.370 align:middle line:10%
was given the warning
don't become too bright

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:39.060 align:middle line:10%
or they see you, there may be
something in this after all.

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Each shadow has been
stripped of its past life.

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:47.890 align:middle line:10%
That knowledge that it possessed
and the source of its base

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:49.720 align:middle line:10%
instincts and needs.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.540 align:middle line:10%
And basically, we're dealing
with an intelligent and deadly

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:56.520 align:middle line:10%
animal of human origin.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:57.405 align:middle line:10%
That was part of us.

00:33:57.405 --> 00:34:00.790 align:middle line:90%


00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:03.270 align:middle line:10%
They can be classified, of
course, as energy vampires,

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:05.120 align:middle line:10%
and some do.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:09.139 align:middle line:10%
Each trying to infuse itself
into a balanced trinity, which

00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:13.780 align:middle line:10%
can cause terrible,
terrible upheaval.

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:16.420 align:middle line:10%
That's if it's not wanted.

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:19.449 align:middle line:10%
Now there are some magic
and some practices,

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:21.909 align:middle line:10%
esoteric practices that
are conducted in Romania,

00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:25.000 align:middle line:10%
in which the soul can be
targeted within individuals

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.480 align:middle line:10%
and can be affected.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:30.699 align:middle line:10%
And there are esoteric practices
used by some practitioners that

00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:36.693 align:middle line:10%
can transmit their shadow at
point of death to a new host.

00:34:36.693 --> 00:34:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that I was working

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:41.870 align:middle line:84%
on when I was looking
at the infamous Aleister

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Crowley, the head
of an occult line

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:54.270 align:middle line:84%
back in the day within
the UK and Italy.

00:34:54.270 --> 00:35:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed from the research
I was doing is that they check

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:06.600 align:middle line:84%
or they select the person
who's going to accept the soul.

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:09.780 align:middle line:90%
And that tends to be a relative.

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:12.720 align:middle line:84%
More so than anything, it has to
be a male no more than 10 years

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.310 align:middle line:90%
of age.

00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:19.300 align:middle line:10%
And during this particular
process, the deal that is done

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:25.630 align:middle line:10%
is so simple that it
can be as easy as giving

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:27.970 align:middle line:10%
the child a pencil.

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:31.780 align:middle line:10%
And the child takes the
pencil, the deal is done.

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And at point of death, that
shadow leaves the practitioner

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:41.100 align:middle line:90%
and joins then with the child.

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:44.790 align:middle line:90%
That causes tremendous upheaval.

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:47.670 align:middle line:10%
Absolute tremendous
upheaval within the child.

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Because the child
contains his own shadow.

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And which now you've got an
outside influence forcing

00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:58.100 align:middle line:90%
its impression onto the child.

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:01.880 align:middle line:10%
And we saw this after
Crowley's death,

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:06.770 align:middle line:10%
that his own son, who had just
seen him several weeks before,

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:09.020 align:middle line:10%
started developing what
we would identify today

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.960 align:middle line:10%
as schizophrenia.

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:14.520 align:middle line:90%
And it was a very terrible time.

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:22.080 align:middle line:10%
Now I have a video here in which
I want to show you the shadow

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:25.640 align:middle line:10%
that I had captured
in New Orleans.

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.190 align:middle line:10%
And this particular
house was haunted.

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:29.810 align:middle line:10%
It had its thing going on.

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:31.580 align:middle line:10%
But I was using
a camera that was

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:35.480 align:middle line:10%
more sensitive to those
outer spectrums mimicking

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:38.240 align:middle line:10%
what the child sees.

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:41.720 align:middle line:10%
Now this particular
video is photographs

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:46.760 align:middle line:10%
that are selected together and
made into a video sequence.

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:51.020 align:middle line:10%
But you will see, through
the lace on the glass

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:56.210 align:middle line:10%
into the room, which was
which led off to a staircase,

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:58.280 align:middle line:10%
you will see the
shadow, which are

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:01.010 align:middle line:10%
found I believe within
the ultraviolet spectrum.

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:32.150 align:middle line:90%


00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:33.530 align:middle line:10%
Now it was two floors up, folks.

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:36.048 align:middle line:10%
There was nothing behind me.

00:37:36.048 --> 00:37:37.590 align:middle line:10%
And I was standing
out in the balcony

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:42.670 align:middle line:10%
when I was photographing
this particular occurrence.

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:45.970 align:middle line:84%
The shadow, of course,
within a haunted property

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:49.750 align:middle line:84%
can exist if there are
living beings within it.

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:52.560 align:middle line:90%
They will feed from us.

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:57.752 align:middle line:84%
And if it's an old
relic of a house

00:37:57.752 --> 00:37:59.210 align:middle line:84%
and there is nothing
there, then we

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:02.420 align:middle line:84%
tend to look at a doorway
that has been opened.

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And we have to find
the doorway to close it

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:09.240 align:middle line:84%
because that will allow them
to come back and forward.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:12.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's what was
reported in New Orleans.

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:14.960 align:middle line:84%
I was there some years
ago, and I'm involved

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.145 align:middle line:90%
with that particular case.

00:38:16.145 --> 00:38:18.890 align:middle line:90%


00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Now there are locations,
I have to point out,

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:24.950 align:middle line:84%
of magnetic disturbance,
where many of this phenomena

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:25.800 align:middle line:90%
can be fine.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.130 align:middle line:10%
We can today, every
single one of us

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:32.270 align:middle line:10%
has access to free
software that will allow

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:35.570 align:middle line:10%
us to access satellite data.

00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:40.100 align:middle line:10%
In which we can put on
this particular program

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:45.140 align:middle line:10%
that will show us magnetic
anomalies, both north and south

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:46.100 align:middle line:10%
of the hemisphere.

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:48.380 align:middle line:10%
Within these strong
magnetic anomalies,

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.200 align:middle line:10%
we tend to find
these liminal places.

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.360 align:middle line:84%
These places where
the doorways are thin,

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:57.800 align:middle line:84%
where this phenomena can come
through in all its masks.

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Whether it be UFO,
whether it be cryptids,

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:06.010 align:middle line:84%
whether it be fairies, for
instance, are all the same.

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:08.920 align:middle line:84%
Now Skinwalker Ranch
is a perfect example.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.510 align:middle line:84%
For the majority
of us here, we will

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:12.910 align:middle line:90%
be aware of Skinwalker Ranch.

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:16.030 align:middle line:84%
But Skinwalker Ranch sits
on a magnetic anomaly.

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:18.130 align:middle line:90%
I was there in 2019.

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And it sits on a
magnetic anomaly,

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:23.310 align:middle line:90%
which is 80 miles long.

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:25.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not just the ranch.

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:28.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a greater magnetic anomaly.

00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And we find that there
are phenomena that are

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:32.630 align:middle line:90%
appearing outside of the ranch.

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:34.610 align:middle line:84%
There are issues as
to what the ranch is

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:36.800 align:middle line:84%
doing that's causing
the problem there,

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:41.010 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not going to
get into that now.

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:44.340 align:middle line:10%
Strong positive
magnetic anomalies

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:48.670 align:middle line:10%
present typical
poltergeist activity.

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:52.170 align:middle line:10%
And you will also find
UFOs, mutilations,

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:54.570 align:middle line:10%
cryptid encounters,
and disappearances

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:57.060 align:middle line:10%
of both animal and human alike.

00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:59.780 align:middle line:10%


00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:02.960 align:middle line:10%
Negative magnetic anomalies.

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:07.590 align:middle line:10%
Well, they're a different
kettle of fish altogether.

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:09.770 align:middle line:10%
And what we need to
understand in regards

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:12.170 align:middle line:10%
to the magnetic
anomalies, it looks

00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:14.300 align:middle line:10%
like we're looking at a
positive and a negative.

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:15.870 align:middle line:10%
It's two different facets.

00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:16.670 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:20.090 align:middle line:10%
We are looking at the same coin.

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:22.910 align:middle line:90%
It's two faces of the same coin.

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:24.120 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:29.850 align:middle line:10%
The origins are the
same for this phenomena.

00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:32.190 align:middle line:10%
The majority of
sacrificial worship sites

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:35.430 align:middle line:10%
that our ancestors were
using, blood worship

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:38.610 align:middle line:10%
and the spilling
of blood was huge

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:42.780 align:middle line:10%
in negative magnetic anomalies.

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:48.300 align:middle line:10%
And 75% of the world's
top suicide locations

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:51.660 align:middle line:10%
also appear in negative
magnetic anomalies.

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:54.990 align:middle line:10%
Something is drawing us in.

00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:58.200 align:middle line:10%
Something is drawing us in
to perform these actions.

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.700 align:middle line:90%
It's about the blood.

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.710 align:middle line:84%
There's something
about the blood.

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:06.180 align:middle line:90%


00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:09.960 align:middle line:10%
Interestingly, 70% of the
world's weapons development

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:14.770 align:middle line:10%
labs storage are in these areas.

00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:18.683 align:middle line:10%
Those weapons are taking
lives, much more lives

00:41:18.683 --> 00:41:19.600 align:middle line:10%
than used to be taken.

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.400 align:middle line:10%


00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.460 align:middle line:10%
Are they communicating with
something beyond the void?

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:27.850 align:middle line:10%
Is it possible?

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:29.740 align:middle line:10%
Now we'll have a look.

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:32.530 align:middle line:10%
These former temples,
they were hard to reach.

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:34.120 align:middle line:10%
They were on top of hills.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.380 align:middle line:10%
They were on top of mountains.

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:36.310 align:middle line:10%
Japan.

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:38.753 align:middle line:10%
You can still
experience that today.

00:41:38.753 --> 00:41:40.420 align:middle line:10%
You climb up to the
top of the mountains

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:42.100 align:middle line:10%
and leave the rest
of the world behind.

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:44.860 align:middle line:10%
You reach these very,
very difficult places.

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:48.310 align:middle line:10%
You'll find them in
lakes and on islands.

00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:50.710 align:middle line:10%
You'll find them in
caves deep underground.

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:53.110 align:middle line:10%
These temples were very,
very hard to reach.

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:55.860 align:middle line:10%


00:41:55.860 --> 00:42:01.570 align:middle line:10%
This practice can be traced
to the Near East and countries

00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:02.370 align:middle line:10%
such as Syria.

00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:04.920 align:middle line:10%


00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:06.930 align:middle line:10%
Now one of these
particular beings

00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:12.390 align:middle line:10%
within the Greek
mythology we find

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:15.690 align:middle line:10%
was the god of the wilderness,
what we would represent as Pan.

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:18.060 align:middle line:10%
And its appearance,
it appeared as what

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:20.370 align:middle line:10%
we would identify as Pan.

00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:22.890 align:middle line:10%
But there was another one.

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:28.290 align:middle line:10%
There was one more being energy
entity, call it what you want,

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:32.130 align:middle line:10%
that I wanted to focus on.

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:37.062 align:middle line:10%
Because these beings
were known as the word.

00:42:37.062 --> 00:42:39.270 align:middle line:10%
These beings were the things
that were coming through

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:44.130 align:middle line:10%
to our leaders, to the
elite, to our priests,

00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:49.680 align:middle line:10%
who were going to these areas,
such as the Oracle of Delphi

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:50.820 align:middle line:10%
is one example.

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:54.570 align:middle line:10%
They were going to these places
to commune with wisdom that

00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:56.760 align:middle line:10%
was coming through the veil.

00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Wisdom, of course, that
was similar to economics,

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:06.330 align:middle line:84%
government practices, sociology,
warfare, crime, engineering,

00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:08.430 align:middle line:90%
and science.

00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:11.700 align:middle line:84%
These were the details that
they were pulling through.

00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:14.720 align:middle line:10%
And there were
prices to be paid.

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.820 align:middle line:10%
But what's knowledge?

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:17.870 align:middle line:90%
We need knowledge.

00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:20.790 align:middle line:90%
We'll pay the price.

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:25.830 align:middle line:10%
Scientists and engineers have
been using channeling devices

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:28.730 align:middle line:10%
to get ahead of current
technological challenges.

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:32.010 align:middle line:10%
Now that in itself is
quite hard to believe.

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:35.410 align:middle line:10%
What do you mean our
scientists and engineers?

00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:41.050 align:middle line:10%
Industrial companies that are
using Ouija boards to connect

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:43.330 align:middle line:10%
to what's beyond the veil.

00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:44.410 align:middle line:10%
Looking for information.

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:47.140 align:middle line:10%
That seems bizarre.

00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:49.330 align:middle line:10%
But there are many
traceable documents

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:51.700 align:middle line:10%
detailing these
esoteric communication

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:55.330 align:middle line:10%
sessions that attempted to gain
knowledge from the other side.

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:57.610 align:middle line:10%
For instance, the
memo of the A380,

00:43:57.610 --> 00:44:01.510 align:middle line:10%
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,
from the Douglas Aeronautics

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:07.610 align:middle line:10%
Company in 1968 before becoming
absorbed by Boeing in 1997.

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:11.630 align:middle line:10%
they were sponsored internally.

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:14.000 align:middle line:10%
They were sponsored
because they believed

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.380 align:middle line:10%
they were using a Ouija board
to communicate with aliens

00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:19.700 align:middle line:10%
from beyond the veil.

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:23.630 align:middle line:10%
What are aliens doing
using a Ouija board?

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Again, when we
strip this away, we

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:27.170 align:middle line:84%
start looking at
the common factors.

00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:30.740 align:middle line:90%


00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:32.600 align:middle line:90%
This is part of the document.

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:36.320 align:middle line:10%
And red flag, after red
flag, after red flag

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:40.850 align:middle line:10%
was coming through this
particular documentation.

00:44:40.850 --> 00:44:43.100 align:middle line:10%
Communication with
alleged distant sources

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:44.690 align:middle line:10%
was always
accomplished in English

00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:47.500 align:middle line:10%
almost without exception.

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:52.450 align:middle line:10%
A variety of topics was covered
from sociology, government,

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:55.190 align:middle line:10%
economics, warfare, crime,
medicine, engineering,

00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:55.990 align:middle line:10%
and science.

00:44:55.990 --> 00:45:00.310 align:middle line:10%
Have we heard that
before from Greece?

00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:02.050 align:middle line:10%
Another red flag
was when they were

00:45:02.050 --> 00:45:06.430 align:middle line:10%
pressed on technical
issues, the communications

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:08.945 align:middle line:10%
suddenly broke down.

00:45:08.945 --> 00:45:11.070 align:middle line:10%
And this is always something
that we tended to see.

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:13.830 align:middle line:10%
When we wanted more information,
when we needed more information

00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:20.750 align:middle line:10%
to clarify where that knowledge
was coming from, they back off.

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:24.680 align:middle line:10%
When we become suspicious of
what they are or who they are,

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:27.240 align:middle line:10%
they back off.

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:30.590 align:middle line:10%
There is an exceptionally
high level of deception

00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:35.120 align:middle line:10%
that is required to fool us to
accept what's coming through,

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.070 align:middle line:10%
so that we will
take that direction.

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:39.970 align:middle line:10%


00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:41.700 align:middle line:10%
Now there is
unconfirmed reports that

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:46.620 align:middle line:10%
suggest Carl Jung had spoke to
a delegation of the US military

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:49.140 align:middle line:10%
when addressing
the UFO phenomenon.

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:51.865 align:middle line:10%
And he stated, we may be looking
at a mass Babylonian death

00:45:51.865 --> 00:45:52.665 align:middle line:10%
ritual.

00:45:52.665 --> 00:45:55.850 align:middle line:90%


00:45:55.850 --> 00:45:58.570 align:middle line:10%
And that's one way of
looking at it I suppose.

00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:01.600 align:middle line:10%
But when we consider 20
years later after Douglas,

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:05.830 align:middle line:10%
a rival company did
engineer the A380

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:09.020 align:middle line:10%
and then went on to develop
AI weapons platforms called

00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:13.720 align:middle line:10%
ASTARTES, a nod possibly to the
Mesopotamian goddess of war,

00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:15.850 align:middle line:10%
Astarte.

00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:17.500 align:middle line:10%
So the clues are
there in front of us.

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:18.958 align:middle line:10%
It's whether we
choose to see them.

00:46:18.958 --> 00:46:21.480 align:middle line:10%


00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:25.470 align:middle line:10%
Now I have to say
that the shining ones,

00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:30.150 align:middle line:10%
the shining ones are what
I would call my nemesis.

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:34.700 align:middle line:10%
And they're often
called the bright ones.

00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:37.220 align:middle line:10%
And they usually appear
above or in the vicinity

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:41.660 align:middle line:10%
of rocky outcrops
and stone plateaus

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:44.360 align:middle line:10%
and most notably in caves.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And here we should consider
the stone connection

00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:50.630 align:middle line:84%
because we also find a lot
of paranormal phenomena

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:56.060 align:middle line:84%
also appearing around stony
plateaus, outcrops, and caves.

00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:58.660 align:middle line:90%


00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:02.750 align:middle line:84%
We also find ufology is
connected to it as well.

00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And I should address the
encounter at Medjugorje.

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:09.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if everyone
is aware of Medjugorje over

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:10.820 align:middle line:90%
in Eastern Europe.

00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:15.225 align:middle line:84%
But it was a place where
children were coming back

00:47:15.225 --> 00:47:16.600 align:middle line:84%
and had this
encounter where they

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:21.130 align:middle line:84%
saw the shining one in the hill,
which is now called Our Lady.

00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And she delivered messages to
them and does so every Tuesday.

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:28.010 align:middle line:90%


00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:31.970 align:middle line:10%
And this has continued
over the years.

00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:36.140 align:middle line:10%
But for us to understand these
encounters with the shining

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:41.420 align:middle line:10%
ones, we have to understand
the 20-second rule.

00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:43.610 align:middle line:90%
No, we do.

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Now when we go back
and we strip away

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:49.880 align:middle line:84%
what Medjugorje has
become now and not getting

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:52.100 align:middle line:90%
involved with the politics.

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:56.120 align:middle line:84%
What I want to concentrate on
is the phenomenon, initially.

00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:58.310 align:middle line:90%
The way it began.

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:01.970 align:middle line:10%
Because in the beginning,
when this being

00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:07.950 align:middle line:10%
appeared on the hill, the
children were frightened.

00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:10.690 align:middle line:90%


00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:13.360 align:middle line:84%
The children were
stunned in fear.

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:16.572 align:middle line:90%


00:48:16.572 --> 00:48:21.210 align:middle line:84%
That was the clue as to
what this phenomena was,

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:22.500 align:middle line:90%
where it was coming from.

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Now it's become something
completely different.

00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:30.230 align:middle line:90%
Lourdes in 1858 was another one.

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:32.980 align:middle line:90%
St. Bernadette's.

00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:38.170 align:middle line:10%
When this being appeared
in the cave system,

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:42.730 align:middle line:10%
she referred to
it as that thing.

00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:44.230 align:middle line:10%
Now later on, the
Church, of course,

00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:46.840 align:middle line:10%
took that and smoothed it
out and became Our Lady.

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.640 align:middle line:10%
But St. Bernadette
referred to it

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.620 align:middle line:10%
in the initial
stages as that thing.

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:53.650 align:middle line:84%
She did not know who the
hell she was looking at.

00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:55.330 align:middle line:84%
It was actually
smaller than her.

00:48:55.330 --> 00:48:58.420 align:middle line:10%
The images, the
models, and statues

00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:00.700 align:middle line:10%
that were created
following that she

00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:02.860 align:middle line:10%
was very distraught
about because she said,

00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:04.840 align:middle line:10%
that's not what I saw.

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:08.140 align:middle line:10%
But of course, there
were plans on power

00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:09.980 align:middle line:10%
to control folks
and everything else.

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:11.950 align:middle line:10%
And that's what it became today.

00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:13.450 align:middle line:10%
But it's interesting
that we do have

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:15.970 align:middle line:10%
people who go to that
location and still have

00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:17.230 align:middle line:10%
a negative effect.

00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:19.210 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to be there.

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Sensitive school there, and
they have that experience.

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:24.460 align:middle line:10%
And that's still
happening today.

00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Now it should be pointed out
that in a wonderful book called

00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Gods, Demons, and the Symbols
of Ancient Mesopotamia

00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:33.790 align:middle line:84%
by Jeremy Black
and Anthony Green,

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:36.910 align:middle line:84%
they state in
ancient Mesopotamia,

00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:42.770 align:middle line:90%
the gods exuded malam and nay.

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And malam was a light
that was terrifying.

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.080 align:middle line:10%
There, the children
were stunned.

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:50.640 align:middle line:10%


00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:52.980 align:middle line:10%
It was terrifying
and awe-inspiring,

00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:59.160 align:middle line:10%
whilst nay was described
as a creeping of the flesh.

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:02.820 align:middle line:84%
That's what an appearance of
the shining one really does.

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:06.480 align:middle line:10%
And that's something we need
to be very, very aware of.

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:10.080 align:middle line:10%
And behind the deception of
what they portray themselves

00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:15.190 align:middle line:10%
to be our instincts,
our gift of discernment

00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:20.230 align:middle line:10%
can direct us to you're not
telling me everything to yes,

00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:22.880 align:middle line:10%
I can accept what you're saying.

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:26.000 align:middle line:10%
And if there is any
doubt, whatsoever, folks,

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.360 align:middle line:10%
we should be telling
them to get on their bike

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:31.370 align:middle line:10%
and get the hell out of there.

00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:34.620 align:middle line:90%


00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:37.020 align:middle line:84%
But back in 2017, Pope
Francis, of course,

00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:38.810 align:middle line:90%
was on a flight back to Rome.

00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And he was interviewed
about Medjugorje.

00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:46.760 align:middle line:10%
And he made a comment
about the Mother of Jesus

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:50.390 align:middle line:10%
who was appearing every
Tuesday delivering messages.

00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:53.740 align:middle line:84%
He said, she is
not a postmistress.

00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:55.870 align:middle line:90%
And he was pretty much on power.

00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, they have
got their own thing going on

00:50:58.120 --> 00:50:59.260 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:01.660 align:middle line:10%
But it was
interesting that there

00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:06.220 align:middle line:10%
are particular folks in the
Vatican and former members

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:11.320 align:middle line:10%
of the Vatican, such as, I
can't remember his name now.

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:14.320 align:middle line:90%
He was an Irish exorcist.

00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:17.830 align:middle line:84%
He even he even was convinced
that Medjugorje was actually

00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:19.590 align:middle line:90%
demonic.

00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:21.590 align:middle line:84%
So people are going here
and offering themselves

00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:23.330 align:middle line:90%
up to this particular energy.

00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:29.610 align:middle line:84%
But the aspect of demon is
another mask to the phenomena.

00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:31.950 align:middle line:84%
So we shouldn't
get lost in that.

00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what was
happening with the shining ones.

00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:44.330 align:middle line:10%
Now the tech, what we tend
to see, the technology that's

00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:46.490 align:middle line:10%
being used, there
is a difference

00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:52.220 align:middle line:10%
between in UFOs
between the 1800s

00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:54.770 align:middle line:10%
to what we're experiencing now.

00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:57.477 align:middle line:84%
Earlier today, I spoke about
that particular attack,

00:51:57.477 --> 00:51:58.310 align:middle line:90%
or it was yesterday.

00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:00.050 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember.

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:04.840 align:middle line:84%
About the fact that our
technology, although it's

00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:07.420 align:middle line:84%
fantastic in what it
does, and the speed,

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:11.440 align:middle line:84%
and the trajectory
in which it travels,

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:16.690 align:middle line:84%
its output of microwaves
and everything else

00:52:16.690 --> 00:52:19.940 align:middle line:90%
is exceptionally high.

00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:22.250 align:middle line:84%
So for anyone, and
there are documentation

00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:24.560 align:middle line:84%
there to support this,
that for the folks that

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:29.860 align:middle line:84%
get within 100 feet of our
technology, that 10% of those

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:33.010 align:middle line:90%
are dead within seven years.

00:52:33.010 --> 00:52:36.010 align:middle line:10%
That's how extreme
our technology is.

00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:37.880 align:middle line:90%
It's exceptionally advanced.

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:40.760 align:middle line:84%
But we have not figured
out the shielding.

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:43.610 align:middle line:84%
That's maybe something
we should work on.

00:52:43.610 --> 00:52:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Now in regards to
the ancient stuff,

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:47.000 align:middle line:90%
it's very, very different.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.430 align:middle line:90%
Very, very subtle.

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And this brings us back
to how they see us.

00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Because as I said, how they
see us or how we see the light

00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:02.180 align:middle line:84%
that emanates from our
faces 1,000 times less

00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:05.180 align:middle line:84%
than what we can see, but
we're picking up on it.

00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:07.380 align:middle line:84%
There's something that was
picking up on the light

00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:08.180 align:middle line:90%
that we produce.

00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:09.270 align:middle line:90%
We walk into a room.

00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:12.920 align:middle line:84%
People will say, oh,
he lights up a room.

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:15.170 align:middle line:84%
That is very, very
important to consider

00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:18.170 align:middle line:90%
when studying this phenomenon.

00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And especially
when we're looking

00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:23.510 align:middle line:90%
at this idea of this light.

00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And the subtlety of
the light is also

00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:29.690 align:middle line:84%
we find that subtlety of
the nature and the energy

00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:31.040 align:middle line:90%
that they are putting out.

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:34.100 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very different.

00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:36.470 align:middle line:90%
Very minute.

00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And I am working with
an engineer in Germany.

00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:44.000 align:middle line:10%
And we're devising this
piece of technology,

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.300 align:middle line:10%
which is designed to look
for particular spikes

00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:51.720 align:middle line:10%
that we expect to find within
the theological fields,

00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:55.080 align:middle line:10%
within the paranormal,
and within cryptids.

00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:57.540 align:middle line:10%
And this is a
technology, which is not

00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:02.850 align:middle line:10%
available as yet to the
greater research fields

00:54:02.850 --> 00:54:04.590 align:middle line:10%
because we need to
go through tests.

00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:08.460 align:middle line:84%
But we're expecting to
find that key signature.

00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:13.150 align:middle line:84%
That signature that spikes
when the phenomenon occurs.

00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And we can leave this technology
on site for up to a month.

00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:19.170 align:middle line:90%
And it'll collect that data.

00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:21.540 align:middle line:84%
That data that we
really valuably

00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:24.070 align:middle line:84%
need to understand
the phenomena.

00:54:24.070 --> 00:54:26.190 align:middle line:10%
So we're going to start
seeing this difference

00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:29.130 align:middle line:10%
and this understanding and
the technology, which is then

00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:32.820 align:middle line:10%
going to be coming forward to
the mainstream for us to use.

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:36.600 align:middle line:84%
But as I say, when we
look at the technology

00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:39.540 align:middle line:84%
that we're creating
within the UFOs,

00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:43.170 align:middle line:84%
we should also note that
back in 2018, Steve and I

00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:44.940 align:middle line:84%
stood on the stage
of awakenings,

00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:46.900 align:middle line:90%
and we called the Tic Tac out.

00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:49.110 align:middle line:90%
We said, this is our technology.

00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:52.210 align:middle line:10%
Back in 2018, we did that.

00:54:52.210 --> 00:54:59.280 align:middle line:10%
And it should be noted that the
technology in itself, it really

00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:04.070 align:middle line:10%
forces us to look at what was
happening in San Diego when

00:55:04.070 --> 00:55:07.490 align:middle line:10%
the Tic Tac was breaking out.

00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:09.590 align:middle line:84%
The entire fleet
had been kitted out

00:55:09.590 --> 00:55:12.830 align:middle line:84%
to track high speed
objects over the horizon.

00:55:12.830 --> 00:55:17.100 align:middle line:84%
The Nimitz fleet were pulled
back and rewired for this.

00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And then they went out
and started finding this.

00:55:21.330 --> 00:55:22.410 align:middle line:90%
The technology was there.

00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Our technology is
there to track this.

00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And now moving
forward today, we find

00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:31.620 align:middle line:84%
that Russia is
making claims that it

00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:35.910 align:middle line:84%
has nuclear warheads that can
meet London in 200 seconds.

00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:37.290 align:middle line:90%
That's a high speed weapon.

00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:40.150 align:middle line:84%
You need a high
speed cure for that.

00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:41.870 align:middle line:90%
Well, we've already got that.

00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:42.870 align:middle line:90%
The technology is there.

00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:44.700 align:middle line:90%
It is our technology.

00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:48.960 align:middle line:10%
Scott Bray, he's the deputy
director of the US Naval

00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:52.230 align:middle line:10%
Intelligence, stated in a
congressional hearing in 2022

00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:55.500 align:middle line:10%
regarding footage of the UAPs.

00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:59.160 align:middle line:10%
We have detected no
emanations with the UAP Task

00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:02.550 align:middle line:10%
Force that would
suggest it is anything

00:56:02.550 --> 00:56:06.000 align:middle line:10%
non-terrestrial in origin.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.190 align:middle line:90%
Read between the lines.

00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:10.630 align:middle line:90%
I will repeat.

00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:15.730 align:middle line:10%
We have detected no
emanations with the UAP Task

00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:19.150 align:middle line:10%
Force that will
suggest it is anything

00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:22.850 align:middle line:10%
non-terrestrial in origin.

00:56:22.850 --> 00:56:24.840 align:middle line:90%
That's our technology.

00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:26.610 align:middle line:90%
Initially, we were copying them.

00:56:26.610 --> 00:56:28.380 align:middle line:10%
Now we've advanced.

00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:30.210 align:middle line:84%
We're making greater
moves than they are.

00:56:30.210 --> 00:56:33.570 align:middle line:90%


00:56:33.570 --> 00:56:36.990 align:middle line:10%
Now The Guardian newspaper.

00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:40.380 align:middle line:10%
This gets us now into
a very sticky area.

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:42.510 align:middle line:10%
The Guardian newspaper
had said in March

00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:45.780 align:middle line:10%
the 11th 2017, had
run the headline,

00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:50.010 align:middle line:10%
the 1930s were humanity's
darkest and bloodiest hour.

00:56:50.010 --> 00:56:53.220 align:middle line:10%
Are you paying attention?

00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:56.180 align:middle line:10%
Not quite, I would suggest.

00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:58.840 align:middle line:10%
We have been much worse.

00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:02.530 align:middle line:10%
When we go back and we
look at the Marian library,

00:57:02.530 --> 00:57:04.420 align:middle line:10%
the resources there
of the Marion Library

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:05.920 align:middle line:10%
or the International
Marian Research

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:09.970 align:middle line:10%
Institute in Dayton, Ohio, I
was able to put the figures

00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:15.220 align:middle line:10%
on my nemesis on the shining
ones and their appearances

00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:18.640 align:middle line:10%
across the world.

00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:20.130 align:middle line:10%
And it was interesting
to see when

00:57:20.130 --> 00:57:24.190 align:middle line:10%
we started pulling the figures
and placing them together

00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:27.490 align:middle line:10%
that within the last century,
World War I, World War

00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:33.030 align:middle line:10%
II, Korean War, Bosnian War,
the global war on terrorism,

00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:37.800 align:middle line:10%
predominantly, the shining
ones were appearing

00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:40.170 align:middle line:10%
in negative magnetic anomalies.

00:57:40.170 --> 00:57:42.720 align:middle line:10%


00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:44.668 align:middle line:10%
The shining ones
were appearing there

00:57:44.668 --> 00:57:46.335 align:middle line:10%
where the blood was
going to be spilled.

00:57:46.335 --> 00:57:50.840 align:middle line:90%


00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:54.380 align:middle line:10%
Now in the 1970s,
we should really

00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:56.720 align:middle line:10%
address this CE5 because
we've really been

00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:59.600 align:middle line:10%
talking about the paranormal.

00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:04.070 align:middle line:10%
But we tend to see other
areas of the paranormal slip

00:58:04.070 --> 00:58:07.370 align:middle line:10%
into the ufology field as well
because we are technically

00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:09.790 align:middle line:10%
looking at the same thing.

00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:11.590 align:middle line:10%
Students from the
University of Indiana

00:58:11.590 --> 00:58:15.440 align:middle line:10%
devised a plan to contact
UFOs without truly,

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:18.400 align:middle line:10%
truly understanding
the phenomena.

00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:22.450 align:middle line:10%
They were using the usual
flashlight up into the sky,

00:58:22.450 --> 00:58:26.810 align:middle line:10%
and flashing away,
and making contact.

00:58:26.810 --> 00:58:29.680 align:middle line:10%
However, when they
established primary contact

00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:33.580 align:middle line:10%
with the nocturnal lights
in several occasions,

00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:35.260 align:middle line:10%
a bizarre series
of events followed

00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:37.990 align:middle line:10%
that reflected the findings of
the scientific investigation

00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:41.050 align:middle line:10%
by the Livermore Laboratories
in the United States described

00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:43.240 align:middle line:10%
by Russell Tariq.

00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:47.890 align:middle line:10%
Now I should point out
that the Scole Experiments,

00:58:47.890 --> 00:58:52.270 align:middle line:10%
during that five-year
series of experiments,

00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:55.690 align:middle line:10%
there was manifestations
of UFOs, miniature UFOs

00:58:55.690 --> 00:58:58.550 align:middle line:10%
within the seance room.

00:58:58.550 --> 00:59:01.550 align:middle line:10%
There was manifestations
of bodily parts.

00:59:01.550 --> 00:59:05.150 align:middle line:10%
There was manifestations
of various other phenomena

00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:06.650 align:middle line:10%
that was occurring.

00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:14.780 align:middle line:10%
And even within that particular
experiment on the screen of one

00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:19.040 align:middle line:10%
of the video cameras appeared
the face of a grey alien.

00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:22.850 align:middle line:84%
What on Earth is a grey alien
doing in the seance room?

00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:25.870 align:middle line:90%


00:59:25.870 --> 00:59:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And that particular
alien became known

00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:32.700 align:middle line:84%
as Blue because of the
blue hue in the screen.

00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:41.990 align:middle line:10%
And as the experiments continued
within the Scole Experiment,

00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:45.760 align:middle line:10%
the communication
came to an end.

00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:47.990 align:middle line:84%
It was drawn to an end
for various reasons.

00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:51.170 align:middle line:84%
But we were informed that there
would be no more communication

00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:53.660 align:middle line:84%
with the spirit guides,
with the spirit team,

00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:57.120 align:middle line:84%
or with the beings that
were beyond the other side.

00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:58.040 align:middle line:90%
That was fair enough.

00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:00.710 align:middle line:84%
The experiment came to
a close, but I have it

01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:05.550 align:middle line:84%
on good authority that
Blue didn't go away.

01:00:05.550 --> 01:00:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And later on, Blue was
making his appearance

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:10.320 align:middle line:90%
in seance rooms in Spain.

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:13.530 align:middle line:90%


01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:16.620 align:middle line:84%
So again, we were told
to lie within that.

01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:19.680 align:middle line:84%
Again, the deceit
is very much there.

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Now within the
Livermore Laboratories

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:24.990 align:middle line:84%
back also in the 1970s,
the scientists there

01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:27.090 align:middle line:84%
were making the same
type of progress,

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:31.280 align:middle line:84%
but they were also experiencing
the same phenomena.

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.620 align:middle line:10%
In particular, one
body part appeared,

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:37.900 align:middle line:10%
and it was an arm,
just like in--

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:38.830 align:middle line:10%
oops.

01:00:38.830 --> 01:00:42.100 align:middle line:90%
There's one over there.

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Just like in the Scole
Experiment, the arm appeared.

01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:47.710 align:middle line:84%
But instead of a hand on
the end, it had a hook.

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And this was rotating in the
air as if showing itself off

01:00:51.830 --> 01:00:54.760 align:middle line:90%
in broad daylight.

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:58.300 align:middle line:10%
Not the darkness of a seance
room, which we're told spirits

01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:00.238 align:middle line:10%
need the darkness.

01:01:00.238 --> 01:01:02.530 align:middle line:84%
They didn't need it back in
the Livermore laboratories.

01:01:02.530 --> 01:01:04.660 align:middle line:84%
They were appearing
in broad daylight,

01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:08.290 align:middle line:84%
another deceptive aspect
to the phenomenon.

01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:12.670 align:middle line:84%
The arm appeared in the bedrooms
of some of the scientists.

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:14.560 align:middle line:10%
The scientists were
having serious problems

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:17.530 align:middle line:10%
because the phenomena
was following them back

01:01:17.530 --> 01:01:20.770 align:middle line:10%
to their rooms, to their homes.

01:01:20.770 --> 01:01:23.800 align:middle line:84%
As they were lying in bed, there
were strange animals appearing

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:25.600 align:middle line:84%
at the foot of the
bed, large birds

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:29.260 align:middle line:84%
were appearing that didn't
exist in our reality.

01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:32.482 align:middle line:84%
These things were appearing
in broad daylight.

01:01:32.482 --> 01:01:34.690 align:middle line:84%
It got to the stage with
the scientists believed they

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:36.250 align:middle line:90%
were going absolutely nuts.

01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:42.160 align:middle line:84%
They were losing their touch,
their grounding of reality,

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:46.440 align:middle line:90%
and the experiments had to end.

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:47.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's what was
happening there.

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And we were seeing
this discrepancy

01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:54.490 align:middle line:90%
of how this phenomena appears.

01:01:54.490 --> 01:01:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Now the students began to
experience rapping sounds.

01:01:57.340 --> 01:01:59.140 align:middle line:90%
Hollow, disembodied voices.

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:01.240 align:middle line:90%
Furious pounding in the walls.

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.690 align:middle line:84%
Physical attacks
also began to happen.

01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:07.100 align:middle line:10%
And again, we start seeing
this crossover of phenomena.

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:10.600 align:middle line:10%
So we've gone from UFOs into
the world of the paranormal.

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately,
everything is connected.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.960 align:middle line:10%
Some experience the
awakening in the night

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:19.210 align:middle line:10%
to find strange,
dark-clothed men

01:02:19.210 --> 01:02:21.980 align:middle line:10%
standing in their apartments.

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:23.690 align:middle line:10%
But radios and TVs
would switch on

01:02:23.690 --> 01:02:25.790 align:middle line:10%
and when nobody was
near them, leading

01:02:25.790 --> 01:02:29.390 align:middle line:10%
them to abandon the
experiments, just

01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:32.640 align:middle line:10%
like Livermore Laboratories.

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:35.430 align:middle line:10%
Now years later, of course,
the experiment organizer

01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:41.430 align:middle line:10%
concluded that they tapped
into some sort of energy.

01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:44.940 align:middle line:10%
They suspected that this energy
had been present on Earth.

01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:49.690 align:middle line:10%
And this led two of the
team members disappearing.

01:02:49.690 --> 01:02:50.490 align:middle line:10%
Why?

01:02:50.490 --> 01:02:51.680 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.550 align:middle line:10%
One becoming deeply
involved in the occult.

01:02:53.550 --> 01:02:58.630 align:middle line:10%
Another committing suicide,
and another turned to religion.

01:02:58.630 --> 01:03:02.920 align:middle line:84%
So there are side effects to
us getting involved with this,

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:06.995 align:middle line:84%
and we need to understand our
body's defenses, our signals

01:03:06.995 --> 01:03:07.870 align:middle line:90%
that come through it.

01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:11.170 align:middle line:84%
How we can enhance
those signals, and also

01:03:11.170 --> 01:03:12.610 align:middle line:84%
what we should be
looking at for.

01:03:12.610 --> 01:03:16.540 align:middle line:84%
The exceptional level of
deceit that comes through

01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:18.700 align:middle line:90%
needs to be broken down.

01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:23.110 align:middle line:84%
We cannot accept the
phenomena on face value.

01:03:23.110 --> 01:03:26.960 align:middle line:84%
We have to stop that
right across the board.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:29.020 align:middle line:90%
And we have to challenge it.

01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Now unfortunately,
what I also discovered

01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:35.050 align:middle line:84%
is when we start challenging
the phenomena, it steps back.

01:03:35.050 --> 01:03:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And my take on this is if
the entity, the energy,

01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:45.010 align:middle line:84%
the being whatever the case may
be, if it has nothing to hide,

01:03:45.010 --> 01:03:47.430 align:middle line:84%
then it shouldn't mind
the extra question.

01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:49.470 align:middle line:90%
The Columbo question.

01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:52.020 align:middle line:90%
One more thing.

01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:54.270 align:middle line:90%
But it does.

01:03:54.270 --> 01:03:56.160 align:middle line:84%
What we tend to see
time and time again

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:59.940 align:middle line:84%
is that this phenomena does
not want to be discovered.

01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And it will move off
when we challenge it

01:04:02.550 --> 01:04:03.555 align:middle line:90%
in the truest sense.

01:04:03.555 --> 01:04:06.650 align:middle line:90%


01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And the final words
I have to say really

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:12.860 align:middle line:84%
go to fellow
researcher, RW Bush.

01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:16.910 align:middle line:10%
In 1984, he wrote an
amazing piece called UFOs

01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:18.902 align:middle line:10%
caught in the web of deception.

01:04:18.902 --> 01:04:20.360 align:middle line:10%
And he said, the
true shepherd goes

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:24.140 align:middle line:10%
through the main gates instead
of jumping over the fence.

01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:27.140 align:middle line:10%
The real homeowner walks
through the front door instead

01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:29.960 align:middle line:10%
of climbing through the window.

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:32.260 align:middle line:10%
And the man who wants
to tell us the truth,

01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:34.570 align:middle line:10%
even if he comes
from another planet,

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:37.510 align:middle line:10%
broadcasts it openly
instead of whispering it

01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:39.280 align:middle line:10%
into the ears of
helpless captives

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:41.940 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of the night.

01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:44.910 align:middle line:90%
That speaks volumes, folks.

01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And within the book of The
Deception of Gods and Man,

01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:48.630 align:middle line:90%
I go into the details.

01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Brian and I both go into the
details of this phenomena.

01:04:52.770 --> 01:04:56.070 align:middle line:84%
How it has worked with
us over the centuries.

01:04:56.070 --> 01:05:01.780 align:middle line:84%
How we have been
manipulated to a high degree

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:05.290 align:middle line:84%
by the phenomenon in
all its multifacets.

01:05:05.290 --> 01:05:07.180 align:middle line:84%
The masks that it
has appeared in,

01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:11.380 align:middle line:90%
we have to kick it to the curb.

01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:13.905 align:middle line:84%
That is deeply important
that we do that.

01:05:13.905 --> 01:05:15.280 align:middle line:84%
Because by doing
that, then we're

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:16.990 align:middle line:84%
able to track it
by the phenomena.

01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:21.160 align:middle line:84%
That phenomena
stretches back eons.

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:26.230 align:middle line:84%
All the way back into the
Fertile Crescent and beyond.

01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:28.930 align:middle line:84%
We lose that phenomena
because the written text

01:05:28.930 --> 01:05:31.160 align:middle line:90%
disappears at that point.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.760 align:middle line:90%
So we can track that phenomenon.

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that,
we have the wisdom.

01:05:36.730 --> 01:05:38.170 align:middle line:90%
We have the experience.

01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And today, we live in a society
in which we decide that, well,

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:46.510 align:middle line:90%
I have lived 50 odd years.

01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:47.810 align:middle line:90%
I haven't had this experience.

01:05:47.810 --> 01:05:49.390 align:middle line:90%
So it doesn't exist.

01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:54.790 align:middle line:10%
Yet we ignore the thousands of
years of research and knowledge

01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:57.820 align:middle line:10%
that our ancestors
have left for us carved

01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:02.500 align:middle line:10%
in manuscripts and
stone, all the way back

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.120 align:middle line:10%
to the Fertile Crescent.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:06.860 align:middle line:10%
We decide, in our
arrogance, I don't see it.

01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:08.140 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't exist.

01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:11.020 align:middle line:10%
As I say in one of my books,
because we go to India

01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:15.370 align:middle line:10%
and don't see a tiger doesn't
mean there are no tigers.

01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:17.020 align:middle line:90%
Folks, thank you very much.

01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be at the back for
more questions if you need any.

01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:28.000 align:middle line:90%
