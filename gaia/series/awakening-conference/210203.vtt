>> So today, we will
be presenting some

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.430 align:middle line:84%
of our pre-selected audience
questions to our guest speakers

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.180 align:middle line:84%
starting with Richard Doty
and then moving along.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.100 align:middle line:10%
So without further
ado, I'll hand over

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.470 align:middle line:10%
to our digital emcee,
Mr. Peter Twist.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.299 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Doty.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Richard as a Special
Investigations Agent,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.860 align:middle line:84%
you were once
involved in a search

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.400 align:middle line:84%
for an escaped extraterrestrial
from a Papoose Lake

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.640 align:middle line:90%
facility known as Sight Alpha.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us what type
of extraterrestrial creature

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.730 align:middle line:84%
this was and where
it had come from?

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.700 align:middle line:84%
In early 1980s,
I was assigned as

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.690 align:middle line:84%
a counterintelligence officer
at the Groom Lake complex.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And everyone knows
that as Area 51.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.350 align:middle line:84%
There was an incident
that happened

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.920 align:middle line:84%
where an ET that
we had in captivity

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.310 align:middle line:84%
or, I don't like to
actually say captivity,

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.040 align:middle line:84%
but we were housing it
at a special facility

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.320 align:middle line:84%
called Sight Alpha, which was
Northwest of Papoose Lake.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a lot of stories
out there about this incident.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.740 align:middle line:90%
Some facts, some fiction.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.410 align:middle line:84%
But the actual
incident was that one

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:39.690 align:middle line:84%
of these extraterrestrial
entities escaped.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, Sight Alpha is in the lower
portion of the Groom Lake area.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And it made its way all the way
up to the northern perimeter

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.080 align:middle line:84%
of the Nellis Test
and Training Range,

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.070 align:middle line:84%
which encompasses Papoose Lake,
Groom Lake, and Tonopah Air

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.870 align:middle line:90%
Force Base.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.260 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.300 align:middle line:84%
The OSI office was notified
that this entity had escaped.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And the containment team, and
there was a special containment

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.010 align:middle line:84%
team on the base, and
their actual job was

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.850 align:middle line:90%
to try to capture this entity.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.160 align:middle line:84%
But we were notified
that this has happened.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And we went out to assist in
the capture of this entity.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.150 align:middle line:90%
The entity was a--

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.900 align:middle line:84%
now, the names of these entities
that we had in captivity

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.450 align:middle line:84%
or the names that we knew or had
contact with ETs over the years

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.670 align:middle line:84%
was named by the Defense
Intelligence Agency.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.870 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people ask me,
why are their name the way

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.670 align:middle line:90%
they are?

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't really
know how they named them.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.460 align:middle line:84%
But this particular entity was
a quadaloid, Q-U-A-D-A-L-O-I-D.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was an insect-looking,
almost like a praying mantis

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.850 align:middle line:90%
looking.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.030 align:middle line:84%
The problem that
particular entity had

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.720 align:middle line:84%
is that it couldn't continuously
breathe our atmosphere.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.240 align:middle line:84%
You're going to remember
that these entities come

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.040 align:middle line:84%
from millions and sometimes
millions of light year, not

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.600 align:middle line:84%
light years, but miles,
hundreds of light years away.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.940 align:middle line:84%
They come from a
different planet.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.800 align:middle line:84%
They breathe
different atmospheres.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.830 align:middle line:84%
They eat different
nutritious things.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And this particular
one, it could only

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.240 align:middle line:84%
breathe our atmosphere for
a very, very short period

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.480 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.080 align:middle line:84%
So when we finally were
able to corral this entity,

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.550 align:middle line:84%
the containment team came in
and placed in a container.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.470 align:middle line:90%
So it wouldn't die.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was taken
back to Sight Alpha.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, Sight Alpha, you can
actually get a Google map

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.900 align:middle line:84%
and look at Papoose Lake, and
just a little bit Northwest

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.000 align:middle line:90%
of Papoose Lake is a facility.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.480 align:middle line:84%
You'll see that facility
in a Google map.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.000 align:middle line:84%
That's where's Sight
Alpha is located.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And whether it's still
there or not, I left in '88,

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.985 align:middle line:90%
and I believe it's still there.

00:04:16.985 --> 00:04:18.360 align:middle line:84%
I know it's still
there on a map,

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.120 align:middle line:84%
whether it's housing
extraterrestrials or not,

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.700 align:middle line:84%
that's for maybe
another program.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.370 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Paul Sinclair.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Paul, you have been heavily
involved as a UFO researcher

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.550 align:middle line:84%
throughout the area
of Bempton in the UK.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.860 align:middle line:84%
There have been countless
claims from people

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.050 align:middle line:84%
who have experienced
strange phenomena

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.420 align:middle line:90%
in and around this location.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Paul, have you ever witnessed
any strange occurrences

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.120 align:middle line:90%
yourself?

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.160 align:middle line:84%
It's the first
answer to that, many.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, not as many as
when you take an individual up

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:03.220 align:middle line:84%
there randomly for the first
time, and then the phenomena

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.530 align:middle line:90%
seems to interact or engage.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.940 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why that is.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.225 align:middle line:84%
Andrew touched on it
earlier in his talk.

00:05:10.225 --> 00:05:11.060 align:middle line:90%
Similar .

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.540 align:middle line:84%
There's an awareness to
what we're dealing with.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.830 align:middle line:84%
But as you probably saw in
the talk, Wolflands earlier,

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.180 align:middle line:84%
there are concentrated
hotspots within the zone

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.270 align:middle line:84%
of strangeness and that
hillside in particular,

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And there's a few people
in the audience today

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.550 align:middle line:84%
who have actually been there
and experienced things.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.490 align:middle line:84%
The square of light
that we talked about,

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.900 align:middle line:90%
I've seen that personally.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.910 align:middle line:84%
Although, I didn't
see that night when

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.190 align:middle line:90%
Bob and Jemma saw it.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.380 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it with Andy Ramsden.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen it with a
guy called Steve Ashbridge.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And there's no predictability
to unexplained phenomena.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.880 align:middle line:90%
It does not present to order.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.550 align:middle line:84%
But what we didn't
touch on in the talk

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.430 align:middle line:84%
is there's a former RAF
base there, RAF Bempton.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.550 align:middle line:90%


00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.590 align:middle line:90%
It closed in 1968.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.440 align:middle line:90%
They were there from the 1940s.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.130 align:middle line:90%
So an underground facility.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And after it closed, it
was used intermittently,

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.540 align:middle line:84%
be it intermittently
by a satanic cult.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know we're
talking about the UFOs,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.080 align:middle line:84%
but I just wonder what
they evoked and experience.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.637 align:middle line:84%
Because I think it's
an into mind connection

00:06:23.637 --> 00:06:25.220 align:middle line:84%
that we're dealing
with the phenomena.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And we can bring
these things through.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.620 align:middle line:90%
So we've got RAF Bempton.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And we've got lots and lots
of UFO-related information

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.290 align:middle line:84%
in its operational
years as well.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:38.990 align:middle line:90%
There's UFO incidents.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And then if we go further
afield to RAF Staxton Wold,

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.600 align:middle line:84%
12 miles away, we've
got the same thing.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.520 align:middle line:84%
But jumping to Bempton, I'm not
sure if A is responsible for B,

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.790 align:middle line:84%
as in there was animal
mutilation up there,

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.510 align:middle line:90%
2017 to early 2019.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's light farm phenomena
present not at the same time.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.870 align:middle line:84%
I've got no definite proof
that they're responsible.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.910 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to
ask yourself, why

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.760 align:middle line:84%
is all the unexplained
phenomena presenting around

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.870 align:middle line:84%
the same area, in
the same time frames?

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.030 align:middle line:84%
The people in the
area know about it.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And them that know
don't want to talk.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.590 align:middle line:90%
It's difficult.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.480 align:middle line:84%
I've become friends with
a few of the farmers

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.120 align:middle line:90%
and gathered information.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Typical example, these farms
are in the middle of nowhere.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And when I-- whilst
investigating the light farm

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.360 align:middle line:84%
phenomena and the
mutilations, I found myself

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.690 align:middle line:84%
on these fields at 4:30 in
the morning for best part

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.670 align:middle line:84%
of 18 months,
three or four times

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.760 align:middle line:84%
a week because I wanted
to find these unfortunate

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.015 align:middle line:84%
animals before people could
say that crows had predated

00:07:44.015 --> 00:07:48.350 align:middle line:84%
on them or other animals close
to the source as possible.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:50.120 align:middle line:84%
But one particular
morning, the farmer

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.060 align:middle line:84%
came walking across
the field to me.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And there'd been a roe
deer that had been hovering

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.838 align:middle line:90%
around the field quite a bit.

00:07:57.838 --> 00:07:59.630 align:middle line:84%
I think it just weren't
quite mature enough

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:06.050 align:middle line:84%
to mix with the adults
for the mating purposes.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.702 align:middle line:84%
And as he's walking
across to me, he said,

00:08:08.702 --> 00:08:10.160 align:middle line:84%
that road here, he
says, it's dead.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.240 align:middle line:90%
It's near the kissing gate.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.448 align:middle line:90%
And we went and looked at it.

00:08:12.448 --> 00:08:15.080 align:middle line:84%
His face stripped of
skin, eyes removed.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.520 align:middle line:84%
I had not seen it
prior as I drove in.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.093 align:middle line:84%
I entered into a
different place.

00:08:21.093 --> 00:08:23.010 align:middle line:84%
He'd walked his dogs up
that way and found it.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:25.850 align:middle line:84%
But what was interesting
because he doesn't

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.350 align:middle line:90%
shut his curtains on a night.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.690 align:middle line:84%
So I'm laid in bed last
night listening to music.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:33.380 align:middle line:84%
This is on Bempton
cliffs, very close.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.326 align:middle line:84%
And there's a light going
round on my bedroom wall.

00:08:36.326 --> 00:08:38.409 align:middle line:84%
And I said, why didn't you
get up and have a look?

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:39.280 align:middle line:90%
He went, no.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.210 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:43.233 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to go out.

00:08:43.233 --> 00:08:45.650 align:middle line:84%
I think we all would probably,
or a lot of us would think,

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.590 align:middle line:84%
well, we'd have to
investigate this.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.950 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like there was
a nullifying effect on him.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:52.870 align:middle line:84%
He was adamant about
what he was saying.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.100 align:middle line:84%
We've got this light
that's going around

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:54.900 align:middle line:90%
on my bedroom wall.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm listening to music.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:59.650 align:middle line:84%
He'd not connected
that with the death

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:00.820 align:middle line:90%
of the deer, the roe deer.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.520 align:middle line:84%
But I think there is
some kind of connection.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm mindful that I don't
want to jump off the fence,

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.100 align:middle line:84%
and say, A is
responsible for B. But I

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.950 align:middle line:84%
think we've got to consider
that there's something there

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.630 align:middle line:90%
that is connecting them.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:15.430 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks a lot.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:16.620 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:21.250 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:22.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Billy Carson.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Billy, the subject of the
Black Knight Satellite

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:29.530 align:middle line:84%
has been much talked about
within the UFO community.

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And now, a new documentary
is being produced by yourself

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:33.730 align:middle line:90%
on this subject.

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.830 align:middle line:90%
What information can you share?

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:37.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Great question.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Black Knight
Satellite intrigued me probably

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.010 align:middle line:90%
about 10 years ago.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:46.340 align:middle line:84%
I came across the Black Knight
and just doing some research

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:51.320 align:middle line:84%
into UFOs and conspiracy
theories with regarding aliens.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very tiny
bit of information.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And I said, this is
pretty interesting.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:02.840 align:middle line:84%
Something orbiting our planet
before we even had satellites.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And so as I dug into
it deeper and deeper,

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:07.100 align:middle line:84%
I started to realize
that there had

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.580 align:middle line:84%
been accounts of this
object orbiting our planet.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.400 align:middle line:84%
Not only orbiting our
planet in an orbit,

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.250 align:middle line:84%
like equatorial orbit, it was
orbiting in a polar orbit.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Something that we definitely
couldn't do at the time.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Not only that we
didn't have satellites,

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:23.120 align:middle line:84%
we weren't able to
create a polar orbiting

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.010 align:middle line:90%
satellite until more recently.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.730 align:middle line:90%
So this is very interesting.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.330 align:middle line:84%
So I dug deeper and found
out that Nikola Tesla

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.660 align:middle line:84%
was getting signals from
this in the late 1800s.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Then fast forward in
time in the 1950s,

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.510 align:middle line:84%
several Ham Radio operators
were getting signals

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:41.690 align:middle line:84%
from this same object
orbiting Earth.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:45.782 align:middle line:84%
During the 1960s,
actually in 1960,

00:10:45.782 --> 00:10:47.240 align:middle line:84%
there was a gentleman
that actually

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.480 align:middle line:84%
named Duncan Lunan who was a
journalist and an astronomer.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.020 align:middle line:84%
He was a journalist for Time
Magazine and an astronomer.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And he was into astronomy
and astrophysics.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.740 align:middle line:84%
He actually wrote
an article, which

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:01.610 align:middle line:84%
got published by Time Magazine
that this object not only did

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:04.550 align:middle line:84%
it exist, but it was giving
off a specific signal.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:07.910 align:middle line:84%
This signal was decoded by Ham
Radio operators independently,

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:09.380 align:middle line:90%
as well as Duncan Lunan.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And it gave up a location of
where this thing may be from.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
Bootes constellation.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's amazing
because that's a big key.

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.200 align:middle line:84%
This is why I had to
do the documentary.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.360 align:middle line:84%
When I found out that was
the Bootes constellation,

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.240 align:middle line:84%
and being that I researched
ancient civilizations,

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I discovered that
one of the Anunnaki

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.840 align:middle line:84%
gods of the Pantheon in
Mesopotamia named Enlil,

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.020 align:middle line:84%
he actually had something
called an all seeing eye.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, this all seeing
eye would allow

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:41.578 align:middle line:84%
you to see anything going
on Earth at any given time.

00:11:41.578 --> 00:11:42.620 align:middle line:90%
And how is that possible?

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.870 align:middle line:84%
We have all seeing eyes
in space right now.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.000 align:middle line:84%
They're called
polar-orbiting satellites.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.120 align:middle line:84%
With a polar-orbiting satellite,
as the Earth spins on its axis

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and it orbits the Earth while
it's spinning on its axis,

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:56.180 align:middle line:84%
it's taking swaths of data
information, and video,

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.540 align:middle line:84%
and photos, and everything
else, topographical data.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And it gives you the capability
of transmitting that data back

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.190 align:middle line:84%
to Earth, analyzing
it, and seeing

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:05.690 align:middle line:90%
everything going on the planet.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the
best way to get

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.290 align:middle line:90%
all the data around the world.

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:11.000 align:middle line:90%
It's an all seeing eye in space.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.230 align:middle line:90%
We have those now.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:13.333 align:middle line:90%
So I said, wow.

00:12:13.333 --> 00:12:15.500 align:middle line:84%
This guy has an all seeing
eye in ancient times that

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:19.250 align:middle line:84%
can let him see population
densities, farming

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:21.770 align:middle line:84%
densities, who's got crops,
who doesn't have crops.

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Because at certain
times, he would actually

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:26.780 align:middle line:84%
destroy crops if people were
growing too much population

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.220 align:middle line:90%
in one area.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.260 align:middle line:84%
I said, could these
two things be linked?

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.200 align:middle line:84%
As I dug deeper, I
discovered that Enlil

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.620 align:middle line:84%
was the owner of the
Bootes constellation

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.390 align:middle line:84%
according to the
ancient Sumerians.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a
mind blowing thing.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.490 align:middle line:84%
So this object that's been
orbiting the Earth for who

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:46.430 align:middle line:84%
knows how long, according to
the people that have decoded

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:49.580 align:middle line:84%
the message, it's where
Bootes was in the sky

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:53.820 align:middle line:84%
approximately 11,000
to 13,000 years ago.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.510 align:middle line:84%
So this thing is super ancient,
potentially super ancient.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:00.210 align:middle line:84%
It may have been there since the
last Ice Age that we just had.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And so now, it's
saying that Enlil is

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.120 align:middle line:90%
the owner of the constellation.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.120 align:middle line:84%
To go a step further,
theoretical physicists

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.430 align:middle line:84%
have been looking at the
Bootes constellation.

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:11.630 align:middle line:90%
And what did they find?

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:13.220 align:middle line:90%
There's a void there.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.160 align:middle line:84%
There's a void in the
constellation that actually

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.640 align:middle line:90%
doesn't even have dust in it.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.515 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the largest
voids that we've ever

00:13:19.515 --> 00:13:21.560 align:middle line:90%
found in the universe so far.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And light appears to be
bending around something.

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:26.450 align:middle line:84%
So I started to
look even deeper.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:27.690 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:28.490 align:middle line:90%
Well.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:32.210 align:middle line:84%
They're theorizing that it's an
advanced cloaked civilization.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:35.880 align:middle line:84%
So we have a satellite orbiting
Earth that shouldn't be there,

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.550 align:middle line:90%
especially in a polar orbit.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:40.160 align:middle line:84%
It's giving off a
signal stating that it's

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.480 align:middle line:84%
from Bootes Epsilon, which
is a constellation hundreds

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.720 align:middle line:90%
of light years away.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And we have a link
to it on Earth

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.260 align:middle line:84%
with the Mesopotamian
God, Enlil,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:55.130 align:middle line:84%
who has an all seeing eye
and owns the constellation.

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:56.750 align:middle line:90%
Just too many coincidences.

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And I said, we've got to
dig a lot deeper into this.

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:01.250 align:middle line:84%
So I made a documentary
called "The Black Knight

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:02.810 align:middle line:90%
Satellite, Beyond the Signal."

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's available on
4biddenknowledge TV.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:08.000 align:middle line:84%
If you want to watch
it, just go to 4bk.tv.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.680 align:middle line:84%
It's only about an
hour and a half.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think I had about 20
incredible talents in there.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.955 align:middle line:84%
And Mr. Mera is in there as
well giving his great content

00:14:16.955 --> 00:14:18.842 align:middle line:90%
and information to the story.

00:14:18.842 --> 00:14:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And we dug really deep
into the research.

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think we provided
something for everyone

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:24.740 align:middle line:84%
to take a look at and come
up with your own conclusion.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:27.920 align:middle line:84%
But I do think that there's a
link between ancient Sumeria

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.410 align:middle line:84%
and the Bootes the constellation
and the Black Knight.

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:32.930 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:33.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:38.190 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:39.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Barry Fitzgerald.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Barry, is there
a "them" and "us"

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:48.700 align:middle line:84%
divide, we must recognize
within modern UFO technology?

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>> There is.

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And when I suppose we reference
that them and us divide,

00:14:55.330 --> 00:15:01.450 align:middle line:84%
initially we have to look
at the craft and phenomena

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:04.150 align:middle line:84%
of our ancestors of what
they were experiencing

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:07.180 align:middle line:84%
compared to what we
are experiencing now

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:08.710 align:middle line:90%
within the modern age.

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And within the 20th
century, it gets very murky

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.920 align:middle line:84%
when we try and identify
between the two.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:20.260 align:middle line:84%
But now, we've reached a
stage within modern society

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:24.205 align:middle line:84%
that we have phenomena
such as the Tic

00:15:24.205 --> 00:15:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Tac of San Diego and
things like that, which

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.410 align:middle line:90%
in itself is our technology.

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:33.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's our tech.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:37.510 align:middle line:10%
But our tech is very, very
different in signature

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:41.800 align:middle line:10%
to the tech of
them, if you wish.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:46.210 align:middle line:10%
And there has been some
evidence that has come forward

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:51.340 align:middle line:10%
to suggest that the amount
of microwave technology

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.970 align:middle line:10%
or microwave emitted
from our technology

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:57.190 align:middle line:10%
is much, much higher.

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:00.160 align:middle line:10%
And for anyone who gets
within around 100 feet

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.930 align:middle line:10%
of this particular
craft, there have

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:04.090 align:middle line:10%
been some figures
being suggested

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:07.900 align:middle line:10%
that of the people that
do have that encounter,

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.150 align:middle line:10%
it is around 10% that are
dead within seven years.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.120 align:middle line:10%
And so there's a
radiation contaminant

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.290 align:middle line:10%
that we have to be aware of.

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:17.170 align:middle line:10%
The high signature
of this contamination

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:19.180 align:middle line:10%
that comes from the
stuff that we build

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.780 align:middle line:10%
is certainly not the same as
what we've seen with them.

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:26.440 align:middle line:10%
Theirs is either
shielded or they're

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:31.430 align:middle line:10%
using a different style
of technology altogether.

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm
speaking later on, I

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:37.630 align:middle line:84%
will be reflecting and
looking at this idea

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:40.480 align:middle line:90%
of the different style.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:44.030 align:middle line:84%
But yes, there is a difference
between "us" and "them."

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say with the
advancements of technology

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:52.710 align:middle line:84%
today, we are really
starting to outsurpass them.

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:53.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:59.030 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:00.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Steve Mera.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Steve, you've been
investigating the UFO phenomenon

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:05.490 align:middle line:90%
for almost 40 years.

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:08.780 align:middle line:84%
During that time, you've likely
come across many theories

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.490 align:middle line:90%
about UFOs.

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.829 align:middle line:84%
Has your opinion
changed over the years?

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And what's your current
opinion in regards to where

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:17.970 align:middle line:90%
these UFOs are coming from?

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:18.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, boy.

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:20.240 align:middle line:90%
What a question.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.190 align:middle line:84%
When I first
started, my mentors--

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:25.550 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you probably the
beginnings of 1980s here.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:30.590 align:middle line:84%
My mentors said to me, Steve,
these extraterrestrials,

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:33.440 align:middle line:84%
they're traveling from
different planets,

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:37.100 align:middle line:84%
traveling the vastness
of space in very nuts

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.660 align:middle line:90%
and bolts physical crafts.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.360 align:middle line:90%


00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And I took that verbatim,
to be honest with you.

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.300 align:middle line:84%
As time's gone on,
boy, has that changed.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:50.630 align:middle line:84%
The metaphysical factors
of this phenomena

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:53.180 align:middle line:84%
was totally ignored
in the early days.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.050 align:middle line:90%
And it was pushed aside.

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:58.220 align:middle line:84%
It was considered woo,
woo, not worthy of study.

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:02.340 align:middle line:84%
That is the most important
aspects of this study.

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:06.680 align:middle line:84%
We now are literally
on the cusp of change.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Ufology is balancing
on its edge.

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you
the reasons why.

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:14.240 align:middle line:84%
In the highest
circles of ufology,

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.360 align:middle line:84%
these think tanks, what I can
say what is actually happening

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.960 align:middle line:84%
is that they are aware
of the high strangeness.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.710 align:middle line:84%
They are aware of what
they refer to is woo, woo.

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:26.510 align:middle line:84%
But what they're
currently faced with

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:29.000 align:middle line:84%
is that over the
last few years, we've

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.780 align:middle line:84%
had a huge amount of
academics and scientists

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.870 align:middle line:84%
coming forward, especially
since the Pentagon announcement,

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:39.410 align:middle line:84%
since the newspapers picked up,
since the pilots come forward

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.600 align:middle line:84%
from the Navy talking
about these things.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.800 align:middle line:90%
We've seen the films.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.180 align:middle line:90%
We've seen the footage.

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Since then, we've had
some people come forward

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.250 align:middle line:84%
from the scientific
community saying,

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:51.960 align:middle line:84%
do you know what, I
want to get involved.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.000 align:middle line:90%
I want to help out.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.010 align:middle line:84%
I want to put my work
forward and trying a system

00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:59.390 align:middle line:90%
coming up with some answers.

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:01.910 align:middle line:90%
That was pretty much unheard of.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.760 align:middle line:84%
It might have been going
on in the military factor,

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.500 align:middle line:90%
but not in the public realm.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.130 align:middle line:84%
So we don't want
to scare them off.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:11.480 align:middle line:10%
That's what I was told.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.520 align:middle line:84%
In those circles,
they say, well, we

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.990 align:middle line:90%
know about the high strangers.

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:17.300 align:middle line:90%
We know about the woo woo.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.370 align:middle line:84%
But we can't give
it to scientists

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.590 align:middle line:84%
because we've just
got them interested.

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:24.060 align:middle line:84%
If we go and throw all
this in front of them,

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:28.370 align:middle line:84%
you've literally got
to rewrite physics.

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:33.860 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to deliver
digestible chunks to them.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.570 align:middle line:90%
It's the only way.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:37.530 align:middle line:90%
And that is the way forward.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:38.840 align:middle line:90%
And that is why it's balancing.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, it says,
because now we know

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:44.240 align:middle line:84%
that an extraterrestrial
civilization, which

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.650 align:middle line:84%
would be so advanced, is very
unlikely to travel the vastness

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:50.540 align:middle line:90%
of space as we would think.

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.690 align:middle line:10%
They would have found
an easier, better way.

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:56.300 align:middle line:84%
If we look about this phenomena,
where it's coming from,

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.770 align:middle line:84%
because it's asking
that question,

00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:00.110 align:middle line:90%
where are they coming from?

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the early
days, we'd say, well,

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.490 align:middle line:84%
maybe from this
planet or that planet.

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:06.080 align:middle line:90%
That might be the case.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.600 align:middle line:84%
But not in the sense
of what we think.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Because most of
this phenomena seems

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.970 align:middle line:84%
to have a metaphysical
aspect to it.

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:18.290 align:middle line:84%
They seem to materialize,
manifest, and de-materialize

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:19.220 align:middle line:90%
in key areas.

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Very similar to some of
the paranormal things

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:23.870 align:middle line:90%
that we experience in life.

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:27.800 align:middle line:84%
The apportation of other
items in poltergeist cases

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.110 align:middle line:84%
is very similar to the
sudden manifestation

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:33.870 align:middle line:84%
if an UFO suddenly appears on
the ground in front of people.

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:35.780 align:middle line:84%
The problem that we
have is that we're

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:39.530 align:middle line:84%
going to have to look at
the whole scope, which

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:42.350 align:middle line:84%
I referred to and Barry
refers to as phenomenology.

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:46.525 align:middle line:84%
Because what we seem to
be faced with is this--

00:20:46.525 --> 00:20:49.040 align:middle line:84%
I think it may have been
even done purposely,

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:53.720 align:middle line:84%
to some degree, that we've
got this compartmentalization

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.640 align:middle line:90%
between all these subjects.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.610 align:middle line:84%
The paranormal guys weren't
dealing with the UFO guys.

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:00.785 align:middle line:84%
UFO guys weren't
dealing with paranormal.

00:21:00.785 --> 00:21:05.000 align:middle line:84%
We've got all these supernatural
aspects, and the paranormal,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.530 align:middle line:90%
and the metaphysical.

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:09.162 align:middle line:84%
And when you bring
all these together,

00:21:09.162 --> 00:21:11.120 align:middle line:84%
this is why we're not
getting the full picture.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Because we were
stuck in our UFO box.

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:15.333 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going into
the other areas.

00:21:15.333 --> 00:21:17.750 align:middle line:84%
We're never going to gain that
full picture until we start

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:19.833 align:middle line:84%
tearing it all down and
looking at the whole thing

00:21:19.833 --> 00:21:20.840 align:middle line:90%
as phenomenology.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:24.362 align:middle line:84%
Because once you do that, you
start to realize very quickly,

00:21:24.362 --> 00:21:26.570 align:middle line:84%
well, hang on a second,
there's a considerable amount

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:30.260 align:middle line:84%
of cases of UFO incidents
where it involves

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.430 align:middle line:90%
paranormal-type phenomena.

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:33.530 align:middle line:90%
Now, why is that?

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:35.990 align:middle line:84%
If we're dealing with an
extraterrestrial source coming

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:39.410 align:middle line:84%
from some other planet, and
presumably a paranormal thing

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:42.590 align:middle line:84%
is a very ancient old
phenomena on Earth,

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:46.850 align:middle line:84%
why are they seemingly utilizing
this similar physics here?

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think what we're doing now
is that we're balancing right

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:52.850 align:middle line:84%
on that edge of bringing in
this high strangeness because it

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:54.770 align:middle line:90%
cannot be ignored any longer.

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:58.370 align:middle line:84%
But this phenomena may very
well be right under our noses

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:00.440 align:middle line:90%
at any given time of the day.

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And that they're not only
aware of our proceedings

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.880 align:middle line:84%
and what we're going
to do, but also,

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:08.550 align:middle line:84%
it may be possibly even into
the future, small future events.

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:09.972 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to
prepare ourselves

00:22:09.972 --> 00:22:11.930 align:middle line:84%
to have an understanding
that we haven't really

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:13.460 align:middle line:90%
had to concede before.

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And that is the world
of quantum physics,

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.830 align:middle line:84%
quantum mechanics, and
rewriting literally the physics

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:21.050 align:middle line:84%
we know to try and gain
some understanding.

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:24.890 align:middle line:84%
But, yes, The UFO phenomena
for me is vastly changed

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:26.900 align:middle line:90%
over the years.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:33.150 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Doty.

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Richard, there
has been much talk

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:40.650 align:middle line:84%
surrounding the topic of time
traveling ETs over the last 10

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:41.520 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.710 align:middle line:84%
During your work,
did you ever come

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:47.430 align:middle line:84%
across any information
pertaining to extraterrestrials

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:50.400 align:middle line:90%
and time travel capabilities?

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:52.290 --> 00:23:00.500 align:middle line:84%
Way back in the early 80's, the
Defense Intelligence Agency,

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.120 align:middle line:84%
they had a highly
classified program

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.100 align:middle line:90%
experimenting with time travel.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And this was out at Nevada
test site, which is now

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:13.590 align:middle line:84%
the Nevada National Security
Site, where the nuclear weapons

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:15.660 align:middle line:90%
were tested years before.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:18.690 align:middle line:84%
They built some special
facilities out there

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.390 align:middle line:84%
to experiment and
time traveling.

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:25.260 align:middle line:84%
Trying to figure out
how they could do that.

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Top scientists from all
over the United States

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:31.710 align:middle line:84%
and some from the
UK were there trying

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:36.730 align:middle line:84%
to perfect a method to open
up the fabric of space,

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:42.585 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, in order to travel,
either forward or back in time.

00:23:42.585 --> 00:23:45.360 align:middle line:90%


00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, as I mentioned
earlier, we had visitors,

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:55.410 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to call them, at
the facility at Site Alpha.

00:23:55.410 --> 00:24:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
particular entities,

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.520 align:middle line:84%
although, we couldn't
fully communicate,

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.460 align:middle line:90%
but we were able to determine.

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know exactly
how this happened.

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:13.230 align:middle line:84%
But the scientists were able to
communicate in a way for them

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:17.970 align:middle line:84%
to explain something about
how they move from one point

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:20.790 align:middle line:90%
to another in space.

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:24.030 align:middle line:90%
And this is back in the 80's.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:26.490 align:middle line:84%
You've got to understand,
our understanding

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:28.290 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of different
things, even

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:31.080 align:middle line:84%
pertaining to physics
and astronomy,

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:34.620 align:middle line:90%
was a neophyte back then.

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:38.860 align:middle line:84%
We were just in the infant
stages of understanding this.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:44.220 align:middle line:84%
So our scientists
were able to grasp

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:47.310 align:middle line:84%
some information
that was provided

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:49.650 align:middle line:90%
by this particular visitor.

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:54.180 align:middle line:90%
And they tried to adapt that.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:58.170 align:middle line:84%
But, unfortunately,
you have to understand

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:03.150 align:middle line:84%
that the visitor's technology
was hundreds or maybe thousands

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:04.650 align:middle line:90%
of years more advanced than us.

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Plus, we couldn't
understand their science.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was difficult for them
to relate their science to us.

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:17.520 align:middle line:84%
But we were able to understand
that that particular entity was

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:23.820 align:middle line:84%
able to move not so much
as during time travel,

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:28.730 align:middle line:84%
but moving forward
and back in time.

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:32.190 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't understand
exactly how they did it,

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:34.410 align:middle line:90%
but they were able to do that.

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And over the years
now, jumping to now,

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:43.340 align:middle line:84%
after I left
government service, I

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:46.010 align:middle line:84%
worked for the Institute for
Advanced Studies at Austin, Dr.

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Harold Puthoff
facility down there.

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And there was some
research that was

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:55.880 align:middle line:84%
done regarding this particular
subject of traveling the time.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Most scientists understand time
travel to be only back in time

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:04.820 align:middle line:84%
because that's occurred
rather than forward in time,

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:08.030 align:middle line:90%
where it hasn't occurred yet.

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:13.880 align:middle line:84%
But there's a strong evidence
that we can do that now.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Even by just moving some atoms
from one location to another

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:25.340 align:middle line:84%
or a molecule of water or
the third element of water

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:30.170 align:middle line:84%
tritium of the molecule
from one point to another.

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:34.200 align:middle line:84%
We're able to do that,
both forward and backwards.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:39.800 align:middle line:84%
So the answer to the question,
yes, ETs can do that.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.790 align:middle line:84%
If one particular species
of extraterrestrials

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:49.670 align:middle line:84%
can travel in that manner,
probably all of them could.

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:56.570 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:57.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Paul Sinclair.

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Paul, are there any
significant ancient burial

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:04.700 align:middle line:84%
mounds in the region of Bempton
or around the coastal region?

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And if so, do you think
they are connected

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:09.530 align:middle line:84%
to some of the strange
phenomena being

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:11.990 align:middle line:90%
witnessed in that location?

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:14.290 align:middle line:90%
There are burial mounds.

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And I do think they're connected
to the unexplained phenomena.

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:21.430 align:middle line:84%
I think the ancient
people already knew this.

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they placed their
burial mounds and other stones,

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:31.420 align:middle line:84%
I think Maria touched on it,
the Rudston Monolith, earlier.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's about 11
miles from my home.

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Britain's tallest standing
stone is about 29 and 1/2 feet.

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's been a place
of worship and sacrifice

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.330 align:middle line:84%
for thousands and
thousands of years.

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:47.710 align:middle line:90%
It's in a churchyard.

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:50.830 align:middle line:84%
But it obviously
predates the churchyard.

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was excavated in
the 1800's by someone

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:56.665 align:middle line:90%
called William Strickland.

00:27:56.665 --> 00:28:00.070 align:middle line:84%
He found large quantities
of human skulls.

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And this speculated that it
had been a site of sacrifice.

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:05.140 align:middle line:84%
A few miles away,
there's probably

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:09.130 align:middle line:84%
one of the most famous burial
mounds in the United Kingdom.

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:13.180 align:middle line:84%
If anybody Google's or
has a look at Willy Howe,

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:17.740 align:middle line:84%
you will find that it's
associated with fairies,

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:20.290 align:middle line:84%
hobgoblins, and elf-like
folk, the stories

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:25.000 align:middle line:84%
throughout folklore,
describing seeing

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.490 align:middle line:84%
a glowing entrance
into the burial mound

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:29.830 align:middle line:90%
and vast banquets taking place.

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:33.730 align:middle line:84%
We realize that over time, these
things may become distorted.

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:36.320 align:middle line:84%
But I believe there's an
element of truth there.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.190 align:middle line:84%
I have a report
in the first book

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:42.610 align:middle line:84%
of a pilot that used to be
an airfield at Willy Howe

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:44.290 align:middle line:90%
Farm, the farm.

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:46.060 align:middle line:90%
It had a small airstrip.

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And there was a pilot there
who had a vintage plane.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:52.510 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't equipped
for night flight.

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And he contacted me
and told me this story.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:55.810 align:middle line:90%
It had three gauges on it.

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:58.420 align:middle line:84%
We'd got revs, altitude,
or something else,

00:28:58.420 --> 00:28:59.770 align:middle line:90%
it slips my mind.

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And he said, on
this particular day,

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:03.550 align:middle line:84%
he decided to fly up the
coast towards Whitby.

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:05.740 align:middle line:90%
He takes his plane out.

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And coming back is close
to the burial mound.

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:11.780 align:middle line:90%
And the sun is just setting.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:13.240 align:middle line:84%
So he realizes,
he's got time to do

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:17.697 align:middle line:84%
what he wants to do because
no lights on this plane.

00:29:17.697 --> 00:29:19.030 align:middle line:90%
And he looks at the sun setting.

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And then he turns and
he sees another sun.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:25.480 align:middle line:84%
I think he's confused
as you would be.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Thinking this can't
be another sun.

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.330 align:middle line:90%
What's happening, he said.

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And then he gave
a few analogies.

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Then he said, it was
almost as though my plane

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:36.160 align:middle line:90%
flew into a cobweb literally.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.420 align:middle line:90%
He said, and I looked.

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:38.710 align:middle line:90%
And I'm traveling.

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:40.760 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not moving.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm not losing any altitude.

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:43.903 align:middle line:90%
This is strange.

00:29:43.903 --> 00:29:45.070 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, it's going to be.

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:47.110 align:middle line:90%
So a period of time passes.

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
he's flying again.

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:51.640 align:middle line:90%
And he's in the night.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.310 align:middle line:84%
He said, there
were some 37 volts,

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:59.140 align:middle line:84%
I think, KV cables in the field
across where he wanted to land.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, in daylight,
that wouldn't be a problem.

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:04.780 align:middle line:84%
There's a tractor plowing with
its lights on in the field.

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And he put the plane
down in the field

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:08.800 align:middle line:90%
at the side of Willy Howe.

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.780 align:middle line:84%
So that's a story of
the burial mounds.

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:14.380 align:middle line:84%
But, yes, we've got earthworks
all around this area.

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:17.470 align:middle line:84%
The location steeped
with ancient earthworks.

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's just a few examples
of strange things happening

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:21.280 align:middle line:90%
around them.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.863 align:middle line:84%
But a little bit
further up the coast,

00:30:22.863 --> 00:30:24.340 align:middle line:84%
we've got the
Devil's Arrows, which

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.650 align:middle line:84%
are made of the same
stone, gritstone

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:29.720 align:middle line:84%
as what the Rudston
Monolith is made out of.

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:30.520 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:36.140 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:37.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Billy Carson.

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Billy, in more
recent years, there

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:42.950 align:middle line:84%
has been a growing interest
in regards to planet Mars.

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:45.860 align:middle line:84%
Could there have once been
an ancient civilization

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.880 align:middle line:90%
that occupied this planet?

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And if so, what evidence
is there to support this?

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:54.590 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of great
questions here.

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:57.950 align:middle line:90%
Mars is an amazing place.

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:00.492 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk a lot about
it actually tonight at 7:00 PM.

00:31:00.492 --> 00:31:02.450 align:middle line:84%
So you don't want to miss
this talk because I'm

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:04.970 align:middle line:84%
going to show you some
anomalies on Mars and the links

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:07.400 align:middle line:84%
that it has to Earth
and other civilizations.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:11.630 align:middle line:84%
But Mars used to be a
habitable moon of Tiamat,

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:13.310 align:middle line:90%
which I'll talk about tonight.

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And one side of Mars
is completely charred.

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And the other side
is extremely smooth.

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:22.250 align:middle line:10%
The side that charred was the
side that actually was impacted

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:24.680 align:middle line:10%
by the explosion of this
planet named Tiamat,

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:27.440 align:middle line:10%
which now is the asteroid belt.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And then Mars was slung
into this very strange

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:31.460 align:middle line:90%
elliptical orbit around the sun.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.290 align:middle line:90%
And it became a planet.

00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:36.050 align:middle line:84%
But Mars originally
was a habitable moon.

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting about
it, we've sent a lot of missions

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.440 align:middle line:90%
to Mars.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.720 align:middle line:84%
If you look at all of
the space agencies that

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.910 align:middle line:84%
have sent missions
to Mars, you'll

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:46.250 align:middle line:84%
find that literally
trillions of dollars

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:50.000 align:middle line:84%
have been spent to send
remote controlled cars

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.580 align:middle line:90%
to a cold, dry rock.

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, tonight, I'm going to
show you evidence in my lecture

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:57.770 align:middle line:84%
that Mars is not
a cold, dry rock.

00:31:57.770 --> 00:31:59.300 align:middle line:90%
That there is that atmosphere.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.940 align:middle line:84%
That there is oxygen. That
there is magnetic field.

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:05.510 align:middle line:84%
That there is bioshock
bending the solar wind

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:06.710 align:middle line:90%
around the planet.

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:08.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show you all
the science data that we've

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:13.230 align:middle line:84%
collected on Mars showing you
that the planet was extremely

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:14.030 align:middle line:90%
habitable.

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And right now, today
currently, it's

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.380 align:middle line:90%
habitable in a limited basis.

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Also, I'm going to talk
tonight about the pole

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:22.280 align:middle line:90%
shift that occurred on Mars.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:26.120 align:middle line:84%
When it took that impact, the
crust of the actual planet

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:30.440 align:middle line:84%
itself shifted about 45 degrees
creating a pole shift, which

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.960 align:middle line:84%
created a global
flood on Mars, which

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:35.420 align:middle line:84%
is why a lot of the anomalies
that we have discovered

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.610 align:middle line:84%
appeared to be
washed over by mud.

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to show you
a lot of anomalies taken

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.550 align:middle line:84%
from several different
rovers, Opportunity, Spirit,

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:46.940 align:middle line:90%
Perseverance, Curiosity Rover.

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:48.797 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be
an amazing talk tonight

00:32:48.797 --> 00:32:49.880 align:middle line:90%
you don't want to miss it.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Mars, in my opinion, is directly
linked to the ancient Atlantean

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.330 align:middle line:90%
culture that was on Earth.

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
provide my evidence

00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:01.070 align:middle line:84%
for that tonight showing
that Atlantis was not just

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:03.860 align:middle line:84%
a ring city in the
middle of the Atlantic.

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:07.670 align:middle line:84%
But that Atlantis was not only
a global civilization on Earth,

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:10.550 align:middle line:84%
but it was also an
interplanetary civilization.

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And that I believe that similar
anomalies or things that

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.310 align:middle line:84%
are anomalies that
we've discovered

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:20.390 align:middle line:84%
look extremely similar to some
of the ancient structures,

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:23.060 align:middle line:84%
megalithic structures
left behind here on Earth.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Everything from ankhs
which I'll show you that

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.960 align:middle line:84%
have been left
behind here on Earth,

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:30.650 align:middle line:84%
to ankhs that we can see on
planet Mars from the rover

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:31.820 align:middle line:90%
data.

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Pyramids and many,
many other anomalies

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:38.625 align:middle line:84%
that we can show you that will
leave you scratching your head

00:33:38.625 --> 00:33:40.250 align:middle line:84%
like, what is really
going on up there?

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And some things
that don't look too

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:45.450 align:middle line:84%
old, which really makes you want
to scratch your head, and go,

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:47.120 align:middle line:90%
what is going on Mars?

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:50.870 align:middle line:84%
In my personal opinion, I
think that Mars is probably

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:52.970 align:middle line:84%
a location of a
breakaway civilization.

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:56.120 align:middle line:84%
It makes total logical
sense, especially when

00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:00.980 align:middle line:84%
you're spending trillions of
dollars over several decades

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:02.760 align:middle line:90%
to go visit this place.

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.960 align:middle line:10%
And the reason why there's a lot
of billionaires going to Mars

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.430 align:middle line:10%
is because I,
personally, believe,

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:09.290 align:middle line:10%
this is my personal
opinion, that there's

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:11.870 align:middle line:10%
an infrastructure
that has already been

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:13.760 align:middle line:10%
worked out and built up there.

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:18.230 align:middle line:84%
When you talk about Elon
Musk and Branson and all

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:20.480 align:middle line:84%
these other
billionaires that are

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.060 align:middle line:84%
looking to go to Mars on a
one way trip and not come back

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.697 align:middle line:90%
and taking people with them.

00:34:24.697 --> 00:34:26.989 align:middle line:84%
If you're on Earth with the
creature comforts of Earth,

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:27.830 align:middle line:90%
you're a billionaire.

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:29.270 align:middle line:84%
You've got all the
money you need.

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:31.040 align:middle line:90%
You can go on all the vacations.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.503 align:middle line:84%
You can go on yachts
and airplanes.

00:34:32.503 --> 00:34:33.920 align:middle line:84%
You can see this
beautiful planet.

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.409 align:middle line:84%
You've got butlers, and
maids, and servants.

00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:38.540 align:middle line:90%
Everything is first class.

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:41.060 align:middle line:84%
You don't necessarily want to
get on an airplane or a space

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:44.090 align:middle line:84%
plane and go to another planet
that's just a cold, dry rock

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:46.130 align:middle line:84%
and live in a tin
can and a spacesuit

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:48.260 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of your
life until you die.

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:51.389 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make logical
sense, at least, not to me.

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And so if I'm going
to go to Mars,

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:56.330 align:middle line:84%
that means I'm already
knowing that there's possibly

00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:58.460 align:middle line:84%
an infrastructure
established, whether it's

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:00.780 align:middle line:90%
below ground or above ground.

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:03.980 align:middle line:84%
We know that you can 3D print
10 to 12 houses in a day.

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:07.310 align:middle line:84%
A Japanese architect is already
doing that right now in Japan.

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:11.960 align:middle line:84%
They 3D print houses using
existing regolith and soil

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.000 align:middle line:84%
right from the current
landscape and turn it

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.380 align:middle line:90%
into a house in a day.

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.480 align:middle line:84%
They can do a dozen
houses in a day.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Could that same technology
be used on Mars?

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:20.375 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:35:20.375 --> 00:35:22.250 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to talk a
lot about that tonight

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:24.410 align:middle line:84%
to show you guys
a lot of anomalies

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:26.450 align:middle line:90%
that you're going to see.

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Actually, they resemble
ancient things here

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:34.390 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, but also some things
that don't look so ancient.

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And do we know
exactly what they are?

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:37.030 align:middle line:90%
No, we don't.

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:39.100 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell
you that there has

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:42.430 align:middle line:84%
been xenon discovered in
the science data coming back

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:45.130 align:middle line:90%
from Mars, weapons grade xenon.

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And so xenon is a
byproduct of nuclear war,

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:50.890 align:middle line:90%
nuclear explosions.

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And so when you have
xenon in the soil

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:55.930 align:middle line:84%
and in the atmosphere and
those levels, it tells us

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:59.660 align:middle line:90%
Mars truly was the God of War.

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And so if you come to my
talk tonight at 7:00 PM,

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:05.320 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go in deep and
in-depth on this conversation.

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:06.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show
the link between them

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:08.710 align:middle line:90%
and the Atlantean civilization.

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:14.660 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Barry Fitzgerald.

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Barry, we occasionally hear of
an observer effect in regards

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:22.070 align:middle line:90%
to UFO witnesses.

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Do you think the effect
could be caused by the UFO?

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>> The observer effect generally
encompassed this idea that,

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:38.480 align:middle line:84%
for instance, three people
could see three different things

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.650 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:44.060 align:middle line:84%
But this also reflects on
the conscious connection

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:49.010 align:middle line:84%
with the true phenomena
and not the man-made one.

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And the problem that
we face is that we

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:54.950 align:middle line:84%
have around a 20-second window
with the observer effect.

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:59.210 align:middle line:10%
And the initial contact,
that light in the sky

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:01.760 align:middle line:10%
is the hook and the bait.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:10.640 align:middle line:84%
So when we're seeing this and
understand 20-second window,

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:13.520 align:middle line:84%
this effect really
comes into play

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:16.760 align:middle line:84%
because that's whenever it
links into the conscious.

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:18.530 align:middle line:84%
It links into the
conscious brain.

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And we start seeing
the different aspects.

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.170 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes completely different.

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And because consciously, it's
linked to you as an individual.

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And that conscious connection
happens within the first 20

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:32.330 align:middle line:90%
seconds.

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And that is where
the body signals you.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.600 align:middle line:84%
Your own body signals you
within the first 20 seconds,

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.790 align:middle line:84%
if what you are encountering
is right or not.

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:42.732 align:middle line:90%
It will alert you.

00:37:42.732 --> 00:37:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And there are ways that
I will talk about later

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:46.460 align:middle line:90%
about how you identify that.

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:49.310 align:middle line:90%
But that can be overridden.

00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:53.490 align:middle line:84%
That biological response
can be shut down.

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And the brain will
then be triggered

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:59.870 align:middle line:84%
to enter into a particular
brain pattern, which

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:05.030 align:middle line:84%
is where the body will
move into when we're going

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:08.910 align:middle line:90%
into the likes of meditation.

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:10.805 align:middle line:84%
And we also have
hypnotic suggestion.

00:38:10.805 --> 00:38:12.410 align:middle line:90%
It can also be brought in there.

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:15.000 align:middle line:84%
False memory can
also be induced.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.380 align:middle line:84%
So we have a 20-second
window, which

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:20.450 align:middle line:84%
if we understand the
signals from a body,

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:22.760 align:middle line:84%
we can defend ourselves
against this encounter

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.940 align:middle line:90%
and better understand it.

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:28.290 align:middle line:84%
But that's something
I'll talk about later on.

00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:31.700 align:middle line:84%
So there is a difference
within every single individual

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:34.940 align:middle line:84%
about what they're seeing when
the conscious connection is

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:39.494 align:middle line:84%
linked to every single one
of us on a different level.

00:38:39.494 --> 00:38:45.660 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:46.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Steve Mera.

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Steve, you've been working
alongside Barry Fitzgerald

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:52.965 align:middle line:84%
in a special study known
as Project Doorway.

00:38:52.965 --> 00:38:56.970 align:middle line:84%
A part of that research involved
the Colares UFO incident

00:38:56.970 --> 00:39:00.810 align:middle line:90%
from 1977 to 1978.

00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:04.657 align:middle line:84%
Steve, what have you learned
from studying this case?

00:39:04.657 --> 00:39:05.740 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good question.

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:11.250 align:middle line:10%
Well, we had an interesting trip
to the US a couple of years ago

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:16.590 align:middle line:10%
and report to George Knapp had
driven all the way from Las

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:21.660 align:middle line:10%
Vegas to LA to interview myself
and Barry about this, actually.

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And what we found
was very interesting

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:29.460 align:middle line:84%
is that how some of these
incidents, some of these cases

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:33.730 align:middle line:84%
are being swept under
the rug to some degree.

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:36.270 align:middle line:84%
There are many places
around the world

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:38.430 align:middle line:84%
where we might consider
the UFO phenomenon

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:40.440 align:middle line:90%
cases of love and light.

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And in many places,
that's exactly what

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.490 align:middle line:90%
the belief system is.

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:47.970 align:middle line:84%
But this doesn't tell the full
story about this phenomena.

00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people are
injured or even worse.

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And when we go and deliver
information about the subjects,

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.950 align:middle line:84%
we pretty much say
it for what it is.

00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:01.725 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to paint
it in any direction,

00:40:01.725 --> 00:40:04.740 align:middle line:84%
not give it a belief
system a certain tag,

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:07.950 align:middle line:84%
and just report on the
evidence that's been provided.

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And the Colares UFO incident,
which took place in '77 and '78

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.890 align:middle line:90%
was one case like that.

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:16.450 align:middle line:90%
And it's not the only one.

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:18.190 align:middle line:84%
There's been others
around the world,

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:20.700 align:middle line:84%
as well as like, for
instance, in India,

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:25.560 align:middle line:84%
where people have been attacked
by these flying objects, which

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.890 align:middle line:84%
fire a pencil beam
light down at them.

00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, the villages
and the people that

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:35.010 align:middle line:84%
lived on this small town,
the small village of Colares,

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:39.360 align:middle line:84%
an island off the
shores of Brazil, really

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:43.343 align:middle line:84%
wasn't a big place known
for military and/or policing

00:40:43.343 --> 00:40:44.260 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:47.080 align:middle line:84%
It was just tucked
out of the way.

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And people have pretty
much a simple life.

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And one day they were
besieged by these objects.

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And this went on for a
considerable length of time.

00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest
problem for them was

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:02.640 align:middle line:90%
trying to evade these crafts.

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Because what was happening is
that these lights, these beams

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:09.210 align:middle line:84%
of pencil beam
lights had come down

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:11.520 align:middle line:84%
and were striking
some of the villagers.

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And when it did,
it paralyzed them.

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:18.265 align:middle line:84%
What the biggest problem
was because they, obviously,

00:41:18.265 --> 00:41:19.890 align:middle line:84%
thought, well, let's
stay out of sight.

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Then you got very
panicky, very worried.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And they decided when
these things are around

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.800 align:middle line:90%
is run off into the house.

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.680 align:middle line:84%
But the biggest problem
was is that these lights

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:31.590 align:middle line:84%
from these objects would
penetrate solid things,

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:36.450 align:middle line:84%
would penetrate the walls, would
penetrate the roofs of houses.

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:41.340 align:middle line:84%
People would suddenly find
themselves waking up in bed

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:43.830 align:middle line:84%
seeing this beam of light
coming from the ceiling

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:46.260 align:middle line:84%
and hitting them in
the body not being able

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:50.850 align:middle line:84%
to move, and tremendous,
tremendous pain.

00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:53.250 align:middle line:84%
You can't imagine to
not being able to move

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:54.450 align:middle line:90%
under those circumstances.

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:58.680 align:middle line:84%
What was left behind was
puncture rooms between seven

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:00.540 align:middle line:90%
and nine little holes.

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:05.010 align:middle line:84%
But what was most fascinating
about over 1,000 people,

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:07.560 align:middle line:84%
actually was about
1,300 people, was

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:11.430 align:middle line:84%
these things attacked,
is that the amount

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:14.910 align:middle line:84%
of people that had
adrenal weakness.

00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Because the iron-- the iron
content from their body

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:24.030 align:middle line:84%
had been suddenly
taken, diminished.

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And that was a really
fascinating thing.

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:28.380 align:middle line:90%
Why is this happening?

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:29.760 align:middle line:90%
Now, don't get me wrong.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:35.010 align:middle line:84%
These people did go to
hospitals and did see doctors.

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And some of them did die
from those illnesses,

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:39.480 align:middle line:90%
from those injuries.

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't
publicized very well.

00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:44.040 align:middle line:90%
It was kept very quiet.

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:45.760 align:middle line:90%
These incidents do happen.

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:48.690 align:middle line:84%
So we like to call it for
what it is, this phenomena.

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And we realized, hang on a
second, we have a problem here.

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:55.680 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm faced with
people saying Steve,

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:59.250 align:middle line:84%
where's the best place
to go for a sky watch?

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say to him, are
you sure you want to do it?

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't know what
we're going to experience.

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:07.210 align:middle line:84%
We all love to see
something in the sky.

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:08.010 align:middle line:90%
Don't get me wrong.

00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:08.950 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:10.500 align:middle line:90%
It's hypnotic even.

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:11.490 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it?

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:17.017 align:middle line:84%
But do we truly know what
that might result in?

00:43:17.017 --> 00:43:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Because I've talked
to all the people.

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:21.255 align:middle line:84%
I said, I wish I never
had my experience.

00:43:21.255 --> 00:43:22.800 align:middle line:90%
I was interested and went out.

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:25.180 align:middle line:90%
And I wish I never had it.

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:27.700 align:middle line:84%
So that can be a
real problem for us.

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:29.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's
really important for us

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:34.280 align:middle line:84%
to say about this phenomena for
what it really does represent.

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.550 align:middle line:90%
It's the good side.

00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:36.450 align:middle line:90%
It has a bad side.

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:38.730 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's just agenda.

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:39.690 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there is no good.

00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:41.700 align:middle line:84%
But maybe they're
just doing their job.

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And I've said this many,
many just like, for instance,

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:46.040 align:middle line:84%
police officers come
and arrest somebody.

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:49.152 align:middle line:84%
Do they consider that
they've been handled badly?

00:43:49.152 --> 00:43:50.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a bad incident for them.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.080 align:middle line:90%
Is it good?

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:51.880 align:middle line:90%
It's just agenda.

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.390 align:middle line:90%
It's just a job.

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:57.272 align:middle line:84%
And it's also how we
perceive this to be.

00:43:57.272 --> 00:43:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
like what we wanted

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:01.760 align:middle line:84%
to do through Project
Doorway is represent that.

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, George Knapp
had come over to interview us.

00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Because he said, there's a
very interesting news article

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:11.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm releasing in a few days.

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And what was being released
from the US government

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:21.740 align:middle line:84%
was the statistics of
people's experience

00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:23.930 align:middle line:90%
under those incidents.

00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:25.530 align:middle line:90%
And they were lies.

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:27.090 align:middle line:90%
They were not true.

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:29.510 align:middle line:84%
They mentioned a lot of
different information

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:31.610 align:middle line:84%
about how people
weren't injured.

00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:33.470 align:middle line:90%
How people didn't die.

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:39.525 align:middle line:84%
And what was interesting for me
is that why is the lies there?

00:44:39.525 --> 00:44:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, all we've got
to do is go and talk

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:46.220 align:middle line:84%
to a very good researcher,
AJ Gevaerd from Brazil.

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And he was part of
the hearing process,

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:52.640 align:middle line:84%
UFO hearing about that
particular case, the Colares

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:53.750 align:middle line:90%
UFO incident.

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:54.860 align:middle line:90%
He was on the ground.

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:56.330 align:middle line:90%
He was talking to the people.

00:44:56.330 --> 00:44:58.310 align:middle line:84%
He knew how many
people were affected.

00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:00.950 align:middle line:84%
He knew how many people
fell seriously ill.

00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:03.110 align:middle line:90%
Those who also died.

00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:06.380 align:middle line:10%
And he reported
over 1,200 people

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:09.900 align:middle line:10%
were very severely injured.

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
what was interesting

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:14.960 align:middle line:84%
is that the US government tried
to make us believe, again,

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:18.450 align:middle line:84%
just as many others is to
sweep that incident away.

00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So what we like to say is
call it for what it is.

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:23.120 align:middle line:90%
And we do stress caution.

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes,
we just do not

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.990 align:middle line:84%
know what phenomenon
we might experience

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:28.896 align:middle line:90%
whilst we're out there.

00:45:28.896 --> 00:45:34.580 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Doty.

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Richard, over the
last few years,

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:41.060 align:middle line:84%
there has been considerable
discussions over the Tic Tac

00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:42.410 align:middle line:90%
UFO.

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:45.470 align:middle line:84%
Richard, what are your
thoughts about the Tic Tac?

00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Do you think it could, in fact,
be some kind of advanced drone

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:53.060 align:middle line:84%
that we ourselves have
secretly manufactured?

00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:55.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Great question.

00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, the incident
happened in 2004.

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And there's other incidents
that have happened since.

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And, obviously,
some research has

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:10.820 align:middle line:84%
found that there's been
incidents of military aircrafts

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:16.280 align:middle line:84%
and even civilian aircrafts
encountering these Tic Tacs.

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:18.890 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back to the 1980s.

00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:21.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk about this
tomorrow with Paul Bennewitz.

00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:25.250 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
Paul Bennewitz found out

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:31.730 align:middle line:84%
and he photographed some
of the early drone programs

00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:34.790 align:middle line:84%
that the United States
government had that

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:36.770 align:middle line:84%
were being tested
around New Mexico.

00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:38.480 align:middle line:90%
He photographed that.

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:41.300 align:middle line:84%
The jump ahead to
2004, the incident

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:42.485 align:middle line:90%
happened on USS Nimitz.

00:46:42.485 --> 00:46:45.080 align:middle line:90%


00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:48.020 align:middle line:84%
A lot of really, really
smart researchers

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:51.560 align:middle line:84%
have found out that there are
some events that occurred prior

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:55.820 align:middle line:90%
to that that people questioned.

00:46:55.820 --> 00:47:02.780 align:middle line:84%
They question the Navy why
three days prior was the alert

00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:09.495 align:middle line:84%
planes, the F/A-18s
stationed on the USS Nimitz,

00:47:09.495 --> 00:47:10.370 align:middle line:90%
the aircraft carrier.

00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Why were they taken
off armed alert?

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:18.300 align:middle line:84%
The weapons were
taken off the racks.

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:19.190 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:26.000 align:middle line:84%
There's a former
weapons officer who

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.810 align:middle line:84%
now lives in Utah, who
has spoken about this.

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Nobody seems to know
except that there's

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:36.590 align:middle line:84%
some people that came on the
ship prior to the incident

00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:39.140 align:middle line:90%
and downgraded some things.

00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:46.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, speed up to the day
that this happened, aircraft,

00:47:46.850 --> 00:47:53.480 align:middle line:84%
radar systems spotted
these things in the sky.

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:56.030 align:middle line:84%
It was being tracked
on shift radar.

00:47:56.030 --> 00:48:01.010 align:middle line:84%
A number of different
ships around the carrier

00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:04.310 align:middle line:90%
were tracking these objects.

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And the way the
carrier group is set up

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:12.500 align:middle line:84%
is that the aircraft carrier
has to be well protected

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:15.900 align:middle line:84%
because that's where
the planes are at.

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:19.910 align:middle line:84%
So as these things
are being tracked,

00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:24.320 align:middle line:84%
the commander of the USS Nimitz
or the carrier group commander

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:33.500 align:middle line:84%
launched the two F/A-18s
after these objects, Tic Tacs.

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:37.250 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately, these were armed.

00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:40.760 align:middle line:84%
All they could do was
track them in the air

00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:43.490 align:middle line:84%
and spot them on
the aircraft radar.

00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And then report back
to the carrier group

00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:48.440 align:middle line:90%
what was being seen.

00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:50.810 align:middle line:84%
But there was no way
shooting them down,

00:48:50.810 --> 00:48:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, people put two
and two together.

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Common sense says
that maybe they

00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:00.470 align:middle line:90%
didn't want them shot down.

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this was a test
of the carrier group.

00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:07.310 align:middle line:90%
What would the carrier group do?

00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:09.440 align:middle line:84%
What would the commander
of the carrier group

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:15.530 align:middle line:84%
do if they encountered
something like this, an unknown?

00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:18.830 align:middle line:90%
And how would they react?

00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:23.390 align:middle line:90%
So were these things ours?

00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:27.530 align:middle line:84%
Were these things something
in experimental stage?

00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:36.110 align:middle line:84%
Or have we perfected an
anti-gravity device in 2004?

00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:38.300 align:middle line:90%
Or was this extraterrestrial?

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:40.500 align:middle line:90%
That's the big question.

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:44.805 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of evidence that
can point in both directions.

00:49:44.805 --> 00:49:50.120 align:middle line:84%
I've spoken with some of
the radar controllers.

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:54.320 align:middle line:84%
They've spoken at
different conventions

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:57.140 align:middle line:84%
that they think that
it wasn't nothing

00:49:57.140 --> 00:49:59.030 align:middle line:90%
that we've ever encountered.

00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:01.580 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
people have said

00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:06.620 align:middle line:84%
that we have things like
this being tested at Area 51

00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:08.900 align:middle line:84%
or Dugway Proving
Grounds, which could

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:15.140 align:middle line:84%
be another form of an
Area 51 testing area.

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:17.408 align:middle line:90%
So that's the dilemma.

00:50:17.408 --> 00:50:20.000 align:middle line:90%
What were these?

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Will the government
ever come out

00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:23.990 align:middle line:90%
and say, yeah, these were ours.

00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:28.460 align:middle line:84%
Did we test these things
against a carrier group?

00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, any people,
anyone that's ever

00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:33.230 align:middle line:84%
been in any kind
of special forces

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:38.330 align:middle line:84%
or in any kind of advanced
training, whether Royal Marines

00:50:38.330 --> 00:50:44.300 align:middle line:84%
or SAS or Navy Seals
or Army Rangers

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:48.890 align:middle line:84%
or even US intelligence
officers, you're

00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:55.470 align:middle line:84%
given these scenarios
that you can't win at.

00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And you're evaluated
as a human and how

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:02.635 align:middle line:90%
you react to these unknowns.

00:51:02.635 --> 00:51:04.260 align:middle line:84%
How are you going to
react to something

00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:09.370 align:middle line:84%
you know you can't defeat
or you can't get out of?

00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Was this a scenario created
by the United States Navy

00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:18.220 align:middle line:84%
or the Department of Defense
or some other government entity

00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:23.560 align:middle line:84%
to test the crew, the aircraft
pilots, the radar crew,

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:28.450 align:middle line:84%
the ground crews, even
the fleet commander?

00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:31.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, he's been interviewed
hundreds of times.

00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And he claims he knew nothing
of any kind of exercise.

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, they
wouldn't tell him that.

00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:42.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's left to us to
decide what it was.

00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Was it extraterrestrial
evidence of that?

00:51:45.370 --> 00:51:48.220 align:middle line:90%
Or was it one of ours?

00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:51.010 align:middle line:84%
That's a dilemma that we just
have to figure out on our own

00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:51:51.810 --> 00:51:57.940 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:57.940 --> 00:51:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Paul Sinclair.

00:51:59.070 --> 00:52:02.010 align:middle line:84%
Paul, the location where
you've carried out research

00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:04.890 align:middle line:84%
and investigation looks
to have the same type

00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:07.500 align:middle line:84%
of reported phenomena
that has been reported

00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:09.720 align:middle line:90%
at Skinwalker Ranch in the US.

00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:15.060 align:middle line:84%
What do you think it is that
makes these places so unusual?

00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Good question.

00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:17.800 align:middle line:90%
It's not just Skinwalker, is it?

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And I said earlier,
Bempton, in particular,

00:52:20.310 --> 00:52:22.140 align:middle line:90%
it could stand alone.

00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:24.030 align:middle line:84%
There's as much
unexplained phenomena

00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:26.790 align:middle line:84%
being reported and seen
there, not just by myself.

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:30.540 align:middle line:84%
There's that many
people coming forward.

00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:33.180 align:middle line:84%
We could spend the month up
there, six weeks up there,

00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:34.050 align:middle line:90%
and see nothing.

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And somebody might just
go when we're not there.

00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:37.170 align:middle line:90%
And they experience it.

00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:38.890 align:middle line:90%
What makes it special?

00:52:38.890 --> 00:52:40.360 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:43.075 align:middle line:84%
I believe, like I
said previously,

00:52:43.075 --> 00:52:44.700 align:middle line:84%
sorry for going over
old ground, but we

00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:49.770 align:middle line:84%
have got concentrated pockets
of phenomena presenting

00:52:49.770 --> 00:52:52.140 align:middle line:90%
within the unexplained zone.

00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's the Hoia Baciu
forest in Romania.

00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:59.460 align:middle line:84%
There's not just
Bempton and Skinwalker.

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:01.665 align:middle line:84%
And I believe these places
are all over the world.

00:53:01.665 --> 00:53:03.540 align:middle line:84%
It just takes the right
combination of people

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:07.020 align:middle line:90%
to start lifting stones.

00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:10.590 align:middle line:84%
Find an area, find somewhere
where something's happening

00:53:10.590 --> 00:53:11.970 align:middle line:90%
of an unexplained nature.

00:53:11.970 --> 00:53:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And invariably, when
you start looking,

00:53:14.410 --> 00:53:16.770 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that there's
an interconnected phenomena

00:53:16.770 --> 00:53:19.150 align:middle line:90%
occurring at the same time.

00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:21.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
the mechanisms are.

00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:27.570 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult because
it's almost as though there's

00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:30.360 align:middle line:84%
an enabler because there's
one thing happening

00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:32.490 align:middle line:84%
a few weeks later or
within the same time frame,

00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:34.560 align:middle line:84%
you've got something
else happening.

00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:38.190 align:middle line:84%
I've not got an answer
for why these areas are

00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:41.640 align:middle line:84%
producing such a vast array
of unexplained phenomena.

00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:46.455 align:middle line:84%
And I likened it to it
could be a hive mind.

00:53:46.455 --> 00:53:50.350 align:middle line:84%
It could be just one all
encompassing phenomena

00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:54.013 align:middle line:84%
that's presenting showing
you your worst fears,

00:53:54.013 --> 00:53:54.930 align:middle line:90%
your worst nightmares.

00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:56.370 align:middle line:90%
You see cryptids.

00:53:56.370 --> 00:53:58.860 align:middle line:84%
If you want to see
not some bolts UFOs,

00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:00.990 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see
nut and bolts UFOs.

00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Speculation-- that's
all we're doing.

00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:04.410 align:middle line:84%
To be honest, with
all that I'm doing.

00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:06.090 align:middle line:90%
But that's what it could be.

00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:07.890 align:middle line:84%
If you want to see
light form phenomena,

00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:09.840 align:middle line:84%
you will see light
form phenomena.

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:12.880 align:middle line:84%
I realize that not
everybody's going to agree.

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's not what
it's forced to be.

00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:18.100 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think any of us
really at the end of the day,

00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:18.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:19.960 align:middle line:90%
I've been a bit vague with that.

00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:21.120 align:middle line:90%
But I'm going to answer.

00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:22.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:27.370 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:28.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Billy Carson.

00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:31.240 align:middle line:84%
Billy, over the
last 30 years, it

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:34.510 align:middle line:84%
seems that public knowledge of
our technological advancements

00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:36.700 align:middle line:90%
are becoming less and less.

00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:40.230 align:middle line:84%
Billy, do you believe that we
are involved in a secret space

00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:41.030 align:middle line:90%
program?

00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And if so, how many years
in advancement are they?

00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:49.310 align:middle line:84%
So I really do believe that we
are involved in a secret space

00:54:49.310 --> 00:54:51.140 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:56.210 align:middle line:84%
We know that NASA is the front
for the main space program

00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:57.750 align:middle line:90%
that's presented to the public.

00:54:57.750 --> 00:55:01.040 align:middle line:84%
So it is the European Space
Agency, and the Indian Space

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Agency, and the
Russian Space Agency.

00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:06.380 align:middle line:84%
But behind the
scenes primarily, I

00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:09.470 align:middle line:84%
believe that America is leading
the way in a secret space

00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:10.590 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And how I come to
this conclusion is,

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:16.700 align:middle line:84%
well, I own a tech company,
First Class Space Agency.

00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:19.130 align:middle line:84%
A company is now five years
old, so a tech company.

00:55:19.130 --> 00:55:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And we are doing R&D
research and development.

00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:25.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, through that
company, it gives me

00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:28.310 align:middle line:84%
access to the space symposium
and other private space

00:55:28.310 --> 00:55:29.570 align:middle line:90%
industry meetings.

00:55:29.570 --> 00:55:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And in those meetings, I have TS
clearance, top secret clearance

00:55:32.450 --> 00:55:33.372 align:middle line:90%
into private space.

00:55:33.372 --> 00:55:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And in some of those
meetings, I can't tell you

00:55:35.330 --> 00:55:36.372 align:middle line:90%
everything we talk about.

00:55:36.372 --> 00:55:39.050 align:middle line:84%
But one thing I can
tell you is that people

00:55:39.050 --> 00:55:44.420 align:middle line:84%
used to think that the
military and the space agencies

00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:47.340 align:middle line:84%
were 50 years ahead
technologically.

00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:48.140 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Try 300 plus years
ahead of what you have

00:55:51.770 --> 00:55:53.330 align:middle line:90%
today, of what we have today.

00:55:53.330 --> 00:55:55.910 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much whatever
you can think of,

00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:58.220 align:middle line:84%
whatever you can
imagine in your brain

00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:00.380 align:middle line:84%
has already been
done or experimented

00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:04.140 align:middle line:84%
on to a point of where it's
theoretically possible.

00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And so the Space
Agency, and the reason

00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:09.050 align:middle line:84%
why NASA ended its
shuttle program,

00:56:09.050 --> 00:56:11.240 align:middle line:84%
they didn't really end
their Space Agency,

00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:12.730 align:middle line:90%
NASA is still a space agency.

00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:14.480 align:middle line:84%
What they've done is
they've gone private.

00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:15.280 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Because of Freedom
of Information Act.

00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:22.100 align:middle line:84%
So if NASA is publicly doing
a lot of these explorations

00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:24.260 align:middle line:84%
and creating these
technologies and exploring

00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:27.440 align:middle line:84%
warp drives and EM drives and
all these other new propulsion

00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:30.290 align:middle line:84%
technologies, then
we as the people

00:56:30.290 --> 00:56:33.500 align:middle line:84%
can easily request
information on what they're

00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:36.860 align:middle line:84%
doing, how they're doing
it, and a certain level

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:38.610 align:middle line:90%
of how the technology works.

00:56:38.610 --> 00:56:40.490 align:middle line:84%
However, by taking it
and transferring it

00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:43.037 align:middle line:84%
to private industry saying,
oh, we're out of money guys.

00:56:43.037 --> 00:56:45.620 align:middle line:84%
We're going to transfer all this
over to the private industry.

00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:47.953 align:middle line:84%
There's no way that you can
get a Freedom of Information

00:56:47.953 --> 00:56:52.940 align:middle line:84%
Act on Tesla, on Lockheed, or
any of these other companies

00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:55.580 align:middle line:84%
that are producing these
top secret Pentagon-approved

00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:56.630 align:middle line:90%
Projects.

00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And so by moving it
from public to private,

00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:01.670 align:middle line:84%
they're now able to
hide and go dark.

00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And then the space
agency behind the scenes

00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:09.230 align:middle line:84%
is then allowed to, now,
due to the new space

00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:12.613 align:middle line:84%
force, siphon
trillions of dollars

00:57:12.613 --> 00:57:14.030 align:middle line:84%
where they can
continue to develop

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:15.500 align:middle line:90%
all these high technologies.

00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:19.565 align:middle line:84%
Prior to this whole
9/11 situation,

00:57:19.565 --> 00:57:23.120 align:middle line:84%
we had trillions missing
from the budget going

00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:24.890 align:middle line:84%
into these black
budget projects.

00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:27.627 align:middle line:84%
And now, that there's
a space force,

00:57:27.627 --> 00:57:29.960 align:middle line:84%
they don't have to hide where
the money's going anymore.

00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:32.252 align:middle line:84%
They just tell you, we need
it for the Space Force now.

00:57:32.252 --> 00:57:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And so we're in
a situation where

00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:36.170 align:middle line:84%
they're siphoning a lot of
money into these projects

00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:37.130 align:middle line:90%
behind the scenes.

00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:42.200 align:middle line:84%
We do have the X33, X37b, which
is a military space shuttle

00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:44.720 align:middle line:84%
program that's
launching right now.

00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:46.700 align:middle line:84%
They publicly announce
when it launches.

00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:48.740 align:middle line:90%
But the missions are top secret.

00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:50.780 align:middle line:90%
How long do they go into space?

00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:52.430 align:middle line:90%
Two years at a time.

00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Where are they going
with these cargo ships?

00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:58.220 align:middle line:84%
We're launching the most
advanced navigable shuttles

00:57:58.220 --> 00:57:59.600 align:middle line:90%
right now today.

00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Publicly available
knowledge, you

00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:03.440 align:middle line:84%
can learn about the
launches and the return

00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:05.682 align:middle line:84%
just not where they're going
and what the payload is.

00:58:05.682 --> 00:58:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, where are they
going with these payloads?

00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:08.750 align:middle line:90%
What is the payload?

00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And why are they
going into space

00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:13.280 align:middle line:84%
for two years with an
advanced navigation system?

00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:16.268 align:middle line:84%
So yes, there's a secret
space program for sure.

00:58:16.268 --> 00:58:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And they're hiding
it in plain sight.

00:58:17.810 --> 00:58:25.370 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:25.370 --> 00:58:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Barry Fitzgerald.

00:58:27.050 --> 00:58:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Barry, is there an element
of esoteric undertones

00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:33.830 align:middle line:84%
when dealing with
the real phenomenon?

00:58:33.830 --> 00:58:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>> All of the phenomena that we
see across that weaves its way

00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:42.740 align:middle line:84%
into many of the fringe research
fields all possesses an element

00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:43.850 align:middle line:90%
om esotericism.

00:58:43.850 --> 00:58:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And we have to realize that
you can such as CE5 and things,

00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:56.630 align:middle line:84%
you can summon the
phenomena to you.

00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Like when you go into
a paranormal situation

00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:03.080 align:middle line:84%
and you're using whatever
a particular type of device

00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:06.440 align:middle line:84%
that you wish to try and
communicate with spirit,

00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:08.390 align:middle line:90%
you are summoning.

00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:13.280 align:middle line:84%
It's all got connections
with esoteric undertones.

00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:15.542 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
realize that that when

00:59:15.542 --> 00:59:17.000 align:middle line:84%
we're dealing with
something that's

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.440 align:middle line:84%
coming from beyond
the veil, are we

00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:19.857 align:middle line:84%
looking at something
that's coming

00:59:19.857 --> 00:59:24.150 align:middle line:84%
from the same source that's
just disguising its appearance?

00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:27.650 align:middle line:10%
And so to understand,
I think, that's

00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:29.690 align:middle line:10%
one of the fundamental
keys in understanding

00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:35.210 align:middle line:10%
the phenomena is that the
majority of the true phenomena

00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:37.160 align:middle line:10%
can all be summoned.

00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:45.250 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:45.250 --> 00:59:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Steve Mera.

00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Steve, you've discussed
on many occasions

00:59:49.450 --> 00:59:52.270 align:middle line:84%
about the connections
between UFO encounters

00:59:52.270 --> 00:59:53.890 align:middle line:90%
and the paranormal.

00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:56.500 align:middle line:84%
One aspect you have
covered is the ability

00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:58.150 align:middle line:90%
to conjure such phenomena.

00:59:58.150 --> 01:00:00.935 align:middle line:90%
What exactly does this entail?

01:00:00.935 --> 01:00:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just how about saying
about what does it actually

01:00:03.310 --> 01:00:04.420 align:middle line:90%
entail conjuring.

01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:08.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, really if we want to
talk about CE5, for an example,

01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:12.460 align:middle line:84%
we take five people who are
going to go out and meditate

01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:13.585 align:middle line:90%
in a particular location.

01:00:13.585 --> 01:00:14.590 align:middle line:90%
It could be on a beach.

01:00:14.590 --> 01:00:16.660 align:middle line:84%
It could be we have a
location where people have

01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:19.486 align:middle line:90%
seen a few lights in the sky.

01:00:19.486 --> 01:00:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And over a period of time, you
get the right amount of people

01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:24.800 align:middle line:90%
together.

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:27.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes, phenomena can be seen.

01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:31.230 align:middle line:90%
It can suddenly appear manifest.

01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:33.980 align:middle line:84%
There's no different than
having five people, which

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:38.510 align:middle line:84%
are meditators on a beach
conjuring a light in the sky

01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:41.540 align:middle line:84%
than there is five mediums
around the science table

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:43.500 align:middle line:90%
conjuring a ball of light.

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:45.540 align:middle line:90%
It is one of the same thing.

01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, our friends, we have a
number of people researchers

01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:50.420 align:middle line:90%
have been involved.

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have
been in those school

01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:58.430 align:middle line:84%
experiment settings, which
was experiments in regarding

01:00:58.430 --> 01:01:02.030 align:middle line:84%
this type of science
and communications

01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:05.030 align:middle line:84%
with spirits, entities,
call them what we will,

01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:08.810 align:middle line:84%
which started taking
place in the 1990s.

01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Further things
carried on from there

01:01:12.050 --> 01:01:17.630 align:middle line:84%
where there was manifestations
of small craft seen, balls

01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:20.100 align:middle line:84%
of light, which seemingly
had mass to them,

01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:23.610 align:middle line:84%
which would land
in people's hands.

01:01:23.610 --> 01:01:27.350 align:middle line:84%
It literally is, as
researcher, Grant Cameron,

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:29.540 align:middle line:90%
said in his book, magic.

01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:34.790 align:middle line:84%
How do we really define
what this phenomena is?

01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And how do we really
trust these exactly what

01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:39.230 align:middle line:90%
we experience in the phenomena.

01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:40.850 align:middle line:84%
When something is
conjured, does that

01:01:40.850 --> 01:01:42.110 align:middle line:90%
mean that is the phenomena?

01:01:42.110 --> 01:01:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Or is it something
that represents it?

01:01:44.070 --> 01:01:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And like Barry has mentioned
before, on many occasions,

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.910 align:middle line:90%
you have these materializations.

01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:55.085 align:middle line:84%
But in some cases, they act
as if there was no glamouring.

01:01:55.085 --> 01:01:56.720 align:middle line:90%
They seem to glamour.

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:59.240 align:middle line:90%
It's happened to me on location.

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:03.230 align:middle line:84%
I've been absolutely transfixed
by like a close encounter

01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:06.860 align:middle line:84%
experience of
beautiful lights is

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:09.080 align:middle line:90%
putting on a wonderful display.

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:12.020 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as you are
transfixed with this,

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:13.640 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure many
people would be,

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:16.670 align:middle line:84%
you're completely and
utterly unaware of what's

01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:18.100 align:middle line:90%
going on behind you.

01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And there's been a few
times where you had

01:02:19.850 --> 01:02:23.030 align:middle line:90%
to hot tail out of some places.

01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:25.670 align:middle line:84%
But you learn
through that process

01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:29.750 align:middle line:84%
that the world of
metaphysics literally

01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:33.590 align:middle line:84%
means that it can be
seen to be physical.

01:02:33.590 --> 01:02:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just finish on saying
that those connections have

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.590 align:middle line:90%
been seen time and time again.

01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:42.470 align:middle line:84%
In the research field
of the parapsychology

01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:46.070 align:middle line:84%
and the paranormal, when we
look at apportation phenomena

01:02:46.070 --> 01:02:49.580 align:middle line:84%
from the poltergeist
cases, there

01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:53.690 align:middle line:84%
was an incident where there
was a mog, which had apported.

01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:56.720 align:middle line:84%
But lucky for us, there was
three other mogs identical so

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.010 align:middle line:90%
that we could save them both.

01:02:58.010 --> 01:02:59.120 align:middle line:90%
One was the apple.

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:01.190 align:middle line:84%
One which wasn't
and analyze them.

01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And they were both put
on to atomic microscopy.

01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And what we found, there
was a computer program

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:10.700 align:middle line:90%
that looks at it.

01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And it says, are they both
the same in a scale fact.

01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And the scale would suggest that
the apported mog, for instance,

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:24.230 align:middle line:84%
looking at Barry's [INAUDIBLE],,
look the same, feel the same,

01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:27.110 align:middle line:84%
weigh the same under
the microscope.

01:03:27.110 --> 01:03:30.830 align:middle line:84%
It's saying that
this is not that.

01:03:30.830 --> 01:03:33.770 align:middle line:84%
It's saying that it might look
it and feel it everything.

01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:36.350 align:middle line:90%
But boy, is that not the same.

01:03:36.350 --> 01:03:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And we look for those
little elements in there

01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:40.100 align:middle line:90%
to say, well, what is different?

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:42.230 align:middle line:84%
What are the biggest
differences in there?

01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:44.780 align:middle line:84%
Is the-- the
diathermic reactions in

01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:46.940 align:middle line:90%
there are incredible.

01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:50.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, we recognize somebody's
diathermic reactions.

01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:52.160 align:middle line:84%
We thought where have
we seen this before.

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't in the
parapsychology realm

01:03:54.770 --> 01:03:55.910 align:middle line:90%
or the paranormal.

01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:59.900 align:middle line:84%
It was energy ufological
where a materialization of UFO

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:03.970 align:middle line:84%
would come so close to ground
that it affected the plant

01:04:03.970 --> 01:04:04.900 align:middle line:90%
growth.

01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:06.880 align:middle line:90%
And scientists came out.

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And they took samples
of the plants.

01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was known as a plant
biological or metallurgy test.

01:04:14.170 --> 01:04:17.920 align:middle line:84%
The results of that showed this
very same diathermic reactions

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:20.360 align:middle line:84%
in the plants have
been affected.

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.990 align:middle line:84%
So we have to really
sit back and consider

01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:26.830 align:middle line:84%
is the materialization of
a UFO a materialization

01:04:26.830 --> 01:04:32.020 align:middle line:84%
of a morgue of a paranormal
case utilizing the very

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:33.470 align:middle line:90%
same physics here.

01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And that leads us to really
come to some questions as to,

01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:38.560 align:middle line:84%
what really are
those connections

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:39.700 align:middle line:90%
between this phenomena?

01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And why should we
even have them?

01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:48.180 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Doty.

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Richard, the subject of ufology
over the last several years

01:04:53.730 --> 01:04:55.920 align:middle line:90%
has seemingly taken a shift.

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Numerous researchers
are now focusing

01:04:58.170 --> 01:05:01.800 align:middle line:84%
on the aspects of a conscious
connection between UFOs

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.860 align:middle line:84%
and the observers,
the specific areas

01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:08.820 align:middle line:84%
where refers are seen to
materialize and de-materialize

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:11.160 align:middle line:90%
as if jumping through portals.

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:14.460 align:middle line:90%
Richard, what are your views on

01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's a
fantastic question.

01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:21.130 align:middle line:90%
We did a study.

01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:22.920 align:middle line:84%
The government did
a study a long time

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:27.630 align:middle line:84%
ago way back before my
time during Project Grudge

01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:29.190 align:middle line:90%
and Blue Book.

01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And sign back in the early
50's up through 60's.

01:05:36.450 --> 01:05:40.110 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a very
well-known program.

01:05:40.110 --> 01:05:44.610 align:middle line:84%
But when somebody reported
a sighting of a UFO back

01:05:44.610 --> 01:05:47.040 align:middle line:84%
in those days, there
were Project Blue Book

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:47.890 align:middle line:90%
Investigators.

01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And almost all of
them were military.

01:05:50.550 --> 01:05:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And they were assigned all
over the United States.

01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And when somebody made a
report to a local police

01:05:55.830 --> 01:05:59.430 align:middle line:84%
agency, or a
Sheriff's Department,

01:05:59.430 --> 01:06:04.920 align:middle line:84%
then the UFO investigators
will go out and evaluate.

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:08.640 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
they did unwittingly

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:11.970 align:middle line:84%
where the witness
doesn't know, they

01:06:11.970 --> 01:06:15.300 align:middle line:84%
did a psychological
evaluation of the person, not

01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:17.280 align:middle line:84%
a detailed one,
but they asked them

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:23.580 align:middle line:84%
certain questions that would
key a certain response.

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And people who are psychologists
or psychiatrists or people who

01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:32.010 align:middle line:84%
work in intelligence,
we're trained to do

01:06:32.010 --> 01:06:37.740 align:middle line:84%
that to look at the response
of a person with key words.

01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And they would
record that and then

01:06:40.410 --> 01:06:43.470 align:middle line:84%
later on, scientists would
get together or psychologists

01:06:43.470 --> 01:06:46.050 align:middle line:84%
and analyze what
information that was

01:06:46.050 --> 01:06:48.510 align:middle line:90%
gathered from these witnesses.

01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And what they found were there's
probably the majority of people

01:06:55.350 --> 01:06:59.520 align:middle line:84%
who made the first reports were
legitimate they saw something

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:04.737 align:middle line:84%
in the sky, probably,
they're saying 70%, 80%.

01:07:04.737 --> 01:07:06.570 align:middle line:84%
They just didn't know
what they were seeing.

01:07:06.570 --> 01:07:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of what
they were seeing

01:07:08.910 --> 01:07:11.100 align:middle line:90%
could be easily explainable.

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:14.520 align:middle line:84%
But there's also that
segment that couldn't be.

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:17.190 align:middle line:84%
They also found
that these people

01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:25.890 align:middle line:84%
that had frequent sighting
were drawn to a certain area.

01:07:25.890 --> 01:07:29.640 align:middle line:90%
And then they see a sighting.

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:38.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, jump ahead, I had
a case where this person

01:07:38.010 --> 01:07:39.720 align:middle line:90%
would write me letters.

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:41.530 align:middle line:90%
Not emails, but letters.

01:07:41.530 --> 01:07:43.470 align:middle line:84%
He's actually a real
letter writer, which

01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:44.730 align:middle line:90%
you don't see many nowadays.

01:07:44.730 --> 01:07:51.025 align:middle line:84%
But he lived in Canada,
Yukon territory,

01:07:51.025 --> 01:07:51.900 align:middle line:90%
southside Whitehorse.

01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:56.970 align:middle line:84%
He was a retired Royal
Canadian Mounted policeman.

01:07:56.970 --> 01:08:02.010 align:middle line:84%
He worked there
for 35 or 40 years.

01:08:02.010 --> 01:08:03.720 align:middle line:90%
I finally got in touch with him.

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:07.830 align:middle line:84%
He told me he
could summon a UFO.

01:08:07.830 --> 01:08:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And he had actually had
the encounters with the ETs

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:15.810 align:middle line:90%
from that board.

01:08:15.810 --> 01:08:17.279 align:middle line:90%
He filmed one.

01:08:17.279 --> 01:08:19.290 align:middle line:90%
And he sent me the film.

01:08:19.290 --> 01:08:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And he first sent
me an audio tape

01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:25.109 align:middle line:84%
where he was recording
what was happening.

01:08:25.109 --> 01:08:27.343 align:middle line:84%
And then he sent
me the actual tape.

01:08:27.343 --> 01:08:28.260 align:middle line:90%
Now, I looked at tape.

01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:30.644 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a straight shooter.

01:08:30.644 --> 01:08:34.500 align:middle line:84%
If I think you're lying to me,
I'm going to tell you that.

01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:37.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you,
I think this isn't real.

01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:38.340 align:middle line:90%
You're lying.

01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:40.170 align:middle line:90%
You're faking this or something.

01:08:40.170 --> 01:08:41.880 align:middle line:90%
I looked at this.

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:43.050 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm in New Mexico.

01:08:43.050 --> 01:08:43.890 align:middle line:90%
And he's up there.

01:08:43.890 --> 01:08:46.740 align:middle line:90%
And I get on the phone with him.

01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:47.540 align:middle line:90%
I spoke with him.

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.123 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I'll
bring you up here.

01:08:49.123 --> 01:08:49.965 align:middle line:90%
I said, no.

01:08:49.965 --> 01:08:52.350 align:middle line:90%
I can go up there.

01:08:52.350 --> 01:08:54.569 align:middle line:84%
And that's an entirely
different story

01:08:54.569 --> 01:08:56.710 align:middle line:90%
how we eventually got up there.

01:08:56.710 --> 01:09:00.840 align:middle line:84%
But he actually went
out on his patio.

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:05.369 align:middle line:84%
And this is the only
place that he can do this.

01:09:05.369 --> 01:09:08.580 align:middle line:90%


01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:13.275 align:middle line:84%
And he had a laser pointer,
a high-powered one.

01:09:13.275 --> 01:09:16.109 align:middle line:84%
One that you're not supposed
to shoot in the air.

01:09:16.109 --> 01:09:18.000 align:middle line:90%
And he'd flash that.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And probably within 10 or 15
minutes, a craft appeared.

01:09:23.370 --> 01:09:25.750 align:middle line:90%
I was bewildered.

01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:30.689 align:middle line:84%
I was totally caught off guard
because I wasn't believing him

01:09:30.689 --> 01:09:31.890 align:middle line:90%
initially.

01:09:31.890 --> 01:09:34.515 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately, it never landed.

01:09:34.515 --> 01:09:36.390 align:middle line:90%
It flew around.

01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:38.880 align:middle line:90%
It got close to the ground.

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:41.170 align:middle line:90%
And then it went away.

01:09:41.170 --> 01:09:44.609 align:middle line:84%
So his film showed
the craft landing.

01:09:44.609 --> 01:09:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And these two long, tall, lanky
ETs coming out of the craft.

01:09:52.170 --> 01:09:54.450 align:middle line:90%
They never came close to him.

01:09:54.450 --> 01:09:56.310 align:middle line:84%
They never came
close to his house.

01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:59.250 align:middle line:90%
They stayed close to the craft.

01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And he had a dialogue with
him through brain transfers

01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:06.030 align:middle line:84%
or brain thought
transfers, not telepathy.

01:10:06.030 --> 01:10:09.030 align:middle line:84%
They don't really use
telepathy anymore.

01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:14.220 align:middle line:84%
It's brain thought transfers as
the scientific Dr. Greer talks

01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:15.090 align:middle line:90%
about.

01:10:15.090 --> 01:10:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And they'd be on the ground
for 30 minutes or so.

01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:22.060 align:middle line:90%
And then they'd leave.

01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And then later on, he told me,
the reason they probably didn't

01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:28.260 align:middle line:90%
come out was because of me.

01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:29.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm there.

01:10:29.310 --> 01:10:30.585 align:middle line:90%
And they don't know me.

01:10:30.585 --> 01:10:31.710 align:middle line:90%
They know him and his wife.

01:10:31.710 --> 01:10:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And they're the only two
has ever had connections.

01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:36.720 align:middle line:84%
But there's been a lot of
studies about people that

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:40.950 align:middle line:90%
can draw these crafts to them.

01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them, and I've
spoken with some abductees

01:10:47.010 --> 01:10:50.520 align:middle line:84%
here at this conference,
they've had an abduction

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:53.700 align:middle line:84%
or they had an experience
at the younger years.

01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And now, as these
things come back,

01:10:56.670 --> 01:10:59.430 align:middle line:84%
they're more attracted
to a certain location

01:10:59.430 --> 01:11:02.000 align:middle line:90%
where they can encounter them.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, unfortunately,
some of the encounters

01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:06.690 align:middle line:90%
aren't very, very nice.

01:11:06.690 --> 01:11:12.810 align:middle line:84%
There's horror stories when you
get to the abduction enigma.

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:18.390 align:middle line:84%
But I think our
scientists have now--

01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:21.780 align:middle line:84%
that the scientists that
are studying these things

01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:26.340 align:middle line:84%
are saying that people
can be at a location

01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:29.940 align:middle line:90%
and draw these crafts.

01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:31.982 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm not in a situation.

01:11:31.982 --> 01:11:33.690 align:middle line:84%
I think there's more
people on this panel

01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:38.460 align:middle line:84%
could speak more intelligently
about why or how this happens

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:40.680 align:middle line:90%
or why they're attracted.

01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:44.860 align:middle line:84%
But in my time, both
in intelligence working

01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:46.680 align:middle line:84%
for the government,
working for Dr. Puthoff

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:50.250 align:middle line:84%
in private research,
I find that the people

01:11:50.250 --> 01:11:54.310 align:middle line:90%
are drawn to these situations.

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:55.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:11:55.110 --> 01:12:00.690 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:12:00.690 --> 01:12:02.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Paul Sinclair.

01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:04.730 align:middle line:84%
Paul, after writing
more than four books,

01:12:04.730 --> 01:12:07.430 align:middle line:84%
talking with dozens and
dozens of witnesses,

01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:10.340 align:middle line:84%
and dedicating yourself
to years of research,

01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:14.420 align:middle line:84%
what is, for you, the most
significant case you have ever

01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:16.550 align:middle line:90%
investigated?

01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:19.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Without a doubt, Hunmanby,
which we touched on earlier

01:12:19.670 --> 01:12:21.470 align:middle line:84%
as regards the name
of the village.

01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:24.410 align:middle line:84%
But it's not in
connection with this.

01:12:24.410 --> 01:12:25.700 align:middle line:90%
And yes, I've wrote about it.

01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And I've only touched the
tip of the iceberg, I think.

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And it would probably take
an afternoon to discuss it.

01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:37.280 align:middle line:84%
But just give you an
overview, 1996, '97, and '98,

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:40.280 align:middle line:84%
three men worked at
an industrial estate

01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:45.230 align:middle line:84%
as a second job after their
primary day jobs painting

01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:47.930 align:middle line:84%
fairground rides and
high class motor cars

01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:50.240 align:middle line:90%
in this huge warehouse.

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:53.390 align:middle line:84%
June, July, and August
of 1996, '97, and '98,

01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:55.610 align:middle line:90%
that's when it happened.

01:12:55.610 --> 01:12:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Every type of phenomena
begun to present.

01:12:59.030 --> 01:13:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'd known one of the
witnesses for over 20 years.

01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:02.540 align:middle line:90%
And he'd never told me.

01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:04.520 align:middle line:90%
Sonny even worked for me.

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And they ended up doing a job
somewhere in a tiny village

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:08.960 align:middle line:90%
called Flamborough.

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:11.210 align:middle line:84%
The subject of unexplained
phenomena came up.

01:13:11.210 --> 01:13:14.315 align:middle line:84%
And it told the guy
who was overseeing

01:13:14.315 --> 01:13:15.990 align:middle line:90%
this work on this property.

01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:17.425 align:middle line:90%
Well, it was a public house.

01:13:17.425 --> 01:13:19.790 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know that this
former military guy knew me.

01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:21.415 align:middle line:84%
And say, you better
tell Paul Sinclair.

01:13:21.415 --> 01:13:24.890 align:middle line:84%
So he had to tell me, because
we were friends anyway,

01:13:24.890 --> 01:13:26.130 align:middle line:90%
an incredible story.

01:13:26.130 --> 01:13:29.360 align:middle line:90%
So they were there in 1996.

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:33.110 align:middle line:90%
June is preparing some vehicle.

01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And there's overview,
a huge warehouse,

01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:38.780 align:middle line:84%
bottom right-hand corner,
toilet block above it,

01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:39.920 align:middle line:90%
the boss's office.

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And the boss was one
of the three men.

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:43.340 align:middle line:90%
He's preparing the vehicle.

01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:45.170 align:middle line:84%
A block of wood fly
straight past his head.

01:13:45.170 --> 01:13:47.190 align:middle line:84%
There's a void between
the top of the roof.

01:13:47.190 --> 01:13:47.990 align:middle line:90%
And he looks.

01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And he thinks
someone's acting about.

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:50.930 align:middle line:90%
And he just carries on.

01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:53.891 align:middle line:84%
He thinks something's
in that void.

01:13:53.891 --> 01:13:55.660 align:middle line:90%
He carried on.

01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:57.345 align:middle line:90%
He hears a bang on side at unit.

01:13:57.345 --> 01:13:58.470 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't know what it is.

01:13:58.470 --> 01:14:00.668 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
two guys come to work

01:14:00.668 --> 01:14:03.210 align:middle line:84%
with him because he explained
that the boss were fairly lazy.

01:14:03.210 --> 01:14:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And he weren't there half
at time when they arrived.

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:09.180 align:middle line:84%
So over the period of
months, light bulbs

01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:14.310 align:middle line:84%
would pop and kills the
power in the workshop.

01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:17.430 align:middle line:84%
The radio would be
plugged in yet the music

01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:19.230 align:middle line:90%
would carry on playing.

01:14:19.230 --> 01:14:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And gravel would
fall in front of them

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.590 align:middle line:84%
as they're walking
through the workshop.

01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:27.810 align:middle line:84%
They tell the people
on the industrial unit.

01:14:27.810 --> 01:14:29.190 align:middle line:90%
It's still there, this unit.

01:14:29.190 --> 01:14:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1997, '96, '97, and '98,
there were only a few units.

01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And some of the guys
remember they're still

01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:39.760 align:middle line:84%
working there because I've been
an interview with some of them.

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:42.450 align:middle line:84%
So you've got all manner
of unexplained phenomena.

01:14:42.450 --> 01:14:44.130 align:middle line:84%
June, July, and August,
for some reason,

01:14:44.130 --> 01:14:48.980 align:middle line:84%
it started and
slowly built. There's

01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:50.550 align:middle line:84%
a large area of
land at the back.

01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:54.540 align:middle line:84%
They allowed a guy to use it
to break up caravans and sell

01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:56.730 align:middle line:90%
parts, caravan scrap yard.

01:14:56.730 --> 01:14:59.390 align:middle line:84%
So while the vehicles are
parked in front of it,

01:14:59.390 --> 01:15:01.140 align:middle line:84%
they're having a big
argument one morning.

01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Because he tells him that the
radio was playing in the night.

01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:06.030 align:middle line:84%
The horns are
beeping on the cars.

01:15:06.030 --> 01:15:08.430 align:middle line:84%
They used to take the
batteries out for theft.

01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:09.660 align:middle line:90%
It's an impossibility.

01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:11.550 align:middle line:90%
But it was happening.

01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:14.430 align:middle line:84%
The boss who I spoke to
interviewed, at length,

01:15:14.430 --> 01:15:16.230 align:middle line:90%
all three witnesses.

01:15:16.230 --> 01:15:18.113 align:middle line:84%
He said, I was
locking up one night

01:15:18.113 --> 01:15:19.530 align:middle line:84%
after the other
guys had gone home

01:15:19.530 --> 01:15:21.163 align:middle line:90%
early hours of the morning.

01:15:21.163 --> 01:15:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And I suddenly got
an overwhelming fear.

01:15:22.830 --> 01:15:24.090 align:middle line:90%
And I turn around.

01:15:24.090 --> 01:15:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And there's a huge creature
there just a shadow and shape

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:28.590 align:middle line:90%
of it like a Bigfoot.

01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:30.690 align:middle line:84%
So they just literally
went [MOUTH SOUND]

01:15:30.690 --> 01:15:32.640 align:middle line:84%
and it walked off
into the darkness.

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:34.470 align:middle line:90%
No animosity, nothing.

01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:40.830 align:middle line:84%
But it culminated
in August of 1998,

01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:44.850 align:middle line:84%
when you could drive a bus into
this warehouse, the front end

01:15:44.850 --> 01:15:46.360 align:middle line:90%
and straight out the other side.

01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:48.840 align:middle line:84%
So I'll give you an
idea of the size of it.

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:53.430 align:middle line:84%
The roller shutter doors were
up at the back about 8 foot.

01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:56.277 align:middle line:84%
And we'll say, Andrew,
the first witness said,

01:15:56.277 --> 01:15:58.110 align:middle line:84%
I found myself stood
at the door as he said.

01:15:58.110 --> 01:15:59.642 align:middle line:90%
And it can't have been real.

01:15:59.642 --> 01:16:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm only skimming
surface here, guys.

01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:02.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

01:16:02.150 --> 01:16:04.450 align:middle line:84%
They said because
in the compound,

01:16:04.450 --> 01:16:07.920 align:middle line:84%
there's a typical
1960s flying saucer.

01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:09.390 align:middle line:90%
I can see it.

01:16:09.390 --> 01:16:10.530 align:middle line:90%
There's all mist around it.

01:16:10.530 --> 01:16:13.290 align:middle line:84%
He said, it's about the
size of a flat back truck,

01:16:13.290 --> 01:16:14.250 align:middle line:90%
little bobble on top.

01:16:14.250 --> 01:16:16.440 align:middle line:90%
And there's a being inside it.

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:18.900 align:middle line:84%
To this day, he said, it
must have been a film set.

01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:20.280 align:middle line:90%
He said, it's got to have been.

01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:24.260 align:middle line:84%
He said, now, all three
guys talk a similar story.

01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:26.870 align:middle line:84%
He said, and then I
walked to the front.

01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And there's a small side
door, front and back.

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:34.080 align:middle line:84%
He says and I opened the side
door, military guy, black head

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:34.880 align:middle line:90%
to toe.

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:35.690 align:middle line:90%
Grabbed all of him.

01:16:35.690 --> 01:16:37.107 align:middle line:84%
Threw him to the
floor with a gun,

01:16:37.107 --> 01:16:38.540 align:middle line:90%
don't move, lots of swear words.

01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:39.340 align:middle line:90%
Threatened him.

01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:42.370 align:middle line:90%
And he had to stay where he was.

01:16:42.370 --> 01:16:45.572 align:middle line:84%
Second one, we've done
Andrew, Dave does the same.

01:16:45.572 --> 01:16:46.780 align:middle line:90%
He finds himself stood there.

01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:49.180 align:middle line:84%
When you'd think they'd
all be stood there.

01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I
asked him, because I

01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:53.980 align:middle line:84%
spoke to them all
separately, I wanted to see.

01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:56.590 align:middle line:90%
And they're not spoke for years.

01:16:56.590 --> 01:16:58.480 align:middle line:90%
Andrew got into to Dave.

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:01.360 align:middle line:90%
They'd lost touch with the boss.

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.088 align:middle line:84%
But we got in touch
with them eventually.

01:17:03.088 --> 01:17:05.380 align:middle line:84%
He said, yeah, he said, there
was something down there.

01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:07.840 align:middle line:84%
He said, I didn't
see a flying saucer.

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:10.870 align:middle line:84%
He said, there was
an object there.

01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:14.770 align:middle line:84%
But it was so shrouded
in mist and almost

01:17:14.770 --> 01:17:18.850 align:middle line:84%
like arc welding lights flashing
from it, I couldn't tell it.

01:17:18.850 --> 01:17:22.640 align:middle line:84%
He said, but there's three
beings stood in front of it.

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:23.440 align:middle line:90%
Very tall.

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.898 align:middle line:84%
He says, if they'd
got clothing on.

01:17:24.898 --> 01:17:27.970 align:middle line:84%
Then they'd got
almost wet silks.

01:17:27.970 --> 01:17:29.020 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm tall.

01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:31.810 align:middle line:84%
He said, they're taller
than me with large heads.

01:17:31.810 --> 01:17:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And walked to the front of the
building, opens the side door.

01:17:35.810 --> 01:17:38.680 align:middle line:90%
He's thrown to the floor.

01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:39.520 align:middle line:90%
He's threatened.

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:42.070 align:middle line:84%
The boss tells me
the same story.

01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:44.530 align:middle line:90%
He saw one being.

01:17:44.530 --> 01:17:46.630 align:middle line:90%
We've only skimmed on Hunmanby.

01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:50.270 align:middle line:84%
It really is a talk
for at least an hour.

01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:52.782 align:middle line:84%
And so many things
were happening.

01:17:52.782 --> 01:17:53.740 align:middle line:90%
They've got everything.

01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:57.558 align:middle line:84%
They've got the
material's floating.

01:17:57.558 --> 01:17:58.600 align:middle line:90%
I've got time here, guys.

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:01.720 align:middle line:84%
But Andrew said he used
to tease the phenomena.

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:03.040 align:middle line:90%
It would shout at it.

01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:04.990 align:middle line:90%
Give me some money I can spend.

01:18:04.990 --> 01:18:06.310 align:middle line:90%
Give me something I can use.

01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:10.570 align:middle line:90%
Give me the lottery numbers.

01:18:10.570 --> 01:18:13.250 align:middle line:84%
There's another element here
that we've not quite got into.

01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And I've not got a
bottom of it yet.

01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:15.910 align:middle line:90%
But the boss said, stop it.

01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:17.710 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what
you're dealing with.

01:18:17.710 --> 01:18:19.330 align:middle line:90%
You must stop this.

01:18:19.330 --> 01:18:21.400 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm just
doing something.

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:23.020 align:middle line:90%
I've just bend down and look.

01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And I can see this
circle coming towards me.

01:18:25.450 --> 01:18:27.250 align:middle line:90%
And it smacked me on the head.

01:18:27.250 --> 01:18:28.570 align:middle line:90%
And it was a coin.

01:18:28.570 --> 01:18:30.070 align:middle line:90%
And they've all told the story.

01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:32.320 align:middle line:84%
They said, they were just
spinning around on the floor

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.170 align:middle line:90%
saying, I've been hit.

01:18:33.170 --> 01:18:33.970 align:middle line:90%
I've been hit.

01:18:33.970 --> 01:18:37.810 align:middle line:84%
So there was an intent
with the phenomena as well.

01:18:37.810 --> 01:18:40.030 align:middle line:84%
Although, they were having
all this, I don't know,

01:18:40.030 --> 01:18:43.300 align:middle line:84%
this conglomerate of
activity at Hunmanby way

01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:46.250 align:middle line:90%
back '96, '97, and '98.

01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:47.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:18:47.050 --> 01:18:47.890 align:middle line:90%
We've just touched on it.

01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:50.020 align:middle line:84%
There's absolutely so much more
that I could tell you about it.

01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:51.100 align:middle line:90%
But thank you.

01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:54.050 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:18:54.050 --> 01:18:54.850 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:18:54.850 --> 01:18:55.650 align:middle line:90%
Last question.

01:18:55.650 --> 01:18:59.570 align:middle line:90%


01:18:59.570 --> 01:19:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Billy Carson.

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Billy, many are now aware that
UFOs have seemingly deactivated

01:19:05.630 --> 01:19:09.320 align:middle line:84%
or neutralized ICBMs,
not only in the US,

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:12.350 align:middle line:84%
but also in other
places around the world.

01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:15.890 align:middle line:84%
Billy, could some of
these UFOs be coming here

01:19:15.890 --> 01:19:20.550 align:middle line:84%
to make sure we do not launch
nuclear weapons on Earth?

01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:19:21.630 --> 01:19:24.250 align:middle line:84%
I think that's exactly
what's going on.

01:19:24.250 --> 01:19:28.740 align:middle line:84%
We do have accounts of veterans,
former military officers,

01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:33.090 align:middle line:84%
former nuclear physicist,
former nuclear scientist.

01:19:33.090 --> 01:19:36.120 align:middle line:84%
At first, imagine, one of
the hardest jobs in the world

01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:40.620 align:middle line:84%
to get employed,
you go apply to be

01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:43.560 align:middle line:84%
the person that operates
in a nuclear silo, that

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:45.270 align:middle line:90%
works in a nuclear silo.

01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:47.710 align:middle line:84%
These are got to be some of
the toughest jobs in the world

01:19:47.710 --> 01:19:48.510 align:middle line:90%
to get.

01:19:48.510 --> 01:19:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Imagine being the
person that actually

01:19:51.390 --> 01:19:54.180 align:middle line:84%
knows how to program
the codes into the nukes

01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:56.350 align:middle line:84%
and activate and
deactivate them.

01:19:56.350 --> 01:19:58.740 align:middle line:84%
So when these people,
which they did,

01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:03.870 align:middle line:84%
come forward and testified
that UFOs have showed up

01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:10.920 align:middle line:84%
at these silos in broad daylight
and actually deactivated nukes,

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:11.910 align:middle line:90%
activated nukes.

01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:14.622 align:middle line:84%
In other words, played
around with the codes.

01:20:14.622 --> 01:20:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
have a procedure,

01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:19.470 align:middle line:84%
a protocol when this
happens that when they're

01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:23.190 align:middle line:84%
told to go down into the
silo, close the door,

01:20:23.190 --> 01:20:25.500 align:middle line:84%
and wait until the
activity above has stopped,

01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:26.820 align:middle line:90%
they have an actual protocol.

01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:28.980 align:middle line:90%
This is a known protocol.

01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And so when these
people start talking

01:20:30.810 --> 01:20:33.240 align:middle line:84%
about the UFO is
showing up at facilities

01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:37.305 align:middle line:84%
and doing this at nuclear silos,
then we have to pay attention.

01:20:37.305 --> 01:20:40.820 align:middle line:90%


01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Nothing against anybody with a
regular job, but these people

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:44.437 align:middle line:90%
don't have regular jobs.

01:20:44.437 --> 01:20:46.020 align:middle line:84%
They're controlling
the world's nukes.

01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And right now, there's over
20,000 of these things.

01:20:48.270 --> 01:20:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, they're
all pointed at us

01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:54.540 align:middle line:84%
while we're on the planet
still, if you didn't know.

01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:55.770 align:middle line:90%
We have no escape hatch.

01:20:55.770 --> 01:20:58.090 align:middle line:84%
We have no escape shuttles
to get off of this thing.

01:20:58.090 --> 01:21:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're an alien
race and you're flying by,

01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:02.820 align:middle line:84%
and you go, oh, let
me scan this planet.

01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:04.410 align:middle line:90%
Oh, a lot of life.

01:21:04.410 --> 01:21:05.760 align:middle line:90%
A lot of activity going on here.

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.218 align:middle line:90%
Civilization is booming.

01:21:07.218 --> 01:21:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Oh, they learn how
to split the atom.

01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:09.700 align:middle line:90%
Oh, let's check it out.

01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:10.890 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what they've
been able to do with this.

01:21:10.890 --> 01:21:12.120 align:middle line:90%
Oh, they've got weapons.

01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:12.690 align:middle line:90%
Let me see.

01:21:12.690 --> 01:21:13.857 align:middle line:90%
Let's analyze these weapons.

01:21:13.857 --> 01:21:15.705 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what
they're all about.

01:21:15.705 --> 01:21:18.030 align:middle line:84%
What is the trajectory
of these weapons?

01:21:18.030 --> 01:21:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this is not-- wait
a minute, these weapons

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:23.190 align:middle line:84%
aren't to defend them
from space invaders.

01:21:23.190 --> 01:21:26.850 align:middle line:84%
The trajectories
are going like this.

01:21:26.850 --> 01:21:28.950 align:middle line:84%
They're pointing
back at themselves

01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:31.830 align:middle line:84%
while they're on the
planet with the--

01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:32.820 align:middle line:90%
they're going, oh, man.

01:21:32.820 --> 01:21:33.778 align:middle line:90%
This place is a ghetto.

01:21:33.778 --> 01:21:35.796 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

01:21:35.796 --> 01:21:38.550 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Please put your hands
together for our esteemed

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:41.600 align:middle line:90%
guests.

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:46.985 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:21:46.985 --> 01:21:52.000 align:middle line:90%
