>> With me today on this
"Truth Hunter" special is Tim,

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.180 align:middle line:10%
a tactical advisor to covert
German analysts who are trying

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.230 align:middle line:10%
to understand the missions
and strategies of nonhuman

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.270 align:middle line:10%
intelligences on our planet, in
this solar system, and beyond.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Tim, welcome to this special
edition of "Truth Hunters."

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you, Linda,
for having me.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, Tim, I'm thinking
out of all of our discussions

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.710 align:middle line:84%
having to do with the
installation and what pushes

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.710 align:middle line:84%
and what doesn't that
in December of 1999,

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.040 align:middle line:84%
it was the meeting
in a way of my life.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.000 align:middle line:84%
It was organized by a man who
worked for the World Bank who

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.250 align:middle line:84%
had been approached
by a colleague of his

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.780 align:middle line:84%
in the Defense
Intelligence Agency.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And the man at the DIA was
retiring after 23 years.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And I got the call from
the World Bank guy saying,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.350 align:middle line:84%
would you be willing to
travel for a meeting?

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.960 align:middle line:84%
This man seriously
wants to talk with you,

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.970 align:middle line:90%
but he cannot be in Washington.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.040 align:middle line:90%
He can't be anywhere near there.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.950 align:middle line:90%
Would you travel?

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.580 align:middle line:84%
So about a month later,
the three of us met.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was so interesting
because the DIA analyst who

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.990 align:middle line:84%
requested the
meeting, he had said

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.410 align:middle line:84%
that he wanted to
control the location

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.610 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that satellites
wouldn't penetrate.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And where we met was
where there was a lot

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.160 align:middle line:90%
of boats, lots of white noise.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.610 align:middle line:10%
And as we went to sit
down at a place to talk,

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.380 align:middle line:10%
he looked up at the
sky, and he said,

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.310 align:middle line:10%
I don't think our satellites
can penetrate this white noise.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.840 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it began.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.760 align:middle line:84%
It was seven hours,
and he began by saying,

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.230 align:middle line:84%
my job for the last
23 years with the DIA

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.280 align:middle line:84%
was to analyze the competition
and conflict of three

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.530 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial
civilizations on this planet--

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.160 align:middle line:90%
Reptilians, Blondes, and Greys.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And he said, for
you to understand

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.260 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the questions
that you have been trying

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.680 align:middle line:84%
to explore, you have to
understand that conflict

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.210 align:middle line:84%
is over this planet
specifically, Linda.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.180 align:middle line:84%
This planet is a
laboratory to them.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.900 align:middle line:84%
It is a laboratory
to many species.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.660 align:middle line:84%
Humans do not understand how
extraordinary this planet is

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.910 align:middle line:84%
and that these
three groups fight

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.970 align:middle line:90%
each other over the planet.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Each would like the
planet to themselves

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.480 align:middle line:84%
for their own
genetic experiments.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.600 align:middle line:90%


00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And he said, our government,
the United States,

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.660 align:middle line:84%
has proof that they
have been competing

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.880 align:middle line:84%
with each other on this
planet for 270 million years.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And I said, sir, that's before
the time of the dinosaurs.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And without one
break, he said, yeah,

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.370 align:middle line:90%
the Greys made the dinosaurs.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.740 align:middle line:90%


00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And what unfolded
over those seven hours

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.550 align:middle line:84%
was this man giving
me an education

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.450 align:middle line:84%
from his studied point
of view at the DIA

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.020 align:middle line:84%
about the true
history of this planet

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.110 align:middle line:84%
under the influences
of competing three

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.920 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial civilizations.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And that the war
continued to this day,

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.670 align:middle line:84%
and that would explain
so much of the dynamics

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.480 align:middle line:84%
and the conflicts and
the problems of the world

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.640 align:middle line:84%
if everybody understood how
absolutely precious this Earth

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.160 align:middle line:84%
is and how these three
competing species each wanted it

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.000 align:middle line:90%
for themselves.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.280 align:middle line:90%
And so I throw this to you.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any sense of
how far back competing

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.420 align:middle line:90%
ETs have been on this planet?

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And what would be
your perspective

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.960 align:middle line:84%
of the evolving history,
the true evolving history

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.850 align:middle line:90%
of this Earth?

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.580 align:middle line:10%
>> I think measuring time when
it comes to species that are

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.690 align:middle line:10%
capable of time travel,
modification of time,

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.680 align:middle line:10%
et cetera is something that is--

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.830 align:middle line:10%
it's impractical
because for them there

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.570 align:middle line:10%
is no difference between
starting yesterday or starting

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.630 align:middle line:10%
270 million years
ago because they

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.390 align:middle line:10%
are capable of
moving through time

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.400 align:middle line:10%
and through temporal dimensions.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:32.540 align:middle line:84%
There is some issue to time
and temporal dimensions.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.590 align:middle line:84%
Temporal dynamics
work like that,

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.370 align:middle line:84%
that the universe is
always self-correcting

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.450 align:middle line:84%
the different path
that might have failed

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.460 align:middle line:90%
and those who succeed it.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.260 align:middle line:84%
So we have a lot of variety
of different histories

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.580 align:middle line:84%
that have been sort of melted
together in the history

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.540 align:middle line:90%
that we have now.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:03.320 align:middle line:84%
So time, it's very
impractical to put time

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.920 align:middle line:84%
in a linear perspective
because that's not quite how

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.300 align:middle line:90%
the universe works.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.700 align:middle line:84%
But I do understand, I
mean, it makes things easier

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.990 align:middle line:84%
to put into a history
book if you agree

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.570 align:middle line:90%
upon one version of history.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one thing that he
pointed out is that some people

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.500 align:middle line:84%
think that it might
be literature,

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.630 align:middle line:84%
and others say
it's pure science,

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.200 align:middle line:84%
and that is a group
called the Anunnaki.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And that even this person
working for the DIA

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:43.110 align:middle line:84%
knew about the relationship of
Mars to the Earth and the fact

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.820 align:middle line:84%
that the Anunnaki had been on
Mars as a precursor to coming

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.260 align:middle line:84%
to Earth and ending up in
conflict with the Greys

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:53.700 align:middle line:90%
and the Blondes.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And it was fascinating because
it meant to me that the United

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.830 align:middle line:84%
States government, inside of
highly classified intelligence

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.800 align:middle line:84%
agencies that are
responsible for investigating

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.240 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial biological
entities not only on the Earth

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.430 align:middle line:84%
but on the moon and
throughout the solar system,

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.950 align:middle line:84%
they have a history that
they consider to be fact.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:22.110 align:middle line:84%
But if you went into Oxford or
Harvard or other universities,

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:26.190 align:middle line:84%
you would not have a match up
on what our own government's

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.820 align:middle line:84%
history is, and it is
extremely dramatic.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:35.160 align:middle line:84%
It is that the Anunnaki came
from another star system,

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.580 align:middle line:84%
apparently escaping
some kind of war.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.915 align:middle line:84%
Ends up on Mars, ends
up in war on Mars.

00:07:42.915 --> 00:07:46.170 align:middle line:84%
It might explain
the hydrogen bomb

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.420 align:middle line:90%
evidence that may be on Mars.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:55.470 align:middle line:84%
They come to Earth they end
up with a triangle of reptiles

00:07:55.470 --> 00:08:00.390 align:middle line:84%
of the Greys and themselves,
and then they fight again.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And he told me, he said,
what we've come to learn,

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:10.040 align:middle line:84%
the Greys can make Blonde
bodies and Reptile bodies

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.790 align:middle line:84%
and project themselves into
the Blondes or the Reptiles.

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:16.790 align:middle line:84%
The Reptiles can make
Blondes and Grey bodies

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:20.270 align:middle line:84%
and project themselves into
the Blonde and the Grey bodies.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:24.140 align:middle line:84%
The Blondes can make the
Reptilian bodies and the Grey

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.880 align:middle line:84%
bodies and project
themselves into it.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Linda, what
I've just said to you

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:33.690 align:middle line:84%
is the key to the
history of this planet.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:34.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>> That the competing
extraterrestrials can

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.900 align:middle line:84%
camouflage as each
other's enemies.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, and that relates
to what we were talking about

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:51.110 align:middle line:84%
earlier, the installation where
I said that there are cloaking

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:56.750 align:middle line:84%
mechanisms to make certain
incidents look like it's coming

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.660 align:middle line:90%
from humanity itself.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And even some very
advanced species,

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.250 align:middle line:84%
they haven't had
a clue about that.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.430 align:middle line:84%
They were looking at
it, and they were also

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.890 align:middle line:84%
presuming that it may be
coming from humanity itself.

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:17.000 align:middle line:84%
While in fact, there
are evidences that what

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.700 align:middle line:84%
you described is a
possibility and fact, yes.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Which means almost everything
in the history of the Earth was

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:30.380 align:middle line:84%
an illusion, a competing
illusion on behalf

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:38.180 align:middle line:84%
of intelligences who are able
to even deceive their enemy,

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:43.460 align:middle line:84%
and what they're after
is control of our planet.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I mean, so we have
a lot of agendas going on.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And what I would
say is very true is

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:54.920 align:middle line:84%
that we have a kind of rare
situation on this planet

00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:00.200 align:middle line:84%
as we have a high
variety of species--

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.990 align:middle line:84%
animal species, botanical
species, but also the--

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Water.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:06.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Water species.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And we also have different
strains, so to speak,

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.280 align:middle line:90%
of humanity itself.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Reinforcing this planet
has been used as a laboratory

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:22.040 align:middle line:84%
by these multiple species, which
would explain why the density

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.120 align:middle line:84%
of different lifeforms on
Earth is supposed to be hugely

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:31.070 align:middle line:84%
greater than the normal planet
that may have two or three.

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I wouldn't suggest that
we have this kind of absolute

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.400 align:middle line:90%
answer.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.620 align:middle line:10%
So I would say that some of
the species we're talking about

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:44.840 align:middle line:10%
indeed think that Earth is kind
of a playground for whatever

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.890 align:middle line:10%
they have in mind.

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:52.700 align:middle line:10%
But I would also say that there
are different other species,

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:56.840 align:middle line:10%
very benevolent, that
think that Earth is just

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.920 align:middle line:10%
a wonderful place.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:02.040 align:middle line:84%
It's something where life
flourishes and so on.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.050 align:middle line:84%
But what I wanted to say
about the rare moment

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:09.470 align:middle line:84%
or the rare situation that
we have considering Earth

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:14.240 align:middle line:84%
is that there are so
many different influences

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.610 align:middle line:84%
acting and operating
on this planet

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.760 align:middle line:90%
that there is a high diversity.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And diversity,
again, is something

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:27.080 align:middle line:84%
that a species allows in
order to make experiences,

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:33.200 align:middle line:84%
and experiences is fundamentally
the main force of the universe

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.340 align:middle line:90%
in order to grow.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:40.340 align:middle line:84%
So that is something why
this planet Earth is chaotic,

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:45.740 align:middle line:84%
yet, has a very high
potency in order to evolve.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>> When you were with the
Greys, those many times,

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:53.210 align:middle line:84%
maybe 100 times, were you
ever shown the movie--

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:56.060 align:middle line:84%
I think of it as,
from the people

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:59.390 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed, that they
see it like a movie somewhere

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:00.990 align:middle line:90%
right in here.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And that in the movies,
they will often be

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:08.130 align:middle line:90%
shown past event in their life.

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And in some of them,
it will involve, say,

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.290 align:middle line:90%
seeing a craft or a being.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost
like, remember this?

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.830 align:middle line:90%
This is me again.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever had,
while you were

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:26.110 align:middle line:84%
with Greys, one of those movies
or the flashing images that

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:30.580 align:middle line:84%
was like trying to show you this
is where we've been involved

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.530 align:middle line:90%
in your planet for a long time?

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>> No, not on this kind
of level of communication.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:40.790 align:middle line:84%
But I did have indeed
conversations about history

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:45.100 align:middle line:84%
and the perspective of the
Greys on human history and Earth

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:45.900 align:middle line:90%
history.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.080 align:middle line:84%
Which is interesting
because data

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.590 align:middle line:84%
has been collected how
different species see

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:53.880 align:middle line:90%
the history of this planet.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And what you can see-- and
this is something that, I mean,

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.800 align:middle line:84%
I found particularly
interesting,

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:09.410 align:middle line:84%
maybe a little bizarre that
you do not have a cohesive one

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:11.240 align:middle line:90%
version of history.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:16.520 align:middle line:84%
You have histories that
seem to be very credible.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:20.210 align:middle line:10%
So I do not doubt all this
data that have been collected,

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:24.800 align:middle line:10%
but I would say that there
are contradicting parts in it

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:30.980 align:middle line:10%
and different foci and different
viewpoints on Earth history.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you give a
very specific example

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:38.720 align:middle line:84%
that's impressed you as possibly
one history that gets changed?

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>> For example, Being 6 has
a totally different viewpoint

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:47.820 align:middle line:84%
on that because they don't
see any history at all.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.810 align:middle line:10%
They see like a life
environment that

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:55.580 align:middle line:10%
has been created outside
of time, so to speak,

00:13:55.580 --> 00:14:00.240 align:middle line:10%
and just been set up in
order to gain experiences.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.650 align:middle line:84%
So there is no sense
of time at all.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And the Greys, for example,
they have a pretty much

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:10.860 align:middle line:90%
linear understanding of time.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.010 align:middle line:84%
For example, if we talk
about the pyramids,

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:17.780 align:middle line:84%
we can see that
some species claim

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:21.590 align:middle line:84%
to be the builder of the
pyramids or at least being

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.900 align:middle line:90%
influencer of the construction.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.590 align:middle line:84%
Being 6, for example,
says that it's

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:30.800 align:middle line:84%
their members, their
collective that

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.070 align:middle line:84%
has placed the
pyramids there in order

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:41.430 align:middle line:84%
to have a solution so that the
universe can observe itself.

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:45.380 align:middle line:84%
So the pyramids
from their viewpoint

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:50.480 align:middle line:84%
have an equivalent outside
of time and inside of time.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>> In just 2021, it was one of
the more impactful statements

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.790 align:middle line:90%
said to me.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:04.250 align:middle line:84%
It was from somebody who works
in both military and large

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.430 align:middle line:90%
aerospace.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was, we have been
able to confirm pyramids

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:17.470 align:middle line:84%
on many solar systems with our
work through the Space Force

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:20.660 align:middle line:84%
working with the
Tall Whites and that

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:24.740 align:middle line:84%
the measurements of
Cheops, the measurements

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.200 align:middle line:84%
of the other pyramids
that they have found--

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.330 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking
on solar systems

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:33.180 align:middle line:84%
beyond our solar system
in the Milky Way Galaxy--

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:33.980 align:middle line:90%
>> They are equal.

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>> That the same mathematical
ratios are in these other

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:40.490 align:middle line:90%
pyramids.

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, because the measurements
of the pyramids are equal

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:53.210 align:middle line:84%
to sum of the code that
is the basic structure

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:57.900 align:middle line:84%
to the objective reality
that we experience here.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:02.450 align:middle line:84%
So from the
viewpoint of Being 6,

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:09.110 align:middle line:84%
it's been a direct
influence from Source itself

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:13.160 align:middle line:90%
that has created the pyramids.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.090 align:middle line:84%
But then as well has
an equivalent inside

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:22.910 align:middle line:84%
of time, where we find some
kind of logical connection--

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>> That go throughout
the Milky Way galaxy.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:27.620 align:middle line:90%
>> And there's a suggestion--

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:31.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying anybody has said
this as a declarative sentence,

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:35.480 align:middle line:84%
but that I have information
about one person who

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:42.130 align:middle line:84%
has been taken to Andromeda
Galaxy twice with Tall Whites.

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And the implication was
that there are pyramids

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:47.180 align:middle line:90%
in that galaxy as well.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:51.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And it raises the question--
it's not a declarative

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.540 align:middle line:90%
sentence--

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:58.030 align:middle line:84%
are there pyramids throughout
this whole particular universe

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:middle line:84%
going back to some point
in time and almost as

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.589 align:middle line:84%
if the universe
itself were marked

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:08.360 align:middle line:84%
by a pyramid-building
intelligence?

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:14.170 align:middle line:84%
So even outside of time
is what I'm trying to say

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.960 align:middle line:90%
and what I understood from that.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:27.130 align:middle line:84%
So the universe itself seems to
have naturally built on thought

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.830 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you
constructed those pyramids.

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And you find them,
indeed, you find them

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.230 align:middle line:84%
all over the place,
everywhere in the universe.

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And what I understand from the
descriptions and explanations

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:42.880 align:middle line:84%
of Being 6 is that
pyramids can very well

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:49.120 align:middle line:84%
be used for the universe itself
in order to observe itself.

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.630 align:middle line:84%
The way Being 6
describes me the reality

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:56.710 align:middle line:84%
that you see it we,
whatever, perceive

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:02.020 align:middle line:84%
the reality is that there are
spots within the universe that

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:08.410 align:middle line:84%
are full of paradoxes and
still sort of clouds where

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:13.540 align:middle line:84%
the universe doesn't know
what that is until it itself

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:14.950 align:middle line:90%
observes it.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And from that very
point, too, we

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.900 align:middle line:84%
have all this what we
experience right here.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And, Tim, what's sort
of becoming, I guess,

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:28.600 align:middle line:84%
almost a revelation to me as we
have been talking is that it is

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.020 align:middle line:84%
almost as if the creatures
inside of this universe,

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:36.910 align:middle line:84%
whether it's humans on Earth or
on Anunnaki on Mars or the Tall

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:41.750 align:middle line:84%
Whites on another solar
system, that we are really,

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:45.320 align:middle line:84%
truly the observers
for the universe.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, 100%.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And I've only really
felt that strongly

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.580 align:middle line:90%
in our discussion.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.220 align:middle line:90%
It's like a cyclic feedback.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm beginning to get that sense.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.930 align:middle line:84%
I've read those words
in books, but now it's

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:00.110 align:middle line:90%
beginning to feel real.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.910 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a self--

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:03.740 align:middle line:10%
>> We are the observers
for the universe.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>> We are the observers, and
it's a self-remembering process

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.500 align:middle line:84%
to know that we
are the observers.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And that is, for example, why
we find these eyes, for example,

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:17.590 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt where--

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:21.190 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.820 align:middle line:84%
So that was something
that Being 6

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:29.650 align:middle line:84%
had told me that this stance
in relationship to the universe

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:31.430 align:middle line:90%
observing itself.

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:34.450 align:middle line:84%
So that is why we have
this eye somewhere.

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:39.040 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it seems like the
universe can utilize pyramids

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:43.660 align:middle line:84%
in order to observe
itself, just like maybe

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:47.890 align:middle line:84%
a kind of an organ, a
structure or whatever in order

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:49.960 align:middle line:90%
to measure some things.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.270 align:middle line:84%
But yet, it seems
like the pyramids

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:56.920 align:middle line:84%
have many different,
sometimes even contradictory

00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:04.930 align:middle line:84%
functions that they also can be
used as tools inside of time.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And I found that
pretty interesting.

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And the Greys, for
example, while Being 6

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:15.310 align:middle line:84%
was mainly speaking
about the Pyramid of Giza

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:19.480 align:middle line:84%
and several other big
pyramids on the planet,

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:23.620 align:middle line:84%
the Greys have claimed
that heavily influenced

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.170 align:middle line:84%
the construction of
the other two pyramids

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:27.550 align:middle line:90%
that we find in Egypt.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.600 align:middle line:84%
>> The smaller ones
right next to Cheops.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And what I found
interesting-- and I mean,

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:36.160 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people probably
are aware of this--

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.110 align:middle line:84%
that the pyramids,
the three pyramids

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:41.440 align:middle line:84%
are absolutely aligned
to the Orion's belt.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:43.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:45.580 align:middle line:10%
And we find that in
many structures on Earth

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.860 align:middle line:10%
that these are all
aligned to Orion,

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:52.570 align:middle line:10%
and Orion is basically
the star system where

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:58.020 align:middle line:10%
the Greys have their home base,
so to speak, so we find that.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And what they said is that they
utilize these three pyramids

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:11.950 align:middle line:84%
in order to work with
humans from the past that

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:16.780 align:middle line:84%
have used these pyramids
in order to extract

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:20.590 align:middle line:84%
their consciousness, their
souls, whatever in order

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:23.770 align:middle line:90%
to bring it to the Grey system.

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:27.505 align:middle line:84%
And that is why these pyramids
are aligned to Orion, which

00:21:27.505 --> 00:21:28.630 align:middle line:90%
I found pretty interesting.

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Because, I mean, it seems
like the Greys nowadays

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:35.230 align:middle line:84%
have much more sophisticated
technology in order to do.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:38.530 align:middle line:84%
So I told you about
the big internet--

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, of the Greys--

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, an
interesting question.

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.200 align:middle line:90%
I've only been to Cheops once--

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.930 align:middle line:90%
it was in 1982.

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:56.610 align:middle line:10%
And I was traveling with
my husband, and I ask him,

00:21:56.610 --> 00:22:00.950 align:middle line:10%
they were going to be in a line
and they've got the guides.

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:06.410 align:middle line:84%
Would you please say,
I'm there if I'm not,

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:08.480 align:middle line:84%
and I will come back
out of the pyramid.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.120 align:middle line:84%
But I asked my husband if
he would help because--

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:15.140 align:middle line:84%
I had and it came to me
when I'm in the pyramid.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:19.890 align:middle line:84%
It was nothing that I
calculated, but something in me

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:23.730 align:middle line:84%
said, you've got to go
into the King's Chamber.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:26.820 align:middle line:84%
You've got to stand
in there by yourself.

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.310 align:middle line:84%
You are not going to learn
this if there's anybody else.

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:33.830 align:middle line:84%
It just came in just like
that, and that's just

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:36.150 align:middle line:84%
translated to him,
would you just please,

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:39.090 align:middle line:84%
if they call for
our names, answer.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>> What did you learn?

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I managed to get to
the tail of the people.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:51.980 align:middle line:84%
So when it came time
for everybody to leave,

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:55.230 align:middle line:84%
the Black sarcophagus
was behind me,

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.250 align:middle line:84%
and I was as if I
were being guided.

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And I stood right in
the middle, as close

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.380 align:middle line:84%
to the middle of
the King's Chamber.

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And I had been a meditator,
and I went into that frequency.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And I would close my
eyes, and all of a sudden,

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:19.820 align:middle line:84%
just as clear as if somebody
were talking to me, but more

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:22.600 align:middle line:90%
like a thought voice.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a vacuum.

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:27.740 align:middle line:90%
This is a void.

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:28.960 align:middle line:90%
It's empty.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.100 align:middle line:90%
It was the opposite.

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:34.960 align:middle line:84%
I had expected that I
would get an energy rush

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.230 align:middle line:84%
and that I was almost
afraid of what might happen.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:41.050 align:middle line:90%
It was completely the opposite.

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And out of feeling now I am in
a void came the next revelation.

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:56.990 align:middle line:84%
This is a place built to
be filled with energy.

00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have no other explanation
beyond that occurring,

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.340 align:middle line:90%
but I think it was true.

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And now, as we talk in 2022,
I've been to other places.

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:12.730 align:middle line:90%
I have been to Gobekli Tepe.

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:17.010 align:middle line:84%
I had a discussion
with a geologist there.

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:19.290 align:middle line:90%
We talked about this.

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it's very possible
that what you were experiencing

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:27.540 align:middle line:84%
is that the pyramids
were built to vibrate

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:32.850 align:middle line:84%
to specific frequencies
applied by extraterrestrials

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:39.000 align:middle line:84%
in a network of pyramids
on this planet linked

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.770 align:middle line:90%
to other pyramids.

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And my mind went
larger and larger,

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.760 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, what
if this is all true.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:46.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And that something gave me
that lesson standing in Cheops

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.040 align:middle line:90%
one time in my life on Earth.

00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:03.060 align:middle line:84%
>> There are so many different
versions of what the pyramids

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:08.800 align:middle line:84%
are like, who built them,
what they did, and so on.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.640 align:middle line:84%
But I would absolutely
agree that frequencies,

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.980 align:middle line:84%
and for example,
balancing frequencies,

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:20.440 align:middle line:84%
used to be one of the main
functions of the pyramids.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:24.300 align:middle line:84%
That's basically
what Being 6 told me

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:28.410 align:middle line:90%
that they have used our--

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:34.320 align:middle line:84%
outside of time, the universe
creates pyramidal structures

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.810 align:middle line:84%
not only to observe
itself, but also

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:44.520 align:middle line:84%
to have a stabilized frequency
so that life can flourish

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.950 align:middle line:90%
and can grow from that.

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:51.450 align:middle line:84%
So it seems like all these
alignments of pyramids

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:56.070 align:middle line:84%
also create something
that balances reality.

00:25:56.070 --> 00:26:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And the energy, it
might be what is resisting

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.370 align:middle line:90%
the installation.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:04.950 align:middle line:84%
>> If I correctly
understand Being 6,

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:09.960 align:middle line:84%
then the pyramids are pretty
much out of function right now

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:15.930 align:middle line:84%
because they are so
destroyed in a way.

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:18.480 align:middle line:84%
I personally have always
thought, why don't we

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.220 align:middle line:90%
reconstruct them?

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:24.220 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes feel like when I
look at them, like, man, this

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:28.680 align:middle line:84%
should be like a project for
humanity just to rebuild these.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>> When I did a
documentary on Antarctica,

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:37.830 align:middle line:84%
the seal that I focused on said
that there was an archaeologist

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:43.350 align:middle line:84%
in this huge obsidian-based
basalt installation two miles

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:48.300 align:middle line:84%
down under that ice who was
there as a master studying

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.490 align:middle line:90%
the symbols.

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And that he, the Seal 6, was
able to ask the archaeologist,

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.570 align:middle line:90%
how old is the Sphinx in Egypt?

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And that archaeologist,
anthropologist, language guy

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:11.120 align:middle line:84%
said, it's at least
45,000 years old.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:16.250 align:middle line:84%
I told that to one of
the government aerospace

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:19.580 align:middle line:84%
military people in the
last couple of years.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And they said, Linda,
as far as we know,

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:25.020 align:middle line:84%
the Sphinx could be
800,000 years old.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:29.180 align:middle line:84%
One thing that I've found
pretty interesting with Being 6

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:34.700 align:middle line:84%
is that there seemed to be life
cycles on this planet as well.

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:39.800 align:middle line:84%
When we enter life
and become alive,

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:44.180 align:middle line:84%
then there always have been
species before ourselves.

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:49.460 align:middle line:84%
We have constantly life
cycles and other beings

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:53.240 align:middle line:84%
that have already
made experiences

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.460 align:middle line:90%
which we can benefit from.

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that I
found interesting--

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:01.490 align:middle line:84%
and this is just a
perspective from Being 6,

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:05.790 align:middle line:84%
which is a being that is
outside of time, so to speak--

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:12.240 align:middle line:84%
is that they say, planets are
also being re-used in some way.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:16.070 align:middle line:84%
So if life flourishes
on a planet,

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:21.260 align:middle line:84%
and this life evolves to
a certain stage, which

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:26.210 align:middle line:84%
where they just go for another
realm, they just disappear,

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:29.690 align:middle line:84%
and Earth will be recycled
and some other lifeforms

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:30.600 align:middle line:90%
will be put upon it.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Like the erasure layer,
layer, layer, layer, layer.

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:35.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.580 align:middle line:10%
>> If we could look
at all the layers,

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:40.370 align:middle line:10%
we would begin to truly see
the history of the planet.

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>> 100%.

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And if I understand
that correctly,

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.720 align:middle line:84%
that is, for example,
one of the reasons

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:48.560 align:middle line:84%
why so many people are digging
in Antarctica right now.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:52.520 align:middle line:84%
Because beneath those
10 kilometers of ice,

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:57.530 align:middle line:84%
there seems to be evidence of
a culture of a previous form

00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:03.560 align:middle line:84%
of life cycle that has
already ascended but left some

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.900 align:middle line:84%
of this traces of their
civilization, which

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:10.430 align:middle line:84%
might be totally and completely
different than anything

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:12.740 align:middle line:90%
we have knowledge about.

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And this might be, if I
correctly understand this,

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.220 align:middle line:84%
the reason why
Antarctica, for example,

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:23.780 align:middle line:90%
is so interesting since 1940--

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:24.710 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:28.520 align:middle line:84%
We think that Earth
is being reused,

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:33.080 align:middle line:84%
and species that have ascended,
they just leave the place.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>> This came from a man who did
work for the CIA when I talk

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:40.740 align:middle line:84%
with him, only this goes
back probably 25 years ago.

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was about
Mayan civilization.

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why it came up
is, I was getting a document.

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:53.750 align:middle line:84%
That was the whole reason
that I was talking with him.

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:55.550 align:middle line:90%
I was getting a document.

00:29:55.550 --> 00:30:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And he said something
about, have you

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:04.310 align:middle line:84%
ever learned about
the ET connection

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:07.820 align:middle line:84%
to the Mayan civilization
and its disappearance?

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:09.420 align:middle line:90%
A very provocative sentence.

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:10.220 align:middle line:90%
I said, no.

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:12.260 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
the truth is the world

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:19.660 align:middle line:84%
gets the story that there was
some kind of climactic problem

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:23.530 align:middle line:84%
and the Mayan
civilization died out.

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:25.960 align:middle line:90%
He said, but here's the truth.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.800 align:middle line:84%
He said, the Mayans were
a genetically manipulated

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:35.170 align:middle line:84%
civilization made specifically
by extraterrestrials.

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And he said, on our planet,
ETs, sometimes same species,

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:42.910 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times
different species,

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:47.650 align:middle line:84%
they will pick a peninsula,
an island a mountaintop

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:51.640 align:middle line:84%
and they will do isolations
in the geography for all

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.530 align:middle line:90%
of their different experiments.

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And he said the Mayans
are truly from Bhutan,

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:03.460 align:middle line:84%
our current modern day
Bhutan in the Himalayas.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And he said and we know
it was a Grey experiment,

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:10.090 align:middle line:84%
and he said it was
done, and he had

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:14.380 align:middle line:84%
numbers on a certain
number of people and where.

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And said they manipulated
DNA in the Bhutanese.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:24.220 align:middle line:84%
They ended up transporting
what would I assume would be

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:28.230 align:middle line:90%
children or the first adults, --

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:31.950 align:middle line:84%
and took them to a
Peninsula that we

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:37.200 align:middle line:84%
call the Yucatan and Belize
and Guatemala and that area.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And they put their Bhutanese
manipulated DNA humanoid there.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And then they
watched and evolved.

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And he said, when
it got to 850 AD,

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.240 align:middle line:90%
he said, it wasn't starvation.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.950 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't drought.

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:59.890 align:middle line:84%
He said the Greys
that had manipulated

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:05.540 align:middle line:84%
the DNA came for the
entire Mayan population.

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:06.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Put it on another planet to
be an entire Mayan civilization

00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:14.220 align:middle line:90%
planet.

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And he ended by
saying, we've always

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:21.000 align:middle line:84%
been very curious to find
out which solar system

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.460 align:middle line:84%
and where is the Mayan
experimental planet.

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:26.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>> That is a real
discussion that I had with--

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Linda, I didn't know that.

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:30.890 align:middle line:90%
>> 25 years ago.

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I didn't know that, but what
I can confirm and what I can--

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:40.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, which
strengthens everything

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:44.340 align:middle line:84%
you said is that you
remember synthesize?

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, the Grey's motto.

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Protect, serve,
and synthesize.

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:51.900 align:middle line:84%
This is basically exactly
what the Greys are doing.

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And what you say, the statement
about sample groups put

00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:00.570 align:middle line:84%
into some different
places, this is absolutely

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:03.130 align:middle line:90%
what happened on this planet.

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And I also can
confirm, even though I

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.620 align:middle line:84%
don't know if this
is Bhutan or not,

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:11.310 align:middle line:84%
but we know that many,
many thousands of years

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:15.600 align:middle line:84%
ago, the Greys had a base
in the Himalayan Mountains.

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:20.710 align:middle line:84%
So everything you just
said makes total sense.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever heard
of like New Delhi, India,

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:31.900 align:middle line:84%
where they would end up
with some kind of a--

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:35.590 align:middle line:84%
it would look to the
human eye like a scroll

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:39.070 align:middle line:84%
in the old biblical literature,
you would see these graphics

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:41.320 align:middle line:84%
where it would be things
that would be rolled

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.940 align:middle line:90%
and they would be like this.

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And we would assume
that they would

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:50.630 align:middle line:90%
unroll like we would do that.

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And this was another
government project,

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:59.620 align:middle line:84%
and this goes all the way
back to the early '70s.

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:02.170 align:middle line:10%
And I was able to
talk with a person who

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:05.560 align:middle line:10%
was on this trip, in
which I believe it

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:09.820 align:middle line:10%
was a CIA paid for operation.

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:13.130 align:middle line:84%
They had these men go, they
had State Department letters,

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:18.370 align:middle line:84%
everything was totally
normal and above board.

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:23.370 align:middle line:84%
But they had somebody
who was translating

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:29.889 align:middle line:84%
found where one of these
scrolls, if they could get

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:34.360 align:middle line:84%
to a very specific
place in New Delhi

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.820 align:middle line:84%
and they had to do
maps and color-- it

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:40.810 align:middle line:84%
was very, very, very weird,
because it was not the way we

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:43.310 align:middle line:90%
think of blocks and streets.

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:45.429 align:middle line:10%
But if they got
to this one place

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:48.280 align:middle line:10%
that they were going to
try to follow on a map,

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:52.179 align:middle line:10%
they would say a word,
and the word would either

00:34:52.179 --> 00:34:54.230 align:middle line:10%
be known to the person--

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:58.970 align:middle line:10%
it was all quite mystical and
like the old days of sigils.

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:00.810 align:middle line:10%
But the man told me they did.

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:02.010 align:middle line:10%
They found it.

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:04.210 align:middle line:10%
They did the word.

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:08.430 align:middle line:84%
A person as if they were
choreographed in a theater,

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:13.230 align:middle line:84%
meaning follow me, down
tunnels, underground,

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:15.270 align:middle line:90%
deep under New Delhi.

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And they came to a thing
like this in the wall.

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>> And what was it?

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>> And he said, it was a Grey.

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>> As if preserved.

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And they stood there
absolutely astounded.

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:33.860 align:middle line:90%
A small one, probably AI.

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And then the person who shows
them the Grey in this alcove

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:44.220 align:middle line:90%
steps down more steps, come.

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:48.470 align:middle line:84%
They go to some kind of like
you would think of a place

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:51.710 align:middle line:84%
where you would go
and pray or something.

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:56.930 align:middle line:90%
Pulls out a drawer like this.

00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And he said, for a
minute, we weren't sure

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:01.190 align:middle line:90%
what we were looking at.

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:03.740 align:middle line:84%
It looks sort of like
a scroll, but Linda, it

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:06.920 align:middle line:90%
was glowing letters.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And we ask, we got a
translator, how old is this?

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
thousands of years.

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:23.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, Tim, what is
the true history of Earth?

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:27.340 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, that's the question.

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.530 align:middle line:90%
And it's super interesting.

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:33.710 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know that, so thank
you for sharing it with us.

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:37.290 align:middle line:10%
I mean the thing
is that we all--

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:43.420 align:middle line:10%
I assume we have to accept that
history is not as linear as we

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:47.680 align:middle line:10%
might think it is and
that everything we come up

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:52.630 align:middle line:10%
in a history book is just
an agreement of how we think

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:55.120 align:middle line:10%
history could have worked--

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.740 align:middle line:10%
a story basically.

00:36:56.740 --> 00:37:01.870 align:middle line:84%
It seems that there are so
many different timelines.

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And the further back you
go, the more different proof

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:10.450 align:middle line:84%
to different, even
contradictory facts you find.

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Political egos trying
to cover up a past.

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Restructuring history
is probably a lot of it.

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I mean, I assume that
everyone who's a historian

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:27.520 align:middle line:84%
or something would confirm
that history is something

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:31.750 align:middle line:84%
that's always been constructed
over time because it's a way

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:37.130 align:middle line:84%
to portray yourself and
also to influence people.

00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:39.550 align:middle line:84%
But what I found
really interesting

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:44.470 align:middle line:84%
is that we have so many
contradictory facts to history,

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:51.160 align:middle line:84%
and they still seem to be true,
all of them at the same time.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>> In your interactions
with Being 6,

00:37:54.490 --> 00:38:01.090 align:middle line:84%
what do you understand is their
goal, the Level 6 goal with us?

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:07.960 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so the goal from
Being 6 is becoming Being 7,

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:11.710 align:middle line:84%
which means the unified
field of this universe.

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And that is where
they need us in a way.

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:19.120 align:middle line:84%
So we are currently
on way where Being 6

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:23.890 align:middle line:84%
is now Being 7 or
already is Being 7.

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:26.980 align:middle line:84%
So everything we see
here, experience here

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:30.700 align:middle line:90%
is already Being 7.

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:33.760 align:middle line:84%
If you want to call it
heaven state or whatever,

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:37.810 align:middle line:84%
that is exactly what's
being developed right now.

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And we are on way to become
that, but in the 3D context,

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:48.310 align:middle line:84%
in a linear way,
it sort of needs

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:51.430 align:middle line:90%
to become played out in a way.

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:56.650 align:middle line:10%
So the takeaway is that
Being 6 is right now becoming

00:38:56.650 --> 00:39:01.360 align:middle line:10%
Being 7 consciousness,
an integrated field,

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:07.220 align:middle line:10%
but still some paradoxes
are being cleared over time.

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And if a being becomes
like, say, Being 6--

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:18.055 align:middle line:84%
>> Evolves to 7, then
are they pure energy?

00:39:18.055 --> 00:39:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>> What's happening--

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the relationship
between getting a heaven

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:27.090 align:middle line:90%
frequency versus us in 4?

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:30.090 align:middle line:84%
How did the two play
in this evolution

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:32.400 align:middle line:90%
that humans want to know?

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Where is heaven, and
how do we get there?

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:35.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:40.740 align:middle line:84%
So if I were to compare it
to any cultural background

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:44.250 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, I
would say the state

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:49.416 align:middle line:90%
of a loving and generous--

00:39:49.416 --> 00:39:58.080 align:middle line:84%
a loving and generous God
state is what Being 7 is like.

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:04.740 align:middle line:84%
So we're actually on a way
to establish a state of God

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:07.800 align:middle line:90%
that is loving and generous.

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:11.550 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't call it God
in a religious way.

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:14.400 align:middle line:84%
But if I would
define the picture

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:18.000 align:middle line:84%
that we have of a loving
and generous Godlike

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.320 align:middle line:84%
state, divine state, that
is exactly where Being 6

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.900 align:middle line:90%
is heading to right now.

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And that being said,
we all are Being

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:30.770 align:middle line:90%
6, so that's where we're going.

00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So at Level 6, are there an
infinite number of gods or only

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:42.520 align:middle line:84%
one that encapsulates all of
the other infinite beings?

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:49.130 align:middle line:84%
>> At Level 6, there is an
almost infinite number, a huge,

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:54.820 align:middle line:84%
huge, huge number of
harmonious, loving, benevolent,

00:40:54.820 --> 00:41:00.880 align:middle line:84%
and good places in the universe,
which means like almost

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:04.640 align:middle line:90%
everyone has found its place.

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:06.640 align:middle line:84%
So in the long run,
the interesting thing

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.500 align:middle line:84%
is what the universe
wants to achieve,

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.210 align:middle line:84%
at least this version
of the universe,

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:13.130 align:middle line:84%
is to become a picture
of itself in the end.

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:15.490 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening
in a 3D world,

00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:18.220 align:middle line:84%
if you think like
particles, is that we

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:21.400 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of particles
searching for the way

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.350 align:middle line:90%
where they fit in the most.

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Like it's a huge evolutionary
universe puzzle or something.

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And the higher it
gets, the more dense

00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:32.530 align:middle line:84%
it gets because all
these consciousness units

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:36.010 align:middle line:84%
have found the place where
they feel like the most

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:37.810 align:middle line:90%
integrated, the best.

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Because that is basically what
the universe at this version

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.750 align:middle line:84%
of the universe
wants to achieve,

00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:47.980 align:middle line:84%
becoming home for
itself, for every cell,

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:52.180 align:middle line:84%
for every consciousness unit,
for every aspect of life

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:56.530 align:middle line:84%
to become its most
wholesome, divine,

00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:58.930 align:middle line:84%
you could even say
Buddha state or whatever

00:41:58.930 --> 00:41:59.860 align:middle line:90%
you want to call it.

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:01.600 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's going to be.

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And at Level 7, we
almost have-- if you

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:09.400 align:middle line:84%
think about this as a picture
or a puzzle or something,

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:13.510 align:middle line:84%
you have this huge puzzle
that is almost finished,

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:16.480 align:middle line:84%
but there's only one
piece of the puzzle that

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:17.980 align:middle line:90%
is still missing.

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're doing right now

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:22.720 align:middle line:90%
to take that and put it inside.

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>> In all of your telepathic
communications with the Greys--

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>> What has haunted
you the most?

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>> That's an
interesting question.

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:37.470 align:middle line:84%
On a physical
level, it's probably

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:44.310 align:middle line:84%
the feeling that is irradiated,
the strong frequency

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:47.860 align:middle line:90%
when you meet these beings.

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:52.200 align:middle line:84%
But what has freaked
me out the most

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:59.130 align:middle line:84%
is the existence of
purely hostile beings.

00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Because that is something
that I cannot grasp in a way.

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:09.810 align:middle line:84%
Like a neurotype
person or being that

00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:14.790 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely OK with his
own self-destructiveness,

00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:18.210 align:middle line:84%
that seems to make no
sense at all for myself,

00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:24.090 align:middle line:84%
and I'm very puzzled and
surprised that these very cold

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:29.220 align:middle line:84%
hearted and absolutely
self-destructive aspects

00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:31.560 align:middle line:90%
of the universe do exist.

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>> And that is--

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Very small portion, though.

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:35.040 align:middle line:90%
I want to say that.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.980 align:middle line:84%
The biggest portion
of the universe

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:43.680 align:middle line:84%
is super beneficial and
creative and constructive,

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:48.360 align:middle line:84%
but there's a small amount
of people and aspects

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:53.080 align:middle line:84%
in the universe that are
just self-destructive.

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And it is that question--
why does evil exist if it is

00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:03.050 align:middle line:84%
a universe that has to do
with entropy reduction.

00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:03.850 align:middle line:90%
>> I will say--

00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Schizophrenic.

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:07.630 align:middle line:84%
They're the opposites
existing in the same universe.

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The biggest question
I would say is,

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:18.120 align:middle line:84%
how do we deal with someone
who knows that he/she/it is

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:22.350 align:middle line:84%
self-destructive but does
not want to change at all?

00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:26.160 align:middle line:10%
How do we deal with an
aspect of the universe that

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:29.940 align:middle line:10%
just wants to destroy itself?

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:31.560 align:middle line:90%
How do we deal with that?

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is something Being 6
raised for its own existence

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:42.930 align:middle line:84%
because you still have this
one piece of puzzle that wants

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:44.550 align:middle line:90%
everything to be destroyed.

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot convince
that piece by saying, hey,

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:53.640 align:middle line:84%
it would be much nicer if you
were constructive and if we all

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.870 align:middle line:90%
be together in a good way.

00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:59.680 align:middle line:84%
If you have this kind of
neurotype personality,

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.440 align:middle line:90%
which is--

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:06.990 align:middle line:84%
the only sense it has is being
self-destructive and bringing

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:10.260 align:middle line:84%
destructiveness to the universe,
then we have the question

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:12.370 align:middle line:90%
how do we deal with that.

00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And I guess one of
the answers to that

00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:17.790 align:middle line:84%
are so-called warrior
type species that

00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:24.240 align:middle line:84%
just put on force onto other
aspects of the same universe

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:26.790 align:middle line:90%
just holding things together.

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:31.950 align:middle line:10%
I'm not quite sure if this
is the best technique that we

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:36.210 align:middle line:10%
could come up with, but I
don't have an alternative to it

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:38.400 align:middle line:10%
as well.

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>> What have the--

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:46.320 align:middle line:90%
Grey inner play that you had--

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:51.720 align:middle line:84%
What gives you hope that we are
headed in a loving direction?

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>> 100%, we are heading towards
a super loving condition,

00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:01.920 align:middle line:84%
and the universe itself
has so many back up plans,

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:04.920 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, that in this
version of the universe

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:08.520 align:middle line:84%
everything will
100% turn out great.

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:09.750 align:middle line:90%
100%.

00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And there are forces
all over the universe

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:17.310 align:middle line:84%
getting more and
more each second

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:20.940 align:middle line:84%
that one thing's
to be constructive

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:24.390 align:middle line:84%
and benevolent and
beautiful and sweet,

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:26.790 align:middle line:84%
and that gives me
a lot of confidence

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:31.290 align:middle line:84%
that things will turn
out great because there's

00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:34.500 align:middle line:90%
100% rate of success.

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>> And the goal of
your unit in Germany,

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:43.250 align:middle line:84%
how would you define what you
would like to continue to do?

00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>> What I would love to
see is that we as aspects

00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:52.730 align:middle line:84%
of the universe remind each
other that we are one singular

00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:57.530 align:middle line:84%
living being and that we need
to be constructive and find home

00:46:57.530 --> 00:46:58.500 align:middle line:90%
for everyone.

00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:02.180 align:middle line:84%
I think that we are
right now at a moment

00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:07.760 align:middle line:84%
where key players have
intellectualized and understood

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:11.840 align:middle line:90%
that we need to cooperate.

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:16.460 align:middle line:84%
This is basically an
ethical/moral stand point

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:20.660 align:middle line:84%
of view that I see
being established,

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:25.430 align:middle line:84%
which gives me some hope that
things would turn out good.

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:29.660 align:middle line:84%
Because from that derives
a certain responsibility

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:35.030 align:middle line:84%
over things, which
wasn't necessarily

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:39.470 align:middle line:84%
available like some decades
ago because people were still

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:42.890 align:middle line:84%
puzzled with reality
and how things--

00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>> We hadn't grown
up enough to say,

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:50.510 align:middle line:84%
war and violence and territorial
disputes are going to destroy

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:55.670 align:middle line:84%
us, so we better move the
planet into greater civility,

00:47:55.670 --> 00:48:01.730 align:middle line:84%
which then makes this decade
of 2020 to 2030 especially

00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:02.720 align:middle line:90%
important.

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it still seems
to be having the influence

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:09.650 align:middle line:90%
of violence.

00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>> First of all, there are two
ways to find solutions to this

00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:16.190 align:middle line:90%
problem.

00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:18.590 align:middle line:84%
You can either be
a character-- that

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:21.110 align:middle line:84%
is from your inner
standpoint, you

00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:24.170 align:middle line:84%
can feel the desire
to be harmonious.

00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:26.990 align:middle line:84%
But you could also
intellectualize

00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:31.070 align:middle line:84%
that a harmonious,
cooperative system

00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:34.550 align:middle line:84%
is much better and much
more of a win-win situation

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:35.820 align:middle line:90%
than anything else.

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:39.860 align:middle line:84%
The one thing, warmheartedness
comes naturally

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:41.840 align:middle line:90%
and very instinctively.

00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:45.500 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is, if you
only intellectualize it--

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:49.250 align:middle line:84%
and we have that situation,
for example, with Greys.

00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:55.670 align:middle line:84%
They don't love in a way
that we experience love,

00:48:55.670 --> 00:49:01.520 align:middle line:84%
but they can intellectualize
love and the necessity of love

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:03.500 align:middle line:90%
being a stabilizing factor.

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do you think
they cannot love?

00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Because some species are more
capable of emotions and more

00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:14.630 align:middle line:84%
capable of understanding
of feelings than others.

00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And the Greys
especially, getting rid

00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:24.680 align:middle line:84%
of their natural biological
body got rid of certain emotions

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:29.000 align:middle line:84%
as well and some empathy
towards each other.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.580 align:middle line:84%
That is, for example,
a main reason

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:36.890 align:middle line:84%
why all these contactees
and those scenarios

00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:40.490 align:middle line:84%
are considered to be
stressful at times

00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:48.380 align:middle line:84%
because a being that is
very empathically caring

00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:53.900 align:middle line:84%
about another species or another
being would stop some things

00:49:53.900 --> 00:50:00.620 align:middle line:84%
or would introduce itself in
a very careful and sweet way

00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:01.470 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:03.050 align:middle line:90%
But the Greys don't have that.

00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:06.590 align:middle line:90%
They see necessity to be--

00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:10.280 align:middle line:84%
some things to be done,
and then they execute that.

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:14.180 align:middle line:84%
>> I am provoked, and I want
to thank you so much for being

00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:16.490 align:middle line:90%
