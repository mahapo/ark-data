00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.100 align:middle line:84%
>> It is not often that
mainstream media does serious

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.270 align:middle line:84%
news reports about alien
beings traveling to Earth

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.340 align:middle line:90%
and abducting humans.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.500 align:middle line:84%
But in the December 1974
issue of "Astronomy" magazine,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.270 align:middle line:84%
there was an article entitled
"The Zeta Reticuli Incident."

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And that was by astronomer and
author Terence Dickinson, PhD.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.010 align:middle line:84%
The article was
groundbreaking because it

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.990 align:middle line:84%
was by a respected PhD scientist
investigating and writing

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.710 align:middle line:84%
about a binary star
system that was referenced

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.620 align:middle line:84%
in the famous Betty and
Barney Hill human abduction

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.360 align:middle line:90%
case of 1961.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.440 align:middle line:84%
That was the first
well-documented human abduction

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.110 align:middle line:84%
case publicized
around the world.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.570 align:middle line:84%
The events and the
effort to unlock missing

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.710 align:middle line:84%
time by a psychiatrist
Benjamin Simon, MD,

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.690 align:middle line:84%
were detailed in that 1966
book, "The Interrupted Journey,"

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.030 align:middle line:90%
by John Fuller.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Astronomer Dickinson
began his article,

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:36.720 align:middle line:84%
quote, "A faint pair of stars
220 trillion miles away,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.130 align:middle line:84%
which is about 39 light years,
has been tentatively identified

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.480 align:middle line:84%
as the home base of
intelligent extraterrestrials

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.520 align:middle line:84%
who allegedly visited Earth
in 1961," close quote.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.610 align:middle line:84%
The stars he referenced
are in the upper right,

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.740 align:middle line:84%
underlined with an orange
line as Zeta Reticuli 1 and 2.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.560 align:middle line:84%
That is a binary star
system of yellow suns

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.590 align:middle line:84%
that are very similar
to our Earth sun.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Astronomer Dickinson
continued, quote,

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.570 align:middle line:84%
"This hypothesis is based on a
strange, almost bizarre series

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.630 align:middle line:84%
of events mixing
astronomical research

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.640 align:middle line:84%
with hypnosis, amnesia, and
alien humanoid creatures."

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.450 align:middle line:84%
That hypnosis, amnesia, and
alien humanoid creatures

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.940 align:middle line:84%
that astronomer
Dickinson referred to

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.190 align:middle line:84%
are from the Betty and
Barney Hill abduction

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.970 align:middle line:84%
case in the White Mountains of
New Hampshire near Franconia

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.020 align:middle line:90%
Notch.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.980 align:middle line:84%
It was the night of
September 19, 1961

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.310 align:middle line:84%
as the couple drove
home to Portsmouth.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Barney stopped the
car on the road,

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.780 align:middle line:84%
and he hurried out
with his binoculars

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.370 align:middle line:84%
to get a better look at the disk
with red lights on either end.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.870 align:middle line:90%
And it was descending downward.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.600 align:middle line:84%
Barney estimated the craft
got to about 50 feet from him.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And he could see
humanoids standing

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.680 align:middle line:90%
in the windows of the craft.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.960 align:middle line:84%
One humanoid in a
window continued

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.620 align:middle line:84%
to stare at Barney, who
became very frightened.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Barney felt the beings
were about to carry out

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.110 align:middle line:84%
some type of plan,
and he said it

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.240 align:middle line:84%
was the precision
of their movements

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.640 align:middle line:90%
that frightened him so badly.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.000 align:middle line:84%
He attempted to pull the
binoculars from his eyes,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.710 align:middle line:90%
but he could not do so.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.110 align:middle line:90%
His arms were paralyzed.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Barney attempted to
reach for his gun,

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.750 align:middle line:84%
but his arms would not
move to his coat pocket.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Barney felt that he was
coming under the control

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.050 align:middle line:84%
of the humanoid at the
window, who was communicating

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.030 align:middle line:84%
telepathically to Barney's
mind to stay where he was

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.940 align:middle line:84%
and keep looking
at that humanoid.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.620 align:middle line:84%
No harm would come to Barney,
the thought voice said.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.650 align:middle line:84%
At that point,
Barney was terrified

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.440 align:middle line:84%
and felt that he was
about to be captured.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.290 align:middle line:84%
But Barney said on
the hypnosis tapes

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.430 align:middle line:84%
that he did not know what they
were going to capture him for.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Barney put the car
into first gear,

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.680 align:middle line:84%
and he swiftly took off
down US Highway Route 3.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.870 align:middle line:84%
That's the route they
were traveling on,

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.750 align:middle line:84%
the major north-south root
through northern New Hampshire

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.190 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.589 align:middle line:84%
Then, when they were just
a few hundred feet away

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:21.899 align:middle line:84%
from where Barney had
stopped on the road,

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:25.900 align:middle line:84%
the couple heard a series
of electronic buzzing sounds

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.740 align:middle line:84%
that seemed to bounce
off the trunk of the car.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.070 align:middle line:84%
The car vibrated,
and Betty and Barney

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.180 align:middle line:84%
felt tingling vibrations pass
through their bodies as well.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they were
abducted by the UFO humanoids

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.410 align:middle line:90%
and subjected to tests.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Later, there would
be many small circles

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.670 align:middle line:84%
on the back of that trunk
that, inexplicably, no one ever

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.000 align:middle line:90%
photographed.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.920 align:middle line:84%
The ET leader communicated
telepathically with Betty Hill

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.290 align:middle line:84%
and showed her a
three-dimensional star

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.610 align:middle line:84%
map that later she drew under
hypnosis with psychiatrist Dr.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.840 align:middle line:90%
Benjamin Simon.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Betty's sketch
shows several stars,

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.110 align:middle line:84%
including our G2
spectrum sun that

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.360 align:middle line:84%
is at the upper-right black dot
at the end of the double lines.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.430 align:middle line:84%
The leader alien told Betty
the lines were trade routes

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.190 align:middle line:90%
in our solar system.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Further distant to the left,
the gray being mentally

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.090 align:middle line:84%
communicated that the
single-dotted lines were

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.280 align:middle line:90%
expedition routes.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.420 align:middle line:84%
The large circles with several
trade route lines between them

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.530 align:middle line:84%
were matched by amateur
astronomer Marjorie Fish

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:48.350 align:middle line:84%
as being Zeta Reticuli 1 and 2,
a binary star system about 39

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.390 align:middle line:90%
lightyears from Earth.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.990 align:middle line:84%
That revelation is why
astronomer Terence Dickinson

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.740 align:middle line:84%
wrote "The Zeta Reticuli
Incident" for the December 1974

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.350 align:middle line:90%
issue of "Astronomy" magazine.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.350 align:middle line:84%
I contacted a
Washington, DC source

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.010 align:middle line:84%
for more information about the
Betty and Barney Hill abduction

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.150 align:middle line:90%
case.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.620 align:middle line:84%
My source said the gray beings
in the Betty and Barney Hill

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.610 align:middle line:84%
case were-- and
this is his word--

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.150 align:middle line:90%
renegades.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.620 align:middle line:84%
He meant those aliens that were
outside the US government's

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.410 align:middle line:84%
alleged treaty
with the Ebens, who

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.670 align:middle line:84%
wanted to do medical and genetic
experiments on our planet.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.950 align:middle line:84%
According to the
man in Washington,

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.880 align:middle line:84%
the treaty demanded that the
Ebens give the US government

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.550 align:middle line:84%
a list of names and
locations of people

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.460 align:middle line:84%
that the Germans wanted
to test and genetically

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.330 align:middle line:90%
harvest in human abductions.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Were Betty and Barney
Hill on a US treaty list?

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Were thousands of
other human abductees

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.520 align:middle line:84%
around the world since
the 1960s on a treaty

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.310 align:middle line:90%
list with the United States?

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:03.110 align:middle line:84%
Do intelligence agents who talk
about such a treaty really know

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.490 align:middle line:84%
and trust non-humans that
are interacting with Earth?

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.430 align:middle line:84%
What is the relationship
between the Ebens

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.250 align:middle line:84%
and other extraterrestrial
types that

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.790 align:middle line:84%
were listed for President
Ronald Reagan at that Camp David

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:21.560 align:middle line:90%
briefing March 6-8, 1981?

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.130 align:middle line:84%
In a previous "Truth Hunter,"
I dug into a document that is

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:29.090 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be an accurate
transcript of that briefing

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:34.190 align:middle line:84%
for President Reagan at Camp
David about UFO's and ET's.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:38.570 align:middle line:84%
It is called "Release
27a Reagan Briefing."

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:43.220 align:middle line:84%
It was included in a series
of 35 reports between 2005

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.870 align:middle line:90%
to 2007.

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:49.730 align:middle line:84%
These were posted in
numerical order at serpo.org.

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.370 align:middle line:84%
The anonymous leaker
identified himself

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:56.030 align:middle line:84%
as affiliated with the
Defense Intelligence Agency,

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.360 align:middle line:84%
and that his mission is
quote, "to facilitate

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.120 align:middle line:84%
the gradual release of
confidential documents

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:07.370 align:middle line:84%
pertaining to a top-secret
exchange program of 12 US

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:13.880 align:middle line:84%
military personnel to Serpo,"
a planet of Zeta Reticuli,

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:19.970 align:middle line:84%
and that this happened between
the years 1965 and 1978.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:24.470 align:middle line:84%
The information began to be
released on November 2, 2004

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.860 align:middle line:84%
by a retired senior official
within the United States

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.230 align:middle line:90%
Defense Intelligence Agency.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.960 align:middle line:90%
That is also known as the DIA.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.409 align:middle line:84%
This leaker calls
himself Anonymous.

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:38.809 align:middle line:84%
Until he chooses to
make his name known,

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:42.140 align:middle line:84%
this will be the way he
will be represented here.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Anonymous reports that he
is "not acting individually

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:50.360 align:middle line:84%
but is part of a group of six
Defense Intelligence Agency

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.870 align:middle line:84%
personnel working together
as an alliance of three

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:58.400 align:middle line:84%
current and three
former DIA employees,

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.920 align:middle line:84%
and he is their chief
spokesman," close quote.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.480 align:middle line:90%


00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.700 align:middle line:84%
There are sobering surprises
in the Reagan briefing,

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.820 align:middle line:84%
as the intelligence agents
explained to President Reagan

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:17.740 align:middle line:84%
that two of the alien
types on the list of five

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:23.110 align:middle line:84%
were genetically cloned
or hybridized by the Ebens

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:26.890 align:middle line:84%
and distributed to
other star systems.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:30.430 align:middle line:84%
That implies one
prime intelligence,

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.440 align:middle line:90%
such as the Ebens.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.530 align:middle line:84%
They are so skilled with
genetic manipulation, cloning,

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:38.380 align:middle line:84%
and hybridization
that they can be

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.890 align:middle line:84%
the source of lots of
humanoid life spread

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:49.680 align:middle line:84%
throughout the Milky Way galaxy,
including Homo sapien sapien.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.040 align:middle line:84%
That's what I read in that
alleged presidential briefing

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.580 align:middle line:84%
paper at Kirtland Air
Force Base in March 1983

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.690 align:middle line:84%
while working on a Home
Box Office documentary.

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.990 align:middle line:84%
That also means
that in this cosmos,

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:09.060 align:middle line:84%
there is other life, that
it is the result of cloning

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:14.010 align:middle line:84%
and hybridizing from
already existing lifeforms.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:17.550 align:middle line:84%
That might also explain why
many humans in the abduction

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:21.150 align:middle line:84%
syndrome have said that
aliens have introduced

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:25.800 align:middle line:84%
them, the humans, to an
identical-looking human being,

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.970 align:middle line:90%
a doppelganger.

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:29.720 align:middle line:90%
But why?

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And then there is the
discussion with President Reagan

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:41.290 align:middle line:84%
about dangerous hostile
insectoids called Trantaloids.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:45.450 align:middle line:84%
In this next piece, Anonymous
describes more details

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.790 align:middle line:84%
about the five
different alien types

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:55.000 align:middle line:84%
released on the Serpo website
about the 1981 Reagan briefing.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Quote, "The Ebens cloned
other races of aliens.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:05.200 align:middle line:84%
The Archquloid is a cloned
biological entity, or CBE,

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.100 align:middle line:84%
created by the Ebens
with big, curved noses--

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.130 align:middle line:84%
also referred to
as Big Nosed Grays

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.830 align:middle line:90%
by modern military personnel.

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:20.230 align:middle line:84%
The Quadloids were also
cloned from two other species,

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:25.420 align:middle line:84%
the praying mantis and
lizards," close quote.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:27.970 align:middle line:84%
So the Ebens
genetically engineered

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:31.960 align:middle line:84%
these Archquloid entities
by rapid cycle cloning

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and allegedly
presented two or more

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:38.110 align:middle line:84%
to the United States government
for observation, examination,

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:42.400 align:middle line:84%
and study, according
to the briefing.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Here is a summary
of what we know

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.540 align:middle line:84%
so far from the alleged
President Ronald Reagan

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:51.220 align:middle line:84%
briefing at Camp David,
Maryland on March 6-8 1981.

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:55.390 align:middle line:84%
First, what I call a prime
intelligence are the Ebens.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:12:00.340 align:middle line:84%
That stands for Extraterrestrial
Biological Entities.

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.270 align:middle line:84%
These are allegedly
from this planet Serpo,

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.690 align:middle line:84%
a desert planet where
skies are bright or dim

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:12.190 align:middle line:84%
but they're never dark, that it
orbits one of the Zeta Reticuli

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:19.510 align:middle line:84%
binary suns in a solar system
39.4 lightyears from Earth.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Archquloids are Ebens'
genetically created beings

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:29.690 align:middle line:84%
that we on the Earth have
called Big Nosed Grays

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:31.760 align:middle line:84%
and that are defined
in the breathing

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:36.560 align:middle line:84%
as being cloned biological
entities using a method called

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.840 align:middle line:90%
rapid cycle cloning.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.130 align:middle line:84%
Archquloids are around
five foot six inches tall,

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:46.490 align:middle line:84%
gray or tanned skin,
mushroom-shaped head

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:49.250 align:middle line:84%
with large black
slanted eyes that are

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:51.830 align:middle line:90%
yellow with vertical pupils.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.560 align:middle line:84%
The nose is very
large and beaked.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.710 align:middle line:84%
The name given by the United
States government insiders

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:02.210 align:middle line:84%
probably relates to the
ancient Greek archon.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.830 align:middle line:90%
And that meant ruler or lord.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.380 align:middle line:90%


00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Writer Robert Emenegger,
who wrote "UFOs--

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Past, Present and Future" with
producer Alan Sandler in 1974--

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:19.170 align:middle line:84%
and Sandler also did
work for the CIA--

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:23.040 align:middle line:84%
showed this illustration
in their book.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Emenegger later
told me face-to-face

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:29.640 align:middle line:84%
that this illustration
was sketched directly

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.760 align:middle line:84%
from a 16-millimeter
film frame that

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.900 align:middle line:84%
was shot when the Ebens
landed at Holloman Air Force

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Base in a formal meeting with
our military representatives.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:45.820 align:middle line:84%
That ET and human meeting was
also described to me by others,

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.180 align:middle line:84%
including retired
Lieutenant Colonel Philip J.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Corso, who said the actual
meeting site was further

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:55.440 align:middle line:84%
north, inside White Sands
Missile Range near the Trinity

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.640 align:middle line:90%
site.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:02.440 align:middle line:84%
The date that I was
given was April 25, 1964.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:06.130 align:middle line:84%
Here's another sketch of an
Archquloid gray type made

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:10.510 align:middle line:84%
by a Navy quartermaster
in 1972 based in Oahu,

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Hawaii who saw black-and-white
photos of these five-and-a-half

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:18.550 align:middle line:84%
foot tall extraterrestrials
in profile,

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:23.770 align:middle line:84%
showing huge beak noses and
slanted eyes that had very

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:28.510 align:middle line:84%
bright, vertical pupils
like a snake, he said.

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:31.630 align:middle line:84%
One of the photographs showed
three of these five-and-a-half

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:36.040 align:middle line:84%
foot tall Big Nosed Archquloid
that had been made genetically

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.670 align:middle line:84%
by the Ebens with
rapid cycle cloning.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.650 align:middle line:84%
They were standing
against a cement

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.320 align:middle line:84%
wall in a black-and-white
photograph

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:49.660 align:middle line:84%
the Navy quartermaster
saw in 1972 while on duty

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.610 align:middle line:90%
in Oahu, Hawaii.

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:56.180 align:middle line:84%
That name, Archquloid, given
by US government insiders

00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:00.530 align:middle line:84%
probably relates to that ancient
Greek word "archon," meaning

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:01.790 align:middle line:90%
ruler or lord.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And here on the left is
an Archquloid Big Nosed

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Gray in a ropey headdress,
vertical pupil eyes, huge bent

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:15.080 align:middle line:84%
nose, holding a telepathic
communication rod at,

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.420 align:middle line:90%
I think it's White Sands.

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.730 align:middle line:84%
Others have said
Holloman Air Force Base.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.970 align:middle line:84%
But the date, I think
everyone agrees,

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:29.060 align:middle line:84%
was April 25, 1964, when the
US government had a meeting

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:33.090 align:middle line:90%
with Ebens and an Archquloid.

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:36.720 align:middle line:84%
On the right, carved
in ancient stone

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:41.570 align:middle line:84%
is the Sumerian sun-god
Shamash, it also in a ropey

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:45.960 align:middle line:84%
headdress as depicted
in Sumerian clay images.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.150 align:middle line:84%
The eyes have large
vertical pupils

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:50.670 align:middle line:90%
like a cat or an alligator.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:54.510 align:middle line:84%
The coiled rod is described
as a communication device,

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:58.590 align:middle line:84%
implying that rods in
Sumerian and Egyptian carvings

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:01.050 align:middle line:90%
were communication devices.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:05.040 align:middle line:84%
They were used by Archquloids
to manage and control

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:09.510 align:middle line:84%
the human creations and
workers specifically placed

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:12.970 align:middle line:90%
in Mesopotamia.

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:17.550 align:middle line:84%
If the March 1981 President
Reagan briefing is an accurate

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:21.840 align:middle line:84%
transcript, then the
very advanced Ebens

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:28.160 align:middle line:84%
turned Earth into a social
experiment very long ago.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.840 align:middle line:84%
But evolving primates
were deliberately

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:34.140 align:middle line:84%
kept ignorant of the
true bigger picture.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Government insiders
who caught on to what

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.370 align:middle line:90%
is really happening--

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:40.620 align:middle line:90%
they might be running scared.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps they have
come to understand

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:47.280 align:middle line:84%
that the Mesopotamian overlords
were actually Archquloids

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:53.040 align:middle line:84%
that humans worshipped as
Sumerian or Anunnaki gods.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Those rapid cycle clone
biological entities

00:16:56.670 --> 00:17:00.570 align:middle line:84%
were made by Ebens, according
to the Reagan briefing.

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And how ironic that the
Ebens made the Archquloids

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:09.089 align:middle line:84%
and then made Homo
sapien sapien, who

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:12.300 align:middle line:90%
worshipped the Archquloids.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Why did the Ebens put
the Big Nosed Archquloids

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:21.430 align:middle line:84%
in charge of this Planet
Earth social experiment?

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:25.030 align:middle line:84%
A third type of ET listed in
the President Reagan briefing

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:29.860 align:middle line:84%
at Camp David are
called Quadloids.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:34.150 align:middle line:84%
The Ebens also genetically
engineered these Quadloids

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:38.980 align:middle line:84%
by hybridizing praying mantis
and lizard-like creatures,

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:40.860 align:middle line:90%
according to the briefing.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And "quad" in Latin means
"four," so perhaps they

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:48.550 align:middle line:84%
are referring in
that name to the fact

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:52.990 align:middle line:84%
that these entities have only
four fingers and four toes.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Ebens allegedly placed
these genetically-engineered

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.590 align:middle line:84%
creatures on a planet
in the Zeta Reticuli

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:02.200 align:middle line:90%
binary solar system.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.560 align:middle line:84%
A fourth type are
called Heplaloids.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.620 align:middle line:84%
No details are given
about characteristics,

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.590 align:middle line:84%
but "hepla" in
Latin means "seven."

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:15.580 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that these are
some of the tall entities

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.960 align:middle line:90%
with white skin?

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.920 align:middle line:84%
They are allegedly
from the planet DAMCO

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.440 align:middle line:84%
near the Cygnus Arm
in a solar system that

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.140 align:middle line:90%
contains 11 planets?

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And DAMCO is described
as the fourth planet

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.953 align:middle line:90%
out from that sun.

00:18:30.953 --> 00:18:35.340 align:middle line:90%


00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:39.120 align:middle line:84%
The fifth on the list
are the Trantaloids,

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:42.510 align:middle line:84%
called "the dangerous
ones," and also known

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:49.020 align:middle line:84%
in the government as hostile
alien visitors, or HAVs.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:53.250 align:middle line:84%
They are allegedly from the
third planet in Epsilon Eridani

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:58.050 align:middle line:84%
solar system that is 10.5
light-years from Earth.

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And this information is
from this web transcript

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:07.380 align:middle line:84%
that everybody can go
to at www.serpo.org.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, returning to a piece
of the actual transcript

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:14.280 align:middle line:84%
of this briefing
for President Ronald

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Reagan in early March of
1981, one of the advisors

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:23.040 align:middle line:90%
from NSA, NRO, DIA--

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:27.430 align:middle line:84%
the intelligence groups--
is named Adviser Number 4.

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And he says, Mr.
President, the Trantaloids

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:38.580 align:middle line:84%
have strange materials, nothing
like those found on Earth.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And these aliens
can imitate humans.

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:46.710 align:middle line:90%
They can look like blond humans.

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:49.170 align:middle line:90%
However, they are not blond.

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:53.370 align:middle line:90%
They are ugly-looking insects.

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:56.550 align:middle line:84%
But they have the ability
to change their bodies.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:01.200 align:middle line:84%
They are 1,000 years ahead of
us in technology and probably

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.090 align:middle line:90%
every other science.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Their spaceships have a
forcefield around them.

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:11.730 align:middle line:84%
They can be shot down, but it
takes some doing on our part.

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:15.390 align:middle line:84%
We know, or we can
recognize, their language,

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:19.080 align:middle line:84%
which is entirely
different than the Ebens.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.110 align:middle line:84%
They use a very high
band radio system,

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:23.910 align:middle line:84%
but they have
different frequencies

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:28.530 align:middle line:84%
and it is difficult for NSA,
the National Security Agency,

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:31.140 align:middle line:90%
to track them.

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.410 align:middle line:84%
So according to the Serpo
leaks, the big picture

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:37.830 align:middle line:84%
is Ebens, with their
genetically-created Big Nosed

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:40.260 align:middle line:84%
Archquloids,
four-fingered praying

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:43.290 align:middle line:84%
mantis and lizard
Quadloids, plus perhaps

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:46.050 align:middle line:90%
some type of tall Haplaloids.

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:48.720 align:middle line:84%
But apparently,
the Ebens warned us

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.570 align:middle line:84%
about the dangerous
insect Trantaloids

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:54.330 align:middle line:90%
from Epsilon Eridani.

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:57.240 align:middle line:84%
All these ETs are very
skilled with making

00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:01.290 align:middle line:84%
cloned biological entities,
including the assertion

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:05.530 align:middle line:84%
that the Ebens also made
Homo sapiens sapien,

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:09.300 align:middle line:84%
our current container
model of humanity.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Ebens genetically
create all kinds

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:16.080 align:middle line:84%
of organic containers
with DNA manipulation

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:20.460 align:middle line:84%
to do work for them on various
planets, including Earth.

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Those Eben-created androids
have included praying

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:27.120 align:middle line:90%
mantis and reptilian humanoids.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:32.190 align:middle line:84%
But who are the so-called
Blonde Swedes or Nordics?

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:36.240 align:middle line:84%
What is their relationship
to the Ebens or Trantaloids?

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.880 align:middle line:84%
There is one startling
answer, perhaps,

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:43.710 align:middle line:84%
to that mystery in the President
Reagan briefing in March 1981

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:46.320 align:middle line:84%
that adviser Number
4 talks in more

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:53.495 align:middle line:84%
detail about the technology
of the dangerous Trantaloids.

00:21:53.495 --> 00:21:57.190 align:middle line:84%
"Mr. President, in
their technology,

00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:01.510 align:middle line:84%
which is at least 1,000 years
more advanced than ours,

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:05.530 align:middle line:84%
the Trantaloids have different
materials to work with.

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Some of their materials
are not found on Earth.

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they have more
than 104 elements

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:15.460 align:middle line:84%
that are different than
ours, very strange materials.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.250 align:middle line:90%
These aliens can imitate humans.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.750 align:middle line:90%
They can look like blond humans.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:22.120 align:middle line:90%
And they are not blond.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.610 align:middle line:90%
They are ugly-looking insects.

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:27.700 align:middle line:84%
They can imitate
looking like humans.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:31.450 align:middle line:84%
So which blonde Nordics
might be camouflage

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:35.890 align:middle line:84%
for insect Trantaloids that
President Reagan was told were

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:39.151 align:middle line:90%
actually dangerous insects?

00:22:39.151 --> 00:22:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Or are some blondes and
red-haired beings trying

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.040 align:middle line:84%
to help android humanity,
such as the archangel Michael,

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.970 align:middle line:84%
who historically has fought
off dragons and serpents?

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:56.740 align:middle line:84%
I was also told that about
2,500 years ago, the Ebens

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:59.590 align:middle line:84%
genetically experimented
with DNA changes

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:03.550 align:middle line:84%
in humans living in
Bhutan, Tibet, and Nepal.

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:06.760 align:middle line:84%
The result was that some
of those altered humans

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.370 align:middle line:84%
were transplanted
to Central America,

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:12.700 align:middle line:84%
specifically the
Mayans that were

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:16.060 align:middle line:84%
related to that genetic
experimentation.

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And that comes from
a Washington source.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.770 align:middle line:84%
My Washington
military source back

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:26.320 align:middle line:84%
in 1983, who told me that the
Ebens made us and put us here,

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.110 align:middle line:90%
they watch us live and grow--

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:32.230 align:middle line:84%
they've been here since at
least the time of the dinosaur

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:36.520 align:middle line:84%
origin some 250 million
years ago, maybe older.

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:40.540 align:middle line:84%
He told me that he had read a
government classified report

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:45.580 align:middle line:84%
that the Ebens collected one
of each species of dinosaur

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:48.970 align:middle line:84%
and placed them either
in one big planetary zoo

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:51.460 align:middle line:90%
or on different planets.

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:53.350 align:middle line:84%
I ask him what
happened that caused

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:56.450 align:middle line:84%
almost total annihilation
of Earth life,

00:23:56.450 --> 00:24:00.745 align:middle line:84%
including the wipeout of the
dinosaurs 65 million years ago.

00:24:00.745 --> 00:24:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is what he said, quote,
"I read in the Yellow Book

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:10.060 align:middle line:84%
that an Eben three-dimensional
history of Earth

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:16.300 align:middle line:84%
shows that the Ebens knew back
then, 65 million years ago,

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:20.290 align:middle line:84%
that a very large asteroid
was going to hit the Earth.

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:23.950 align:middle line:84%
The Ebens wrote that they were
saving one of each species that

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:25.850 align:middle line:90%
was on this planet--

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:30.460 align:middle line:84%
not just the dinosaurs,
but the ants, insects,

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:34.080 align:middle line:90%
flies, snakes, fish.

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.550 align:middle line:84%
The Ebens said they
took one of everything

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:41.460 align:middle line:84%
to save all the species
before the asteroid hit."

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:45.990 align:middle line:84%
So I said, it's a
Noah's ark rescue story.

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:48.510 align:middle line:90%
And he said, that's right.

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And I guess they've
experimented with life forms

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:54.840 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth ever since.

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:58.920 align:middle line:84%
But what bothers us is that
the Ebens can do most anything

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.310 align:middle line:90%
they want.

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:04.870 align:middle line:84%
They could have evaporated that
asteroid, even if it was big.

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:06.550 align:middle line:90%
But they didn't.

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean the
Ebens wanted to get rid

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:13.130 align:middle line:90%
of their dinosaur experiment?

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And what came next was
the rise of mammals.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:20.290 align:middle line:90%
Humans are primate mammals.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And the question we both talked
about without a clear answer

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:28.790 align:middle line:84%
was, would the
Ebens save us humans

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:33.210 align:middle line:84%
now if a big asteroid
was headed for Earth?

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:36.310 align:middle line:84%
In the 1990s, I
was told that MJ12

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:39.700 align:middle line:84%
had evolved to a different
letter number code that

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:44.050 align:middle line:84%
began E2, perhaps related
to an alleged black budget

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:48.970 align:middle line:84%
military organization with
a Defense Department called

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:57.850 align:middle line:84%
E2 SCD, stands for the
Extraterrestrial Space Command

00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:00.430 align:middle line:90%
Directorate.

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the letter
number name is now

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:06.490 align:middle line:84%
as we head toward the
middle of the 21st century,

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:07.930 align:middle line:84%
I would like to
share what I think

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:10.970 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
important leaked documents.

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:15.730 align:middle line:84%
It is another executive briefing
for an unnamed president

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:21.160 align:middle line:84%
on the subject of Project
Aquarius, top secret.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.730 align:middle line:84%
The next page is entitled
"Executive Briefing,"

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:28.000 align:middle line:84%
perhaps meaning it has been
used for American presidential

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.440 align:middle line:90%
briefings.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:33.070 align:middle line:84%
This is another page
classified TS/ORCON.

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:37.000 align:middle line:84%
In June 1947, a civilian
pilot flying over the Cascade

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Mountains in Washington state
observed nine flying disks,

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:44.140 align:middle line:90%
later referred to as UFOs.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:47.140 align:middle line:84%
The Commander, Air Technical
Intelligence Center

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:50.980 align:middle line:84%
of the then-Army Air
Force, became concerned

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.350 align:middle line:90%
and ordered an inquiry.

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:56.890 align:middle line:84%
This was the beginning of
the United States involvement

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:59.530 align:middle line:90%
with UFO investigations.

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:00.770 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:01.570 align:middle line:90%
It was earlier.

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:04.900 align:middle line:84%
But this is what
they're saying formally.

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:09.550 align:middle line:84%
In 1947, an aircraft of
extraterrestrial origin

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:12.460 align:middle line:84%
crashed in the
desert of New Mexico.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.520 align:middle line:84%
The craft was recovered
by the military.

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:19.960 align:middle line:84%
Four alien non-homo
sapiens bodies

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.300 align:middle line:90%
were recovered in the wreckage.

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:25.240 align:middle line:84%
The aliens were found to
be creatures not related

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.860 align:middle line:90%
to human beings.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:30.400 align:middle line:84%
See attachment one, which is
not included with this leaked

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.170 align:middle line:90%
Project Aquarius document.

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:35.850 align:middle line:84%
That would have
been photographs.

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:39.750 align:middle line:84%
In late 1949, another
alien aircraft

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:43.950 align:middle line:84%
crashed in the United States and
was recovered partially intact

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:45.870 align:middle line:90%
by the military.

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:48.660 align:middle line:84%
One alien of
extraterrestrial origin

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:51.990 align:middle line:90%
survived that crash in 1949.

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:56.940 align:middle line:84%
The surviving alien was
male and called itself EBE.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.250 align:middle line:84%
The alien was
thoroughly interrogated

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.470 align:middle line:84%
by military
intelligence personnel

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:04.170 align:middle line:90%
at a base in New Mexico.

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:06.450 align:middle line:84%
The alien's language
was translated

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:09.330 align:middle line:90%
by means of picture graphs.

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:13.320 align:middle line:84%
It was learned the
alien came from a planet

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:18.660 align:middle line:84%
in the Zeta Reticuli star system
approximately 40 light-years

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:20.550 align:middle line:90%
from Earth.

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:25.080 align:middle line:84%
EBE lived until June
18, 1952, when he

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:28.350 align:middle line:90%
died of an unexplained illness.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:31.480 align:middle line:84%
During the time
period EBE was alive,

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:36.030 align:middle line:84%
he provided valuable information
regarding space technology,

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:41.130 align:middle line:84%
origins of the universe,
and exobiological matters,

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:44.370 align:middle line:84%
meaning other life
in the cosmos.

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:48.300 align:middle line:84%
Further data is contained
in attachment two,

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:53.130 align:middle line:84%
which is also not included
in this leaked document.

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:56.100 align:middle line:84%
The next page, also
classified TS/ORCON,

00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:01.860 align:middle line:84%
states, "The recovery of Alien
aircraft led the United States

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.860 align:middle line:84%
on an extensive
investigative program

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:08.340 align:middle line:84%
to determine whether these
aliens posed a direct threat

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:10.860 align:middle line:90%
to our national security."

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:14.430 align:middle line:84%
In 1947, the newly
created Air Force

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:17.520 align:middle line:84%
initiated a program
to investigate

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.100 align:middle line:90%
incidents involving UFOs.

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:23.850 align:middle line:84%
The program was operated under
three different code names--

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Grudge, Sign, and
finally, Blue Book.

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.680 align:middle line:84%
The original mission of
the Air Force program

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:36.670 align:middle line:84%
was to collect and analyze all
reported sightings or incidents

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:40.840 align:middle line:84%
involving UFOs, and determine
whether the information could

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:44.260 align:middle line:84%
be interpreted as having
any bearing on the security

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.060 align:middle line:90%
of the United States.

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Some information was
evaluated with the idea

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:51.970 align:middle line:84%
of using the gained data
to advance our own space

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:54.330 align:middle line:84%
technology and future
space programs.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:57.060 align:middle line:90%


00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Of the estimated 12,000 reports
analyzed by the Air Force

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:05.520 align:middle line:84%
were considered hoaxes,
explained aerial phenomena,

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.610 align:middle line:90%
or natural astronomical objects.

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:13.260 align:middle line:84%
The other 10% were considered
legitimate aliens sightings

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:15.270 align:middle line:90%
and/or incidents.

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:19.200 align:middle line:84%
However, not all UFO
sightings or incidents

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:22.950 align:middle line:84%
were reported under
the Air Force program.

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:26.010 align:middle line:84%
In 1953, Project
Gleem was initiated

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:29.730 align:middle line:84%
by order of President
Eisenhower, who

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:34.830 align:middle line:84%
believed the UFOs presented a
threat to the national security

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:37.650 align:middle line:90%
of the United States.

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Project Gleem, which became
Project Aquarius in 1966,

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:49.050 align:middle line:84%
was a parallel reporting system
for UFO sightings and incidents

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:53.490 align:middle line:84%
that you could say were real, as
opposed to those being parceled

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:58.140 align:middle line:84%
out to Project Blue Book,
which had another reason.

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:00.780 align:middle line:84%
Reports collected
under Project Aquarius

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:06.210 align:middle line:84%
were considered actual sightings
of Alien aircraft or contacts

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:08.460 align:middle line:90%
with Alien Life Forms.

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Most reports were made by
reliable military and defense

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.840 align:middle line:90%
department civilian personnel.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.210 align:middle line:84%
The next page of the
Aquarius document

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:22.500 align:middle line:84%
classified TS/ORCON
says in 1958,

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:26.100 align:middle line:84%
the United States recovered
a third alien aircraft

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.870 align:middle line:90%
from the desert of Utah.

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:31.680 align:middle line:84%
The aircraft was in
excellent flying condition.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.870 align:middle line:84%
The aircraft was
apparently abandoned

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:37.800 align:middle line:84%
by the aliens for some
unexplainable reason,

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.380 align:middle line:84%
since no alien
lifeforms were found

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:43.270 align:middle line:90%
in or around the aircraft.

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:46.840 align:middle line:84%
That aircraft was considered
a technological marvel

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.320 align:middle line:90%
by United States scientists.

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.450 align:middle line:84%
However, the operating
instrumentations

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:57.490 align:middle line:84%
of the aircraft were so complex
that our scientists could not

00:31:57.490 --> 00:32:02.350 align:middle line:84%
interrupt their operation,
meaning stop or start or use.

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:05.920 align:middle line:84%
The aircraft was stored
in a top security area

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.840 align:middle line:84%
and analyzed
throughout the years

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.270 align:middle line:84%
by our best
aerospace scientists.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And I am told that that is
a letter-number location

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:17.260 align:middle line:90%
in the state of Utah.

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:21.240 align:middle line:84%
The United States gained a large
volume of technological data

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.790 align:middle line:84%
from the recovered
Alien aircraft.

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:26.220 align:middle line:84%
A detailed description
and further information

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:29.700 align:middle line:84%
regarding the aircraft is
explained in attachment three,

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:33.840 align:middle line:84%
not included in this
leaked document.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:37.230 align:middle line:84%
The next page is
entitled "Sub Projects

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:39.450 align:middle line:90%
Under Project Aquarias."

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Paragraph one, Top Secret ORCON,
Project Bando, Proword Risk.

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Originally established
in 1949, its mission

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:52.500 align:middle line:84%
was to collect and evaluate
medical information

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:55.440 align:middle line:84%
from the surviving Alien
creature and the recovered

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.300 align:middle line:90%
Alien bodies.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.880 align:middle line:84%
This project
medically examined EBE

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.180 align:middle line:84%
and provided United
States medical researchers

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:08.290 align:middle line:84%
with certain answers to
the evolutionary theory.

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:14.160 align:middle line:84%
OPR CIA was the category
responsible that

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.520 align:middle line:90%
was terminated in 1974.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Paragraph two, TS/ORCON,
Project Sigma, Proword Midnight.

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:25.620 align:middle line:84%
This was originally
established as part

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:28.620 align:middle line:90%
of Project Gleam in 1954.

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:32.490 align:middle line:84%
This became a separate
project in 1976

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:36.390 align:middle line:84%
its mission was to establish
communication with aliens.

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:39.270 align:middle line:84%
This project met
with positive success

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:44.040 align:middle line:84%
when in 1959, the United
States established

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:47.370 align:middle line:84%
primitive communications
with the aliens.

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:53.850 align:middle line:84%
On April 26, 1964, a US Air
Force intelligence officer

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:56.850 align:middle line:84%
met two aliens at a
prearranged location

00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:58.890 align:middle line:90%
in the desert of New Mexico--

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:00.990 align:middle line:90%
this is what I was shown--

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:08.070 align:middle line:84%
at Kirtland Air Force Base on
April 9, 1983 about this event.

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:11.905 align:middle line:84%
The contact lasted for
approximately three hours.

00:34:11.905 --> 00:34:16.650 align:middle line:84%
It was based on the alien's
language given to us by EBE.

00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:20.340 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force officer managed
to exchange basic information

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.100 align:middle line:90%
with the two aliens.

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Attachment seven,
also not included

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:29.760 align:middle line:84%
in this leaked document-- that
would be photographs and film.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.760 align:middle line:84%
This project is continuing
at an Air Force Base

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.638 align:middle line:90%
in New Mexico, OPR MJ12/NSA.

00:34:35.638 --> 00:34:40.070 align:middle line:90%


00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:44.380 align:middle line:84%
This paragraph three is
TS/ORCON, Project Snowbird,

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:46.730 align:middle line:90%
Proword Cetus.

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:50.810 align:middle line:84%
Originally established
in 1972, its mission

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:54.650 align:middle line:84%
was to test fly a
recovered Alien aircraft.

00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:57.680 align:middle line:84%
This project is
continuing in Nevada

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:03.980 align:middle line:84%
under OPR, US Air Force,
NASA, CIA, and MJ12.

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Paragraph four-- TS/ORCON
Project Pounce, Proword Dixie.

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Originally established
in 1968, its mission

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:21.170 align:middle line:84%
was to evaluate all UFO
IAC, which is the identified

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:25.940 align:middle line:84%
aerial craft that our government
knows are extraterrestrials.

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:32.240 align:middle line:84%
All UFO IAC information
pertaining to space technology.

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:39.770 align:middle line:84%
Project Pounce continues
with OPR, NASA, US Air Force.

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:41.780 align:middle line:90%
The next page begins TS/ORCON.

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Several independent
scientific investigations,

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:49.580 align:middle line:84%
at the request of the
Air Force and CIA,

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:53.130 align:middle line:84%
were initiated during the
era of Project Blue Book.

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:56.690 align:middle line:84%
MJ12 decided that officially,
the Air Force should end

00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:59.570 align:middle line:90%
their investigation of UFOs.

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:02.630 align:middle line:84%
This decision was
arrived at during the--

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and there is a word
that's not readable--

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:06.920 align:middle line:90%
a meeting.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And this was an attachment
four, that also was not

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:11.400 align:middle line:84%
included in this
leaked document,

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:15.420 align:middle line:84%
but that the meeting
was held in 1966.

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:18.190 align:middle line:90%
The reason was twofold.

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:21.180 align:middle line:84%
First, the United States had
established communication

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.590 align:middle line:90%
with the aliens.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:24.960 align:middle line:84%
The United States
felt relatively sure

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:28.470 align:middle line:84%
the aliens' exploration of
earth was non-aggressive,

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:32.580 align:middle line:84%
at least the Ebens, and
that they were not hostile.

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps they didn't know
about the dangerous insect

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Trantaloids at
that time in 1966.

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:42.780 align:middle line:84%
It was also established that
the aliens' presence did not

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:46.050 align:middle line:84%
directly threaten the
security of the United States

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:47.740 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, the
public was beginning

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:53.160 align:middle line:90%
to believe that UFOs were real.

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:57.660 align:middle line:84%
The National Security Council
felt this public feeling could

00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:00.750 align:middle line:90%
lead to a nationwide panic.

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:04.350 align:middle line:84%
The United States was involved
in several sensitive projects

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:07.810 align:middle line:84%
during this time
period, so it was

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:11.170 align:middle line:84%
felt the public awareness
of these projects

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:14.140 align:middle line:84%
would have jeopardized
the future space

00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:18.550 align:middle line:84%
program of the United States,
meaning if it were made public.

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, MJ12 decided that
an independent scientific study

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:28.690 align:middle line:84%
of UFO phenomena would be needed
to satisfy public curiosity.

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:31.540 align:middle line:84%
The final official study
of the UFO phenomena

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:34.750 align:middle line:84%
was accomplished by the
University of Colorado

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:37.210 align:middle line:90%
under Air Force contract.

00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And this was the very
controversial Condon report

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:44.770 align:middle line:84%
that inside researchers
say was deliberately

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:48.100 align:middle line:84%
concocted to keep the
media and the public

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:52.360 align:middle line:84%
from serious interest in the
UFO alien presence on Earth,

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and to take away heat from the
Air Force and the government.

00:37:56.830 --> 00:38:00.910 align:middle line:84%
That Condon study concluded
that sufficient data did not

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:04.720 align:middle line:84%
exist that would indicate
UFOs threatened the security

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.580 align:middle line:90%
of the United States.

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:09.640 align:middle line:84%
The final conclusion
satisfied the government

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:13.030 align:middle line:84%
and allowed the Air Force
to officially step out

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:17.260 align:middle line:84%
of the UFO
investigating business.

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:19.920 align:middle line:90%
This page, TS/ORCON--

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.410 align:middle line:84%
"When the Air Force
officially closed

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Project Blue Book in December
1969, Project Aquarius--

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:30.780 align:middle line:84%
this document--
continued operation

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:36.000 align:middle line:84%
under control of the National
Security Council and MJ12."

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.750 align:middle line:84%
The NSC felt investigations
of UFO sightings and incidents

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:45.150 align:middle line:84%
had to continue in secrecy,
without any public knowledge.

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:49.000 align:middle line:84%
The reasoning behind
the decision was this.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.230 align:middle line:84%
If the Air Force continued
its investigation of UFOs,

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:57.850 align:middle line:84%
eventually some uncleared and
unbriefed Air Force or Defense

00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:01.540 align:middle line:84%
Department civilian officials
would obtain these facts

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:03.910 align:middle line:90%
behind Project Aquarias.

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, for
operational security reasons,

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:09.730 align:middle line:90%
this cannot be allowed.

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:13.000 align:middle line:84%
In order to continue the
investigation of UFO sightings

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.790 align:middle line:84%
and incidents in secrecy,
investigators from CIA, DCD,

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:23.320 align:middle line:84%
and MJ12 were assigned to
military and other governmental

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:29.530 align:middle line:84%
agencies with orders to
investigate all legitimate UFO

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:34.680 align:middle line:90%
IAC sightings and incidents.

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:40.050 align:middle line:84%
These agents are presently
operating at various locations

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:42.990 align:middle line:84%
throughout the United
States and Canada.

00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:47.670 align:middle line:84%

00:39:57.150 --> 00:40:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Note, aliens have been
extremely interested

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:02.970 align:middle line:84%
in our nuclear weapons
and nuclear research.

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Many reported military
sightings and incidents occur

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:09.150 align:middle line:90%
over nuclear weapon bases.

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:12.480 align:middle line:84%
The aliens' interest
in our nuclear weapons

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:15.450 align:middle line:84%
can only be attributed
to the future threat

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:18.540 align:middle line:90%
of a nuclear war on Earth.

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:21.030 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force have
initiated measures

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:24.540 align:middle line:84%
to assure the security
of the nuclear weapons

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:30.560 align:middle line:90%
from alien theft or destruction.

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.980 align:middle line:84%
MJ12 feels confident
the aliens are

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:37.940 align:middle line:84%
on an exploration of our solar
system for peaceful purposes,

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:40.010 align:middle line:90%
at least the Ebens.

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:43.130 align:middle line:84%
However, we must continue
to observe and track

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:46.880 align:middle line:84%
the aliens' movement
until it is determined

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.460 align:middle line:84%
that the aliens'
future plans contain

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:52.210 align:middle line:84%
no threat to our
national security

00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:55.250 align:middle line:90%
or the civilization of Earth.

This near-final page
classified TS/ORCON states,

00:41:01.686 --> 00:41:04.360 align:middle line:84%
"Most governmental
documents pertaining

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:08.230 align:middle line:84%
to UFO sightings, incidents,
and governmental policies,

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:10.600 align:middle line:84%
including Project
Blue Book, have

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:13.330 align:middle line:84%
been released to the

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:19.930 align:middle line:84%
MJ12 felt the remaining
documents of information,

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:23.620 align:middle line:84%
not relating to Project
Aquarius but relating

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:28.780 align:middle line:84%
to technological facts regarding
alien medical matters, the fact

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:32.980 align:middle line:84%
that an Alien was captured alive
and survived for three years

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:34.210 align:middle line:90%
under secrecy--

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:37.450 align:middle line:84%
and I know that
was at Los Alamos--

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:41.920 align:middle line:84%
this cannot be released to the
public for fear the information

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:49.120 align:middle line:84%
would be obtained by SHIS,"
an acronym that is still not

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:51.740 align:middle line:90%
clearly identified.

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:54.920 align:middle line:84%
There was other information
obtained from EBE

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:58.730 align:middle line:84%
that was deemed sensitive and
not releasable to the public.

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:03.390 align:middle line:84%
Notably, Project
Aquarius Volume 9,

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:07.250 align:middle line:84%
which pertains to tracing
the aliens' first visitation

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:10.730 align:middle line:90%
of earth back some 5,000 years.

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:15.180 align:middle line:84%
I will also insert that I
think that that is not correct.

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:18.380 align:middle line:84%
I have been told
by a DIA source--

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:22.790 align:middle line:84%
privately, confidentially,
anonymously--

00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:27.110 align:middle line:84%
that our government now
in this 21st century

00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:32.180 align:middle line:84%
has proof that three competing
extraterrestrial biological

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:35.690 align:middle line:84%
groups have been
terraforming and harvesting

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:43.010 align:middle line:84%
genetic material from our planet
for at least 270 million years,

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:46.310 align:middle line:84%
from before the time
of the dinosaurs.

00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:49.460 align:middle line:84%
But continuing with
this Project Aquarius,

00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:53.330 align:middle line:84%
obviously written politically
for a presidential briefing--

00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:56.660 align:middle line:84%
and not telling the
president everything either--

00:42:56.660 --> 00:43:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Iba reported that 2,000
years ago, his ancestors

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:04.610 align:middle line:84%
planted a human
creature on Earth

00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:07.190 align:middle line:84%
to assist the
inhabitants of Earth

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:09.530 align:middle line:90%
in developing civilization.

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:13.670 align:middle line:84%
This information was only
vague, and the exact identity

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:17.810 align:middle line:84%
or background of this
information on this homosapien

00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:20.210 align:middle line:90%
was not obtained.

00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Undoubtfully-- that is a
word in this document--

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:27.140 align:middle line:84%
if this information was
released to the public,

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:31.160 align:middle line:84%
it would cause a
worldwide religious panic.

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:35.540 align:middle line:84%
MJ3 has developed a plan that
will allow release of Project

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:39.380 align:middle line:90%
Aquarius Volumes 1 through 3.

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:43.400 align:middle line:84%
The release program calls for a
gradual release of information

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:46.940 align:middle line:84%
over a period of time in
order to condition the public

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:50.240 align:middle line:90%
for future disclosures.

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Attachment five of this briefing
contains certain guidelines

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:57.950 align:middle line:90%
for future public releases.

The last page of
the linked Aquarius

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:03.990 align:middle line:90%
documents states, TS/ORCON--

00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:07.730 align:middle line:90%
"In the 1976 MJ3 report--

00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:10.460 align:middle line:84%
and this is in attachment
six, which is not included

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:12.920 align:middle line:90%
in my leaked document--

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:16.430 align:middle line:84%
it was estimated the
aliens' technology was

00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:21.560 align:middle line:84%
many thousands of years ahead
of United States technology."

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Our scientists speculate that
until our technology develops

00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:32.060 align:middle line:84%
to a level equal to the aliens,
we cannot understand the large

00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:37.070 align:middle line:84%
volume of scientific information
the United States has already

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:40.100 align:middle line:90%
gained from the aliens.

00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:42.860 align:middle line:84%
This advancement of
United States technology

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:49.160 align:middle line:90%
may take many hundreds of years.

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:53.860 align:middle line:84%
