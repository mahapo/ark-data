>> With me today on this
"Truth Hunter" special is Tim,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.890 align:middle line:10%
a tactical advisor to
covert German analysts,

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.790 align:middle line:10%
trying to understand the
missions and strategies

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.950 align:middle line:10%
of nonhuman intelligences on our
planet, in this solar system,

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.060 align:middle line:10%
and beyond.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.310 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to "Truth Hunter."

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Linda.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>> You have talked
about Being 6.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.500 align:middle line:90%
And it's B-E-I-N-G 6.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And you have talked
about a level

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.080 align:middle line:84%
of seven frequencies
in which there

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.060 align:middle line:90%
are various consciousnesses.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.200 align:middle line:84%
Have you worked
directly with Being 6?

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And what is it that
you would define

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.310 align:middle line:90%
as being in that level 6?

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And what exactly is Being 6's
relationship with us on Earth?

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so Being 6 is a
consciousness being that used

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.330 align:middle line:90%
to be on level 6 consciousness.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a so-called
mindset being, which

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.110 align:middle line:84%
means that you as a observer,
as a consciousness unit,

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.260 align:middle line:84%
you have to make a
willingful decision in order

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:84%
to commit your life
and your soul way

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.200 align:middle line:90%
to a certain destination.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And Being 6 is a combination
of different individuals,

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.720 align:middle line:84%
of different collective
memories, of different species,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.070 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so on.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.410 align:middle line:84%
So there's no cohesiveness
inside of this world.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:57.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a destination, so to speak,
where everyone in this universe

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.590 align:middle line:84%
can find their own
home, be individually.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.470 align:middle line:84%
But everyone commits to
the idea that because we

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.760 align:middle line:84%
are all different aspects
of the same being,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.390 align:middle line:84%
that we commit ourselves to
a certain point of harmony,

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.650 align:middle line:90%
of cooperation, and so forth.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>> But what happens when you are
in some kind of communication

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.550 align:middle line:90%
with Being 6?

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.640 align:middle line:84%
If I were seeing you in
communication with Being 6,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.960 align:middle line:84%
would it be you standing,
talking to air, space?

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.850 align:middle line:90%
Or is there a light?

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.050 align:middle line:90%
Or is there a being?

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.100 align:middle line:90%
Or what is there?

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>> If you think about these
containers that I was talking

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.060 align:middle line:84%
about, these containers were not
only used for the meetings with

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.780 align:middle line:84%
the Greys and potentially
for meetings with other

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.130 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial lifeforms.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.570 align:middle line:84%
But it can also be used in order
to compress certain frequencies

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.510 align:middle line:84%
inside of these
containers in order

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.050 align:middle line:84%
to make it possible that
through compressed frequencies,

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.250 align:middle line:84%
you can have a direct
face-to-face interaction

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.670 align:middle line:84%
with a consciousness
life form that

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.310 align:middle line:84%
is on a different
plane of reality.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>> And what do you see?

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Good question.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.380 align:middle line:84%
So what I did perceive was
a very crisp blue light

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.610 align:middle line:84%
that was just hovering
on my eye level.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.950 align:middle line:90%
It's a very crisp blue light.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And the best I could explain
it is like a crystalline moving

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.330 align:middle line:90%
form or something.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And I asked the tech guy
why it is a blue light.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And, also, I've been
explained, and I've also

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.650 align:middle line:84%
observed that many times,
that different people

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.640 align:middle line:84%
with different
cultural backgrounds,

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.780 align:middle line:84%
different experiences,
or different expectations

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.570 align:middle line:84%
see and interpret
this data differently.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.490 align:middle line:84%
So not all of those who
have interacted with Being 6

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.820 align:middle line:90%
see a blue crystalline form.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Some see a human form,
which is just blue skin.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.570 align:middle line:90%
But it's always blue.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.940 align:middle line:84%
So some see other things, but
they still have a bluish skin,

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.210 align:middle line:90%
like a blue light.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And I asked the
tech guy why that

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.940 align:middle line:84%
is because I was
wondering why people

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.920 align:middle line:84%
have so many
different experiences,

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.240 align:middle line:90%
but it's always a blue light.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
that is he told

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.350 align:middle line:84%
me is that when
frequencies get compressed,

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.270 align:middle line:90%
the wavelengths alter.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And you have either a
tendency towards a red light

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.160 align:middle line:84%
or a blue light because those
have different wavelengths

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.110 align:middle line:90%
and different frequencies.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.760 align:middle line:84%
As I have experienced
like a crystalline form,

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.460 align:middle line:84%
the one thing that I
found very interesting

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.780 align:middle line:84%
is that we have all these
different historical

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.160 align:middle line:84%
relationships to
blue beings, thinking

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.440 align:middle line:84%
of India and the Vedas,
where you have a blue--

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Krishna.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Krishna.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.760 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And we see that in different
parts of the world as well.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.740 align:middle line:10%
So we have Mesopotamia
and Egypt where

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.340 align:middle line:10%
we have statues, where you can
see pigments of blue color.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>> But does that mean that then
the beings from frequency 6

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.000 align:middle line:84%
would have been based on
the Earth in a matter form?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.380 align:middle line:90%
And how would they do that?

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>> What has been explained
to me is that we have natural

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.130 align:middle line:84%
occurring rivers of
frequency around this planet.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And at certain
points of the planet,

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.340 align:middle line:84%
frequencies are
naturally compressed.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And those places,
when you meditate,

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.870 align:middle line:84%
there might be a chance
that the frequencies are so

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.170 align:middle line:84%
compressed that you have
direct experience with one

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.270 align:middle line:84%
of these higher
frequential beings,

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.260 align:middle line:84%
especially at certain
times, thinking of equinox

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.680 align:middle line:84%
in the year where those
frequencies get naturally

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.490 align:middle line:90%
compressed.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you were picking a
blue that all of us might know,

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.490 align:middle line:84%
what is the blue that
you saw in that light?

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, it's almost
like the blue of this cup.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Which is like a teal.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a teal.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.770 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting
thing to me is

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.610 align:middle line:84%
that when you look at
this 3D perspective,

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:17.360 align:middle line:84%
it appears kind of blurry to
me compared to the crisp light

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.430 align:middle line:90%
that Being 6 irradiated.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.270 align:middle line:84%
It's just as if you're
looking at a super 4K

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.900 align:middle line:84%
television compared
to, say, a television

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.670 align:middle line:90%
from the '90s or something.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.160 align:middle line:84%
So the frequencies
compressed are

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.880 align:middle line:84%
so bright and crisp
that a thought like,

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.400 align:middle line:84%
this is like a higher
resolution image

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.170 align:middle line:90%
compared to anything else.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:45.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it interests me that in
2020 to 2021 was the first time

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:51.150 align:middle line:84%
I was introduced through
some people who would have,

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.340 align:middle line:84%
let's say, military or aerospace
knowledge here in the United

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.320 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was about
teal, blue beings

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:06.680 align:middle line:84%
that have been drawn for
me to use in a program.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And they communicated
with me that they

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.290 align:middle line:84%
were shocked that I
had this illustration

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.980 align:middle line:84%
of these teal, blue
beings because nobody

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.040 align:middle line:90%
is supposed to know about them.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And now in dialogue
with you, is it possible

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:31.190 align:middle line:84%
that it is the seven frequencies
that Being 6 is like a teal?

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And that the frequency of 6 is
interacting with our planet,

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.990 align:middle line:84%
that officials and
authorities know,

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.720 align:middle line:84%
but they don't want
anybody else to know?

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know if officials
don't want that out there,

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.020 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.170 align:middle line:84%
but what's for certain
is that Being 6

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:55.850 align:middle line:84%
has been communicating
with Earth over at least

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:59.000 align:middle line:84%
20,000 years, maybe
from the beginning

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.070 align:middle line:84%
on because at level 6 frequency,
we don't have time in the sense

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:05.640 align:middle line:90%
we do have here.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.110 align:middle line:84%
So, basically, it's
outside of time.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And we found that Being 6
collects a lot of different--

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.590 align:middle line:84%
contains a lot of species,
a lot of individuals,

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:21.440 align:middle line:84%
a lot of different
forms of life.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Everything you can imagine
is part of Being 6.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:29.840 align:middle line:84%
So you have an enormous mass of
consciousness units contained

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.809 align:middle line:84%
within this kind
of mindset being.

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you have any sense or
even maybe mental perspective

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:44.150 align:middle line:84%
on what Being 6 sees and
experiences in our 3D world?

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And why would it be
interacting here if it only

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.200 align:middle line:90%
appears as a blue light?

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So I do have a perspective
on how Being 6 perceives

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:56.990 align:middle line:90%
the world.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing is compared

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.370 align:middle line:84%
to the conversation
with the Greys,

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Being 6 has a very different
perspective of reality

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.520 align:middle line:84%
and a very different emphasis
and focus on what is important.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Like?

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Like, so the Grays have
this hands-on mentality,

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:20.450 align:middle line:84%
which means they intellectualize
things and like to find

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:21.300 align:middle line:90%
solutions.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.140 align:middle line:84%
That's why they, for
example, offer administration

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:28.640 align:middle line:84%
over certain parts of the galaxy
or even whole star systems

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.520 align:middle line:84%
or something in a very
hands-on mentality

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.410 align:middle line:90%
so that they put hybrids there.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:37.020 align:middle line:84%
They are certainly
invasive in many ways,

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:41.630 align:middle line:84%
in a way that they directly
interact with species.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Being 6 has a very philosophical
standpoint of view,

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:51.170 align:middle line:84%
which is very interesting
because compared to that--

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:55.250 align:middle line:84%
both perspectives
have a certain sense

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.470 align:middle line:90%
of what's wrong with Earth.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.080 align:middle line:84%
But if you're thinking
about the Greys,

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.500 align:middle line:84%
they think that all
the technology has not

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.550 align:middle line:84%
been used in order to sustain
a positive planet and--

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:09.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Compatibility with the Earth.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:12.200 align:middle line:84%
We end up making technologies
that they give us

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.150 align:middle line:90%
into weapons often.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so what they would
have loved to see is--

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.480 align:middle line:84%
and that's why they gave so
many technologies to humans--

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.660 align:middle line:84%
is use it, use the
technology for common good,

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:28.700 align:middle line:84%
and build your species around
that, compared to Being 6,

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.400 align:middle line:84%
they don't care
about technology.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.830 align:middle line:84%
They don't care
about certain things.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:38.330 align:middle line:84%
They have this sense that
the biggest problem on Earth

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:44.300 align:middle line:84%
is a disbalance between female
and male energies, which

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.670 align:middle line:90%
is a very different mindset.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And that might as
well be what people

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.730 align:middle line:84%
have these meditative
experiences maybe

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:55.640 align:middle line:84%
with different
beings and receive

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.630 align:middle line:90%
very impractical advices.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Give an example.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:05.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, like if you know who you
are, nothing can disturb you.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.700 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
unpractical advice

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:11.480 align:middle line:90%
on 3D level of consciousness.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.470 align:middle line:84%
It makes sense in a way
that when you have a level 6

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.390 align:middle line:84%
experience and
you overlook time,

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:20.300 align:middle line:84%
and you know that everything
is going to be all right, then

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:25.220 align:middle line:84%
of course, the illusion of
what we are experiencing here,

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:30.870 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't bother you because
you grew above that in a way.

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:34.310 align:middle line:84%
But once you are
in time and inside

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:39.410 align:middle line:84%
of some problematic
sociocultural system

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:44.720 align:middle line:84%
or something or even a universe
that has still open challenges,

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:49.670 align:middle line:84%
then problems actually
matter for a lot of people

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.060 align:middle line:90%
that receive those problems.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like from
a Being 6 perspective.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Explain how they would
look at the cycles of life

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.720 align:middle line:90%
and death in human life here.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.400 align:middle line:84%
From their perspective,
there's no difference anymore

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.730 align:middle line:84%
between being alive
and being dead.

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:14.020 align:middle line:84%
It's just a different
perception of reality

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:18.640 align:middle line:84%
where you are entering
from one situation

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.600 align:middle line:84%
into another situation, where
you can continue your life

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.060 align:middle line:84%
and continue
experiencing things.

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:30.850 align:middle line:84%
But on a 3D plane of
life, experiencing death

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:36.760 align:middle line:84%
is maybe way different
because you are

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.760 align:middle line:90%
so close to what's happening.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>> But why is it then that the
Greys would be preoccupied with

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:50.500 align:middle line:84%
keeping the souls of Homo
sapiens sapien with certain

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:55.180 align:middle line:84%
containers for a very specific
length of time as if there is

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:59.350 align:middle line:84%
something that the Greys are
either aware of or trying

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:05.890 align:middle line:84%
to accomplish with keeping souls
with certain body containers?

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:09.580 align:middle line:84%
That would seem that they are
concerned about what happens

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.010 align:middle line:90%
to the soul and the body.

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And would that be of
interest to Being 6 or not?

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So Being 6 made it very clear
that they do not think genetic

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:33.100 align:middle line:84%
modification is a practical good
thing to do because they say

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:39.040 align:middle line:84%
if the universe is let alone
and do its thing without

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.380 align:middle line:84%
manipulating things, then that's
the best experience you can

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:43.180 align:middle line:90%
have.

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:47.260 align:middle line:84%
Just let things come and
let things go in that way.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Also, relationships--
so I found it

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.260 align:middle line:84%
very interesting because
the Greys, they don't pair.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.530 align:middle line:10%
They don't have loving
relationships or something,

00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:01.090 align:middle line:10%
which is something that they are
interested in because on Earth,

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:05.620 align:middle line:10%
love, interest, and stuff is
true form and a true experience

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.960 align:middle line:10%
for humanity.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.770 align:middle line:84%
But the Greys,
certainly, were one

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:15.460 align:middle line:84%
of these influences that
have, for example, brought

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:20.140 align:middle line:84%
marriage to the
sociocultural system of Earth

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:23.980 align:middle line:84%
because what they like to
do is making contracts.

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So two consciousness
units or two aspects

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.090 align:middle line:84%
of the universe that commit
themselves to go together

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:34.075 align:middle line:84%
for a certain amount
of time, probably

00:14:34.075 --> 00:14:38.980 align:middle line:84%
a whole length of a lifespan,
might be very beneficial

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:43.540 align:middle line:84%
for them, too, because they
can train together and grow

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:47.020 align:middle line:84%
together and stuff, compared
to what Being 6 said,

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:53.350 align:middle line:84%
is that they would love to see
the natural cycles of coming

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:57.350 align:middle line:84%
and going determine the way
relationships look like.

00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:00.940 align:middle line:84%
So no marriage, no staying
together for too long.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Just let the energy
do the thing.

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:06.670 align:middle line:84%
That would be something
that they would love to see.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:11.080 align:middle line:84%
So they are so different
viewpoints on reality

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.130 align:middle line:90%
from one side to the other.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So what is the relationship
of the Grey world to the 6

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:23.090 align:middle line:90%
frequency to Being 6?

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:24.860 align:middle line:90%
Do they work together?

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.740 align:middle line:90%
Are they enemies?

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:27.850 align:middle line:90%
Are they friends?

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So one of the major
projects that have been done is

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:38.380 align:middle line:84%
to integrate warrior-type
species into Being 6.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:42.610 align:middle line:84%
So Being 6 is a mindset
being or a destination

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:46.630 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, if you want
to call it, where mostly--

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:51.730 align:middle line:84%
at that time, where only
very benevolent and loving,

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:56.890 align:middle line:84%
harmonious species, individuals,
collectives, and so on

00:15:56.890 --> 00:16:01.150 align:middle line:90%
and so forth were contained.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:04.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And that would mean then the
Earth would not be in so much

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.730 align:middle line:90%
conflict and violence and war?

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>> That would mean that they
don't have any clue about what

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.620 align:middle line:90%
it means to be competitive.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And that is, for example,
why so many advices

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:22.810 align:middle line:84%
from spiritual sites are
not practical compared

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:26.410 align:middle line:84%
to a situation where you
have a warrior-type species.

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Just as a metaphor, if you
have Jesus who is absolutely

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:36.970 align:middle line:84%
peaceful and Nietzsche
called him a failed way

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:42.100 align:middle line:84%
because in the end, Jesus didn't
succeed in bringing his message

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.620 align:middle line:84%
forward, because a
warrior-type species--

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:46.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Rome killed him.

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, in the long run,
Jesus would say in the end,

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.790 align:middle line:90%
everything is good.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:54.820 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't apply for
those people who are practically

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:55.900 align:middle line:90%
suffering in the now.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.330 align:middle line:84%
So that is basically
the difference.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And a Being 6 species
would always say,

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.230 align:middle line:84%
don't mind about the bad,
concentrate on the good,

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:07.780 align:middle line:90%
and don't fight.

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Just be and be happy
and harmonious.

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:15.609 align:middle line:84%
But then you have certain
species and aspects

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:16.609 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about this 95%
to 5%, which even is more--

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.220 align:middle line:84%
which is-- on the higher planes,
you have higher frequentials.

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.790 align:middle line:84%
You have even more
positive beings.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.670 align:middle line:84%
But you still have
a certain amount

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:33.460 align:middle line:84%
of beings that are
self-destructive.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So how is the universe
going to operate with

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.350 align:middle line:90%
self-destructiveness?

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And Being 6 certainly
is a being--

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:45.830 align:middle line:84%
used to be a being that had no
defensive mechanisms at all.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:51.640 align:middle line:84%
So a species that is well
invasive and destructive

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:56.680 align:middle line:84%
could easily try to invade
and take over Being 6.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And because it's so mild,
so harmonious, so positive,

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:06.050 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't have had any
chance to defend itself.

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, on the Earth, the
sad part is that the 5% end up

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:18.820 align:middle line:84%
holding hostage the other 95%
to the war and to the violence.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:25.630 align:middle line:10%
And it's as if I'm remembering
talking to somebody back

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:31.540 align:middle line:10%
in the early 1980s about MJ-12,
which, in the United States,

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.930 align:middle line:10%
was a group of men
that Truman assigned

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:40.800 align:middle line:10%
to try to deal with the
complications of UFOs and ETs.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And I was told that
each of those members

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.480 align:middle line:90%
was assigned different facets.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.150 align:middle line:90%
And one of them was MJ-8.

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And he was supposed
to be concentrating

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:58.050 align:middle line:84%
on the different types
of intelligences here

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:03.670 align:middle line:84%
and what they wanted and
what they wanted from us.

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And that the man who
was talking to me

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:08.680 align:middle line:90%
had had a discussion with him.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And the question was if there
are a variety of nonhumans--

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:27.020 align:middle line:84%
and Homo sapien is like
a baby species on Earth--

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:32.000 align:middle line:84%
how do we get a perspective
on which ones would be

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.880 align:middle line:90%
friendly, neutral, and hostile?

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And what would be the
relationship of the universe

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:41.630 align:middle line:84%
to this planet in
the solar system?

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:50.600 align:middle line:10%
The MJ-8 allegedly answered,
"There is a cold, dark sea

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.040 align:middle line:10%
around this Universe."

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.930 align:middle line:10%
And when he was asked,
what is the cold, dark sea?

00:19:56.930 --> 00:20:00.200 align:middle line:10%
He answered, "You
don't want to know."

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And ever since that discussion
that I had back in 1982,

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:07.800 align:middle line:84%
I have asked a
variety of people,

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.700 align:middle line:90%
what is the cold, dark sea?

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And why is it that
we should not know?

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.580 align:middle line:90%
Why is it there?

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.550 align:middle line:90%
And what is it doing?

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:21.520 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any perspective
on a cold, dark sea

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.710 align:middle line:84%
that surrounds
this universe that

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:28.600 align:middle line:84%
might be known to
Being 6 and the Greys,

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:33.730 align:middle line:84%
but humans are basically left
out of the whole education?

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know if this
is literally a dark,

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:40.640 align:middle line:84%
black sea or if it's a
metaphor for something.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.610 align:middle line:84%
But there are
certainly some parts

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:53.980 align:middle line:84%
of the universe which display
very destructive and bad

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.090 align:middle line:90%
features and so on.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:21:02.890 align:middle line:84%
So the universe is capable of
displaying nightmares in a way.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:05.690 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean the
universe is a nightmare.

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:10.930 align:middle line:84%
It's basically, at least
on the lower planes,

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:13.720 align:middle line:90%
95 benevolent and nice.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And the higher the
grade of experience

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.660 align:middle line:84%
and self-reflectiveness
of the universe is,

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:26.320 align:middle line:84%
the more entropy is reduced, the
more the universe gets unified,

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.860 align:middle line:84%
the better and more
beautiful the universe

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:33.640 align:middle line:84%
becomes because that is
basically what Being 6--

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:39.440 align:middle line:84%
and you must imagine that
at level 6 consciousness,

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:44.890 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about the
whole universe Being 6

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:51.170 align:middle line:84%
except for one only
species that remains bad.

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Which ones are they?

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, that can be defined
from our perspective right now.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:03.200 align:middle line:84%
So in an ontological sense,
it's a antithesis of good.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.050 align:middle line:84%
That's the best
that we can put it.

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:11.870 align:middle line:84%
So we're dealing with such a
high frequency at that point

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:16.370 align:middle line:84%
that you can only say
it's the opposite of good

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:17.390 align:middle line:90%
that's living there.

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's only being there
until that moment where

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:21.560 align:middle line:90%
it gets solved.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:26.300 align:middle line:84%
So when that paradox of a
enormous, big universe--

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:30.050 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about almost the
infinity of everything existing

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:32.720 align:middle line:84%
in the universe,
which is, at level 6,

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.500 align:middle line:84%
benevolent and beautiful
because at that point,

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:40.580 align:middle line:84%
all these trillions and
billions of forms of life

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:44.810 align:middle line:84%
have realized that there's
enough space in infinity

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:48.980 align:middle line:84%
to offer a home for everyone,
and that we do better

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:52.570 align:middle line:84%
if we inspire each other
and when we help each other.

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:53.370 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:54.710 align:middle line:90%
>> But there's still one--

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:55.980 align:middle line:90%
>> There's still one--

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:56.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Negative.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>> --one negative,
so concentrated being

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:05.780 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking about
the whole beach compared to one

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:06.770 align:middle line:90%
grain of sand.

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>> But why couldn't
that whole 99% or 95%--

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:16.850 align:middle line:84%
why couldn't they get rid of
the one terrible negative?

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:23.390 align:middle line:84%
That is when the Greys
and also humanity kicks in

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:32.420 align:middle line:84%
because we are dealing with
a competitive character

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:35.010 align:middle line:84%
of the universe
that is aggressive,

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:39.230 align:middle line:84%
which is very, very,
very small at level 6.

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:44.360 align:middle line:84%
But the whole entire universe
that is only mild, harmonious,

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:50.090 align:middle line:84%
and nondefensive could not get
in opposition to that they just

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:54.470 align:middle line:84%
don't have the ability
to be counter-aggressive.

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And that is when
warrior-type species

00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:03.680 align:middle line:84%
are needed because even though I
wouldn't sign for any conflict,

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:08.940 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate when beings are
cooperative and friendly.

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:12.980 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a very invasive,
self-destructive element

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:17.360 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, one of
the things that can be done

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:21.180 align:middle line:90%
is put pressure against that.

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And that is when this
archetype of a light warrior--

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.690 align:middle line:84%
if you want to use
that metaphor--

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:31.770 align:middle line:84%
that is when this
light warrior kicks in.

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:32.570 align:middle line:90%
And a--

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Like Saint Michael.

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Like Saint
Michael, like Shiva,

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:40.100 align:middle line:90%
who fights the evil and stuff.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.380 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say-- and Being
6 says that as well--

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:48.080 align:middle line:84%
there's no sense in fighting
evil because being aggressive--

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.380 align:middle line:84%
when the universe fights
itself, it makes no sense,

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:58.070 align:middle line:84%
because it's an inner fight
or something that at a certain

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:01.550 align:middle line:84%
level, all species know
that they cannot die.

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:02.450 align:middle line:90%
They cannot be hurt.

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:04.400 align:middle line:90%
They can heal themselves.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:09.170 align:middle line:84%
So fighting doesn't make so
much sense on the higher planes.

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>> What would Being 6 be trying
to communicate, let's say,

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:18.800 align:middle line:84%
with you and your group in
Germany about what it would

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:23.000 align:middle line:84%
like to accomplish either with
technology that it would share

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.240 align:middle line:90%
with humans?

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Is there that kind of sharing
from level 6 with us on Earth?

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So what Being 6 needs to do
and to accomplish is to finally

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:44.600 align:middle line:84%
get rid of that very
bad one being at level 6

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:48.600 align:middle line:84%
because at that point, all
paradoxes of the universe are

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.400 align:middle line:90%
solved.

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And we have an
integrated level 7 being.

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:54.230 align:middle line:84%
That is what they
want to achieve.

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:58.040 align:middle line:84%
They cannot become whole
without that one being that is

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.610 align:middle line:84%
the antithesis of
good being isolated.

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:03.770 align:middle line:90%
It needs to integrate that part.

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:08.090 align:middle line:84%
It can never be whole
without every part

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:11.130 align:middle line:84%
of the universe being
integrated into the big picture.

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:12.950 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they aim for.

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:15.500 align:middle line:84%
But they don't want
that bad character

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:19.130 align:middle line:84%
being infiltrated and
going into the world

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:20.420 align:middle line:90%
and destroying everything.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:26.750 align:middle line:84%
So that is why they were
looking for warrior-type species

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:middle line:84%
as a protector
race, so to speak.

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And that is when the
Greys as a warrior

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:38.390 align:middle line:84%
species and several other, like
the mantis, the humans as well,

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:45.380 align:middle line:84%
perform their role as defending
warriors and being success--

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:48.650 align:middle line:84%
that very clearly, it's
just a matter of time

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:51.350 align:middle line:84%
because at one
point, the universe

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:55.580 align:middle line:84%
itself gets bored of fighting
because it makes no sense.

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.920 align:middle line:84%
What are you going
to do with that?

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.670 align:middle line:84%
It's like a video
game where you--

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:00.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And that leads to
this important question.

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:05.330 align:middle line:90%
There are more and more papers.

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:07.400 align:middle line:84%
I was in a meeting at the
University of Southern

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:11.360 align:middle line:84%
California with three physicists
talking about, yes, it

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.210 align:middle line:84%
looks like we're in a
holographic universe.

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And now comes a headline
that there's a hypothesis

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:20.540 align:middle line:84%
that black holes
in this universe

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.840 align:middle line:84%
could literally have
some kind of dynamic

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:28.010 align:middle line:84%
in this being a projected
holographic universe.

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:31.890 align:middle line:84%
If we are in a
hologram, you can't

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:34.980 align:middle line:84%
have the projector inside
of the universe that's

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.180 align:middle line:90%
being projected.

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:39.030 align:middle line:84%
You have to have the
projector from someplace

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:42.510 align:middle line:84%
else, another dimension,
another universe.

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:46.680 align:middle line:84%
What is the true,
true nature if we're

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.110 align:middle line:90%
in a holographic universe?

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:55.170 align:middle line:84%
Why is it being projected
with the fatal flaw

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:59.160 align:middle line:84%
of violence, the yin
and the yang, the black

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.360 align:middle line:90%
versus the white?

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:05.130 align:middle line:84%
What would be the one question
that you've heard Being 6 say

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:06.720 align:middle line:90%
and agonize over?

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Infinity.

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.410 align:middle line:84%
The main question
that they want to know

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:14.550 align:middle line:84%
is, is the universe
finite or not?

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And that only answers to them
when every single opportunity,

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:23.520 align:middle line:84%
every particle has been in any
possible place of the universe

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.330 align:middle line:84%
at all times, which is
such an amount of data.

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:30.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that means that
every single particle,

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:33.780 align:middle line:84%
every possibility needs to
be played out in the universe

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:39.060 align:middle line:84%
to answer the question, is
it finite, or is it infinite?

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:45.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And have you ever been
able to ask Being 6 why would

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:49.200 align:middle line:84%
knowing whether the universe
was infinite or not--

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.230 align:middle line:84%
why would that be
their top question?

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a constant
upgrading system.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.120 align:middle line:90%
The universe is self-learning.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:59.260 align:middle line:90%
And it's a creative system.

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:02.670 align:middle line:84%
So what would happen
basically to existence

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:06.420 align:middle line:84%
if we come to a point where all
possibilities are played out,

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:10.290 align:middle line:90%
that would basically mean--

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:11.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Universe pops out.

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:12.540 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I mean, it's either
that we have a new universe,

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:20.130 align:middle line:84%
which brings new possibilities
that we are not even able

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:25.080 align:middle line:84%
to think of right now, which
is basically something that I
