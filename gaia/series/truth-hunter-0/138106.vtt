>> In Part 2 of
this "Truth Hunter"

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.229 align:middle line:84%
series about alien symbols
on craft and telepathic

communication in binary code
to humans from non-humans,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.780 align:middle line:90%
we met US Army Sergeant CJ.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.170 align:middle line:84%
On June 30, 2015,
he and his family

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.730 align:middle line:84%
were stopped on a road
near Wadley, Georgia.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.160 align:middle line:84%
In front of them was a
huge disk-shaped craft.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant CJ estimated
it to be 820 feet long.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Symbols at the
craft's midsection

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.170 align:middle line:84%
were similar to other symbols
seen by US Air Force Staff

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant James Penniston
on a black glassy

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.430 align:middle line:84%
triangle in Rendlesham Forest
at RAF Bentwaters Woodbridge,

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.670 align:middle line:90%
England, in December 1980.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.060 align:middle line:84%
The same triangle
with circles patterns

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.010 align:middle line:84%
was also reported in 1803
on a disk that emerged

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.470 align:middle line:90%
from the ocean in Japan.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.230 align:middle line:10%
After encounters
with UFO symbols,

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.690 align:middle line:10%
both Air Force Sergeant
Penniston and Army Sergeant CJ

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.920 align:middle line:10%
experienced downloads of 0's
and 1's into their minds.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Both described
seeing the numbers

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.570 align:middle line:84%
moving right to left in their
mind's eye, as if on a screen.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant Penniston said he
consciously copied binary code

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.790 align:middle line:84%
from his mind onto pages
in his flight notebook.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.460 align:middle line:10%
At first, Sergeant
CJ was shocked

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.610 align:middle line:10%
to wake up in a Motel
6 bathroom staring

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.850 align:middle line:10%
at the back of his
letter size motel receipt

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.610 align:middle line:10%
covered with squares and ones.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.070 align:middle line:84%
He knew nothing
about binary code.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And he did not have any idea
what the squares and the ones

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.480 align:middle line:84%
were, or how he got
from sleep in bed

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.620 align:middle line:84%
to standing at the bathroom
door with a ballpoint pen in one

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.860 align:middle line:84%
hand and the paper covered
with squares and ones

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.820 align:middle line:90%
in the other hand.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.660 align:middle line:84%
After his shock,
Sergeant CJ remembered

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.590 align:middle line:84%
he had been having a vivid
dream before he woke up

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.540 align:middle line:90%
in the bathroom.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.010 align:middle line:84%
In the dream, there were
tall, pale Grey non-humans

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.690 align:middle line:84%
wearing dark lenses over
eyes that Sergeant CJ said

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.720 align:middle line:84%
were similar to human
eyes, but larger.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.650 align:middle line:84%
One being even took off
one of his dark lenses

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.430 align:middle line:84%
and there was a crystal
blue eye underneath.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant CJ learned
telepathically

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.100 align:middle line:84%
that these beings
described themselves

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.240 align:middle line:84%
as being from a Cosmic
Council of Five,

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.670 align:middle line:90%
like the Star Trek Federation.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant CJ heard thought
voices in his head

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.280 align:middle line:84%
warn that Earth humans could
be in danger, that the Grey

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.520 align:middle line:84%
beings from the Council
of Five were on a mission

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.810 align:middle line:84%
to more rapidly advance human
knowledge and technology so

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.860 align:middle line:84%
that humans would not be
so vulnerable to attack.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant CJ told
me in an interview

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.140 align:middle line:84%
that the Council
of Five non-humans

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.060 align:middle line:84%
were quote "doing what
they can to try to help us.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.050 align:middle line:84%
They are almost to the point
where they are outnumbered.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
need to assist in order

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.840 align:middle line:90%
to survive" closed quote.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.540 align:middle line:84%
When I had Sergeant
CJ's squares and one's

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.320 align:middle line:84%
translated with ASCII
8-bit binary code,

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.910 align:middle line:90%
there was a warning.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Quote "Imminent threat
soon upon Earth's leaders

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.630 align:middle line:90%
and civilizations.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Expose and disband hidden
knowledge to all citizens.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Employ safe and controlled
joint study to all minds.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Progression imperative
for combined survival"

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.920 align:middle line:90%
closed quote.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.029 align:middle line:10%
By February of 2016,
Army Sergeant CJ

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.840 align:middle line:10%
had written down five
new lines of binary code

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.550 align:middle line:10%
that turned out to be three
Akkadian and two Sumerian

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.310 align:middle line:10%
ancient words that
roughly translated

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:36.460 align:middle line:10%
as Nabu, an important
Sumerian Lord on a horse

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.170 align:middle line:10%
or in a chariot going from
or to the city of Larsa

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:48.430 align:middle line:10%
in southern Mesopotamia, today's
Iraq, returning to Earth.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.450 align:middle line:84%
On May 25, 2016,
Sergeant CJ sent me

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.630 align:middle line:84%
an email that began
quote "woke up

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.360 align:middle line:84%
to go to work when I
walked out to my truck,

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.420 align:middle line:84%
I saw three white
oval-shaped orbs in the sky

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.040 align:middle line:90%
above me close by.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.980 align:middle line:84%
I ran back to grab my
iPhone to take a picture,

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.900 align:middle line:90%
but my phone would not zoom in.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why the
phone wouldn't work."

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks later,
on June 8, 2016,

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant CJ woke up to write
down 4 1/2 lines of more

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.910 align:middle line:84%
squares and ones in his notebook
that he keeps by his bed.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.600 align:middle line:84%
At the end of those lines, he
also wrote could not keep up.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.760 align:middle line:84%
He says when the
squares and ones

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.800 align:middle line:84%
are running in his
mind's eye from right

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.300 align:middle line:84%
to left, that he has to focus
very hard to keep them clear

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.750 align:middle line:84%
so he can copy them down
before they are gone.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Here is the ASCII
8-bit code translation

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.680 align:middle line:90%
of those June 8th lines.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:57.200 align:middle line:84%
Your creator is
D-I-S-P-L-E-X, capital X,

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.060 align:middle line:84%
this is in the ASCII
code, followed by unknown,

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.650 align:middle line:84%
and unknown, and the letter
Y, and another unknown meaning

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.900 align:middle line:90%
the 0's and 1's.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:16.190 align:middle line:84%
That D-I-S-P-L-E-X could
have meant displeased.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Three weeks after
that, on June 19th,

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.430 align:middle line:90%
Sergeant CJ sent another email.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.090 align:middle line:84%
"Came into work early to receive
first flight of soldiers coming

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.040 align:middle line:90%
back from Poland training.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.160 align:middle line:84%
I was standing out in the
field after I sent the soldiers

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.600 align:middle line:84%
to pick up bags when I spotted
an odd anomaly in the distance

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.490 align:middle line:90%
sky.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.090 align:middle line:84%
It came closer and I took a
couple of pictures running back

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.250 align:middle line:90%
to my truck for protection.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Then I was startled that
the light was suddenly

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.510 align:middle line:90%
right over my head.

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.880 align:middle line:10%
And then, almost
immediately after that,

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.150 align:middle line:10%
two Black Hawk type
helicopters came

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:57.020 align:middle line:10%
in fast pursuing
whatever the light was."

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.670 align:middle line:84%
That same night of June
19, 2016, Sergeant CJ

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:06.800 align:middle line:84%
was receiving more binary code,
but was only able to write down

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.380 align:middle line:90%
a few squares and lines.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.970 align:middle line:84%
But wrote in his notebook that
he could not stay focused.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.750 align:middle line:84%
I was able to get the
squares and lines translated.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And there was one
perfectly spelled word--

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.970 align:middle line:90%
arrogant.

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.840 align:middle line:10%
Here are the squares and
ones Sergeant CJ also

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.210 align:middle line:10%
wrote down in his notebook
the same time as the dream.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:38.070 align:middle line:10%
And below is the binary
translation belief as the word

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:46.470 align:middle line:10%
belief, followed by capital
Q-L-L-O-W, the word all,

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:52.100 align:middle line:10%
space 31 space 77745.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:57.570 align:middle line:10%
Sergeant CJ said he could not
stay alert to keep up with

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.620 align:middle line:10%
the moving squares and lines,
which could explain why

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:09.180 align:middle line:10%
the second word is Q-L-L-O-W
instead of A-L-L-O-W,

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.710 align:middle line:10%
which would be allow.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.300 align:middle line:10%
And what is interesting.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.320 align:middle line:10%
There is only one number
difference in ASCII code

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:27.060 align:middle line:10%
between capital Q and capital
A. Q is 0101 space 0001.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:35.130 align:middle line:10%
A is 0100 space 0001.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:39.240 align:middle line:10%
This may be an example
of a human mind that

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.350 align:middle line:10%
is in a link with a
non-human intelligence that

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:49.080 align:middle line:10%
knows that some people can
take binary code in 0's and 1's

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.550 align:middle line:10%
into their minds and at least
be able to retain it long enough

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:57.780 align:middle line:10%
to write it down, if not
always completely accurately.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:02.250 align:middle line:84%
All of the new binary code
might relate to a vivid dream

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.590 align:middle line:84%
that both Sergeant
CJ and his wife

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:09.840 align:middle line:84%
told me they had at the same
time on the night of March 6,

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.860 align:middle line:90%
2016.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.860 align:middle line:84%
>>I dreamt that I was on
the ground near houses.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And I recall seeing
a bunch people

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.370 align:middle line:90%
running away from something.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And I saw them
looking up in the sky.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.850 align:middle line:90%
So I looked up as well.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.040 align:middle line:90%
And I saw an oval shape.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.290 align:middle line:90%
I remember a light coming down.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.610 align:middle line:90%
And I tried to run from it.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.300 align:middle line:90%
And then I was immersed in it.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>>What is this beam like?

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:37.460 align:middle line:84%
>>It was a bright white
with blue inside it.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.630 align:middle line:84%
I felt completely numb and
paralyzed, couldn't move.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.576 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment
I was no there.

00:09:44.576 --> 00:09:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And I remember there were
different humanoid species.

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>>Not human.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>>Not human.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.810 align:middle line:90%
Well, besides one.

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:57.400 align:middle line:84%
The one that looked human was
a male, late 40s, early 50s,

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.770 align:middle line:84%
and everyone referred
to him as Colonel.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:03.620 align:middle line:84%
He looked like an American to
me, slight receding hairline,

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.100 align:middle line:84%
light brown hair,
brown eyes, and was

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.950 align:middle line:84%
wearing a dark blue
jumpsuit, no patches.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Similar to what astronauts
would wear on the Space Station.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Dark navy blue jumpsuit with
no identification or patches

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:18.730 align:middle line:90%
on the jumpsuit.

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:22.450 align:middle line:84%
There was a small Grey
alien in the room.

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:23.620 align:middle line:90%
There was a tall Grey.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.940 align:middle line:90%


00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>>Was that tall Grey
like those back on June

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.230 align:middle line:84%
30th when you wrote
the binary code?

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.460 align:middle line:90%
They appeared to be the same.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.620 align:middle line:84%
There was a tall human
looking blond hair species

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.900 align:middle line:84%
in that room, but I
never got the impression

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.390 align:middle line:90%
that it was a human at all.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.220 align:middle line:84%
It was a few inches taller
than me and I'm six one.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:52.170 align:middle line:84%
There was a short female that
also looked human, was not.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.744 align:middle line:90%
She was about four feet tall.

00:10:53.744 --> 00:10:55.410 align:middle line:84%
A characteristic that
I noticed and that

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:59.760 align:middle line:84%
was a raised dark spot between
her eyes, above her eyebrows.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.850 align:middle line:84%
It looked like a swollen
spot that was blue in color.

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Another one kind of look like
an incredible hulk, but not

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.080 align:middle line:90%
quite that big.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:11.112 align:middle line:84%
Strong jaw, very rugged
looking head, broad shoulders.

00:11:11.112 --> 00:11:13.710 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>You're describing a scene
of some sort of collaboration

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:22.350 align:middle line:84%
between a US government
person and extraterrestrials.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Why have the non-humans
lifted you up in a beam

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:30.330 align:middle line:84%
and put you in a room with
an American colonel who

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.610 align:middle line:90%
is immediately enraged?

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:33.420 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:37.020 align:middle line:84%
This colonel was very angry
they chose me to be there.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.790 align:middle line:84%
He didn't feel that
I needed to be there.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.680 align:middle line:84%
He was upset that
I was even there.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.860 align:middle line:84%
He actually mentioned that
I needed to be extinguished,

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.950 align:middle line:84%
which pissed me off and
I began yelling at him.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>>I was hearing the tall Grey
talking, in whatever language

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:53.670 align:middle line:84%
it was talking, but I was
hearing it through telepathic.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:55.720 align:middle line:84%
I could hear in
my head, everyone

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.270 align:middle line:84%
was saying in clear
English, but none of them

00:11:58.270 --> 00:11:59.950 align:middle line:90%
were moving their mouths.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:02.140 align:middle line:84%
They told the colonel that
the reason I was there

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.990 align:middle line:84%
was because I am not
influenced by others who

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.507 align:middle line:90%
are making decisions for me.

00:12:06.507 --> 00:12:08.131 align:middle line:84%
They mentioned that
the colonel's group

00:12:08.131 --> 00:12:11.270 align:middle line:84%
that he works for
had been infiltrated

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:13.470 align:middle line:90%
and it was being arrogant.

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>That group is being
too arrogant to realize

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:21.340 align:middle line:84%
that they are blinding
the American government

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.140 align:middle line:90%
from something important?

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:24.070 align:middle line:90%
>>Perhaps.

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>>Trying to do something
that the aliens don't want?

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:28.300 align:middle line:90%
>>It could be.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.120 align:middle line:84%
My impression is
that the non-humans

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.860 align:middle line:84%
need to come clean, come
clean with what's going on,

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.630 align:middle line:90%
get everybody out of the dark.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the most
important parts

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:44.680 align:middle line:84%
of your notes about the March 6,
2016 event quoting "the colonel

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.420 align:middle line:90%
was still angry.

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And the aliens told
him you will remain.

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:54.310 align:middle line:84%
As if that one
sentence indicates

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:57.280 align:middle line:84%
that the power is
with the non-humans,

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.830 align:middle line:90%
not the American colonel."

00:12:58.830 --> 00:12:59.630 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.490 align:middle line:84%
That's the impression
that I got as well.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:04.510 align:middle line:84%
He's the speaker for our
race in this meeting.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And everyone else
in this meeting

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.160 align:middle line:90%
is agreeing that I should stay.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>>There has to be something
important about why

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.050 align:middle line:84%
the non-humans would
have the ability

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:16.540 align:middle line:84%
to counter an American
Air Force colonel

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.952 align:middle line:84%
and do so with confidence
that you would not be harmed.

00:13:19.952 --> 00:13:21.100 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>>If the government
of the United

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:26.140 align:middle line:84%
States with the Allies of
World War II are the ones

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:30.490 align:middle line:84%
that are holding strict policies
of denial for the whole world

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:33.790 align:middle line:84%
to not know that there
are other life forms,

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:36.700 align:middle line:84%
and that our government has
been working and collaborating

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.910 align:middle line:84%
with some since World War
II while trying to fight

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:43.050 align:middle line:90%
or defeat others, a secret war.

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And now it appears that
there is some intent

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:50.620 align:middle line:84%
by yet other non-human
intelligences insisting

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.610 align:middle line:84%
that it is vital to humanity's
survival for the truth

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:56.230 align:middle line:90%
to be opened up.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>>There were numbers
involved that

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:00.730 align:middle line:90%
were associated with Germany.

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And there was an ancient
thing that happened.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.980 align:middle line:90%


00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>>In the 1500s,
there was a battle

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:14.620 align:middle line:84%
of different craft in the
sky over Nuremberg, Germany.

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.030 align:middle line:84%
>>Those were spheres and
crosses, weren't they?

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.830 align:middle line:90%
>>Yep.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:20.470 align:middle line:90%
And long dark craft.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.770 align:middle line:84%
If there was a war
between black triangles,

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:27.070 align:middle line:84%
spheres, and some sort
of technology that

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:30.850 align:middle line:84%
looked like crosses, and
that was in the 1500s, now

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:33.000 align:middle line:90%
we're at 2016.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And the implication is
there is a war going

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.380 align:middle line:84%
on for some geopolitical
territorial reason

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.060 align:middle line:90%
between non-humans.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And that somehow American
humans are involved.

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:45.910 align:middle line:90%
Is it the same war?

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:48.160 align:middle line:10%
And if it is, what
would be the war

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.130 align:middle line:10%
raging throughout
millennia coming

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:54.890 align:middle line:10%
into various battles over what?

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:55.690 align:middle line:10%
>>I know.

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:56.800 align:middle line:10%
I'm right there with you.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.940 align:middle line:10%
Over what?

00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.890 align:middle line:90%
I'd love to know.

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>About which non-humans are
allies and which are not,

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:10.690 align:middle line:84%
in September 2015, I interviewed
retired US Army Sergeant First

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Class Lynn Buchanan
who had worked

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.750 align:middle line:84%
as a controlled remote viewer
for the Defense Intelligence

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Agency's DTS Intelligence
Unit in Fort Meade, Maryland,

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:25.420 align:middle line:84%
next to the National
Security Agency.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Lynn told me about a project
that he was tasked to Remote

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:32.860 align:middle line:84%
View that divided the many
different types of non-human

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:37.870 align:middle line:84%
intelligences interacting with
Earth into four categories--

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:42.010 align:middle line:84%
psychic Greys that are
friendly and like humans,

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:48.130 align:middle line:84%
psychic Greys that do not
like humans, non-psychic Greys

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:54.580 align:middle line:84%
do like humans, and non-psychic
Greys that do not like humans.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:58.510 align:middle line:84%
That, he said, is the
most dangerous category.

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:03.250 align:middle line:84%
I ask Lynn for more details
about the hostile psychic ETs

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:07.330 align:middle line:84%
after he explained that he
received firsthand knowledge

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:10.960 align:middle line:84%
about non-humans
interacting with Earth

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.090 align:middle line:84%
during his official
government work

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.730 align:middle line:90%
in classified black projects.

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:17.260 align:middle line:10%
>>There's not us and them.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.280 align:middle line:10%
Everybody says well
what do they want?

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.790 align:middle line:10%
Well, they want something
different from what they want

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.010 align:middle line:10%
and from what they
want, and you know.

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:27.475 align:middle line:10%
And so there's us and
them and them and them.

00:16:27.475 --> 00:16:31.750 align:middle line:10%
And each one is here with
their own different agenda.

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:40.280 align:middle line:10%
After service, I was asked to
do a study on the comparison

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:45.110 align:middle line:10%
and contrasting of
ET psychic abilities

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:49.460 align:middle line:10%
with human psychic abilities.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.860 align:middle line:10%
I was given access
to many things

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:57.410 align:middle line:10%
that the public will probably
never see in order to do this.

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:04.010 align:middle line:10%
And I came up with basically
you can cut all of them

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:05.810 align:middle line:10%
into four groups.

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:09.050 align:middle line:10%
And now the Greys will be
in each of the four groups.

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:14.290 align:middle line:10%
The insectoids will be in each
of the four groups and all in.

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:15.920 align:middle line:10%
Because there are
Greys there and there

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.050 align:middle line:10%
are Greys there and all in.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:26.250 align:middle line:10%
But it turned out they had
friendly and unfriendly.

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:27.990 align:middle line:10%
And in each of those
two groups, you

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:31.940 align:middle line:10%
had psychic and non psychic.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:35.950 align:middle line:10%
And from the
documentation that I got,

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:41.120 align:middle line:10%
I found out that the friendly
non-psychic ones come here

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.802 align:middle line:10%
for trade.

00:17:42.802 --> 00:17:48.010 align:middle line:10%
I know the guy who's in charge
of the technology transfer.

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.830 align:middle line:10%
And he was laughing one day.

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:54.340 align:middle line:10%
He said they're not
inventive people.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.950 align:middle line:10%
And their culture is old
and all that, they're not

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:58.510 align:middle line:10%
inventive people.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:02.590 align:middle line:10%
And he said we get
stuff from them.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:05.150 align:middle line:10%
We play with it, we find all
these different enhancements

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:05.950 align:middle line:10%
for it.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:09.130 align:middle line:10%
And he said these days we're
trading them their stuff

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:12.960 align:middle line:10%
back to them and
they're glad to get it.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.040 align:middle line:10%
They're here for trade.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:19.560 align:middle line:10%
The non-psychic, non-friendly
ones don't come here.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:24.210 align:middle line:10%
Friendly psychic ones want to
help us develop our abilities.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:28.750 align:middle line:10%
And the non-friendly
psychic ones

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:31.410 align:middle line:10%
want us wiped off the planet.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:32.670 align:middle line:10%
They want us dead.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:33.470 align:middle line:10%
Period.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:35.490 align:middle line:10%
To the last human.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:40.260 align:middle line:10%
And I couldn't figure out
what the motivation is

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.330 align:middle line:10%
for each of those two groups.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:45.840 align:middle line:10%
And there was one
event that happened

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:51.010 align:middle line:10%
that finally made it click.

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:55.930 align:middle line:10%
A UFO came up and
abducted these guys that

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:59.110 align:middle line:10%
were out camping at a lake.

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:03.790 align:middle line:10%
And they watched it come up.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:06.160 align:middle line:10%
And it got over them.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.210 align:middle line:10%
And then they froze.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:13.840 align:middle line:10%
And, well, it dawned
on me from that,

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.320 align:middle line:10%
and after reading
all this other stuff,

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:25.690 align:middle line:10%
that group has more
psychic power than we do.

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:28.540 align:middle line:10%
But they have no range at all.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.940 align:middle line:10%
We can see across the
universe as easily

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.790 align:middle line:10%
as we can see across the room.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:37.390 align:middle line:10%
The conclusion that I
came to on this study

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:44.220 align:middle line:10%
was that as we get
out into the universe,

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.440 align:middle line:10%
we have the psychic ability.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.240 align:middle line:10%
We have the creativity.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.800 align:middle line:10%
We have all that.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.650 align:middle line:10%
And we can be a powerful
force in the universe.

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:55.560 align:middle line:10%
And that's why
those friendly to us

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.650 align:middle line:10%
want us to develop that ability.

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:04.300 align:middle line:10%
And that's why those unfriendly
to us don't want us out there.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:08.712 align:middle line:10%
And so, this is my conclusion.

00:20:08.712 --> 00:20:10.295 align:middle line:10%
And that's what I
wrote in the report.

00:20:10.295 --> 00:20:13.500 align:middle line:90%


00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>>Our planet is now in the midst
of its sixth mass extinction

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.200 align:middle line:84%
of plants and animals,
because of humanity's spread

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.760 align:middle line:84%
around the planet destroying
and paving over so much ground

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.060 align:middle line:84%
that once sustained
abundant Earth life.

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.790 align:middle line:84%
We're currently experiencing
the worst period

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:35.640 align:middle line:84%
of die offs since the
loss of the dinosaurs

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.310 align:middle line:90%
66 million years ago.

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:42.040 align:middle line:84%
Scientists estimate we're
now losing animals, plants,

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:47.280 align:middle line:84%
and insects at 1.000-10,000
times the rate prior

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:51.860 align:middle line:84%
to the 20th century with dozens
of species going extinct every

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:52.950 align:middle line:90%
day.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:56.550 align:middle line:84%
That means by the end
of this 21st century,

00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:03.730 align:middle line:84%
as many as 30%-50% of all
Earth's species could be gone.

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, the non-human
intelligences,

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:11.830 align:middle line:84%
which watch this planet, can see
humanity's own future hanging

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:16.810 align:middle line:84%
in a balance, but will not allow
humans to destroy the earth.

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:20.530 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps that is why the aliens
increase their interference

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:24.010 align:middle line:84%
at nuclear missile sites
and human abductions,

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:26.620 align:middle line:84%
despite aggressive
government efforts

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:30.880 align:middle line:84%
to keep everything about the
alien presence a big secret.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.780 align:middle line:84%
One fact is certain, no
matter who made humans

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:40.480 align:middle line:84%
or why, life on earth
is not guaranteed.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.900 align:middle line:84%
But if the chokehold on
the truth were released

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.440 align:middle line:84%
and the entire human family
could know everything

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.960 align:middle line:84%
the governments and
military are hiding

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:54.550 align:middle line:84%
about an alien presence on this
planet that still manipulates

00:21:54.550 --> 00:22:00.130 align:middle line:84%
DNA and harvests earth life,
perhaps human tribal warfare

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:05.260 align:middle line:84%
would slow down in the alien
concocted Garden of Eden,

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.500 align:middle line:90%
where a reptile was the teacher.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:12.130 align:middle line:10%
In November 1984,
I was a speaker

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:16.030 align:middle line:10%
at the University of Nebraska
with astronomer and CUFOS

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:19.510 align:middle line:10%
founder, J Allen
Hynek PhD, that's

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:22.360 align:middle line:10%
the Center for UFO Studies.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.970 align:middle line:84%
I presented about
animal mutilations

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:28.280 align:middle line:90%
and Dr. Hynek talked about UFOs.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Afterward he said to me,
Linda, let's let our hair down

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:33.800 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.150 align:middle line:84%
I thought, wow I'm going to
learn what Allen Hynek really

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:40.330 align:middle line:90%
knows about UFOs and ETs.

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:44.170 align:middle line:84%
We went to a quiet room away
from the conference buzz.

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:49.840 align:middle line:10%
And to my surprise, he began
with the most important book

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.750 align:middle line:10%
I have ever read and hope
that you will read too

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:55.450 align:middle line:10%
is "Theosophy" by
Rudolf Steiner.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:59.260 align:middle line:84%
In that book, first
written in 1922,

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.330 align:middle line:84%
Steiner summed up
his understanding

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:05.240 align:middle line:84%
about the relationship
between the human mind-body,

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:10.010 align:middle line:84%
its soul, and animating
life force spirit.

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:15.500 align:middle line:84%
"In the soul, the eye flashes
forth, receives the impulse

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:19.160 align:middle line:84%
from the spirit, and
thereby becomes the bearer

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.130 align:middle line:90%
of the spiritual human being.

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Humans are rooted in
the physical world

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:29.900 align:middle line:84%
through physical body,
ether body, and soul body.

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:33.650 align:middle line:84%
They come to flower in
the spiritual world.

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:38.240 align:middle line:84%
The stock, however, that takes
root in the physical body

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.430 align:middle line:90%
and flowers in the spirit.

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:46.450 align:middle line:84%
It is the soul
itself" close quote

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Neither J Allen Hynek
nor I knew that he

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.590 align:middle line:84%
would pass into another
dimension only a year

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:56.710 align:middle line:84%
and a half later
from a brain tumor.

00:23:56.710 --> 00:24:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And I would not learn from
abductees about the ET soul

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:04.840 align:middle line:84%
transfer technology for
seven more years in 1991

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.300 align:middle line:84%
when abductee Linda
Porter sent me

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:12.280 align:middle line:84%
her sketches of the human
soul life force radiating

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:16.840 align:middle line:84%
gold orange light as it moved
from the dying man's body

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.930 align:middle line:84%
into another body
cloned by rapid cycle

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:25.210 align:middle line:84%
cloning in what the abductees
call resurrection tubes.

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Managed by a Grey EBEN
and praying mantis being.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Military voices have
made it clear to me

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:37.790 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
secret war on Earth.

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:40.370 align:middle line:84%
One group of other
intelligences want

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:43.550 align:middle line:84%
to see humans evolve
into consciousness

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:46.970 align:middle line:84%
with the divine feel that is
responsible for all matter

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.540 align:middle line:90%
worlds.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:52.610 align:middle line:10%
Another intelligence wants
to stop human evolution

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:56.030 align:middle line:10%
so it can continue to
harvest us genetically

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:59.540 align:middle line:10%
for its own
self-serving purposes.

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:03.770 align:middle line:10%
Maybe, like political
factions, the dark party

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:07.430 align:middle line:10%
and the light party are
competing over legislation

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:11.390 align:middle line:10%
to legalize the production
of cloned android life

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:15.470 align:middle line:10%
outside the force of
creation's recycling program

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:18.650 align:middle line:10%
of a finite number of souls.

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some souls
are captured and put

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:25.220 align:middle line:84%
into cloned bodies which is
fouling up the divine field's

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:26.810 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:31.130 align:middle line:84%
Other clones might
never receive souls.

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:35.180 align:middle line:84%
That political issue about
cloning for galactic trade

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:38.930 align:middle line:84%
or alien wars might
explain why dramas

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:43.580 align:middle line:84%
of resurrected saviors from
Osiris in Egypt to Christ

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.850 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Palestine,
Israel today,

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:52.120 align:middle line:84%
have been presented
repeatedly to humanity.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.790 align:middle line:84%
Osiris and Christ were
beings with human bodies

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:58.860 align:middle line:84%
and mysterious
divinity who emphasized

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.610 align:middle line:84%
that death in the
body does not end life

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:04.160 align:middle line:90%
for the soul and the spirit.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.190 align:middle line:84%
That concept underlies
the Egyptian obsession

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.440 align:middle line:84%
with mummies and
sacred the rights

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.050 align:middle line:84%
to protect the soul
at the moment of death

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:15.200 align:middle line:90%
from competing forces.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.110 align:middle line:84%
If there is a finite
number of souls,

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:20.480 align:middle line:84%
as the government
whistleblowers that I

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:26.480 align:middle line:84%
call Sherman say, and they are
under a strictly regulated god

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:32.240 align:middle line:84%
force recycling program, then
clone bodies and androids might

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:38.240 align:middle line:84%
end up outside, excluded
from that recycling process.

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:41.630 align:middle line:84%
The full scope of the
complex multi-layered chess

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:44.540 align:middle line:84%
game for souls,
spirits, and bodies

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:50.210 align:middle line:84%
of humans, extraterrestrials,
angels, and time travelers

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:54.130 align:middle line:84%
might be beyond human
ability to understand.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:57.940 align:middle line:84%
One scientist in New England,
who has also been abducted

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:02.320 align:middle line:84%
by grey beings who repaired
his diseased heart,

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.230 align:middle line:84%
told me that he was shown
holograms that depicted

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:08.770 align:middle line:90%
a series of universes in pairs.

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Mirrored images,
each the opposite

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:15.820 align:middle line:84%
of the other from the
subatomic to the macro.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:19.420 align:middle line:84%
He says quote "our
universe is paired

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:22.390 align:middle line:84%
to another universe
which is completely

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:24.100 align:middle line:90%
opposite of this one.

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:28.000 align:middle line:84%
There the skies are glowing
white with dark suns.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Colors are indescribable
and iridescent.

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:34.300 align:middle line:90%
Time flows to the past.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:36.160 align:middle line:84%
Like a conveyor
belt at the moment

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.910 align:middle line:84%
of death in our universe,
we move through a tunnel

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:43.810 align:middle line:84%
into the mirror universe
where it is all light.

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:50.170 align:middle line:84%
There, time moves to the past
and souls return back here

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:54.220 align:middle line:90%
in this universe" closed quote.

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the unique isolation
that each human feels

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:04.480 align:middle line:84%
and the peculiar melancholy that
a dark sky filled with stars

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.930 align:middle line:84%
can evoke have something
to do with knowledge

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:11.950 align:middle line:84%
buried in our genes
and our souls,

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:16.330 align:middle line:84%
a sensing of ancient
intimacies with other beings

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:18.190 align:middle line:90%
in other worlds.

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Now in this time of revolution,
when the whole world

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:26.260 align:middle line:84%
will know we are not
alone in this universe,

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:29.740 align:middle line:84%
our greatest
challenge as a species

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:33.370 align:middle line:84%
will be to stand up
unafraid before the old gods

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:35.050 align:middle line:90%
and watchers.

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, there
is a common bond

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:42.440 align:middle line:84%
among all lifeforms
