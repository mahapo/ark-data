00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.290 align:middle line:10%
>> The end of December 2010
was the 30th anniversary

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.050 align:middle line:10%
of the unidentified
aerial lights, beams,

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.220 align:middle line:10%
and a triangular UFO craft
that interacted with Air Force

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.040 align:middle line:10%
personnel over a 72-hour period
around NATO's then-largest air

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.290 align:middle line:10%
base, RAF Bentwaters,
Woodbridge.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.250 align:middle line:84%
For the anniversary, I join
John Burroughs, Jim Penniston,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.370 align:middle line:84%
and the "Ancient Aliens"
television production crew

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.920 align:middle line:84%
to return to
Woodbridge, England.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.060 align:middle line:10%
What we didn't know was that
the UK defense intelligence

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:07.440 align:middle line:10%
analysis staff, known as DI55,
has managed a secret UFO branch

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.150 align:middle line:10%
for the Ministry of Defense.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.640 align:middle line:10%
On December 7, 2000,
DI55 sent to the MOD

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.650 align:middle line:10%
its three-volume,
460-page study entitled,

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.700 align:middle line:10%
"Unidentified Aerial
Phenomena (or UAPs)

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.990 align:middle line:10%
in the UK Air Defense
Region," close quote.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.930 align:middle line:84%
It's likely the MOD wanted
UFO changed to UAP to cut down

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.670 align:middle line:90%
on FOIA requests.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knew the new
search term was now

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.000 align:middle line:90%
going to be UAP instead of UFO.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.590 align:middle line:84%
The DI55 study was
highly classified,

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.800 align:middle line:84%
UK-eyes-only, UK-secret, and is
truly a de facto confirmation

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.320 align:middle line:84%
that UFOs are very real to UK
and US government insiders.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.460 align:middle line:84%
It was produced under a UK
Ministry of Defense project

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.130 align:middle line:90%
called Condign.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.070 align:middle line:84%
That word means
suitable, especially

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.350 align:middle line:90%
with reference to punishment.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.090 align:middle line:84%
For example, the prisoner has
suffered condign punishment.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.240 align:middle line:84%
So there is dry
British wit and irony

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.240 align:middle line:84%
in the United Kingdom's
Ministry of Defense

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.750 align:middle line:84%
conducting a secret
defense intelligence staff

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.520 align:middle line:84%
investigation of UFOs and
calling it Project Condign.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.320 align:middle line:84%
The name implies that
insiders felt honorable abuse

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.860 align:middle line:84%
for taking on such a mocked
and difficult subject.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the MOD and
UK National Archives

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.280 align:middle line:84%
collaborated in
a publicity blitz

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.880 align:middle line:84%
to convince the general public
that all Ministry of Defense

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.890 align:middle line:84%
UFO files were being transferred
to the UK National Archives,

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.110 align:middle line:84%
while the MOD's so-called UFO
desk was being closed down.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.740 align:middle line:84%
But the BBC caught
one embarrassing fact

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.450 align:middle line:84%
on March 3, 2011, after the
National Archives announced

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:84%
it was releasing 8,500 pages
of UFO-related documents

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.720 align:middle line:84%
about UFOs from the
Ministry of Defense.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.490 align:middle line:84%
The BBC found out that,
quote, "Intelligence papers

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.330 align:middle line:84%
on the Rendlesham incident
have gone missing."

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Officials found a huge gap
where defense intelligence files

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.670 align:middle line:90%
should have been.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.210 align:middle line:84%
However, Bentwaters
and Rendlesham Forest

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.690 align:middle line:84%
are not missing from
the Project Condign UAP

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.450 align:middle line:84%
study that was first delivered
to the MOD in December 2000,

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.200 align:middle line:84%
11 years before MOD Rendlesham
files went missing at the UK

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.660 align:middle line:90%
National Archives.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Annex F in the UAP
study is titled,

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.370 align:middle line:84%
"Non-ionizing Electromagnetic
Effects on Humans."

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.840 align:middle line:84%
Non-ionizing means
electrons are not

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.120 align:middle line:84%
stripped from atoms as alpha,
beta, and gamma radiations are.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Instead, the Condign study
describes complex combinations

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.100 align:middle line:84%
of non-ionizing electromagnetic
radiations from UAP/UFOs

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.440 align:middle line:84%
that are capable at
certain distances

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.320 align:middle line:84%
and various frequencies
of damaging human tissues

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.120 align:middle line:90%
and manipulating human minds.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.900 align:middle line:84%
Page F4 about UAPs is entitled,
"Potential Mental Effects

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.160 align:middle line:90%
on Humans."

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.010 align:middle line:10%
One of its most important
paragraph states,

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.280 align:middle line:10%
"The well-reported Rendlesham
Forest Bentwaters event

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.340 align:middle line:10%
is an example where
it might be postulated

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.560 align:middle line:10%
that several observers
were probably

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.960 align:middle line:10%
exposed to UAP radiation
for longer than normal UAP

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.330 align:middle line:10%
sighting periods," close quote.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Those words, "longer than
normal UAP sighting periods,"

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.350 align:middle line:84%
implies that the
UK'S DI55 has learned

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.810 align:middle line:84%
enough about various UAP/UFO
non-ionizing radiations

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.350 align:middle line:84%
to at least have a
baseline on the time

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.720 align:middle line:84%
of average human exposures
to such radiations.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.870 align:middle line:84%
What UAP radiation
can do is described

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.820 align:middle line:90%
in the next paragraph 14.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.910 align:middle line:84%
"An important fact is
that the reported effect

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.360 align:middle line:84%
of presumed UAP
radiation on humans

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.090 align:middle line:84%
is that it is quick-acting and
remembered, although curiously.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Following the UAP event,
there is little or no recall

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.790 align:middle line:90%
of events as a continuum.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.040 align:middle line:84%
In short, the
witness often reports

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.300 align:middle line:84%
an apparent gaps or
lost time, often not

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.270 align:middle line:84%
accounting for up
to several hours.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.810 align:middle line:84%
It is described as though
the exposure causes

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.980 align:middle line:90%
a temporary memory erasure."

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:14.860 align:middle line:84%
The next paragraph 15 states,
"It is concluded, therefore,

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.060 align:middle line:84%
that if some UAPs, as is
believed and correlated

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.890 align:middle line:84%
by actual reports, like
collateral effects on car

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:27.490 align:middle line:84%
electrical equipment, and
they produce EM radiation,

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.800 align:middle line:84%
then there is a high probability
that the UAP radiation can

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.160 align:middle line:90%
affect the human brain."

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.850 align:middle line:84%
The Condign study does
not give specific details

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.320 align:middle line:84%
about exactly which
non-ionizing frequencies emitted

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.680 align:middle line:84%
from UAP/UFOs can
manipulate human minds.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.980 align:middle line:84%
That's probably
highly classified.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.730 align:middle line:84%
But UFO investigators are very
familiar with screen memories

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.720 align:middle line:84%
in the human abduction syndrome,
when an alien being appears

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.760 align:middle line:84%
to be an owl or a deer
or even a close relative.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:09.700 align:middle line:84%
But it is a report that
confirms that UAP non-ionizing

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:15.190 align:middle line:84%
frequencies can injure
human hearts and eyes

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.670 align:middle line:84%
and produce telepathic
images, such as symbols

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:23.880 align:middle line:84%
and binary code, and
cause memory erasure.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:30.580 align:middle line:10%
But page F7 of Annex F lists
different UAP or UFO diameters,

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:36.370 align:middle line:10%
ranging from 1/2 meter
to 20 meters, or 66 feet.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:40.920 align:middle line:10%
And this is talking about
some kind of hard craft.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:49.810 align:middle line:10%
The DI55 study, quote, "assumes
that UAP is a radiation plasma

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.660 align:middle line:10%
or charged mass source with
effective aperture shown."

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.810 align:middle line:84%
These are the words
in the report.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And that means the
diameter of these UAPs.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.310 align:middle line:10%
"However, this should
not be confused"--

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.370 align:middle line:10%
and this is from
Project Condign.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:10.010 align:middle line:84%
"This should not be confused
with the large triangles,

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:15.250 align:middle line:84%
rectangles, and other large
shapes reported," close quote.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.980 align:middle line:10%
So right here in
this study, UAPs

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.440 align:middle line:10%
are further defined
as something that

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.350 align:middle line:10%
comes in various
large shapes, seen

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.680 align:middle line:10%
in the Earth's atmosphere,
that are not shaped

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.610 align:middle line:10%
like terrestrial aircraft.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.950 align:middle line:10%
Certain frequencies of
non-ionizing radiation,

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:36.990 align:middle line:10%
which essentially are
radio-frequency electromagnetic

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.500 align:middle line:10%
energies, from radio
waves to microwaves

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:46.410 align:middle line:10%
to infrared to visible
light, include terahertz,

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:50.370 align:middle line:10%
the red underlying
frequencies between extremely

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:56.250 align:middle line:10%
high frequency microwaves
and far to near infrared.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.760 align:middle line:10%
Those terahertz
frequencies have now

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.410 align:middle line:10%
been linked to the heart
tissue damage of John Burrows

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:08.880 align:middle line:10%
at RAF Bentwaters,
Woodbridge, in December 1980.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.440 align:middle line:84%
So terahertz emitted from
extraterrestrial UFO craft

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.600 align:middle line:84%
might be why there
have been reports

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.770 align:middle line:84%
over the decades about ETs
warning human abductees

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:23.820 align:middle line:84%
or contactees not to
approach a UFO craft too

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.920 align:middle line:84%
closely until the
craft has landed

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.790 align:middle line:84%
and shut down its
propulsion system.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:33.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to share more about
John Burroughs and that context

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.880 align:middle line:90%
in a few minutes.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.910 align:middle line:84%
In this important
Project Condign,

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:43.720 align:middle line:84%
the appendix A5 lists
exotic technologies.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.650 align:middle line:10%
There, exotic
solutions are described

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:50.880 align:middle line:10%
as "force beyond human
understanding and contrary

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.080 align:middle line:10%
to the laws of physics as we
understand them," close quote.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:00.410 align:middle line:10%
Another section is entitled,
"UAPs as Propelled Vehicles."

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:06.090 align:middle line:10%
There, the DI55 study dismisses
a lot of UAP reports as natural

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:12.210 align:middle line:10%
phenomena, but then it discusses
the residual percentage of UAP

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:16.530 align:middle line:10%
reports that cannot
be explained.

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:21.270 align:middle line:84%
One of the extreme postulations
is that these residual UAPs

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:26.100 align:middle line:84%
are, in fact, genuine
constructed air vehicles which

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.720 align:middle line:84%
use potential scientific and
engineering principles which

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.110 align:middle line:84%
are beyond currently
applied knowledge.

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Thus, they must have some
sort of propulsion systems

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.740 align:middle line:84%
which would provide
the extraordinary range

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:44.340 align:middle line:84%
of velocities and
accelerations and presumably

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:49.110 align:middle line:84%
both endo- and
exo-atmospheric capabilities.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.270 align:middle line:90%
That's Project Condign words.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And it means they
can move in and out

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.170 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth's atmosphere.

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And that methods of
propulsion may, in fact,

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:04.920 align:middle line:84%
be possible that are beyond
our current understanding

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.510 align:middle line:90%
in the UK.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:09.780 align:middle line:84%
The DI55 report then
goes through a list

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.480 align:middle line:84%
of various exotic
propulsions that

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.350 align:middle line:84%
might be used by
observed UAPs such as

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:21.210 align:middle line:84%
anti-matter, anti-proton
propulsion, electric propulsion

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:25.340 align:middle line:84%
technologies, including
arc jets, stationary plasma

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.230 align:middle line:84%
thrust, ion thrusters,
field emission

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:33.870 align:middle line:84%
propulsion, projected energy,
torsion, gravity, and laser

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:38.550 align:middle line:84%
fields that might apply to
remote sensing, geovision

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.320 align:middle line:84%
and geoscan and
modeling planets,

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.280 align:middle line:90%
the sun and other space objects.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:48.840 align:middle line:84%
There is also laser propulsion
and microwave propulsion.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.610 align:middle line:10%
In paragraph 31 about
propulsion options,

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:57.780 align:middle line:10%
DI55 contemplates whether the
UAP propulsion systems could

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:02.010 align:middle line:10%
be duplicated with terrestrial
technology and concludes,

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:06.630 align:middle line:10%
quote, "Propulsion mode is
the key factor in considering

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.720 align:middle line:10%
whether it would be
possible to construct

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.390 align:middle line:10%
a vehicle with
reported UAP attributes

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:17.640 align:middle line:10%
and potentially with an
extraterrestrial capability,

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:21.690 align:middle line:10%
using existing Earth
technology or be

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:26.100 align:middle line:10%
possible to conceive such a
craft, which can move with zero

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.880 align:middle line:10%
or near-zero sound,
meaning silent,

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.170 align:middle line:10%
and change the direction of
movement almost instantly,"

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:35.760 align:middle line:10%
close quote.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.700 align:middle line:84%
So the UK's Ministry
of Defense has

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:43.410 align:middle line:84%
been trying to understand how
UAP/UFOs work without sound

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:47.520 align:middle line:84%
at extremely high speeds,
jumping point to point

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.520 align:middle line:90%
and making 90-degree turns.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:56.040 align:middle line:84%
That makes this entire
460-page UAP study

00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:02.130 align:middle line:84%
a confirmation that UAPs,
UFOs are real and physically

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.260 align:middle line:90%
affect Earth life.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:11.620 align:middle line:10%
That means UAPs UFOs are of
great defense significance.

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:19.660 align:middle line:10%
That is why this 2000 Project
Condign study by the MOD's DI55

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:24.070 align:middle line:10%
is a smoking gun that
confirms government knowledge

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:28.270 align:middle line:10%
of UAPs/UFOs as very
advanced technologies that

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:33.430 align:middle line:10%
emit non-ionizing radiation
that can injure human bodies

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:36.360 align:middle line:10%
and manipulate human minds.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.150 align:middle line:84%
When we were in England
working on the "Ancient Aliens"

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:43.650 align:middle line:84%
production, none of us knew
about the Project Condign DI55

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:49.260 align:middle line:84%
report that links non-ionizing
radiation from Unidentified

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Aerial Phenomena to
injury of human tissues

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:56.070 align:middle line:84%
and manipulation of
human brains and minds.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:14:00.660 align:middle line:84%
We all returned to the United
States on New Year's 2011.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And a month later in February,
John Burroughs became very ill.

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:08.340 align:middle line:84%
He was diagnosed with
congestive heart failure

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.560 align:middle line:90%
and atrial fibrillation.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.870 align:middle line:84%
His lungs were
filling up with water

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.090 align:middle line:84%
because his heart
was not pumping right

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:16.860 align:middle line:90%
and would get out of rhythm.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:21.030 align:middle line:84%
When John went to the Phoenix
VA for medical disability help,

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:24.120 align:middle line:84%
to his dismay and
shock the VA told

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:28.970 align:middle line:84%
him there were no military
records of John being in the US

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Air Force at RAF Bentwaters,
Woodbridge, between 1979

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.240 align:middle line:90%
and 1982.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.770 align:middle line:84%
So John sought the help of
Arizona US Senator Jon Kyl.

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:44.610 align:middle line:84%
John was able to provide his own
personal military file records

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.850 align:middle line:84%
that he had definitely
been an Airman First

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Class at the big NATO base
in England from 1979 to 1982.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:59.040 align:middle line:84%
The next shocking
information came in a letter

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.250 align:middle line:84%
from Senator Kyl's office,
in which the VA said

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:05.810 align:middle line:84%
John's medical records have
been withheld because John's Air

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Force medical records
were classified.

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Senator Kyl, Retired, and
US Senator John McCain

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.980 align:middle line:84%
picked up John Borough's
fight with the VA,

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:23.250 align:middle line:84%
and his office was able to get
John's DD 214 official military

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:28.380 align:middle line:84%
record corrected to show that
he was, in fact, on US Air Force

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:31.410 align:middle line:84%
duty at RAF Bentwaters,
Woodbridge, England,

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:35.850 align:middle line:90%
from 1979 to 1982.

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:39.060 align:middle line:84%
By then, John
Burroughs was so ill

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.880 align:middle line:84%
with persistent
atrial fibrillation,

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.550 align:middle line:84%
but various medical
tests could not

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:47.220 align:middle line:84%
find any evidence
of heart disease,

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.350 align:middle line:90%
such as clogged arteries.

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:52.200 align:middle line:84%
John's heart condition
worsened to life-threatening

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:57.780 align:middle line:84%
by the fall of 2013, while
Arizona VA cardiologists

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:01.230 align:middle line:90%
remained very puzzled about why.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:05.730 align:middle line:10%
That's when John first received
some pages from the UK Condign

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:12.030 align:middle line:10%
report about Unidentified Aerial
Phenomena from a retired MOD

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:17.190 align:middle line:10%
staffer, and the information
about terahertz frequencies

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:21.810 align:middle line:10%
emitted from refers that can
damage human tissues, including

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:25.080 align:middle line:10%
hearts, and manipulate
human minds.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:29.910 align:middle line:84%
So next came help from a
longtime medical consultant

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:33.090 align:middle line:84%
to the Central
Intelligence Agency.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:37.020 align:middle line:84%
He knew about UFO impacts
on human minds and bodies

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:40.950 align:middle line:84%
and that the likelihood was
the mitral valve leaflets

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:44.100 align:middle line:90%
in John's heart were damaged.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:48.150 align:middle line:84%
That CIA doctor ended up sharing
his confidential knowledge

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:50.640 align:middle line:90%
with John's civilian doctors.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:55.890 align:middle line:84%
When John had open heart
surgery on December 18, 2013,

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:59.280 align:middle line:84%
the surgeons found that
the posterior leaflet

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.700 align:middle line:84%
in the mitral valve was
shredded and the interior

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.130 align:middle line:90%
was torn and disintegrating.

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:08.760 align:middle line:84%
One doctor told John,
quote, "If you did not

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.099 align:middle line:84%
have that surgery
then, you would

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:16.109 align:middle line:84%
have dropped dead two or three
days later," close quote.

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:20.160 align:middle line:10%
Finally in January 2015,
the Veterans Administration

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.599 align:middle line:10%
finally and officially granted
retired US Air Force Tech

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:28.050 align:middle line:10%
Sergeant John Burroughs
for medical disability

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:31.080 align:middle line:10%
for injuries in the
line of duty when

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:36.090 align:middle line:10%
John was exposed to
non-ionizing radiation at close

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:40.050 align:middle line:10%
range twice from
unidentified lights

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:45.120 align:middle line:10%
and beams in Rendlesham Forest
December 26 and December 28,

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.800 align:middle line:10%
1980.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.190 align:middle line:10%
That is when John's attorneys
send out a press release

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:54.400 align:middle line:10%
to the world headlined,
quote, "US government's

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:59.400 align:middle line:10%
de facto acknowledgment
of the existence of UFOs,"

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.470 align:middle line:10%
close quote.

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:04.680 align:middle line:10%
I interviewed both John and
his attorney Pat Frascogna

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:09.090 align:middle line:10%
in February for a two-part Earth
Files report and several radio

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:14.670 align:middle line:10%
broadcasts and other
programs about the VA and MOD

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:15.990 align:middle line:10%
breakthroughs.

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:21.510 align:middle line:84%
By March 8, I also did an Earth
Files news segment on YouTube.

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And in all those broadcasts,
I stressed that, to this day,

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:30.720 align:middle line:84%
John Burroughs' 1979 to 1982
medical records from his US Air

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.770 align:middle line:84%
Force assignment at RAF
Bentwaters, Woodbridge,

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:39.870 align:middle line:84%
are still withheld by
the VA as classified.

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:45.000 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of buzz about
that news on the internet.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.150 align:middle line:84%
By the evening of
March 13, 2015,

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:52.290 align:middle line:84%
this reply header showed up
in the Above Top Secret thread

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:55.800 align:middle line:84%
under a discussion
topic listed as, quote,

00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:00.870 align:middle line:84%
"US Department of Defense has
confirmed the UFO phenomena is

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:02.670 align:middle line:90%
real," close quote.

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:04.260 align:middle line:90%
That's what they led with.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.470 align:middle line:84%
The thread discussion
centered around the question,

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:10.110 align:middle line:84%
why would John Burroughs'
medical records from RAF

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Bentwaters, Woodbridge, be
classified, and was that legal?

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:20.130 align:middle line:84%
The name on the thread
header is Kit Green.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:25.740 align:middle line:84%
More formally, Kit Green is
Christopher Kit Green, MD.

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1982, Dr. Green was
on a list called The Aviary.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:34.110 align:middle line:84%
This was a list of bird names
unofficially put together

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:38.250 align:middle line:84%
by UFO investigators William
Moore and Jaime Shandera

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:42.330 align:middle line:84%
as code names for a few
anonymous whistleblowers

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:44.610 align:middle line:90%
and UFO researchers.

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:47.580 align:middle line:84%
Some on the list were
professional investigators,

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:51.600 align:middle line:84%
such as astronomer and
author Jacques Valais.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Others were from
counter-intelligence

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:57.870 align:middle line:84%
trying to maintain the old
World War II policy of denial

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.660 align:middle line:84%
about extraterrestrial
technologies

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:04.320 align:middle line:84%
and biological entities
interacting with Earth, past

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.030 align:middle line:90%
and present.

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Kitt Green was on
that list as Blue Jay.

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:16.410 align:middle line:84%
He admits he worked for the
Central Intelligence Agency

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:19.620 align:middle line:84%
on remote-viewing
research and later became

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:24.810 align:middle line:84%
chief of biomedical
sciences at General Motors.

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:27.600 align:middle line:84%
More recently, Dr.
Green has worked

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.080 align:middle line:84%
as assistant dean, Asia
Pacific, in the Wayne State

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.810 align:middle line:84%
School of Medicine
and as Professor

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:37.290 align:middle line:84%
of diagnostic radiology
and psychiatry

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:39.750 align:middle line:90%
in the Detroit Medical Center.

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Here is Dr. Green's entire and
extraordinary March 13, 2015,

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:47.965 align:middle line:90%
statement.

00:20:47.965 --> 00:20:50.580 align:middle line:90%


00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:56.730 align:middle line:10%
"I am Christopher Kit
Green, MD, PhD, FAAFS,"

00:20:56.730 --> 00:21:02.410 align:middle line:10%
which stands for Fellow American
Academy of Forensic Sciences.

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:07.150 align:middle line:10%
"This is a reply to
the entire thread

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:09.490 align:middle line:10%
and will only address
two issues that

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:13.600 align:middle line:10%
are common throughout many
comments on this thread.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.550 align:middle line:10%
They are question number one--

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:20.120 align:middle line:10%
how can it be true that medical
records such as John Burroughs'

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:22.250 align:middle line:10%
could have been classified?

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.020 align:middle line:90%
Is this true?

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.380 align:middle line:90%
Is it sensible?

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.460 align:middle line:90%
What are the reasons?

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.550 align:middle line:90%
And question number two--

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:32.910 align:middle line:84%
what caused his injuries
and several other present

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:35.640 align:middle line:84%
over the encounter
with the odd air

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:41.190 align:middle line:84%
form that emitted the broadband,
non-ionizing electromagnetic

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:44.000 align:middle line:90%
radiation?

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.780 align:middle line:90%
It is true.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:51.910 align:middle line:10%
John Burroughs' records,
about 1,000 pages,

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:55.360 align:middle line:10%
and to this day still many
hundreds were, in fact,

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.760 align:middle line:10%
legally classified.

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:02.230 align:middle line:10%
In my 46-year career as a
medical officer and a physician

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:05.890 align:middle line:10%
with CIA, including
as staff officer,

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:09.490 align:middle line:10%
chief of medical intelligence,
life sciences division,

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:12.010 align:middle line:10%
and assistant national
intelligence officer

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:19.300 align:middle line:10%
for science and technology, I
had, until a year or so ago,

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:24.010 align:middle line:10%
only seen a handful of truly
classified medical records--

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:29.540 align:middle line:10%
those of Adolf Hitler,
John Kennedy's autopsy,

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.730 align:middle line:10%
and recently, John Burroughs.

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:34.640 align:middle line:84%
I was able to quickly
determine that the reasons were

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.470 align:middle line:90%
quite simple.

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:39.770 align:middle line:84%
Medical records are
not usually digital,

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:43.700 align:middle line:84%
and they are easily sequestered
in multiple locations

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.430 align:middle line:90%
and almost impossible to find.

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:53.100 align:middle line:84%
These of John's were and
remain, except for recent years,

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:59.970 align:middle line:84%
in hard copy, scanned and
separated from FOIA access

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:02.490 align:middle line:90%
and even from my access.

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Thank God that a couple of
senators, John McCain and Jon

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Kyl from Arizona,
had the guts to push

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:13.200 align:middle line:84%
and push to disentangle
that which was legitimately

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.420 align:middle line:84%
classified from
those records that

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.980 align:middle line:84%
were needed to make the
right decision about injuries

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:21.390 align:middle line:90%
sustained while on active duty--

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:22.830 align:middle line:90%
period.

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:24.750 align:middle line:90%
It is/was true.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:26.040 align:middle line:90%
It is sensible.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:30.240 align:middle line:84%
It is not entirely the stuff to
make us physicians very proud.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Very, very few physicians even
care about this arcane area

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:39.360 align:middle line:84%
of research and fewer
know about the injuries

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:44.790 align:middle line:84%
sustained by near-field,
about 100 meters, to humans.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:47.050 align:middle line:90%
That's 328 feet.

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:50.130 align:middle line:84%
That's about the length
of a football field.

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:52.110 align:middle line:90%
The data is sparse.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:54.960 align:middle line:84%
It is not properly
peer-reviewed.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.880 align:middle line:90%
It is not understood.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.820 align:middle line:84%
It is not the subject
of current research.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:03.670 align:middle line:90%
And that is the truth.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:07.570 align:middle line:84%
The decision that was made
to grant medical disability

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:11.030 align:middle line:90%
to John was just.

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Even though the MOD had made a
large, public show back in 2011

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:20.690 align:middle line:84%
that it had released
all of its UFO/UPA files

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:26.816 align:middle line:84%
to UK'S National Archives,
the MOD clearly had not.

00:24:26.816 --> 00:24:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Not long after the surgery
that saved John's life,

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:34.640 align:middle line:84%
he began filing Freedom of
Information Act inquiries

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.720 align:middle line:84%
to the Ministry of Defense
about Project Condign.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.450 align:middle line:10%
That's when a series
of MOD replies

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:47.660 align:middle line:10%
through 2014 led to the MOD's
finally admitting by September

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:55.340 align:middle line:10%
of 2014 that it has withheld
18 UFO-related files,

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:59.105 align:middle line:10%
including six policy
files not stated

00:24:59.105 --> 00:25:03.650 align:middle line:10%
as specific to RAF Bentwaters,
Woodbridge, of 1980.

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:07.310 align:middle line:84%
But finally, a
Ministry of Defense

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:10.820 align:middle line:84%
admission that all of
their publicity in earlier

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:15.380 align:middle line:84%
years about transferring all
MOD UFO files to the UK National

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:20.390 align:middle line:84%
Archive was as phony as
telling the BBC that, quote,

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:23.600 align:middle line:84%
"Intelligence papers on
the Rendlesham incident

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:27.620 align:middle line:90%
have gone missing," close quote.

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:31.010 align:middle line:84%
Ward Black of Brentwood in
England's parliament in March

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:35.060 align:middle line:84%
2015 and a few
times since then has

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:39.530 align:middle line:84%
asked the Ministry of
Defense to release the 18 MOD

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:42.980 align:middle line:84%
files about Unexplained
Flying Objects.

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:46.490 align:middle line:84%
But strangely, in an
unprecedented action

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:52.240 align:middle line:84%
in English history, in
June 2016 the MOD finally

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:57.590 align:middle line:84%
but completely secretly
transferred the 18 files

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:01.790 align:middle line:84%
to the UK National
Archive, only to take them

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:09.410 align:middle line:84%
all back to the MOD in August
2016 without explanation.

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:11.750 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning
of January 2015,

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:15.650 align:middle line:84%
John Burroughs finally received
full medical disability

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:18.560 align:middle line:84%
from the Veterans
Administration for injuries

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.960 align:middle line:84%
in the line of
duty after exposure

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.590 align:middle line:84%
to non-ionizing radiation
at close range in Rendlesham

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:26.190 align:middle line:90%
Forest.

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:30.090 align:middle line:84%
His attorney was proud to
issue that press release that

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:33.240 align:middle line:84%
was headlined, "US government's
de facto acknowledgment

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:37.410 align:middle line:84%
of the existence of
UFOs," in acknowledging

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:41.610 align:middle line:84%
that John's injury was in the
line of duty after exposure

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:46.480 align:middle line:84%
to UFO's emitting
terahertz frequencies.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.420 align:middle line:10%
In addition to the
physical and mental impacts

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:51.790 align:middle line:10%
that the terahertz
frequencies of the phenomenon

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:56.320 align:middle line:10%
had on John Burroughs and
others, only a few weeks ago

00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:02.230 align:middle line:10%
on April 16, 2016, the UK'S
"Mirror" headline, quote,

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:06.640 align:middle line:10%
"Radar operators say UFO
traveled 120 miles in eight

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:10.480 align:middle line:10%
seconds in Britain's
famed close encounter,"

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:14.050 align:middle line:10%
close quote, referring to the
Rendlesham Forest incident

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:17.290 align:middle line:10%
of December 26 to 28, 1980.

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:21.550 align:middle line:10%
That information came from two
former radar operators, Ike

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:25.510 align:middle line:10%
Barker and Jim Carey, who
were on duty in an air traffic

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:27.550 align:middle line:10%
control tower.

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:31.570 align:middle line:84%
The two men, now retired
from US Air Force radar work,

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:33.880 align:middle line:84%
were interviewed for
a new documentary film

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:36.610 align:middle line:84%
by UFO investigator
Robert Hastings entitled

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:40.600 align:middle line:84%
"UFOs and Nukes, the
Secret Link Revealed."

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Some observers back
in December 1980

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:46.930 align:middle line:84%
thought lights and/or beams
went down into the weapons

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:50.800 align:middle line:84%
storage areas containing
tactical nuclear weapons.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.710 align:middle line:84%
There have been rumors that some
of the nuclear weapons at RAF

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Bentwaters, Woodbridge,
were tampered

00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:00.860 align:middle line:84%
with by the Unidentified
Aerial Phenomena.

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:03.910 align:middle line:84%
Ike Barker says the
anomalous radar target

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:09.070 align:middle line:84%
crossed their screens at the
astounding speed of 120 miles

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:10.990 align:middle line:90%
in eight seconds.

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:17.080 align:middle line:90%
That is 54,000 miles an hour.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:20.470 align:middle line:84%
That is about 70 times
the speed of sound

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:23.770 align:middle line:84%
and definitely not
human technology.

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Barker said, quote, "It
wasn't like any radar

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:28.210 align:middle line:90%
target I've ever seen.

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:31.330 align:middle line:84%
It was traveling at an
extremely high rate of speed.

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:35.800 align:middle line:84%
It passed over the control
tower, and then it stopped.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.960 align:middle line:84%
There were lights
around the center,

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.090 align:middle line:90%
but not like navigation lights.

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:44.230 align:middle line:84%
It was more like portholes, as
if you were seeing the lights

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:47.050 align:middle line:90%
from the inside coming out.

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:51.760 align:middle line:84%
It hovered momentarily,
then reversed its course

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:56.940 align:middle line:84%
and went back out at
a high rate of speed."

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:59.790 align:middle line:84%
The intensities of
unknown frequencies fields

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:02.250 align:middle line:84%
and radiations that people
in Rendlesham Forest

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:07.140 align:middle line:84%
were exposed to between
December 26 and 28, 1980,

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:10.020 align:middle line:84%
became even a more
dramatic question

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.740 align:middle line:84%
when talking with the woman
retired from the Woodbridge

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Elementary School that I have
referenced in another "Truth

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:18.540 align:middle line:90%
Hunter."

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And here is a second
excerpt from her

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:26.310 align:middle line:84%
in our interview on
December 29, 2010,

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:30.380 align:middle line:84%
an interview in
Woodbridge, England.

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>> So it was on Monday.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And when I got to the school,
the workmen were there.

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And they were saying that
the house that had been there

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.950 align:middle line:90%
wasn't there anymore.

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what do you mean
that house isn't there anymore?

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And they said the
house was gone.

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.710 align:middle line:84%
That's how we knew
that there was a house.

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:55.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, I didn't ask
Colonel Halt if he

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:57.360 align:middle line:90%
had to sign the statement.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.760 align:middle line:84%
But I think the reason being
that it was the two of us

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.020 align:middle line:90%
is because we were civilians.

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe in 1980 it was so
incomprehensible to say there

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:10.030 align:middle line:84%
was a house and people and
everything was here and then it

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:11.320 align:middle line:90%
wasn't here.

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, some of them, as I
understand it from my workmen,

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:16.570 align:middle line:90%
though, they went to the police.

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to know
what happened to the house.

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:23.530 align:middle line:84%
>> The woman said the house
that disappeared was, quote,

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:26.800 align:middle line:84%
"right across from the
east gate," close quote.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.860 align:middle line:84%
From her Woodbridge home,
she would have driven down

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:34.210 align:middle line:84%
this road, turned right onto
this back road to the east gate

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:36.970 align:middle line:84%
as a shortcut from town
to the elementary school

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:38.650 align:middle line:90%
near the airbase.

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:41.380 align:middle line:84%
This is a currently
available Google map,

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:45.310 align:middle line:84%
where I marked the east gate
with a straight, yellow line

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:48.730 align:middle line:84%
and marked the Foley house
with a yellow circle.

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Along the road to
the east gate, there

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:54.400 align:middle line:84%
are two patches of
trees and bushes

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.000 align:middle line:84%
that might once have grown
around a house or building.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Nearby, there is
also a rectangle

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:02.200 align:middle line:84%
that might have
been the foundation

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.060 align:middle line:90%
of a structure there.

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:07.810 align:middle line:84%
I have tried calling the woman
again, but there is no answer.

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:10.330 align:middle line:90%
She might not be alive now.

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:13.570 align:middle line:84%
John Burroughs, I, and a
Woodbridge, England, friend

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:20.560 align:middle line:84%
have also tried to find a 1980
or 1979 aerial map or ordinance

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.860 align:middle line:84%
map that would show
the east gate to see

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:27.040 align:middle line:84%
if another house was
nearby in addition

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:29.920 align:middle line:90%
to the longstanding Foley house.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:35.020 align:middle line:84%
But it is as if someone scrubbed
clean not only internet maps,

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:38.440 align:middle line:84%
but our Woodbridge friend
was told by the local Suffolk

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:43.270 align:middle line:84%
County records office that
all maps and ordinance

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:50.230 align:middle line:84%
surveys for 1980 are
missing there as well.

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:54.840 align:middle line:84%
The suspicion is the
government took them.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.860 align:middle line:84%
The idea that a house would
disappear after strange lights,

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:03.250 align:middle line:84%
beams, and a UFO were
in the nearby forest?

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Probably a lot of
you are thinking,

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:08.230 align:middle line:84%
as I did, about the Philadelphia
Experiment that allegedly

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:12.640 align:middle line:90%
took place October 28, 1943.

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.250 align:middle line:84%
But other people
since 1943 have also

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:20.810 align:middle line:84%
alleged that the whole ship
popped in and out of our space

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:25.550 align:middle line:84%
time between Norfolk, Virginia,
and the Philadelphia Naval

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:27.020 align:middle line:90%
shipyard.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:31.790 align:middle line:84%
So there is a possibility
of space time manipulation

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:34.340 align:middle line:84%
in Rendlesham
Forest as well that

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:37.850 align:middle line:84%
would have caused the
disappearance of that house.

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:42.890 align:middle line:84%
John and Jim each told me
that on December 26, 1980,

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:46.680 align:middle line:84%
when they were trying to follow
the lights through the trees--

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.500 align:middle line:90%
and this was a quote--

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.410 align:middle line:90%
"time seem to slow down."

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Both felt like they were
moving in slow motion

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:56.510 align:middle line:84%
and remembered
their skin tingled,

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:58.940 align:middle line:84%
and the hair on their
heads and their necks

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:03.910 align:middle line:84%
rose like they were in a
strong electrostatic field.

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:08.020 align:middle line:84%
It was Jim Penniston who
remembered the intense flare

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:11.620 align:middle line:84%
of white light, seeing a
small, black, glassy triangular

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:15.250 align:middle line:84%
craft on the forest floor
right after the blinding, white

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:16.270 align:middle line:90%
light.

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant Penniston did
not know where John was,

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:22.090 align:middle line:84%
but he walked around the
craft dragging his fingers

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:24.400 align:middle line:84%
over its smooth,
glassy surface that

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.940 align:middle line:84%
felt warmer than the
cold, humid winter air.

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:31.420 align:middle line:84%
When he got to the front right
side of the triangle vertex,

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:33.730 align:middle line:84%
there were symbols that
were raised like braille,

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:35.200 align:middle line:90%
Penniston said.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.560 align:middle line:84%
As his fingers traced along
the tops of the symbols,

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.670 align:middle line:84%
his mind was filled with
0s and 1s, binary code,

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:45.040 align:middle line:84%
and telepathic thoughts
about the source

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:47.240 align:middle line:90%
of the black triangle.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And he thought that
what came into his mind

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:58.810 align:middle line:84%
was human time travelers from
40,000 years in the future,

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:02.680 align:middle line:84%
that their mission was to
harvest genetic material

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.950 align:middle line:84%
from an Earth timeline
so that it could

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:10.060 align:middle line:84%
be used as band-aids to
keep the civilization

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:14.739 align:middle line:84%
alive in a far future that
faces survival problems.

00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:18.580 align:middle line:10%
Physicist and astrobiologist
Paul Davies at Arizona State

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:23.469 align:middle line:10%
University is author of "How
to Build a Time Machine"

00:34:23.469 --> 00:34:27.190 align:middle line:10%
and another book,
"The Eerie Silence,

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:31.150 align:middle line:10%
Renewing Our Search for
Alien Intelligence."

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:36.969 align:middle line:84%
In "Eerie Silence" on page 121,
Professor Davies wrote, quote,

00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:40.600 align:middle line:84%
"Our best understanding
of the nature of time

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:44.630 align:middle line:84%
comes from Einstein's
general theory of relativity,

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:47.380 align:middle line:84%
which does seem to permit
journeys, both forward

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:49.690 align:middle line:90%
and backward in time.

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:53.920 align:middle line:84%
All you need to do to
reach the future sooner

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:56.929 align:middle line:90%
is to move as fast as possible.

00:34:56.929 --> 00:35:03.490 align:middle line:84%
For example, at 99% of the speed
of light, if you set off now,

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:10.120 align:middle line:84%
you could reach Earth year
2100 in less than 13 years.

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Getting back from the future
is a much tougher challenge.

00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:16.900 align:middle line:84%
Although not strictly
forbidden by the general theory

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:20.380 align:middle line:84%
of relativity, journeying
backwards in time

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:23.830 align:middle line:84%
involves exotic
super technology,

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:28.120 align:middle line:84%
such as hypothetical wormholes
in space, that have an exit

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:31.240 align:middle line:90%
and entrance," close quote.

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:35.740 align:middle line:84%
But so far, as we are
moving toward the middle

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:40.690 align:middle line:84%
of the 21st century, even
CERN's Large Hadron Collider

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:44.860 align:middle line:84%
has not turned up
a single wormhole.

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:46.840 align:middle line:84%
I have reported
about the concept

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:50.440 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
self-activated technology,

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:55.270 align:middle line:84%
like this photograph, that
uses self-activating software.

00:35:55.270 --> 00:36:00.490 align:middle line:84%
What if the Unidentified Aerial
Phenomena in Rendlesham Forest

00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:06.100 align:middle line:84%
so many years ago was an
unmanned time-traveling drone

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:12.130 align:middle line:84%
on an emergency survival
mission for its civilization?

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:17.050 align:middle line:84%
What if time travel involves
moving in and out of wormholes

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:19.780 align:middle line:84%
like point-to-point
energy bursts

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:23.870 align:middle line:84%
that we see as blinding
flashes of white light

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:28.360 align:middle line:84%
and might cause matter
to appear or disappear?

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:31.420 align:middle line:84%
There is a paradox
in Penniston's recall

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:35.320 align:middle line:84%
of the telepathic transmission
from the glowing craft.

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:41.440 align:middle line:10%
The implication is that the time
travelers are human descendants

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:44.800 align:middle line:10%
from a place 40,000
years in the future,

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.800 align:middle line:10%
where humanity is dying out.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:51.220 align:middle line:84%
Time machine craft are
sent back through time

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:55.150 align:middle line:84%
to harvest genetic material
from our present Earth life

00:36:55.150 --> 00:37:00.010 align:middle line:84%
in order to help a future
civilization survive.

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:03.730 align:middle line:84%
The explanation given for
traveling thousands of years

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:08.440 align:middle line:84%
into the past was to avoid
affecting the time travelers'

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:13.510 align:middle line:84%
own future timeline in some
dangerous, uncontrollable way.

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:19.870 align:middle line:84%
But moving backwards in time
to a distant past to survive

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:23.140 align:middle line:90%
is changing the future.

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the paradox is
a translation problem

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:30.610 align:middle line:84%
in which we humans lack the
language and understanding

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:35.230 align:middle line:84%
of a different cosmology than
we have discovered so far.

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Fans of Star Trek and Star
Wars and other science fiction

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:43.480 align:middle line:84%
are accustomed to plots that
include allies or enemies

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:47.890 align:middle line:84%
that use time travel for
transportation, to fight wars,

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:52.450 align:middle line:84%
to change destinies, and
to even gain immortality.

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Whether the different
lights, beams, craft,

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.990 align:middle line:84%
and symbols in
Rendlesham Forest belong

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:02.920 align:middle line:84%
to time travelers or
extraterrestrial biological

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:07.780 align:middle line:84%
entities from inside this
universe or non-human entities

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:12.500 align:middle line:84%
from parallel universes
or other dimensions,

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.810 align:middle line:90%
why is the truth suppressed?

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:19.200 align:middle line:84%
Why can't governments
tell their citizens

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.890 align:middle line:84%
that humans are not
alone in this universe?

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:25.920 align:middle line:84%
What facts about other
intelligences interacting

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.470 align:middle line:84%
with Earth do
government insiders

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:31.830 align:middle line:84%
know and consider so
dangerous that they

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:36.450 align:middle line:84%
hide those facts for decades
under a policy of denial

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:39.460 align:middle line:84%
in the interest of
national security,

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:45.310 align:middle line:84%
even keeping John Burroughs'
medical records from Bentwaters

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:49.780 align:middle line:84%
classified from him
and everyone else

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:52.120 align:middle line:90%
when his heart was failing?

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:57.010 align:middle line:84%
If national security is
built on lies and deceptions,

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:59.730 align:middle line:90%
it is no one's security.

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:03.040 align:middle line:84%
It is social
imprisonment by illusion.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:07.240 align:middle line:84%
The 1980 high strangeness
in Rendlesham Forest

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.820 align:middle line:84%
has never rested easily
in the minds of those

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:11.830 align:middle line:90%
who were actually there.

00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:15.700 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps like human time-release
capsules, John Burroughs,

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:19.020 align:middle line:10%
Jim Penniston, Adrian
Bustinza, Colonel Halt,

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:22.120 align:middle line:10%
and all of the others
have embedded within them

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:26.890 align:middle line:10%
pieces of truth about an
incomprehensible future,

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:32.050 align:middle line:10%
or pieces of lies that keep
humans corralled by illusions.

00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Either way, whatever penetrated
the Rendlesham Forest

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:40.690 align:middle line:84%
in December 1980 is still
reverberating years later with

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:44.380 align:middle line:84%
so much power that John
Burroughs cannot forget

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:48.910 align:middle line:84%
the haunting, telepathic
lights and the question,

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:51.720 align:middle line:90%
what is their source?

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:55.270 align:middle line:84%
What if the key to the
Rendlesham Forest mystery

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:59.170 align:middle line:84%
is a tangle of past, present,
and future timelines,

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:01.400 align:middle line:90%
like a knot?

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:05.840 align:middle line:10%
If the knot is untied by
advanced technologies,

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:09.170 align:middle line:10%
what happens to past,
present, and future?

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:14.420 align:middle line:84%
What else disappears or
appears out of nowhere?

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Are we unconsciously in
the ultimate paradox?

00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:21.191 align:middle line:90%
We are they.

00:40:21.191 --> 00:40:23.210 align:middle line:90%
They are us.

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Life on Earth is
not guaranteed, but

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:31.100 align:middle line:84%
the mysterious, telepathic
lights and their makers

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:35.630 align:middle line:84%
are using us to help them
survive by coming back

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:39.170 align:middle line:84%
into time to the 20th
and 21st centuries,

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:44.780 align:middle line:84%
the last time genetic material
on Earth was worth harvesting.

00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:48.110 align:middle line:84%
If all humans became
conscious of other life

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:51.500 align:middle line:84%
in the universe and the
unexpected revelation

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:56.930 align:middle line:84%
that time manipulation is used
in cosmic survival efforts,

00:40:56.930 --> 00:41:02.270 align:middle line:84%
would our understanding change
the future for them and for us

00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:05.840 align:middle line:84%
to survival, or at
least buy more time

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:10.670 align:middle line:84%
in this universe of entropy,
where life is never guaranteed?

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Whatever revelations
come next, I

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:17.300 align:middle line:84%
think we are in the century
in which the whole Earth will

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:21.260 align:middle line:84%
learn that we are not the only
life in this vast universe

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:24.830 align:middle line:84%
and that other intelligences
are interacting now,

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:27.590 align:middle line:84%
as they have in the
past with this planet.

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:30.390 align:middle line:90%


00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:32.330 align:middle line:90%
This is Linda Moulton Howe.

00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Please stay tuned
to my "Truth Hunter"
