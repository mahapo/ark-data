00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.610 align:middle line:10%
>> With me today on this
"Truth Hunter" special is Tim,

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.310 align:middle line:10%
a tactical advisor to covert
German analysts who are trying

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.360 align:middle line:10%
to understand the missions
and strategies of non-human

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.400 align:middle line:10%
intelligences on our planet, in
this solar system, and beyond.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Tim, welcome to this special
edition of "Truth Hunter."

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you, Linda,
for having me.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.670 align:middle line:84%
>> After all of these
experiences with the Greys,

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.040 align:middle line:90%
what is the soul to you?

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>> So the soul is geometry.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.090 align:middle line:90%
It's information.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a container that contains
every information that you have

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.300 align:middle line:90%
collected over your lifetime.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.040 align:middle line:84%
A soul is something that
is being naturally formed

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.450 align:middle line:84%
and created in the moment when
a consciousness unit reaches

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.590 align:middle line:84%
a level 3 consciousness,
which means self-awareness.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.910 align:middle line:84%
So if we're talking about this
mug, for example, it's still--

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.400 align:middle line:90%
this is a living life form.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Even though humanity would
not subscribe to that,

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.700 align:middle line:84%
it's still a living life form,
but it has no self-awareness.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.250 align:middle line:84%
If it breaks, it doesn't
mean that it loses--

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.110 align:middle line:84%
it's not redefining its
own understanding, like,

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.720 align:middle line:84%
am I now two mugs
because it's broken,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.760 align:middle line:90%
or is this still one mug?

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.290 align:middle line:90%
It just is.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.940 align:middle line:90%
It's a life form that just is.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the inanimate life form.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Crystals are inanimate,
and yet crystals

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.630 align:middle line:84%
can store the information
that would be in a soul.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you really
start getting into this,

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.330 align:middle line:84%
it is as if there is a kind
of Twilight Zone between

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.260 align:middle line:84%
the organic and the inorganic,
and that the sense that

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.110 align:middle line:84%
I've had from so
many discussions,

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.410 align:middle line:84%
over 3,000 people I've
interviewed in the abduction

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.510 align:middle line:84%
syndrome, and it is as if this
whole universe is some sort

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.820 align:middle line:84%
of an experimental test
with organic consciousness,

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.210 align:middle line:90%
organic life.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And listening to
you, it is almost as

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.100 align:middle line:84%
if I'm being told that that
experiment automatically

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:40.740 align:middle line:84%
evolves toward inorganic, toward
not Greys, not tall whites, not

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Nordics, not reptilians, on
and on, that there could be all

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.660 align:middle line:84%
of these different
modes and frequencies

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.280 align:middle line:84%
that the universe
is to a huge scale

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.560 align:middle line:84%
of both organic and
inorganic material.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So this version of the
universe means ontologically,

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:12.640 align:middle line:84%
everything that is and
is not part of being.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.900 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.410 align:middle line:90%
It means-- it means everything--

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.210 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.278 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:03:18.278 --> 00:03:21.310 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, everything we
perceive right now,

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.870 align:middle line:84%
everything we can think
of, all this, all that is,

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.660 align:middle line:84%
everything that
potentially could be,

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.570 align:middle line:84%
everything you can think
of, everything I can think

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.840 align:middle line:84%
of, and everything in this
version of the universe that

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.900 align:middle line:84%
can think of it, exists
within the boundaries of this

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.700 align:middle line:90%
universe.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:47.050 align:middle line:84%
That is where we can form
technical models and ideas,

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.880 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
foundation, that we

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.890 align:middle line:84%
have an ontological ground
where we can put theories upon.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>> But currently, we are babies
still playing a few notes

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.580 align:middle line:84%
and being taught by
ETs how to advance.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.140 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, we're
an organic species,

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.620 align:middle line:84%
and we have inorganic
and organic intelligences

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.560 align:middle line:84%
interacting with us,
which always leads

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:22.210 align:middle line:84%
to the question, if there are
15 nonhuman species based inside

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.540 align:middle line:84%
of our planet, and in some
cases inside the mountains,

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.680 align:middle line:84%
and in a lot of cases deep
beneath the basins of water

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:37.060 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, what do
those 15 species want?

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>> So I don't know all of these
species from direct experience.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.470 align:middle line:84%
I have a direct experience
with some of them,

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.930 align:middle line:84%
like, a smaller number
of species that exist

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.930 align:middle line:90%
in the overall context of this.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.950 align:middle line:84%
But what I can say is that
we're dealing with a 95% to 5%

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:05.130 align:middle line:84%
percentage of good intentions,
benevolent intentions, which

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.700 align:middle line:84%
is the 95%, at least on
this level of frequency

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.460 align:middle line:84%
that we are here
experiencing on this planet.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.730 align:middle line:84%
The further up we go, the higher
the amount of aspects of life

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:23.340 align:middle line:84%
that are benevolent, but we also
have 5% in the, let's call it

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.300 align:middle line:84%
3D context, maybe,
of the universe,

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:36.030 align:middle line:84%
which might have
agendas that are opposed

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.660 align:middle line:90%
to what the human race wants.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>> What about insects
from Epsilon Eridani?

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Have you had matches of
various intelligences

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.260 align:middle line:90%
with various solar systems?

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not an expert on
insects or insectoids.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm used to dealing with
so-called exotic species

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.330 align:middle line:84%
like the Greys, and, like,
interfrequential beings, which

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.880 align:middle line:90%
we might be talking about later.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:09.600 align:middle line:84%
I did have a video
analysis of a group

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.250 align:middle line:84%
of praying mantis
beings that was somehow

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.980 align:middle line:90%
sent from them to Earth.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And the question
was, what is that?

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:22.910 align:middle line:90%
What's the message?

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.670 align:middle line:90%
What's the point of it?

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And because someone
else couldn't answer it,

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.780 align:middle line:84%
it's been given to
me as well in order

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.020 align:middle line:84%
to have my educated thought
on it, whatever that means.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.820 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>> You're talking
about a electronic,

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.090 align:middle line:84%
or some form of message from
praying mantises that was

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.350 align:middle line:84%
picked up by a
receiver on Earth?

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And you are trying
to translate it.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And right now, you think it
is from praying mantises?

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:07:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And does anybody have
even a partial translation?

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Not that I'm aware of.

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.340 align:middle line:90%
I guess so.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.260 align:middle line:84%
But again, it wasn't
part of my mission.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, insectoid species
weren't part of that.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>> What's confusing is that
the praying mantis is supposed

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:18.440 align:middle line:84%
to be one of the most ancient
of all of the life forms.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And not even originating
in the Milky Way galaxy,

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.700 align:middle line:84%
but probably from
Andromeda or beyond.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And so why would
a praying mantis

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:33.130 align:middle line:84%
send any kind of a signal
to Earth, populated

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:36.750 align:middle line:84%
by Homo sapiens
sapiens, why would they

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.720 align:middle line:84%
send it in a frequency
that they would know

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.360 align:middle line:90%
that we couldn't translate?

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's an
interesting question.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:45.330 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And was it designed for
us, or for somebody else

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:49.370 align:middle line:90%
they're working with here?

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, because it
was a one-time occasion.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.970 align:middle line:90%
But I mean, the reason is--

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:02.670 align:middle line:84%
potentially or possibly
is because this kind

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:07.860 align:middle line:84%
of praying mantis species is
very closely working and allied

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.240 align:middle line:90%
with these small Greys.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.690 align:middle line:90%
They are working together.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.950 align:middle line:84%
They are performing
especially scientific purposes

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:20.010 align:middle line:84%
and helping out the mission that
the small Greys are performing.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.830 align:middle line:84%
So they are very closely
related to each other.

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:27.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And all that tube technology
that we have talked about,

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:31.470 align:middle line:84%
where there are bodies that
are sustained in light tubes,

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:36.120 align:middle line:84%
the praying mantis is closely
involved with every abductee

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.840 align:middle line:84%
that I know has ever
seen all of these tubes.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And then you add the transfer
of the soul energy from body

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.030 align:middle line:84%
into one of the
sustained bodies,

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:51.120 align:middle line:84%
and the praying mantis
is overseeing this.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And the English translation
that came in to at least one

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.470 align:middle line:84%
of the abductees was that
the whole process was called

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.850 align:middle line:90%
translation into the light.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And the praying mantis
was overseeing everything

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:14.940 align:middle line:84%
with Greys, organic
Greys, artificial Greys,

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.040 align:middle line:84%
and I've always
thought that there

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.960 align:middle line:84%
is something so important
for humans to understand.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:28.650 align:middle line:84%
What is the whole big machinery
of these praying mantises

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:33.660 align:middle line:84%
overseeing the transfer
of soul or soul light

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.030 align:middle line:84%
from a body that
is allowed to die

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:43.050 align:middle line:84%
into a sustained new body that
is in these tubes of light?

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>> What I understand is that
the praying mantis species that

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:52.740 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about-- and
there are assumably a lot more

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:57.240 align:middle line:84%
species and insectoid species
that might be confused with

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.290 align:middle line:84%
them because they look similar,
but they are not part of that

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.420 align:middle line:90%
species, but from another--

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.840 align:middle line:84%
just in the way that
humans from Earth

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.860 align:middle line:84%
have their counterparts
on different planets

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.100 align:middle line:90%
all over the universe.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:16.080 align:middle line:84%
So ape species that
might look like humans

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.500 align:middle line:84%
might not have the same
intention, genetic profile,

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.830 align:middle line:90%
or agenda as Earth humans.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.490 align:middle line:84%
So the way I understand it,
this praying mantis species

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:34.480 align:middle line:84%
is basically very good
at genetics and biology.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:39.000 align:middle line:84%
So what they are contributing
to the mission of the small Grey

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.880 align:middle line:84%
species of the Greys
is a scientific labor,

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.620 align:middle line:84%
a scientific support
and that is why

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:52.200 align:middle line:84%
they are overseeing so many
cases where a contactee gets

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:57.090 align:middle line:84%
healed, for example, or being
transferred into another body

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:58.020 align:middle line:90%
or whatsoever.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever asked a
Grey, or any other being that

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:09.630 align:middle line:84%
you've been with, why are
you even involved with humans

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:11.250 align:middle line:90%
on Earth?

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:16.440 align:middle line:84%
What is it that you want
with us, for us, beyond us?

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>> If we're opening
up that chapter,

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:22.920 align:middle line:84%
we need to have a deeper
understanding and context

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:27.430 align:middle line:84%
of the Grey society, and the
species, and their history.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:31.840 align:middle line:84%
So the Greys, from their
perspective of the universe,

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.670 align:middle line:84%
they are relying
on what they call

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.850 align:middle line:90%
a master line of the species.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:42.030 align:middle line:84%
They have three master
lines of species.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Those species,
those master lines,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.070 align:middle line:84%
are perspectives and way
points of the universe that

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:54.270 align:middle line:84%
create from their perspective
everything that is necessary

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.890 align:middle line:90%
in order to sustain life.

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:58.630 align:middle line:84%
If you're familiar with
the Fibonacci code--

00:11:58.630 --> 00:11:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:00.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So you maybe have-- you
begin with a unified

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:09.720 align:middle line:84%
1, which is the first digit
in the Fibonacci code.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.360 align:middle line:84%
But then you have
a kind of clone

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.570 align:middle line:84%
from the 1, which is
necessary in order

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:20.610 align:middle line:84%
to perceive a kind of
energetical movement

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:23.220 align:middle line:84%
that is going on, because
if you only have 1,

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.320 align:middle line:90%
you have nothing to add to it.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.120 align:middle line:90%
You only have 1.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.010 align:middle line:90%
You always stay with 1, 1, 1, 1.

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:32.190 align:middle line:84%
But if you have another 1,
like extracted from that 1,

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:36.350 align:middle line:84%
you certainly have something to
add to it, and then you have 2.

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And from that, from
these three digits,

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:42.150 align:middle line:90%
you begin a curving geometry.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:43.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Like the Nautilus.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And that is, on a
very spiritual level,

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.940 align:middle line:90%
what the Greys originated from.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.550 align:middle line:84%
They have three
master lines that

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:57.710 align:middle line:84%
administer certain
possibilities and probabilities

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.240 align:middle line:90%
of their own universe.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Everyone associates
themselves freely

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:03.080 align:middle line:90%
to one of those master lines.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, through that,
you have a successful timeline.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Because timelines can fail,
timelines can persist,

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:17.600 align:middle line:84%
and what they want is to
achieve a moment where they also

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:26.100 align:middle line:84%
can develop into a new universe,
which is level 7 consciousness.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:31.580 align:middle line:84%
>> It is as if you boiled the
universe down to its "bare

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:37.100 align:middle line:84%
bones," quote unquote,
it's all fractal geometry.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:37.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.330 align:middle line:84%
At least in this version of
the universe, because there

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.370 align:middle line:84%
are other versions where
that doesn't apply,

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:47.590 align:middle line:84%
where it's just purely chaotic
and different geometries.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:55.780 align:middle line:84%
But yes, fractals are a way to
interpret the data that comes

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.840 align:middle line:90%
from the universe naturally.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Roger Penrose, he got the
Nobel Prize for work that he

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.420 align:middle line:10%
had done on black holes in 2021.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.030 align:middle line:90%
And I interviewed him in 2018.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And right at the beginning,
my first question to him

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:15.240 align:middle line:84%
was, would you please
give me your insights

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.180 align:middle line:84%
about the singularity
that began this universe?

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And he has this
wonderful UK voice,

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:29.680 align:middle line:84%
and he said, oh, no, Linda,
no, there's no singularity, no.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:34.000 align:middle line:84%
It is an infinity
of cycles that have

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.610 align:middle line:90%
had no beginning and no end.

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:42.240 align:middle line:84%
I will never forget that as
the beginning of an interview.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And today, as you
and I are talking,

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:48.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm beginning to think
that Roger Penrose really

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.710 align:middle line:90%
is closer to the truth--

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>> --and that the idea that
this universe that we're in is

00:14:55.380 --> 00:15:01.760 align:middle line:84%
singular, had a beginning
13.8 billion light years back

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:07.140 align:middle line:84%
in time, that somehow
we are not grasping.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And the more that
I hear you, which

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm assuming the information
is coming from your contact

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:22.870 align:middle line:84%
with the Greys, that it is
multiple frequencies in cycles

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:23.900 align:middle line:90%
of infinity.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Overlapping itself.

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And there really is
no beginning and no end.

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:30.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.120 align:middle line:90%
You got it right.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.890 align:middle line:90%
It's frequency.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.870 align:middle line:84%
In this version of
the universe, we

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:41.830 align:middle line:84%
have overlapping frequencies
that all exist at all times

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:46.330 align:middle line:90%
at the same point of existence.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And through that
overlaying, even

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.460 align:middle line:84%
if we do not-- if we
might not perceive

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.710 align:middle line:84%
some of those
frequencies, because we

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:58.540 align:middle line:84%
need to achieve a
logical ground for them

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:02.960 align:middle line:84%
to take to come into existence,
the higher the frequency,

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:08.560 align:middle line:84%
the less edges and sharp edges
we have to reality itself.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>> But the tall whites,
as one man said,

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:16.180 align:middle line:84%
it would be like being with some
kind of an organic human body,

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:20.140 align:middle line:84%
but the brain would be
like 10 Grey computers,

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:24.640 align:middle line:84%
and that they can extend
timelines and do mental

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.300 align:middle line:84%
experiments with changing tiny
things and seeing what happens

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.490 align:middle line:90%
in time.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And they are organic, at
least as I understand it,

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:40.030 align:middle line:84%
and that they have been
involved in genetic manipulation

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.400 align:middle line:90%
on this planet as well.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.730 align:middle line:10%
Why would you have
a lot of experience

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:50.410 align:middle line:10%
in your German work
with the Greys,

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:55.840 align:middle line:10%
but not know anything about
the tall whites or the Nordics

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.370 align:middle line:10%
and others?

00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, well, the same way
someone who's specialized

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:05.950 align:middle line:84%
on birds will have fairly less
knowledge about aquatic beings.

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:10.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm working with the
so-called exotic beings, which

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:14.710 align:middle line:84%
basically the most contacts
was the Greys, but also

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:18.655 align:middle line:84%
a species which is
translated as Being Six.

00:17:18.655 --> 00:17:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And have the Greys in any way
communicated to you about what

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:27.609 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
call the divine field,

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:32.440 align:middle line:84%
that there is some
originator of infinity?

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>> That is mainly the biggest
problem that we had to come--

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:41.890 align:middle line:84%
you know, to solve, and
what they have to solve.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad you're bringing
that up, because that leads

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:47.260 align:middle line:90%
to the existence of Being Six.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.725 align:middle line:90%
The Greys are only capable--

00:17:50.725 --> 00:17:56.080 align:middle line:84%
or used to be only capable of
existing in six consciousness

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.350 align:middle line:90%
layers, and not in the seventh.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And that is because the Greys,
having these three master

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:09.010 align:middle line:84%
lines that they bring
together at one point,

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:11.740 align:middle line:84%
they got rid of
everything else in

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:16.660 align:middle line:84%
their first evolutionary
attempt, so to speak,

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:24.820 align:middle line:84%
which means they were purely
alone in their field of level

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.820 align:middle line:84%
6 consciousness,
which is devastating.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:32.140 align:middle line:90%
And it's a super sad moment.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>> You mean they were the
only consciousness that got

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.720 align:middle line:90%
to a sixth level?

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>> From their observable
standpoint, yes,

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:43.840 align:middle line:84%
because we all are perceiving
our own observable standpoints

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:48.370 align:middle line:84%
and proceed in that
lineage in a logical term.

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:53.530 align:middle line:84%
So you might have a
different universe

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:57.040 align:middle line:84%
that you are sharing
with other beings.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.720 align:middle line:84%
So let me say, two weeks ago,
we didn't know each other.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So we weren't sharing a
mutual home or something,

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.150 align:middle line:90%
a frequency.

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:08.290 align:middle line:90%
But now we're sitting here.

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Now we are sharing
the same path.

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Like everyone
watching this, they

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:16.420 align:middle line:84%
are all sharing the
same timeline with us.

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:21.710 align:middle line:84%
But on that timeline-- timelines
are one major timeline,

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:26.800 align:middle line:84%
which is the stable timeline
that flows in the middle,

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.370 align:middle line:84%
but there are always
timelines left and right.

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:34.970 align:middle line:84%
If you look at it from a
standpoint of top down,

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:37.870 align:middle line:84%
then it looks like
a tree, you know?

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:41.500 align:middle line:84%
In the middle, you have
just one sustaining vector

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.110 align:middle line:84%
that is super
stable, because that

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:48.110 align:middle line:84%
is the successful timeline,
the master timeline, the time

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:48.910 align:middle line:90%
strain.

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:51.460 align:middle line:84%
But from the top
perspective, you

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:55.490 align:middle line:84%
can see there are crystalline
timelines going everywhere,

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:56.290 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's where
the tall whites,

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.480 align:middle line:84%
who do these exercises
in these great minds,

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:05.400 align:middle line:84%
can do all these little tiny
adjustments and say this time,

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.200 align:middle line:90%
this time.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:10.120 align:middle line:84%
It would almost be like
time is like a fractal that

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.820 align:middle line:84%
is constantly generated
from a main highway.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>> 100%.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Any species that is capable of
overviewing temporal dynamics,

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:23.440 align:middle line:84%
which is the term
for timelines, they

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:27.940 align:middle line:84%
are all capable of perceiving
time the way you describe it.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Not only the species, but
also certain reptile species,

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:33.820 align:middle line:90%
certain--

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:37.220 align:middle line:84%
the Greys, and different
other species as well.

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:40.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And time, and the
manipulation of time could be

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:44.710 align:middle line:84%
one of the greatest weapons
in the universe according

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:48.730 align:middle line:84%
to people who are concerned
about these tronoloid insects

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:52.810 align:middle line:84%
and Epsilon Eridani, which
is only 10.5 light years from

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:54.100 align:middle line:90%
Earth.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And it raises a very
interesting question

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.620 align:middle line:84%
that an insect
civilization would

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:04.360 align:middle line:84%
get to a point of
such advancement

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:09.460 align:middle line:84%
that it literally could
go and manipulate time.

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:12.490 align:middle line:84%
This one particular
engineer said

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:15.010 align:middle line:84%
they can take time
from the future

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:19.990 align:middle line:84%
and insert it into a path
and that they experiment.

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, can you imagine
what would happen

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.220 align:middle line:84%
if a timeline they
inserted something

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:30.070 align:middle line:84%
that was like a supernova,
right in the middle

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:33.130 align:middle line:90%
of a stable solar system?

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.230 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
weapon comes in,

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:39.100 align:middle line:84%
that time could be used
like a terrible weapon.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever been exposed to
that in terms of communication

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:43.640 align:middle line:90%
with the Greys?

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:44.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.390 align:middle line:84%
To be very honest
about the reason

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:50.320 align:middle line:84%
why we are able to have
this communication right

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.470 align:middle line:84%
now is because there
are forces, and there

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:58.990 align:middle line:84%
have been forces, that corrected
the timeline of this planet

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:03.910 align:middle line:84%
in order to be a stable one
in order to preserve life.

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Because the way I
understand it, there

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:12.340 align:middle line:84%
have been multiple exits of
failed timelines considering

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:16.330 align:middle line:84%
this planet, which means
some versions of this planet

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:17.710 align:middle line:90%
have failed.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:21.010 align:middle line:84%
But the universe has
this very interesting

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:27.310 align:middle line:84%
temporal natural feature,
which reintegrates every failed

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:29.660 align:middle line:90%
timeline into the main string.

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:35.110 align:middle line:84%
So that is why history,
the further back you go,

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:39.580 align:middle line:84%
the more layers of
contradicting information

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:44.740 align:middle line:84%
you get, because the universe,
every failed timeline gets

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:49.960 align:middle line:84%
reintegrated back into the
successful timeline again,

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.730 align:middle line:90%
which is-- it's super nice.

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:54.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a super relieving
thought, you know?

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Whatever happens
in this universe,

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:03.160 align:middle line:84%
there's a net which carries
you and brings you back

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:07.390 align:middle line:84%
to a sustainable,
positive time, you know?

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Do the Greys have a
clue about what the source

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:13.240 align:middle line:90%
of the source is?

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>> The best definition to
come up with is a field--

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:23.320 align:middle line:84%
a living, self-experiencing
field and life form

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.790 align:middle line:90%
of probability and possibility.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:28.450 align:middle line:84%
But if you're thinking
about a huge, huge scale

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.490 align:middle line:84%
of the whole universe,
then everything

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:33.490 align:middle line:84%
we're experiencing right
now is a very old thought

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:36.790 align:middle line:84%
that comes from
source, and we are

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:41.860 align:middle line:84%
moving backwards through
time back to that source.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.830 align:middle line:84%
But we also, at the
same time-- and that

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:51.070 align:middle line:84%
is this inner, outside
projection of the universe--

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:55.300 align:middle line:84%
we're also moving forward
and creating our own time

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:58.640 align:middle line:84%
while we're still
traveling back in time.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:04.090 align:middle line:84%
So we have these two
movements in temporal dynamics

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:05.440 align:middle line:90%
that we're going through.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And while we're doing that,
and we're only perceiving--

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:13.210 align:middle line:84%
so humanity is only perceiving
time as a linear factor

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:17.650 align:middle line:84%
while it is actually
overlapping of past and future

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:18.850 align:middle line:90%
in the same moment.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:24.950 align:middle line:84%
There are species that are able
to travel between this line,

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:29.140 align:middle line:84%
and what they are doing is
mostly correcting the thought

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:32.270 align:middle line:90%
and correcting how this works.

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:34.480 align:middle line:84%
However, there are
also some species

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:38.830 align:middle line:84%
who do that for their own
advantages, which is basically

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:40.360 align:middle line:90%
what you were speaking about.

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:44.530 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a farmer
in Corguinho, Brazil,

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:48.520 align:middle line:84%
and I got a call from some
people who live there and asked

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.960 align:middle line:90%
if I could come there.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And he had been being
abducted by tall blondes.

00:24:55.330 --> 00:25:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And one night, with
Portuguese translators,

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:06.560 align:middle line:84%
he said that the blondes
showed him in his mind

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.770 align:middle line:84%
that they could go
up above timelines,

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:11.900 align:middle line:90%
and they could look down.

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And that they had learned,
as they were in a project

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:20.520 align:middle line:84%
for Earth, if they
saw a disaster--

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:21.840 align:middle line:90%
it could be an asteroid.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:25.560 align:middle line:84%
It could be anything that
is going to wipe out Earth.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.720 align:middle line:84%
It could be civilization
self-destructing.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:34.370 align:middle line:84%
If they tried to come down
waiting for that moment,

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:37.850 align:middle line:84%
they would never be able
to have an influence.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And they had learned that if
they went approximately 2,000

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.450 align:middle line:84%
of what we would
call Earth years,

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:49.760 align:middle line:84%
and they came into
the timeline at 2,000

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:54.290 align:middle line:84%
before the catastrophic
event, that they would then

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:56.730 align:middle line:90%
be able to work and change it.

00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>> So what happens with time is
that a certain impulse that has

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:08.000 align:middle line:84%
been set in any timeline, it has
some ripples of effects in both

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.750 align:middle line:84%
directions, which means there
are two point ways where this

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:16.230 align:middle line:84%
is going, like it's going into
the past and into the future.

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:20.630 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, there
are some species,

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Greys, for example, that
are capable of using

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:28.850 align:middle line:84%
temporal dimensions in
order to just move through

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:33.840 align:middle line:84%
that in the way we move
through this 3D field as well.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.130 align:middle line:84%
But setting the right
impulse in order

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:44.360 align:middle line:84%
to correctly, and efficiently,
and aimfully alter and modify

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.870 align:middle line:90%
time, it can be complicated.

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:48.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>> What would be the Greys'
point of view in communicating

00:26:55.180 --> 00:27:02.420 align:middle line:84%
to you of their role
in manipulating DNA?

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And we end up on a planet in
which one military person said

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:10.340 align:middle line:84%
one time that he had had
telepathic communication

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:13.370 align:middle line:84%
under orders, and that
one of the things that

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:17.090 align:middle line:84%
came into his head in the
images and the symbols

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:24.290 align:middle line:84%
was that the Greys were confused
or puzzled about why there were

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:30.830 align:middle line:84%
five distinct races on Earth,
because the Grey communicated

00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:36.200 align:middle line:84%
to the military guy, we've
only been manipulating one.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:40.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say that there were
many more races than the five

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:45.860 align:middle line:84%
that you mentioned, because
some of them went underground,

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:47.190 align:middle line:90%
some extincted.

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:51.230 align:middle line:84%
We also have different
skulls that we've found

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:53.520 align:middle line:90%
all over the planet, and so on.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:28:00.530 align:middle line:84%
So the number of sample groups
that were placed on this planet

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:04.670 align:middle line:84%
is probably higher,
and the warrior type,

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:08.540 align:middle line:84%
those who have a genetic
profile that it's

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:10.820 align:middle line:84%
a higher tendency
towards aggression,

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:17.120 align:middle line:84%
those were the dominant
survival races that still remain

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.560 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of this Earth.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Some others went
underground, some extincted,

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:22.250 align:middle line:90%
and so on, so forth.

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:26.870 align:middle line:84%
>> How do we trust any of the
extraterrestrials that are

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:31.070 align:middle line:84%
communicating with
you, or anybody?

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And once I got a Christmas
card, because I've learned

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Christmas cards is a
very good, safe way

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.950 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of people
with a lot of knowledge

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:42.200 align:middle line:84%
to communicate
during that holiday.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And I once got a
Christmas card, and it

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:53.940 align:middle line:84%
said, "the Greys are supposed
to be our allies, dot, dot, dot,

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:57.370 align:middle line:90%
but they lie."

00:28:57.370 --> 00:29:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So what you're
talking about is trust.

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And trust is the most important
subject to our evolution

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:12.220 align:middle line:84%
right now, because we
are all the same being,

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.740 align:middle line:84%
and we need to see that
even though if we all

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.770 align:middle line:84%
have different interests
and different features,

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:23.110 align:middle line:84%
we need to operate on
a mutual beneficial way

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:29.480 align:middle line:84%
and have some kind of dedication
to make it a home for us all.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And so that all these
different agendas

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:37.600 align:middle line:84%
that are placing
a chaotic system

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:41.740 align:middle line:84%
onto this planet and different
other planets in the universe

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:46.060 align:middle line:84%
right now gets
solved into something

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:50.010 align:middle line:84%
that we all can call
home and be our home.

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:54.720 align:middle line:84%
That also includes
individuals and collectives

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:58.570 align:middle line:84%
that have a tendency
towards aggression, which

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:00.970 align:middle line:90%
makes things more complicated.

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Humans have
never really truly,

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:07.930 align:middle line:84%
as a global group of five
races, ever been taught how

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:12.850 align:middle line:84%
to collaborate with a planet
that can die by what we are

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:16.880 align:middle line:84%
doing with our own
evolution on the planet.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:22.820 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if we're set in
motion by extraterrestrials,

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:26.170 align:middle line:84%
but the extraterrestrials
don't stay here

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:31.490 align:middle line:84%
to teach the humans how to
take care of the planet.

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I wouldn't say so, and there
are a lot of people who have

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:39.930 align:middle line:84%
direct contact or psychic
contact to other forms of life

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:42.060 align:middle line:90%
and receive inspiration.

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:45.780 align:middle line:84%
So Being Six, for example,
put that into place.

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.570 align:middle line:84%
There have been lots
and lots of operations

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:52.380 align:middle line:84%
where things have been opposed
on this planet in order

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:55.260 align:middle line:90%
to bring a peaceful development.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Recently, probably
in the last year,

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:02.280 align:middle line:84%
I have received from
two different sources--

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.610 align:middle line:90%
I know where they work.

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:04.680 align:middle line:90%
I know what they do.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.840 align:middle line:90%
They know a lot about ETs.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that
they know each other.

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:11.710 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm the
common denominator.

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I'm raising
it is that they both have

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:18.940 align:middle line:84%
said the same thing in different
words to me about the timeline

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:21.220 align:middle line:90%
that we're on, and that--

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.410 align:middle line:90%
they both have put it this way.

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:26.130 align:middle line:90%
Earth is now facing--

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:26.930 align:middle line:90%
>> A change.

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:32.090 align:middle line:84%
>> --an existential--
an existential future.

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:33.020 align:middle line:90%
And that--

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And that this existential
threat has a certain segment

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:41.330 align:middle line:84%
of time in which it could
be happening this century.

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:43.460 align:middle line:84%
What is your source,
and what is it

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:46.970 align:middle line:84%
that you see is going
to neutralize what

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:52.760 align:middle line:84%
right now, as we are
in the 2020 to 2030

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:57.320 align:middle line:84%
decade, that has been marked
for me going all the way back

00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:02.060 align:middle line:84%
to 2014 and 2007 by people
saying that we were going

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:05.540 align:middle line:84%
to hit 2020 to
2030, and that there

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:09.300 align:middle line:84%
was going to be
existential issues,

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:12.770 align:middle line:84%
including a micronova
from our own sun that

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:14.680 align:middle line:90%
could scorch the Earth?

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:18.920 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, so let me elaborate
on your question from before,

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:23.300 align:middle line:10%
because I know the government
now wants me to say that

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:27.590 align:middle line:10%
the situation with the
Greys is as following.

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:30.890 align:middle line:84%
The Greys have their
stock in humanity.

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:35.060 align:middle line:84%
They are relying on what
is happening on this planet

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:40.280 align:middle line:84%
because they need data
and experiences that

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:44.360 align:middle line:84%
are unique to the surface
humans on this planet.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.030 align:middle line:84%
But they still have
their own agenda

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:51.210 align:middle line:84%
on how the universe
should proceed,

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:57.440 align:middle line:84%
which means they have this
great tendency, because they--

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.810 align:middle line:84%
I would say they
have trust issues

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:02.300 align:middle line:84%
from their own
spiritual development,

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:04.250 align:middle line:84%
because getting rid
of your own body,

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:08.000 align:middle line:84%
getting rid of different major
master lines or whatever,

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.590 align:middle line:84%
getting rid of anything
means you are potentially

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:16.280 align:middle line:84%
dominating your own will
over somebody else's

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.690 align:middle line:90%
right of existence.

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And that not only creates
bad, let's call it karma,

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:23.970 align:middle line:84%
but it also creates
a psychic condition,

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:26.600 align:middle line:84%
which means you
would always think

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.760 align:middle line:90%
that could happen to oneself.

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:33.440 align:middle line:84%
So that is a kind of
very strong trust issue

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.850 align:middle line:90%
that the Greys have.

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:40.070 align:middle line:84%
They tend-- they sort
out a program which

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:44.060 align:middle line:84%
involves contracts,
which means they

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:46.190 align:middle line:90%
want contracts for everything.

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:48.740 align:middle line:84%
They are doing contracts
not only with this planet,

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:52.880 align:middle line:84%
but with whole star systems
that they take care of.

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:57.290 align:middle line:84%
They administer whole star
systems, billions and billions

00:33:57.290 --> 00:34:00.890 align:middle line:84%
of species that they
administer because they

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:03.710 align:middle line:84%
are offering, you know,
serve, protect, and so on.

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:07.340 align:middle line:84%
There are multiple
galaxy star systems

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.040 align:middle line:84%
that are administered
by the Greys

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.699 align:middle line:84%
because they were
offering a solution

00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:19.949 align:middle line:84%
to the smooth evolution
of that star system.

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:23.179 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
that that is quite

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:25.580 align:middle line:90%
what the species itself wants.

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:26.929 align:middle line:90%
Some species are good with that.

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:30.469 align:middle line:84%
Some species want guidance,
and say, OK, cool--

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:33.739 align:middle line:84%
OK, cool, we have someone
who takes care of things.

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:34.610 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you trust the Greys
to take an entire star system,

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:41.210 align:middle line:90%
an entire galaxy?

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:43.639 align:middle line:84%
We will take care of
everything for you,

00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:48.060 align:middle line:84%
and meanwhile, it becomes
the Grey star system.

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:48.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:50.449 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
government wants me

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:54.530 align:middle line:84%
to say that the
Greys, although they

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:57.440 align:middle line:84%
are very interested
in contracts,

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.240 align:middle line:84%
they have still their
own agenda in mind.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And that is bringing some
controversy to the whole

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:08.330 align:middle line:90%
subject.

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And also, they are
an invasive species,

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:18.650 align:middle line:84%
which means they would proceed
directly and enter directly

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:21.440 align:middle line:84%
a situation, which
other species don't.

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:26.930 align:middle line:84%
If you look at Being
Six, they also induce

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:31.760 align:middle line:84%
ideas, or coincidences, or
whatever you want to name it,

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.440 align:middle line:90%
in order to bring--

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:38.270 align:middle line:84%
to balance out certain
negative patterns

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:41.900 align:middle line:84%
that are still showing
themselves on this planet,

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:43.105 align:middle line:90%
but they are not invasive.

00:35:43.105 --> 00:35:45.380 align:middle line:84%
>> The Greys-- I hear
what you're saying,

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:49.760 align:middle line:84%
but I don't have a sense
that there is any kind

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:56.640 align:middle line:84%
of collaborative decisions that
everything about Earth still

00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:01.990 align:middle line:84%
seems to be up for grabs in
a strange way between, say,

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:05.340 align:middle line:84%
the tall whites have one
version of the Earth,

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:09.690 align:middle line:84%
the Greys have another, the
reptilians have another,

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:16.080 align:middle line:84%
and that it's a classic
territorial fight still.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:16.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.980 align:middle line:84%
So you have the full
spectrum, Linda.

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:23.390 align:middle line:84%
You have the full spectrum
of agendas and ideas

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:25.540 align:middle line:84%
considering what you
just talked about.

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And so the Greys heavily
rely on the experiences

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:33.440 align:middle line:84%
that surface humans are
experiencing, making

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:41.990 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, because their
own evolutionary path brought

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:44.630 align:middle line:84%
certain lags of
information that they

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:49.430 align:middle line:84%
are trying to fill in order to
become a successful species.

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:55.700 align:middle line:10%
Their overall plan is to become
connected to every living

00:36:55.700 --> 00:37:00.320 align:middle line:10%
species and every dimension
and frequency there

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.420 align:middle line:10%
is in all existence.

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:08.720 align:middle line:84%
Become part of that, and connect
everything and all experiences,

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:14.570 align:middle line:84%
have all that diversity
in order to have one,

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:17.360 align:middle line:90%
harmonious, final evolution.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And in that very
last moment, they

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:23.730 align:middle line:84%
think of themselves
to be the last one

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:24.820 align:middle line:90%
to switch off the light.

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:25.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Grey.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:26.370 align:middle line:90%
The Greys.

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:27.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:32.520 align:middle line:84%
>> If the Greys are, in fact,
can be trusted to be part

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:39.210 align:middle line:84%
of an effort to lift
Earth up and out further,

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:41.880 align:middle line:84%
because that's what these
other beings are supposed to be

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:45.840 align:middle line:84%
doing, but you don't get the
sense that the tall whites are

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.430 align:middle line:90%
working with the Greys.

00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:52.530 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so right now, there
is an effort collectively

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:58.350 align:middle line:84%
and on a universal scale where
certain species are brought

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:02.350 align:middle line:84%
together on a table and have
diplomatic conversations with

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:03.150 align:middle line:90%
each other.

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:04.025 align:middle line:90%
>> This is happening?

00:38:04.025 --> 00:38:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>> This is happening.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Where?

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:10.650 align:middle line:10%
>> So on Earth, there's also a
collective effort in the last

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:14.160 align:middle line:10%
10 years in order to bring
all key players together

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.100 align:middle line:10%
on a corporate level, a
military level, and a country--

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:22.290 align:middle line:10%
a national level, and some
other key players which

00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:29.670 align:middle line:10%
might include ET life, but
also certain other people

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:32.340 align:middle line:10%
on this planet who
might have an interest.

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Around 10 years ago, maybe
15 years ago, conversations

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:41.310 align:middle line:84%
started, which means those key
players were brought together.

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:45.390 align:middle line:84%
They had conversations
about certain things,

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:50.850 align:middle line:84%
because the system needs to
be modified in some ways.

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of global operations
that we see right now

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:58.380 align:middle line:90%
is a result from those talks.

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:01.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a collective
effort in order

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:04.410 align:middle line:84%
to bring a situation
into a certain direction.

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:07.510 align:middle line:84%
I haven't been attending
these meetings.

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:11.220 align:middle line:84%
This is, like, the
next level of anything.

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you, Tim, for being
with me on another special,

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:17.190 align:middle line:90%
special "Truth Hunter."

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for
having me, Linda.

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:23.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Coming up on the
next "Truth Hunter."

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:28.770 align:middle line:84%
>> One example would be is
a greyish-skinned being--

00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Involved in those tubes
and the transfer of souls.

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.850 align:middle line:84%
But these beings, they
live inside of light.

00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:41.160 align:middle line:10%
It's a place of existence
that only comes into existence

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.500 align:middle line:10%
if you, and me,
and everyone else

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:47.570 align:middle line:10%
consciously decides for it.

00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:50.000 align:middle line:90%
