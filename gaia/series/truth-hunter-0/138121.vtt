00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, I'm Linda Moulton Howe.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.800 align:middle line:10%
Since graduating from
Stanford University, where

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.700 align:middle line:10%
I produced documentaries
about medicine and science,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.840 align:middle line:10%
I have investigated the world
with the pressure of fact.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.580 align:middle line:84%
I am a truth hunter on this
planet, this solar system,

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.620 align:middle line:90%
and the universe beyond.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.640 align:middle line:84%
I began investigating worldwide
bloodless animal mutilations

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.260 align:middle line:84%
in September 1979, and
to my great surprise,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.650 align:middle line:84%
a sheriff and other law
enforcement told me, quote,

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.780 align:middle line:84%
"The perpetrators are creatures
from outer space," close quote.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.730 align:middle line:84%
Now in the 21st century, we
have rovers exploring Mars,

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.120 align:middle line:84%
and solar-system spacecraft
showing us the first close-up

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.220 align:middle line:84%
images of Pluto's icy mountains,
and the bright white magnesium

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.330 align:middle line:84%
salt deposits in a crater
on the dwarf planet Ceres.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And news that at the bottom
of the six-mile deep ocean

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.800 align:middle line:84%
at the south pole on
Saturn's moon Enceladus,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.650 align:middle line:84%
there is hot water
at nearly 200 degrees

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Fahrenheit gushing
from the seafloor

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.100 align:middle line:84%
and spouting through the
surface ice, apparently heated

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.220 align:middle line:84%
by radioactive
material in the core.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.560 align:middle line:10%
That provokes
scientists to wonder

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.740 align:middle line:10%
if there could be swimming
creatures in that surprisingly

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.380 align:middle line:10%
warm moon water.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.710 align:middle line:10%
As the future rushes toward
us with a mixture of lies

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.040 align:middle line:10%
and truths, I would
like to sharpen focus

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.260 align:middle line:10%
on what was actually
happening right

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.750 align:middle line:10%
after the end of
World War II, when

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.220 align:middle line:10%
the front page of the "Roswell
Daily Record" on July 8, 1947

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.620 align:middle line:10%
was headlined, quote, "Roswell
Army Airfield Captures Flying

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.710 align:middle line:10%
Saucer On Ranch
in Roswell Region.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.780 align:middle line:84%
No Details of Flying Disk
Are Revealed," close quote.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.200 align:middle line:84%
We now know that during a
thunderstorm late at night

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.840 align:middle line:84%
on July 3 to 4, 1947,
three aerial objects

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.820 align:middle line:84%
merged on radar before three
crash sites were reported.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.890 align:middle line:84%
The headline about
one of those crashes

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.010 align:middle line:84%
came from Colonel William
Blanchard, commanding officer

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.730 align:middle line:84%
of the 509th Bomb Wing at
the Roswell Army Airfield.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.150 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Blanchard ordered his
public information officer,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Walter Haut, to issue
a press release that

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.740 align:middle line:84%
said one of those flying saucers
that people had been reporting

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.920 align:middle line:84%
that summer had crashed
northwest of Roswell

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.330 align:middle line:90%
near Corona.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Strange debris had been
found by sheep rancher Mac

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.030 align:middle line:90%
Brazel on July 4.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.750 align:middle line:10%
Three days later
on July 7, the head

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.700 align:middle line:10%
of the Roswell Army Airfield's
509th Bomber Group Intelligence

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.330 align:middle line:10%
unit, Lieutenant Colonel
Jesse Marcel, Sr.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.350 align:middle line:84%
went to the Brazel ranch with
Counterintelligence Corps Agent

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.120 align:middle line:90%
Sheridan Cavitt.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.910 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to investigate,
and they gathered up

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.930 align:middle line:84%
peculiar silver foil
that folded like cloth

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.800 align:middle line:84%
and sprang back to
perfect flatness.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.140 align:middle line:84%
There were also
long, thin I-beams

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.300 align:middle line:90%
with purple symbols on them.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.940 align:middle line:84%
The next day on July
8, after the story

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.000 align:middle line:84%
broke on the front page of
the "Roswell Daily Record,"

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.260 align:middle line:84%
the head of the Eighth Air Force
in Fort Worth, Texas, Brigadier

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.320 align:middle line:84%
General Roger Ramey
held a press conference

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.560 align:middle line:84%
with his chief of staff,
Colonel Thomas Dubose,

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.490 align:middle line:84%
to falsely say there
was no flying saucer.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.410 align:middle line:84%
It was just a
weather balloon that

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.780 align:middle line:90%
exploded in a thunderstorm.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.140 align:middle line:84%
To strengthen his phony
story, General Ramey

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.830 align:middle line:84%
had pieces of shredded weather
balloon spread on the floor

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.350 align:middle line:84%
to be photographed
so newspapers would

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.220 align:middle line:84%
run with his concocted
story, specifically

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.770 align:middle line:84%
to keep the public and
the media from knowing

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.500 align:middle line:90%
about the alien presence.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.899 align:middle line:84%
Even Lieutenant
Colonel Jesse Marcel,

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:24.890 align:middle line:84%
Sr. was asked to fly from
Roswell to Fort Worth

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:30.080 align:middle line:84%
to pose for photographs amid
actual weather balloon debris.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.210 align:middle line:10%
But Colonel Marcel
knew that what

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.080 align:middle line:10%
he had gathered the day
before from the Brazel ranch

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.530 align:middle line:10%
was not a weather balloon.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.560 align:middle line:10%
Five years later, 1952,
President Truman's Majestic 12

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.270 align:middle line:10%
special panel produced their
"First Annual Report" that

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.070 align:middle line:10%
described, quote, "unidentified
planform space vehicles,"

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.450 align:middle line:10%
close quote.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.710 align:middle line:10%
Planform meant a delta
or crescent shape, not

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.810 align:middle line:10%
a round disk.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Here are paragraphs six and
seven from MJ-12's 1952 report.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.780 align:middle line:84%
Quote, "Radar film
and tower logs

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.950 align:middle line:84%
do not explain the merging
of three radar targets

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.580 align:middle line:84%
prior to collision and
subsequent crashes.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.390 align:middle line:84%
There were five recovered
bodies, two of which

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.630 align:middle line:84%
were found in a severely
damaged escape cylinder,

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.900 align:middle line:84%
and the remaining three bodies
were found some distance away

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.460 align:middle line:90%
from the cylinder.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.240 align:middle line:84%
All five appear to have suffered
from sudden decompression

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.230 align:middle line:84%
and heat suffocation,"
close quote.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.570 align:middle line:10%
So there were three radar
targets and three crash sites

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:50.390 align:middle line:10%
that MJ-12 called Landing
Zones One, Two, and Three.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.680 align:middle line:10%
Landing Zone One was near
Corona, New Mexico, about 75

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.410 align:middle line:10%
miles northwest of Roswell.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.100 align:middle line:84%
The same month of the
crashes, another US government

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.760 align:middle line:84%
agency with the provocative
title "Interplanetary

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Phenomenon Unit"
summarized on July 22, 1947

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.570 align:middle line:84%
what had been found at
those three crash sites.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Paragraph 12 stated, quote,
"The most disturbing aspect

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.260 align:middle line:84%
of this investigation was
there were other bodies found

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.990 align:middle line:84%
not far from Landing
Zone One that

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.280 align:middle line:84%
looked as if they had been
dissected as you would a frog,"

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.870 align:middle line:90%
close quote.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.010 align:middle line:84%
No explanation was given about
whether the dissected bodies

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.030 align:middle line:90%
were animal, human, or alien.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And then came this
startling sentence.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Quote, "Animal parts
were reportedly

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:53.050 align:middle line:84%
discovered inside the craft at
Landing Zone Two," close quote.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.190 align:middle line:10%
Landing Zone Two was 20
miles southeast of Socorro,

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.790 align:middle line:10%
not far from Oscura Peak,
southeast of the Trinity

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.190 align:middle line:10%
site in White Sands
proving ground,

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.090 align:middle line:10%
where the United States tested
its first atomic bomb two

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.390 align:middle line:10%
years earlier in July, 1945.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:12.970 align:middle line:84%
Those animal parts
were reportedly

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:17.230 align:middle line:84%
found inside a
well-preserved capsule.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.140 align:middle line:84%
It might have been ejected
from the crashed vehicle

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.470 align:middle line:90%
at Landing Zone One near Corona.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Landing Zone Three was 30
miles east of Alamogordo

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.340 align:middle line:84%
on the Mescalero Apache
Indian Reservation.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:35.290 align:middle line:10%
That third UFO hit the ground
hard and was badly damaged.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:39.610 align:middle line:10%
Remember that the Majestic 12
project's "First Annual Report"

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:45.340 align:middle line:10%
in 1952 used the word
"planform" to describe

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.660 align:middle line:10%
crescent-shaped alien
craft, not round disks.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.990 align:middle line:10%
Well, here is a photograph
of one of those planforms

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.200 align:middle line:10%
that the photographer
told me reminded him

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.550 align:middle line:10%
of a man's shoe heel.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:01.090 align:middle line:10%
William A. Rhodes had
been a flight instructor

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:05.440 align:middle line:10%
during World War II at Falcon
Field in Phoenix, Arizona.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.830 align:middle line:10%
When he saw this
shoe-heel in the sky,

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:12.970 align:middle line:10%
Bill Rhodes grabbed his box
camera to take this photograph.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:18.070 align:middle line:84%
The date was July 7, 1947, the
same week of the other three

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:21.190 align:middle line:90%
UFO crashes in New Mexico.

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Two days later, on
Wednesday, July 9, 1947,

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.570 align:middle line:84%
"The Arizona
Republic" in Phoenix

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:34.720 align:middle line:84%
put the Rhodes photograph of the
crescent-shaped aerial planform

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.070 align:middle line:84%
on its front page, but
it got it upside-down.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:41.650 align:middle line:84%
The same planform shape
has been described

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.470 align:middle line:84%
by other retired
military eyewitnesses

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.890 align:middle line:90%
of crescent-shaped UFOs.

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:51.880 align:middle line:84%
General Roger Ramey's goal was
to carry out President Harry

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Truman's orders for a strict
policy of denial and secrecy

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.030 align:middle line:90%
about the alien crashes.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:00.880 align:middle line:84%
Allegedly, Truman
and FDR had already

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:07.660 align:middle line:84%
dealt with a UFO and three dead
aliens six full years before.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.410 align:middle line:10%
In a 2015 book entitled "MO41"--

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.440 align:middle line:10%
standing for Missouri 1941--

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:19.210 align:middle line:10%
"The Bombshell Before Roswell,"
author Paul Blake Smith

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:24.160 align:middle line:10%
writes that on the
night of April 12, 1941,

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:29.800 align:middle line:10%
a crescent-shaped UFO crashed
near Cape Girardeau, Missouri.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Cape Girardeau is 115 miles
southeast of St. Louis,

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.640 align:middle line:84%
and near there was
the Missouri Institute

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.730 align:middle line:90%
of Aeronautics in Sikeston.

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Allegedly, military
personnel from MIA

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:47.560 align:middle line:84%
retrieved a crescent-shaped
craft and three

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.580 align:middle line:84%
identical small
bodies, described as

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.160 align:middle line:84%
"not from this
world," and they were

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:59.440 align:middle line:84%
found on a farm about eight
miles south of Cape Girardeau.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Today we would call those
identical bodies "clones."

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:14.140 align:middle line:10%
to aerospace engineer Dr.
Robert Wood is entitled, quote,

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:19.050 align:middle line:10%
"MJ-12 Project White Hot
Intelligence Estimate,"

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:23.580 align:middle line:10%
a preliminary dated
September 19, 1947.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.430 align:middle line:84%
That's only 2 and 1/2
months after the UFO

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.920 align:middle line:90%
crashes around Roswell.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.940 align:middle line:84%
"Classified, Majic Eyes
Only, Part III, Scientific

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Probability" states,
quote, "Based

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.550 align:middle line:84%
on all available
evidence collected

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:42.540 align:middle line:84%
from recovered exhibits"--
meaning the planform UFOs--

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.270 align:middle line:84%
"currently under
study," and then

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:50.220 align:middle line:84%
comes a list of 11 government
and military agencies

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:54.330 align:middle line:84%
and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:11:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Those craft are deemed
"extraterrestrial in nature.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:05.010 align:middle line:10%
This conclusion was reached
as a result of comparisons

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:09.240 align:middle line:10%
of artifacts from the
Missouri discovery in 1941,"

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.640 align:middle line:10%
meaning Cape Girardeau.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.530 align:middle line:10%
"The technology is outside
the scope of US science.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:20.580 align:middle line:10%
It is even outside that of
German rocket and aircraft

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.950 align:middle line:10%
development," close quote.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:27.200 align:middle line:10%
"Part II, Technical Evaluation,"
paragraph 18 states,

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.930 align:middle line:10%
quote, "The following elements
were analyzed and found

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:35.700 align:middle line:10%
to exist in the small neutronic
power plant that was found

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.840 align:middle line:10%
inside ULAT-1," close quote.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, "ULAT-1" is another
acronym for UFO planform.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:49.800 align:middle line:84%
This one stands for unidentified
lenticular-shaped aerodyne.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.010 align:middle line:10%
Continuing from the
September 19, 1947,

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:56.700 align:middle line:10%
white-hot intelligence
briefing, it says, quote,

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:00.540 align:middle line:10%
"Even the recovery
case of 1941"--

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:05.310 align:middle line:10%
Cape Girardeau-- "did not create
a unified intelligence effort

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:08.190 align:middle line:10%
to exploit possible
technological gains

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:12.150 align:middle line:10%
with the exception of
the Manhattan Project,"

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.400 align:middle line:10%
close quote.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.770 align:middle line:10%
The reference to the
Manhattan Project

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:19.410 align:middle line:10%
means physicist
Robert Oppenheimer

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.930 align:middle line:10%
had the Cape Girardeau
neutronic power

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:26.010 align:middle line:10%
plant to study during his
development of the atomic bomb

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.920 align:middle line:10%
that we first dropped on
Japan in August, 1945,

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.870 align:middle line:10%
ending World War II.

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:34.950 align:middle line:84%
That also implies that
presidents Roosevelt and Truman

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:39.570 align:middle line:84%
already knew about an alien
presence during World War II,

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:43.590 align:middle line:84%
before the July,
1947 Roswell crashes.

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And they had made a decision
to keep everything secret--

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.990 align:middle line:84%
about UFOs, the alien
bodies they had retrieved,

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:54.480 align:middle line:90%
both dead and alive.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.790 align:middle line:10%
Much of the content
in those early reports

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:59.400 align:middle line:10%
was drawn from what
Lieutenant General Nathan

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.300 align:middle line:10%
Twining discovered on his secret
mission for President Truman

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.850 align:middle line:10%
soon after the New
Mexico crashes.

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.650 align:middle line:84%
That's when General
Twining viewed

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:11.040 align:middle line:84%
the five alien bodies and
craft found at Landing Zone Two

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.520 align:middle line:84%
near Oscura Peak and
the Trinity site.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:18.120 align:middle line:84%
In 1947, General Twining was
commander of the Air Materiel

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.260 align:middle line:90%
Command.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.660 align:middle line:84%
10 years later,
President Eisenhower

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:25.500 align:middle line:84%
would appoint him chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:30.930 align:middle line:10%
By July 16, 1947, only one
week after the "Roswell Daily"

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:34.530 align:middle line:10%
headline, General Twining
sent President Truman

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:38.790 align:middle line:10%
a two-page report about what he
saw for himself at the Landing

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.460 align:middle line:10%
Zone Two crash site
near Oscura Peak,

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.670 align:middle line:10%
and that was on the White
Sands proving ground.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:49.670 align:middle line:10%
Quote, "Upon examination of
the interior of the craft,

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:53.130 align:middle line:10%
a compartment exhibiting
a possible atomic engine

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:54.480 align:middle line:10%
was discovered."

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.810 align:middle line:10%
In the power room was
"a doughnut-shaped tube

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:00.660 align:middle line:10%
approximately 35
feet in diameter,

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.900 align:middle line:10%
made of what appears to be
a plastic material, that

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.120 align:middle line:10%
is surrounding a central core.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:11.070 align:middle line:10%
This tube was translucent,
approximately one inch thick.

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:14.340 align:middle line:10%
The tube appeared to be
filled with a clear substance,

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.980 align:middle line:10%
possibly a heavy water.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.530 align:middle line:84%
This activation of
electrical potential

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:24.180 align:middle line:84%
is believed to be the
primary power to the reactor,

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:27.000 align:middle line:84%
though it is only a
theory at present.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.200 align:middle line:84%
Just how a heavy water reactor
functions in this environment

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.640 align:middle line:90%
is unknown.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.710 align:middle line:10%
On the deck of the
power room there

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:38.490 align:middle line:10%
are what resembles
typewriter keys, possibly

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:41.370 align:middle line:10%
reactor/power plant controls.

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:44.130 align:middle line:10%
There were no
conventional electronics

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:47.910 align:middle line:10%
nor wiring to be seen
connecting these controls

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:50.520 align:middle line:10%
to the propulsion turret."

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:55.200 align:middle line:84%
I have been told those keys
had strange hieroglyphic type

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.850 align:middle line:90%
symbols on them.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:01.850 align:middle line:84%
The 1952 "MJ-12 First
Annual Report" said, quote,

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:07.230 align:middle line:84%
"The technology may be eons
ahead of us," close quote,

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:12.540 align:middle line:84%
meaning thousands of
years beyond us on Earth.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:16.560 align:middle line:84%
Another military insider from
World War II and the Eisenhower

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:22.500 align:middle line:84%
and Kennedy presidencies did
a 1997 book entitled, "The Day

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.940 align:middle line:90%
After Roswell."

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:26.160 align:middle line:84%
It was about what
he knew firsthand

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:31.740 align:middle line:84%
of UFO extraterrestrial
technologies and ETs

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:35.250 align:middle line:84%
while he was working
in the Pentagon.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Lieutenant Colonel
Philip J. Corso

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:40.650 align:middle line:84%
worked as chief of the
Pentagon's Foreign Technology

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:43.440 align:middle line:90%
desk for General Arthur Trudeau.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.790 align:middle line:10%
He was handpicked by President
Dwight Eisenhower in 1958

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:50.790 align:middle line:10%
to be director of Army
Research and Development

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:52.860 align:middle line:10%
in the Pentagon.

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:57.270 align:middle line:10%
General Trudeau, on the right,
handpicked Colonel Corso

00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:00.990 align:middle line:10%
after their trusted days
together in World War II.

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Corso told me he
met with General Trudeau

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:08.340 align:middle line:84%
in his Pentagon office,
where the general handed

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:13.500 align:middle line:84%
over extraterrestrial artifacts
retrieved from crashed

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.810 align:middle line:90%
or landed UFOs.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:20.430 align:middle line:84%
The general asked Colonel Corso
to secretly hand-deliver ET

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:26.190 align:middle line:84%
artifacts to selected contacts
in a few American corporations.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:29.010 align:middle line:84%
General Trudeau and
President Eisenhower

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:32.730 align:middle line:84%
wanted ET technologies
back-engineered

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:37.740 align:middle line:84%
and patented as a top-secret
national security priority.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:41.970 align:middle line:10%
No one-- not in Congress,
the Supreme Court,

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:46.560 align:middle line:10%
or the taxpaying American
public was to know anything.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.900 align:middle line:10%
General Trudeau
and Colonel Corso

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.620 align:middle line:10%
were the beginning of the
United States' serious efforts

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.840 align:middle line:10%
to develop a secret
space program that

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:58.200 align:middle line:10%
would use retrieved
extraterrestrial technology

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.270 align:middle line:10%
for advancement.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, NASA was
created on July 29, 1958,

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:08.339 align:middle line:90%
allegedly as a public agency.

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:13.170 align:middle line:84%
But insiders have long reported
that NASA has been under CIA

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.420 align:middle line:90%
control from the beginning.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.450 align:middle line:84%
NASA would be the public
camouflage for what

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:20.790 align:middle line:90%
was behind the scenes--

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:25.230 align:middle line:84%
a dark and growing underbelly
of American secret authorities

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:28.440 align:middle line:84%
not accountable to either
Congressional oversight

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.930 align:middle line:90%
or to the American people.

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:36.270 align:middle line:84%
These above top-secret entities
controlled billions, trillions

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:40.170 align:middle line:84%
of dollars behind an
untouchable intelligence

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:43.590 align:middle line:84%
and counterintelligence
matrix designed

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:46.020 align:middle line:84%
to keep the whole
world from knowing

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:50.220 align:middle line:84%
about the alien
presence on Earth.

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:54.180 align:middle line:84%
In June, 1997, Time
magazine did a cover story

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:57.720 align:middle line:84%
on the 50th anniversary
of the Roswell crashes.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.350 align:middle line:84%
I was there to speak for
that 50th commemoration.

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And there I met and talked with
Colonel Corso about his work

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:07.110 align:middle line:90%
for General Trudeau.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:09.720 align:middle line:84%
When Colonel Corso
was introduced to me,

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.770 align:middle line:84%
he extended his hand to shake
mine as he said, how the hell

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:17.490 align:middle line:84%
did you get so much
classified information?

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:20.910 align:middle line:84%
He meant the animal mutilations
that I had investigated

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:24.480 align:middle line:84%
for my TV documentary,
"A Strange Harvest," that

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:29.430 align:middle line:84%
was first broadcast May 28,
1980, on Denver's CBS station

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:31.530 align:middle line:90%
KMGH-TV.

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:35.220 align:middle line:84%
That is where I was director
of special projects.

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And that is when sheriffs
and ranchers told

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.710 align:middle line:84%
me the perpetrators
of the bloodless,

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:43.560 align:middle line:84%
trackless animal
deaths were, quote,

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.530 align:middle line:84%
"creatures from outer
space," close quote.

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:51.300 align:middle line:84%
Ranchers had seen glowing lights
in night skies emit beams down

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.780 align:middle line:90%
into their pastures.

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:56.760 align:middle line:84%
A few had even seen a cow
lifted up in a beam of light,

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.970 align:middle line:84%
or lowered to pastures,
dead and mutilated.

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:01.860 align:middle line:84%
But none of those
eyewitnesses would

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:06.540 align:middle line:84%
stand in front of my TV
camera, for fear of ridicule.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Before he died, Colonel
Corso talked to me

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.210 align:middle line:84%
in private about the highly
classified documents that he

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:17.760 align:middle line:84%
had read in Washington,
DC, dated as early as 1951,

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.920 align:middle line:84%
about animals found
in several parts

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.860 align:middle line:84%
of the world with
bloodless excisions

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.140 align:middle line:90%
and no tracks around them.

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Corso said
the classified reports

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:31.350 align:middle line:84%
that he read specified that
the perpetrators of animal

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:36.090 align:middle line:84%
mutilations were, quote,
"extraterrestrial biological

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:38.700 align:middle line:90%
entities," close quote.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.480 align:middle line:90%
But why?

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:46.790 align:middle line:10%
This illustration is by a
Missouri horse rancher in 1975

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:49.020 align:middle line:10%
who saw this glowing
being at his gate

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:52.790 align:middle line:10%
during a time when he
found several newborn foals

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:56.900 align:middle line:10%
and young horses bloodlessly
mutilated in his pasture.

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Eventually our
government would realize

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:02.870 align:middle line:84%
that many of the UFO pilots
and other non-human entities

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:08.300 align:middle line:84%
were cloned androids or
human ET hybrids produced

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.950 align:middle line:84%
from genetic harvests
of Earth life,

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:16.400 align:middle line:84%
including animal mutilations
and extractions of human sperm

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.100 align:middle line:90%
and eggs.

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Our government, according
to Colonel Corso,

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:25.220 align:middle line:84%
learned that in spite of the
mutilations and abductions,

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:29.540 align:middle line:84%
some ETs are friendly,
and they want humanity

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:35.660 align:middle line:84%
to advance faster, to be more
protected from unfriendly ETs.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.200 align:middle line:84%
So, there was urgency in
General Trudeau's goal

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.410 align:middle line:84%
to get alien technologies
back-engineered and patented

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:46.640 align:middle line:84%
as fast as possible, to keep
them from Germany and Russia,

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.330 align:middle line:84%
and to support a secret
space program that might have

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:54.360 align:middle line:90%
to do battle in real star wars.

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:57.540 align:middle line:84%
About secret ET
technology transfer

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:01.260 align:middle line:84%
to American corporations for
back-engineering and patents,

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Corso wrote,
quote, "General Trudeau

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:08.850 align:middle line:84%
also had relationships
with the Army contractors

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:10.860 align:middle line:84%
who were developing
new weapons systems

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:14.790 align:middle line:84%
for the military within
one part of the company,

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:17.640 align:middle line:84%
while another highly
secret part of the company

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:22.140 align:middle line:84%
was harvesting some of the
same ET technology for consumer

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:24.300 align:middle line:90%
products development.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And these were companies such as
Bell Labs, IBM, Monsanto, Dow,

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:33.240 align:middle line:84%
RCA that became General
Electric and the aviation

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:38.460 align:middle line:84%
and medical companies of
Howard Hughes," close quote.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:42.780 align:middle line:84%
At that July, 1997
50th-anniversary conference,

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Jesse Marcel, Jr. Handed me
this replica of the thin I-beam

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:53.430 align:middle line:84%
that he remembered holding in
the first week of July, 1947.

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:56.910 align:middle line:84%
That's when his father,
Jesse Marcel, Sr.,

00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:00.660 align:middle line:84%
the head of intelligence at
the Roswell Army Airfield,

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:03.060 align:middle line:84%
woke up Jesse and
his mother to show

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:07.320 align:middle line:84%
them pieces of this strange
silver foil in I-beams

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.660 align:middle line:84%
that Jesse Marcel,
Sr. Had picked up

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.180 align:middle line:84%
at one of the three
UFO crash sites

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.120 align:middle line:90%
that first week of July, 1947.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And that was the one
between Roswell and Corona.

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Jesse Marcel, Sr. said
the metallic foil was

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:26.250 align:middle line:84%
like cloth that could be
folded or crumpled up,

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:30.090 align:middle line:84%
and it would always return to
its original flat unwrinkled

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:31.410 align:middle line:90%
shape.

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:33.870 align:middle line:84%
Jesse Jr. told me
his father said

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:40.320 align:middle line:84%
that the debris, quote, "was
not of this Earth," close quote.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:44.820 align:middle line:84%
Young Jesse Marcel was so
curious about what he described

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:49.380 align:middle line:84%
as metallic pinkish-purple
hieroglyphs or symbols that

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:54.330 align:middle line:84%
ran along the entire length of
a tan-colored I-beam only 3/8

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:55.950 align:middle line:90%
of an inch wide.

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:58.740 align:middle line:84%
The I-beam was so
lightweight that Jesse Jr.

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.670 align:middle line:84%
said he could hardly
feel it in his hand.

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Plastics did not exist
publicly in 1947,

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:09.840 align:middle line:84%
but eyewitnesses would
later on compare the I-beams

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:13.380 align:middle line:84%
to new lightweight
plastic or balsa wood.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.360 align:middle line:84%
There were rumors
that scientists

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.470 align:middle line:84%
had discovered the I-beams
were an exotic hybrid

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:22.620 align:middle line:90%
of metal-like wood.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:25.710 align:middle line:84%
It could not be cut,
it could not be burned.

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence Officer
Jesse Marcel,

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Sr. would himself compare the
strange pink-purple symbols to,

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:37.350 align:middle line:84%
quote, "indecipherable
Chinese writing," close quote.

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:42.500 align:middle line:84%
12 years after the 1947
Roswell UFO cover-up began,

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:45.060 align:middle line:84%
Brigadier General
Stephen Lovekin

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:48.960 align:middle line:84%
said that he was briefed
in the Pentagon in 1959

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.430 align:middle line:90%
about the Roswell UFO crashes.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And he was shown thin
I-beams with what he

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.740 align:middle line:90%
called purplish "encryptions."

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:03.150 align:middle line:84%
That word means encoding
messages or information

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:07.980 align:middle line:84%
in such a way that only
authorized parties can read it.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:11.700 align:middle line:84%
Another source, Steve Lytle,
reported that his mathematician

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:15.720 align:middle line:84%
father was asked by government
authorities to, quote,

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:19.980 align:middle line:84%
"decipher the I-beam
symbols," close quote.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.430 align:middle line:90%
But no one was able to.

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And those weren't the
only mysterious symbols

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:27.450 align:middle line:90%
to show up on UFOs.

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:32.640 align:middle line:84%
In 1803 on the east coast of
Japan, in the Hitachi Province,

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:37.410 align:middle line:84%
fishermen reported that a pale
red-headed alien-looking woman

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:40.050 align:middle line:84%
suddenly emerged
from under the ocean

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:45.190 align:middle line:84%
waters in a round craft that
had symbols on its surface.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:48.540 align:middle line:84%
The woman was inside the
craft, clutching a box.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Eyewitnesses called her
Utsuro-Bune, meaning ship hole,

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:57.540 align:middle line:84%
because her sea craft was
shaped like a rice bowl.

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.730 align:middle line:84%
People who saw the
craft said the top

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:01.690 align:middle line:90%
was like glass or crystal.

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And when the red-haired woman
spoke, it was in a language

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:08.250 align:middle line:84%
that no Japanese person
had ever heard before.

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:10.290 align:middle line:90%
What language was she speaking?

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:11.680 align:middle line:90%
Where did she come from?

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.070 align:middle line:90%
What was in the box?

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:15.600 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:19.050 align:middle line:84%
Eyewitnesses claim the same
red-haired woman and craft

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:21.600 align:middle line:84%
were reported in
other parts of Japan,

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.350 align:middle line:84%
as if she were flying
around in the craft.

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:30.670 align:middle line:84%
She was always reported to
be tightly holding that box.

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:35.580 align:middle line:10%
177 years later, on
December 26, 1980,

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:38.940 align:middle line:10%
after midnight, Staff
Sergeant James Penniston

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.580 align:middle line:10%
at RAF Bentwaters,
Woodbridge, in England

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:43.800 align:middle line:10%
would also encounter
a strange craft

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.210 align:middle line:10%
with symbols in
Rendlesham Forest.

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:51.290 align:middle line:84%
When Sergeant Penniston dragged
his fingers over the symbols,

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:55.940 align:middle line:84%
his mind was filled with
zeros and ones of binary code,

00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:00.020 align:middle line:84%
and telepathic impressions
of a time machine

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:03.620 align:middle line:84%
from a distant future, where
an advanced civilization was

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.390 align:middle line:90%
dying out.

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Its mission was to harvest
genetic material from Earth

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:14.660 align:middle line:84%
to use as band-aids to extend
the future of civilization's

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:15.990 align:middle line:90%
survival.

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:17.600 align:middle line:90%
There was no pilot.

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.640 align:middle line:84%
The triangular
craft operated with

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.570 align:middle line:90%
alien self-activating software.

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, here is a comparison of
two Utsuro-Bune symbols, marked

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:32.060 align:middle line:84%
with red circles, that are
variations on the Jim Penniston

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:35.820 align:middle line:84%
triangle and circle
symbols in the lower left.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:39.700 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see this
triangle-circle symbol again

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.740 align:middle line:90%
in a 2015 UFO encounter.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:47.450 align:middle line:84%
But first, on August
28, 1991, 11 years

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:51.280 align:middle line:84%
after Sergeant Penniston touched
the symbols on the alien craft

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:54.410 align:middle line:84%
in Rendlesham Forest,
Soviet authorities

00:26:54.410 --> 00:27:02.720 align:middle line:84%
were tracking a UFO on a zigzag
course of 4,225 miles an hour.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:06.890 align:middle line:84%
The rapid radar track
vanished over Kyrgyzstan.

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:10.760 align:middle line:84%
A year later, in June,
1992, a search party

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:15.060 align:middle line:84%
found a cylinder-shaped craft
with strange green symbols

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:15.860 align:middle line:90%
on it.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:18.690 align:middle line:84%
The investigation
reported, quote,

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:23.900 align:middle line:84%
"powerful electromagnetic field
emanating from the wreckage,"

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.750 align:middle line:90%
close quote.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:31.000 align:middle line:84%
All photographs and videotape
recordings were overexposed.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.100 align:middle line:84%
The craft had crashed in
the Shaitan Mazar gorge,

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.870 align:middle line:84%
also known as the Devil's
Grave, in the central Tien Shan

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:41.870 align:middle line:90%
mountains of eastern Kyrgyzstan.

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:46.010 align:middle line:84%
Then 14 years after
that, in late June 2015,

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:49.520 align:middle line:84%
an Army sergeant with his
wife, two young children, dog

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.760 align:middle line:84%
and a cat began moving
from Hunter Army Airfield

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:55.730 align:middle line:84%
near Richmond Hill, Georgia,
on the Atlantic Ocean,

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:58.520 align:middle line:84%
to Fort Carson in
Colorado Springs,

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:01.160 align:middle line:90%
planning to go through Atlanta.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.700 align:middle line:84%
He set his truck's
GPS for the route

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.900 align:middle line:84%
and they planned to
travel at night when

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.390 align:middle line:84%
it was cooler with less
traffic, and then they

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:11.210 align:middle line:84%
would stay in motels
during the day.

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:15.170 align:middle line:84%
The husband, Sergeant
CJ, I call him,

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and his wife were shocked when
a bright white light in the sky

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:22.790 align:middle line:84%
suddenly came down
toward their truck.

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:25.850 align:middle line:84%
The Army sergeant estimated
that the disk hovering

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:30.000 align:middle line:84%
above their truck
was 820 feet long--

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.720 align:middle line:84%
that's nearly three
football fields--

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:36.440 align:middle line:84%
and was 200 feet high
from base to top.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Bright white sparks projected
out beyond the craft,

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:41.300 align:middle line:90%
front and back.

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Below the midline
there was a row

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.100 align:middle line:90%
of five dark-colored symbols.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:50.540 align:middle line:84%
He told me, quote, "In the
Army I'm a trained observer.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:52.880 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing
this for 15 years.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:56.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to identify high
velocity rounds as well

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.090 align:middle line:84%
as mortars, rockets,
artillery aircraft--

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:00.860 align:middle line:90%
all types of aircraft.

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm trained to do that for
whatever comes down in front

of us on military missions.

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:09.710 align:middle line:84%
This huge craft was
way beyond anything

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:13.370 align:middle line:84%
that I have been trained
for," close quote.

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant CJ's wife remembered
the UFO's surface glistened

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.630 align:middle line:84%
like an oil slick
of rainbow colors

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:22.460 align:middle line:90%
when it tilted toward them.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And she also thought that
there were round lights

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:26.760 align:middle line:90%
around the perimeter.

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:32.060 align:middle line:84%
The encounter was from
exactly 1:25 to 1:29

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:36.890 align:middle line:84%
AM Eastern on the early
morning of June 29, 2015,

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:40.460 align:middle line:84%
and this is according to
Sergeant CJ's digital watch

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:44.810 align:middle line:84%
that he looked at when the craft
disappeared by blinking out

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:46.320 align:middle line:90%
in front of them.

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.870 align:middle line:90%
It blinked out.

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:49.910 align:middle line:90%
It did not move.

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:52.700 align:middle line:84%
The couple felt confused
and disoriented.

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:56.300 align:middle line:10%
Sergeant CJ drove up
the road a few miles,

00:29:56.300 --> 00:30:00.230 align:middle line:10%
and he found a Shake Rag
Express on Highway 1 South.

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:02.120 align:middle line:10%
When he tried to get
out of the truck,

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.640 align:middle line:10%
he said, his legs
felt like wet noodles,

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:08.240 align:middle line:10%
as if he couldn't stand up, and
he didn't know what was wrong.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:12.020 align:middle line:10%
But the greater shock was
when he bought some food,

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:15.470 align:middle line:10%
the Shake Rag Express
receipt showed

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:19.250 align:middle line:10%
they were in Wadley,
Georgia, way off their GPS

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.680 align:middle line:10%
course to Atlanta.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.440 align:middle line:10%
The couple had no
idea how they were

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:28.010 align:middle line:10%
diverted north without
realizing it from their GPS.

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:29.210 align:middle line:10%
It was programmed.

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:32.330 align:middle line:10%
It was a programmed route that
should have taken 4 and 1/2

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:36.710 align:middle line:10%
hours for the 250-mile drive
from Richmond Hill, Georgia,

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:41.420 align:middle line:10%
via Route 16 to Route
75 into Atlanta.

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:45.920 align:middle line:84%
But what happened next implies
that the diversion on Route 1

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:49.340 align:middle line:84%
North to the countryside
of Wadley, Georgia,

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:53.360 align:middle line:84%
was under the control
of an alien intelligence

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:58.660 align:middle line:84%
in order to transmit binary
information into Sergeant CJ's

00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:01.060 align:middle line:90%
mind.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant CJ had the
shock of his life.

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And we'll go deeper
into that shock

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:08.550 align:middle line:90%
on the next "Truth Hunter."

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:10.570 align:middle line:90%
This is Linda Moulton Howe.
