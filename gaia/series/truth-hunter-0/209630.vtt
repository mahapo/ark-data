00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.580 align:middle line:10%
>> With me today on this
Truth Hunter special is Tim,

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.310 align:middle line:10%
a tactical advisor to covert
German analysts who are trying

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.360 align:middle line:10%
to understand the missions
and strategies of non-human

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.400 align:middle line:10%
intelligences on our planet in
this solar system and beyond.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Tim, welcome to this special
edition of Truth Hunter.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you, Linda,
for having me.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>> On our Earth
plane level four,

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.440 align:middle line:84%
we have all of these tensions
from competing energies,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.130 align:middle line:84%
and we have a lot
of negative here,

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.180 align:middle line:90%
and that is one of those issues.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Is Earth in play like a
football game between teams

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.980 align:middle line:84%
in which one team is really
trying to curtail humanity

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.880 align:middle line:90%
because they want Earth?

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And if those are a form
of reptiles, what exactly

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.820 align:middle line:84%
is this installation
that you have referenced

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.480 align:middle line:84%
in relationship to the
energies on Earth that

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.300 align:middle line:90%
seem to always be in conflict?

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.150 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.400 align:middle line:90%
And what is the goal?

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.750 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so we're coming back
now to level 3 and level 4

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.640 align:middle line:90%
consciousness realities.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.090 align:middle line:84%
So on this very
Earth, this planet

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.720 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking
about, the human species

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.240 align:middle line:84%
has a very, very high so-called
evolutionary potential, which

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.930 align:middle line:84%
means a species on
certain planets,

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.470 align:middle line:84%
they all have different
evolutionary potentials,

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.030 align:middle line:84%
which means the way they
can evolve; in which way

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.260 align:middle line:84%
they can evolve in
how likely it is

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.410 align:middle line:84%
that this is going to be a
super successful stable species

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.310 align:middle line:90%
over time.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>> But that's spontaneous,
and the installation,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.640 align:middle line:84%
as I understood, it is a goal
or motivated by, let's say,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.030 align:middle line:84%
reptilians who want
to curtail humanity.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a certain insulation
that's been put over Earth

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.420 align:middle line:84%
in order to lower the potentials
of the evolution of humankind.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And that is a very
complex situation

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.900 align:middle line:84%
because that is responsible for
all the issues and disbalances

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.130 align:middle line:84%
that we experience right
now and on this planet.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And it comes along
with technology

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.630 align:middle line:84%
that's being used in order
to sort of create some chaos.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.160 align:middle line:90%
It's coming down to--

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Like, what technology
would be creating chaos?

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>> What has been reported is
that there are chemicals being

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.690 align:middle line:84%
used but also frequencies
and also psionic frequencies

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:20.190 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring Earth into
a certain lower frequency,

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.160 align:middle line:84%
a lower energetic realm, in
order to slow down the process

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.030 align:middle line:90%
of evolution on this planet.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>> What would be an example
of what a person, a human,

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.420 align:middle line:84%
would experience if they were
the target of, let's say,

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.250 align:middle line:84%
the installations we
want to curtail you?

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.690 align:middle line:90%
We want to stop you.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Would it be frequencies
they would hear in the ears

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.300 align:middle line:84%
and that would cause migraines,
or how would it manifest?

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>> For example, depression.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.030 align:middle line:90%
That would be something.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.190 align:middle line:84%
What we have right
now, right here

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:02.140 align:middle line:84%
in this installation, which is
being removed right now, is--

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.750 align:middle line:90%
>> It's being removed?

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.520 align:middle line:90%
>> It's being removed, right.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.420 align:middle line:90%
>> By?

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>> By inside and outside forces.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.020 align:middle line:84%
They needed time to understand
what's happening on this planet

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.980 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of what is
inside of this installation

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:24.420 align:middle line:84%
is quite subtle and might seem
as if it has evolved naturally.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.620 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.940 align:middle line:84%
We have seen that there have
been temporal modifications,

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.560 align:middle line:84%
meaning an outside
force has influenced

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.960 align:middle line:84%
certain points of human history
over time in a negative way.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.300 align:middle line:84%
But made it look like a
natural occurring thing.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Among humans and not outside
forces that are actually

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:56.130 align:middle line:84%
advanced frequencies, or
are some of those activating

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.340 align:middle line:84%
the blocks in the
installation, are they actual

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.780 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial biological
entities, such as reptilians?

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.960 align:middle line:84%
>> The installation
itself is working on many,

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.460 align:middle line:90%
many different levels.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.480 align:middle line:84%
What we need to understand
is the bigger picture

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.600 align:middle line:90%
how that works.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:21.600 align:middle line:84%
It kind of keeps humans
inside of a miserable reality.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.480 align:middle line:90%
And it's a self--

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Perpetuating.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Perpetuating and
self-repeating process over

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.820 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's very, very
unlikely that humanity,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.120 align:middle line:84%
without removing
the installation,

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.000 align:middle line:84%
would be able to get
out of that because it's

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.290 align:middle line:84%
so complete and
subtle in some way.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So, who gains from
humans being trapped down

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.230 align:middle line:90%
in the installations?

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The surface human beings
are probable of becoming very

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.310 align:middle line:84%
strong warriors, which
poses a threat to, I mean,

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.980 align:middle line:84%
other warrior species
in the universe.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.400 align:middle line:84%
Also, through the very
high evolutionary potential

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.420 align:middle line:84%
that humanity has because it's
facing a lot of challenges

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.310 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of challenges,
a lot of diversity,

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.270 align:middle line:84%
a lot of different
genetic profiles.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.840 align:middle line:84%
All this diversity
means that a species

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.010 align:middle line:84%
has to become fit and
find solution to that.

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And the more solution, the more
diversity, the more challenges

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:33.880 align:middle line:84%
a species faces, the more
it advances over time.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And so us humans have
a very high potential

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.460 align:middle line:84%
of becoming a very dominant
factor in the universe.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And that is something
that other species either

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.990 align:middle line:84%
do not like or like very much
because they think that surface

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.850 align:middle line:90%
humans could protect them.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And what seems like a
very unstable decade that

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:06.390 align:middle line:84%
we're in, are the frequencies
that are jumbling everything?

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:11.070 align:middle line:84%
Are they because of the
installation or independent

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.220 align:middle line:90%
of the installation?

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>> So I would say that
everything that can be

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.520 align:middle line:84%
experienced on this planet is in
some way or another influenced

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.590 align:middle line:84%
by the installation because it's
so complete and very cleverly

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.480 align:middle line:90%
set up.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.520 align:middle line:84%
So let me give you some
examples of how that is done.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.430 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, if we are
talking about the sociocultural

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:45.430 align:middle line:84%
level, there has been a system
brought into place that,

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.360 align:middle line:84%
on a corporal level, is
competing and leading

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.170 align:middle line:84%
to a lose-lose situation,
kind of stand-off because--

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And who is
driving it, though?

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The question is,
who has installed it?

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And once it was in place,
it is mostly driving itself

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:05.080 align:middle line:84%
because humanity,
without even knowing,

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.540 align:middle line:90%
is contributing to its function.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.000 align:middle line:84%
>> But how did it
get into place?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.090 align:middle line:84%
Who has the specific motive
to want to curtail us?

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>> The species that has been
part of talks is reptilian.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:27.170 align:middle line:84%
But more important is to
understand how that works.

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:32.380 align:middle line:84%
So the interesting thing
is that this species

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:38.629 align:middle line:84%
seems to know a lot about the
features and uniqueness of ape

00:08:38.629 --> 00:08:39.429 align:middle line:90%
races.

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:42.679 align:middle line:84%
So humanity is
basically an ape race,

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:47.890 align:middle line:84%
which means it comes from
a 99% ape background.

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:48.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Homo erectus.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
certain unique experiences

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.950 align:middle line:84%
and behavior patterns
that come from that

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:59.720 align:middle line:84%
derives from that
evolutionary genetic thing.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And I assume from
interactions with people

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.010 align:middle line:84%
it's not even obvious
to them that this

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:07.580 align:middle line:90%
might be a genetic thing.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:13.180 align:middle line:84%
So one of these things is ape
species are living in groups

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:18.430 align:middle line:84%
and oppose themselves
against other groups, which

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.320 align:middle line:90%
you can see in the wildlife.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.530 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
group of chimpanzees,

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.770 align:middle line:84%
it's going to have
some kind of battle

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.340 align:middle line:84%
over resources with other
groups of chimpanzees.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.770 align:middle line:90%
Not all species are doing that.

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:34.870 align:middle line:84%
There are lots and
lots of examples,

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:37.390 align:middle line:84%
even on this
planet, where nature

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:41.590 align:middle line:84%
is cooperating in such a way
that it has the best results.

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:46.210 align:middle line:84%
Ape species also rely very
heavily on the togetherness

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:50.440 align:middle line:84%
and continuity of behaviors
inside the group, which

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.800 align:middle line:84%
means, for example, in an
ape species, an ape that,

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.710 align:middle line:84%
for example, would
fall down a tree

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:00.790 align:middle line:84%
accidentally would
certainly try to communicate

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:03.670 align:middle line:84%
that it's been in an
accident and that it's still

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.010 align:middle line:84%
a healthy individual
inside of the group

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:09.490 align:middle line:84%
because they face the
challenges that ape species also

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:13.810 align:middle line:84%
remove members from their own
group if they are not fit.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And fitness, meaning fit
into society into a group,

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:23.560 align:middle line:84%
is something ape species have
relied on for their own success

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.090 align:middle line:90%
of evolution.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:27.970 align:middle line:84%
They need to form
groups, and they

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:32.500 align:middle line:84%
need to have a group
conformity, meaning

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:37.400 align:middle line:84%
that every member of the group
needs to be on the same page,

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.330 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So, what are the reptilians
gaining by this installation

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:47.680 align:middle line:84%
to cause these conflicting
and push-back frequencies?

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, they gain from
that a slowed-down evolution

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:53.890 align:middle line:10%
of humanity.

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.630 align:middle line:10%
>> But how do they
gain from that?

00:10:55.630 --> 00:11:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Potentially a human warrior
species that is fully capable

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.710 align:middle line:90%
of all its powers.

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And we are talking
about, for example,

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:08.710 align:middle line:84%
through genetics, the
lifespan of humans

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.030 align:middle line:90%
being lowered dramatically.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.750 align:middle line:84%
So actually, a human
being could live

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.850 align:middle line:90%
in the 300 years or something.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:20.860 align:middle line:84%
But being genetically
modified, it

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.040 align:middle line:84%
comes down to 70
years or something.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:27.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me ask you because I've
run into this several times

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:33.160 align:middle line:84%
in interviews with abductees,
and it's 40, at least 43 years,

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.000 align:middle line:84%
I have talked with
a lot of people.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And every once in a while, the
same image, the same metaphor,

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:40.890 align:middle line:90%
comes up.

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And that is that I'm
thinking of one man who

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.280 align:middle line:84%
was a scientist in
New Jersey, and he

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:53.110 align:middle line:84%
was abducted, taken right out of
a car, and a beam into a craft,

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:58.780 align:middle line:84%
and they were a form of greys,
and they showed him a screen.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And in the screen, they had
two, two, two, two, five.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:09.070 align:middle line:84%
It was 10-- we'll say they
look sort of like galaxies

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.540 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And the being talking now with
a scientist, not a layperson,

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:22.020 align:middle line:84%
but with a scientist said, this
is your galactic neighborhood,

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.030 align:middle line:90%
but these are not galaxies.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.270 align:middle line:90%
They're universes.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And the scientist, when he was
telling me that said I found

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:38.370 align:middle line:84%
myself gasping inside at the
concept that there could be 10

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:44.520 align:middle line:84%
different universes and we're
in one of 3 trillion galaxies

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:51.840 align:middle line:84%
in one universe, and this grey
being is showing the five pairs

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:56.050 align:middle line:84%
of universes and not only
were there five pairs.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:13:00.540 align:middle line:84%
He talked about a dynamic that
went around life and death

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:06.210 align:middle line:84%
in some process between this
pair of universes and on up.

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And I still can
remember this scientist

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.510 align:middle line:84%
saying that I am
stunned if I have

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.060 align:middle line:90%
been shown a reality because--

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:18.370 align:middle line:90%
and he asked the same question--

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:23.560 align:middle line:84%
what is infinity if
there are 10 universes?

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>> So what we know is there
are different versions

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:33.400 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, some of which
are so exotic and bizarre that

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.610 align:middle line:84%
they don't make any sense
from our viewpoint right now.

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Like, what would be an
example of something you know?

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>> We're coming now into
to realms of understanding

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.520 align:middle line:90%
the universe.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.890 align:middle line:84%
They're very complex,
very advanced.

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.690 align:middle line:90%
So just that being said.

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:51.610 align:middle line:84%
But one of the realms that
the greys, for example, are

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:54.190 align:middle line:84%
exploring right now, and
they have a hard time

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:56.950 align:middle line:84%
to do that because
what they want to do

00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:02.440 align:middle line:84%
is gain literally every
experience in the universe

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.210 align:middle line:90%
and get it integrated.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:07.220 align:middle line:90%
That's their approach.

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.220 align:middle line:84%
So they go out to
different versions

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.990 align:middle line:84%
of the universe,
different realities,

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.610 align:middle line:90%
different realms of existence.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And one of these newer realms
that they are discovering

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:22.390 align:middle line:84%
is a super bizarre version
of the universe that

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:29.880 align:middle line:84%
deals with the pure
nonsense of existence, which

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.820 align:middle line:84%
is, I mean, if we
are talking about all

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.930 align:middle line:84%
these models of frequency,
everything makes sense.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:38.280 align:middle line:90%
Life makes sense.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.870 align:middle line:84%
You see that the
universe makes sense.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:44.790 align:middle line:84%
But there also is a probability
where the universe is

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:50.070 align:middle line:84%
ridiculously nonsense,
and it continuously

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:55.950 align:middle line:84%
loses its form over its
own laughter and ridicule.

00:14:55.950 --> 00:15:00.090 align:middle line:84%
There is life in that
universe as well,

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:04.320 align:middle line:84%
but it's so different
and so exotic

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:10.620 align:middle line:84%
that you could not possibly
have any conception of yourself

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:15.660 align:middle line:84%
because everything
is pure nonsense.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And I am now more aware than
I have ever been of deceptions

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:26.610 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth that are created
by illusions that can be traced

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:32.100 align:middle line:84%
directly to some kind of
push-back by extraterrestrial

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.170 align:middle line:90%
intelligences.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And if that is a context
that you would think

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:43.190 align:middle line:84%
relates to the
installation, what

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:48.710 align:middle line:84%
would be the evolution going
forward right now to humans

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:51.470 align:middle line:84%
pushing aback against
the installation

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:56.420 align:middle line:84%
having these impacts of
illusions and delusions

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.150 align:middle line:90%
so much on Earth life?

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that's very
well put for your side.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.310 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly that.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:07.160 align:middle line:84%
So we have come
to the conclusion

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.250 align:middle line:84%
that there is an
artificial system that

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:14.240 align:middle line:84%
has been opposed onto
humanity and Earth

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:19.940 align:middle line:84%
as well that needs to be
removed in order to have

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:23.660 align:middle line:84%
the human species to
evolve successfully.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:26.705 align:middle line:84%
And to have the bigger
picture of that,

00:16:26.705 --> 00:16:32.300 align:middle line:84%
that includes technology that's
been used against humanity.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:37.700 align:middle line:84%
It means historical or temporal
modification of certain things.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:43.340 align:middle line:84%
It means sociocultural
systems that

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:47.150 align:middle line:84%
seem to lead to a
lose-lose situation, which

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:51.070 align:middle line:84%
means that humanity
is constantly

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:56.990 align:middle line:84%
or used to go through cycles
of destruction, renaissance,

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:59.900 align:middle line:90%
and destruction again.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:05.359 align:middle line:84%
>> And you know, it reminds me,
like if you are at a bullfight

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:09.200 align:middle line:84%
and the toreador
does this right,

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.500 align:middle line:84%
and the bull is stomping,
and the toreador is saying,

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.510 align:middle line:90%
come here.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:15.840 align:middle line:90%
Don't come here.

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:16.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>> It is almost as if the whole
global situation is look here

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.140 align:middle line:84%
right, but this is
what is going on.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.430 align:middle line:84%
How would we bring 8
billion minds and souls

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:32.650 align:middle line:90%
up to seeing clearly?

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:36.550 align:middle line:84%
This is not where
you want to go.

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:39.040 align:middle line:84%
This is what is
really happening.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:43.060 align:middle line:84%
How would we do this as a
civilization going forward?

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.280 align:middle line:10%
>> That's a very
complex question

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.820 align:middle line:10%
and because the installation
operates on so many different

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:54.310 align:middle line:10%
levels, we even have a
spiritual side to it where even

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:59.830 align:middle line:10%
the rebirth cycle is being
manipulated in a way that some

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:04.240 align:middle line:10%
souls experience an exit
channel right back into Earth.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.670 align:middle line:84%
So, they reincarnate
again on Earth

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:08.680 align:middle line:84%
and experience the
same challenges

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.970 align:middle line:90%
they experienced before.

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:11.860 align:middle line:90%
Talking about reducing entropy.

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:17.200 align:middle line:84%
It means that the soul needs to
experience new things in order

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.930 align:middle line:84%
to learn from it
to find solutions.

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:24.460 align:middle line:84%
But if you're forced to be stuck
in a certain cycle and always

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:28.840 align:middle line:84%
experience the same things and
not have any different input

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:31.910 align:middle line:84%
or solution to it,
you cannot exit that.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.630 align:middle line:84%
So that is something
that's been done.

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, and good
for us, there are

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:41.770 align:middle line:84%
a lot of higher frequency
species that offer their help

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:46.480 align:middle line:84%
and offer different
situations in order to proceed

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.910 align:middle line:90%
with the rebirth cycling.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:54.310 align:middle line:84%
But there also is this one
case where this rebirth cycle

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:58.750 align:middle line:84%
is being used in order to keep
people trapped onto the Earth

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:03.700 align:middle line:84%
situation and not go somewhere
else in order to learn.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:08.440 align:middle line:84%
So that is something that
is being removed right now.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>> How?

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>> There are species on
higher frequency levels that

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:21.250 align:middle line:84%
their very mission is to
create space in the afterlife,

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:22.310 align:middle line:90%
if that makes sense.

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:23.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:25.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Expand that.

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:30.850 align:middle line:84%
So everything we
experience is some kind

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:33.550 align:middle line:84%
of a construct, an
illusion, so to speak.

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:37.280 align:middle line:84%
A creative illusion of
the universe itself.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.580 align:middle line:84%
It creates something out
of nothing, so to speak.

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:46.450 align:middle line:84%
So if the conscious unit
or the observer or someone

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:51.160 align:middle line:84%
is going through death, it
needs to go into something

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.800 align:middle line:84%
that can be experienced,
and from there,

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.900 align:middle line:84%
get recycled into
something else that

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.870 align:middle line:84%
can be experienced
because that is

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:01.930 align:middle line:84%
the basic factor for the
universe in order to learn.

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:03.590 align:middle line:90%
It needs experiences.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:08.080 align:middle line:84%
So the interesting thing is that
there are species living inside

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:14.320 align:middle line:84%
of fourth-level frequencies,
that the only thing that they

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:19.390 align:middle line:84%
are doing is creating
spaces and situations where

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:24.310 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness mind
can operate and understand

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:26.740 align:middle line:84%
what's happening
in the afterlife.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.740 align:middle line:10%
One example could be and
you mentioned Bob Monroe.

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.960 align:middle line:10%
He explained like
a lot of places

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.050 align:middle line:10%
through out-of-body
experiences where

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:38.770 align:middle line:10%
you can see that there are
worlds in the afterlife that

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.420 align:middle line:10%
can be accessed.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.190 align:middle line:90%
>> He called me.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:44.540 align:middle line:84%
He called me after
his wife died.

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:45.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And he said Linda, I
know, and used her name.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.010 align:middle line:90%
It's all right.

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:55.390 align:middle line:84%
She's out at and gave a
mathematical configuration.

00:20:55.390 --> 00:21:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is there was
something just so grounded.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:06.610 align:middle line:84%
It was like Monroe was
calling to say my wife is OK.

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:08.410 align:middle line:90%
I know where she is.

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.600 align:middle line:90%
I will be able to visit her.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.780 align:middle line:84%
The rest of us hear
that discussion,

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.370 align:middle line:90%
and we say how is this possible?

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:17.920 align:middle line:90%
What is he doing?

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Now can you fill out some of
the gaps of how would that work?

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:27.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So it basically means that
there are species at level four

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:32.230 align:middle line:84%
and/or level five consciousness
that are capable of creating

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:35.450 align:middle line:90%
space within the afterlife.

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:38.680 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard to grasp
how they do that exactly,

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:43.600 align:middle line:84%
but in the same way that this
3D world is being created out

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:49.780 align:middle line:84%
of nothing, they are constantly
creating different transition

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:53.590 align:middle line:84%
stations from one life
cycle to another life cycle

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:58.360 align:middle line:84%
because the soul, and talking
about reducing entropy,

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:02.500 align:middle line:84%
the soul needs to have a
certain amount of experiences

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:09.100 align:middle line:84%
until it realizes that it's
the own self that creates

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:13.990 align:middle line:84%
its world, meaning you are
fully responsible and capable

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:16.040 align:middle line:90%
of creating your own home.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.870 align:middle line:10%
That is where the universe wants
you, me, and everything else

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:25.960 align:middle line:10%
to go to so that everyone can
create their own universe,

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:31.270 align:middle line:10%
and then we have a unified
field of so many great inspiring

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:35.660 align:middle line:10%
homes that we can elaborate
from that and operate from that.

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:41.890 align:middle line:10%
But until that stage, there
is some kind of illusion

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:44.110 align:middle line:10%
in order to guide the soul.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And these worlds
in the afterlife

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:52.300 align:middle line:84%
are being created so
that being, a soul that

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:56.470 align:middle line:84%
transits to another
rebirth cycle,

00:22:56.470 --> 00:23:01.480 align:middle line:84%
has a place to reflect
on itself to come

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:07.330 align:middle line:84%
to a non-traumatic experience
and also have a logic in order

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:10.210 align:middle line:84%
to have this kind
of amnesia process

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:14.230 align:middle line:84%
where you just forget about
your experience that might have

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:19.180 align:middle line:84%
failed and then continue
with a different variable

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.390 align:middle line:90%
and different approach.

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:24.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we've been talking
about the installation as being

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:31.680 align:middle line:84%
forces manipulated by reptiles
and perhaps a lot of ETs trying

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:35.550 align:middle line:84%
to slow down or curtail the
evolution of humans either out

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.650 align:middle line:84%
of jealousy or
territorial design,

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:40.230 align:middle line:90%
or whatever the motive is.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:44.490 align:middle line:84%
How would that translate
into the afterlife

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:50.850 align:middle line:84%
if we're being curtailed
on the 3D-4D side of what

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:52.950 align:middle line:90%
we would call living life?

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And then comes the moment of
death and then into a phase

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:02.160 align:middle line:84%
as you have just described so
that there would be some effort

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:08.880 align:middle line:84%
to even continue the education
after death in the afterlife.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.920 align:middle line:90%
Are there reptiles?

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Are there intelligences
that are actually

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:21.270 align:middle line:84%
trying to persuade
souls in the afterlife

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:24.990 align:middle line:84%
to go a wrong direction
that would slow them

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:28.860 align:middle line:84%
down even before they
are reincarnated?

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Just the same way as there
are species and forces that

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:38.340 align:middle line:84%
guide people in a positive
way in the afterlife,

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:43.770 align:middle line:84%
there's also a very small
number of species that try to do

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:46.560 align:middle line:90%
the direct opposite.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.140 align:middle line:84%
But luckily, for
every one of us,

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:54.240 align:middle line:84%
the amount of species that do it
very positively and benevolent

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.650 align:middle line:90%
is way bigger.

00:24:55.650 --> 00:25:00.330 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about 99% to
1% at the level four stage.

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And the best thing
every one of us can do

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:07.710 align:middle line:84%
is either you have the
capabilities and capacities

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:10.050 align:middle line:84%
to understand your
role in the universe,

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:14.640 align:middle line:84%
and you have a level four
consciousness understanding

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.080 align:middle line:90%
of how everything works.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Then you can design your
own afterlife, so to speak.

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And learn how to reject the
negative as soon as you feel

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:25.710 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:26.910 align:middle line:90%
>> It 100%.

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:28.350 align:middle line:90%
100%.

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Either you have the
level of consciousness

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:34.560 align:middle line:84%
in order to know
that you can create

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:39.300 align:middle line:84%
your own worlds in the
afterlife and just go there.

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Whatever idea you
have, it's possible.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Or you rely on the natural
forces of the universe

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:51.240 align:middle line:84%
and maybe get into
contact with them in a way

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.640 align:middle line:84%
that you just make a
willingful decision

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:57.540 align:middle line:84%
to say I would love to receive
help for the transition.

00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:01.200 align:middle line:84%
That is something that the
universe heavily relies on,

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.530 align:middle line:84%
and it's just one
very simple sentence

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:06.990 align:middle line:84%
that can be repeated
over a lifetime in order

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:12.540 align:middle line:84%
to make clear for the universe
that my transition has

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:15.780 align:middle line:90%
to be smooth, gentle, and nice.

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, this really does
dovetail to another one

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:22.980 align:middle line:84%
of the mysteries that I've
encountered over the last four

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:24.210 align:middle line:90%
decades.

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:29.450 align:middle line:84%
One of the mysteries that I
have encountered in abductions

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:34.040 align:middle line:84%
is that I will have interviewed
someone about being taken.

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.560 align:middle line:84%
It could be in a beam of
light, whatever it is,

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.660 align:middle line:90%
with another intelligence.

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And then they will
get in contact with me

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:44.390 align:middle line:84%
and say an animal that
they had, a cat or a dog,

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:50.590 align:middle line:84%
died or their brother or their
sister or father or a relative.

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And what they are describing
is having an experience usually

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:59.550 align:middle line:84%
at night of having whatever has
passed over come back to them

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:03.720 align:middle line:84%
in a very, very vivid
way within, let's say,

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:08.340 align:middle line:84%
48 hours of the passing
of the organic body.

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And because I've
seen this pattern,

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:13.600 align:middle line:90%
it's even happened to me.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think that there
is that kind of vividness

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:23.680 align:middle line:84%
in some lives that
seems to connect?

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:27.130 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if it's
saying this is real.

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:29.950 align:middle line:84%
This has happened, and
there is a survival

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:33.790 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness
after death, but it

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:35.750 align:middle line:90%
doesn't happen for everyone.

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So what's definitely true
is that consciousness survives

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:43.750 align:middle line:84%
death because everything
is just the same illusion,

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:47.980 align:middle line:84%
but it goes through logical
steps and worlds in order

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:52.420 align:middle line:84%
to make sense out of it, which
changes in the moment where you

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:56.320 align:middle line:84%
understand your own
capacity to create worlds.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.110 align:middle line:84%
That is something
consciousness goes through.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:06.820 align:middle line:84%
The thing that is a little
hard to prove is what is real

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:07.970 align:middle line:90%
and what's not real.

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:12.850 align:middle line:84%
But we have a lot of
cases where people report

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:16.180 align:middle line:84%
shadowish beings that
communicate with them

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:20.770 align:middle line:84%
that appear, for example, in the
bedroom or something just one

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:24.115 align:middle line:84%
day or two days after a
relative, mother, daughter,

00:28:24.115 --> 00:28:26.470 align:middle line:90%
or whatever, died.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>> In my mind now, talking
with you about the installation

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:33.790 align:middle line:84%
and the idea that there could
be these cross-currents always

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:39.980 align:middle line:84%
trying to deceive, this feels
to me as if it is an example

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:45.140 align:middle line:84%
of something pushing back
against forces that are trying

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.050 align:middle line:90%
to be deceptive.

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And that these are
experiences which are you have

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:51.500 align:middle line:90%
a soul.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.270 align:middle line:90%
The cat has a soul.

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:55.160 align:middle line:90%
Your father has a soul.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:29:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And that you are able to have
this brief communion even

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:03.620 align:middle line:84%
after the passing
from life to death.

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And that would be
something to encourage,

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:11.640 align:middle line:84%
perhaps to push the
installation further away.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So remember that the
universe itself at level seven

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.520 align:middle line:84%
consciousness is this
wonderful, beautiful,

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:23.060 align:middle line:84%
loving place of existence
where we all are,

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:24.980 align:middle line:90%
and we all enjoy ourselves.

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.290 align:middle line:90%
That is very true.

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And a level four frequency,
which is basically

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:39.770 align:middle line:84%
the afterlife that this is
situated in level four world,

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:44.360 align:middle line:84%
this allows for certain
very positive frequencies

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.560 align:middle line:90%
to be experienced.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about 99%
of those great wonderful

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:51.860 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:54.920 align:middle line:10%
It's only because
our consciousness

00:29:54.920 --> 00:30:00.920 align:middle line:10%
is, through one way or
another, kept in this frequency

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:05.330 align:middle line:10%
that we are experiencing
right now that the benevolent

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:09.050 align:middle line:10%
and wonderful frequencies
and situations

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:12.440 align:middle line:10%
are sort of artificially
being kept out of Earth.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.960 align:middle line:10%
We still experience
them, so we still

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:18.800 align:middle line:10%
have wonderful, beautiful
divine experiences,

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:22.560 align:middle line:10%
mystical experiences,
and so on and so forth.

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:27.710 align:middle line:84%
But we see that the
more consciousness units

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:31.160 align:middle line:84%
that are living together,
for example, in the city,

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:36.800 align:middle line:84%
they create their own reality,
their shared community, which

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.980 align:middle line:84%
is kind of
denaturalized, so it's

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:45.080 align:middle line:84%
kind of away from this
super beautiful divine

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:48.620 align:middle line:84%
feeling that we all
experience at so many levels.

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And in such an amount of
places in the universe,

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:58.730 align:middle line:84%
it's very rare that
we have a situation

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:01.795 align:middle line:90%
like we do find here on Earth.

00:31:01.795 --> 00:31:07.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Did do you ever hear what
Steve Jobs' wife described when

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:08.470 align:middle line:90%
he passed?

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:09.270 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:10.170 align:middle line:90%
What did she?

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:12.330 align:middle line:90%
>> It was fascinating.

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:16.740 align:middle line:84%
She was interviewed
after Steve Jobs died,

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.680 align:middle line:84%
and she said I was
sitting by the bed,

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:24.020 align:middle line:84%
and I was holding on to his
hand, and he was unconscious,

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.270 align:middle line:90%
and she was just watching him.

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:28.940 align:middle line:84%
The breaths were getting
more and more shallow,

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:30.910 align:middle line:90%
and she was aware.

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And she said all of a
sudden, he opened his eyes,

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.200 align:middle line:90%
his body came up.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.150 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:42.130 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:44.800 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.420 align:middle line:90%
And laid down.

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And for a long time after
she did that interview,

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:57.320 align:middle line:84%
everywhere you went was what did
Steve Jobs see for those three

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:58.790 align:middle line:90%
"oh wows."

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:00.350 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Look, we have a situation
where the universe is itself

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:07.530 align:middle line:90%
creating something for itself.

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:12.860 align:middle line:84%
So the universe knows that
everything that it's creating

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.440 align:middle line:84%
is not for an outside
force or something.

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.900 align:middle line:84%
It's creating
something for itself.

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And why should the
universe create something

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:27.740 align:middle line:84%
that is anything else than
beautiful, great, loving,

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:31.160 align:middle line:84%
and super wonderful
to experience?

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the pushback
from the installation.

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:39.860 align:middle line:10%
Because there are some aspects
totally irrational to my mind,

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:46.280 align:middle line:10%
but there are some aspects of
this universe that seem to just

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:51.050 align:middle line:10%
don't like this
super divine feeling

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:53.840 align:middle line:10%
for other aspects
of the universe.

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.570 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that
someone could have

00:32:56.570 --> 00:33:01.770 align:middle line:84%
this kind of self-destructive
neuro-behavior patterns,

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:05.270 align:middle line:84%
so someone has to do
the job, so to speak.

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Someone in the universe
picks up on that frequency

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:11.720 align:middle line:90%
and kind of plays it out.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And that is only true
until it's been solved.

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:20.150 align:middle line:84%
So that's a certain
moment in time or outside

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:23.300 align:middle line:84%
of time, whatever you want
to call it, inside of time

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.580 align:middle line:84%
as well where this
is being played out.

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:29.810 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make sense
anymore, and the universe just

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:33.770 align:middle line:84%
gets rid of it because
it's part of the reduction

00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:36.890 align:middle line:84%
scenario of entropy,
and this kind

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:40.620 align:middle line:84%
of self-destructive behaviors,
at one point or another,

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:42.560 align:middle line:90%
will not make any sense anymore.

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And it seems like that
out of this discussion

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:49.550 align:middle line:84%
of installation, of something
trying to curtail human

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:54.920 align:middle line:84%
evolution versus forces that
are trying to make us understand

00:33:54.920 --> 00:34:00.470 align:middle line:84%
that that's illusion and that
the reality is joy and love

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:02.570 align:middle line:90%
and light.

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:07.160 align:middle line:84%
One of the contradictions
that puzzles me is we

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.400 align:middle line:84%
have talked about how
the installation is

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:15.710 align:middle line:84%
trying to curtail
humanity's evolution.

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:19.010 align:middle line:10%
But there are so many
examples of humans

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:24.350 align:middle line:10%
being given joy
and light and love

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:27.980 align:middle line:10%
that it's like,
why would anything

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:31.130 align:middle line:10%
in the big scheme
of the universe

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:34.969 align:middle line:10%
be given even the
right or the option

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:38.490 align:middle line:10%
to do the curtailing
in the installation?

00:34:38.490 --> 00:34:39.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And the answer to
that is quite easy

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:46.590 align:middle line:84%
because it's just possible that
the universe could do that,

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:47.820 align:middle line:90%
and so it's happening.

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:52.070 align:middle line:84%
So that is the easiest
answer to your question.

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:55.100 align:middle line:84%
The other question
is, the thing is,

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:59.900 align:middle line:84%
why are there species that
are so benevolent and caring?

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Why do they let things
like that happen?

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And the answer to that is
because a lot of species

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:12.650 align:middle line:84%
have not been aware
of what artificially

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:15.350 align:middle line:90%
has been put upon Earth.

00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:19.340 align:middle line:10%
So because it's been made in
such a clever way, whoever

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:22.670 align:middle line:10%
made that and whoever
did it, has made it

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:25.970 align:middle line:10%
in such a clever way that
it looks like something

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:31.700 align:middle line:10%
that humanity has accidentally
been created upon itself,

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.300 align:middle line:10%
and that is just not true.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's the installation.

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:35.365 align:middle line:90%
>> That is the installation.

00:35:35.365 --> 00:35:36.165 align:middle line:90%
>> The push-back.

00:35:36.165 --> 00:35:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been covered in a way
that it looks like something

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:43.370 align:middle line:84%
that occurred
naturally, but it's not.

00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:46.430 align:middle line:84%
It's something that's
been cloaked in a way

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:49.640 align:middle line:84%
so that it looks like something
that occurred naturally.

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And that makes a big
difference to other species.

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:57.560 align:middle line:10%
So there's a big difference to
their own reaction of something

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:01.940 align:middle line:10%
and to their own
will to interfere

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:07.040 align:middle line:10%
with something if the situation
is a naturally occurring.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:11.180 align:middle line:84%
If it's B, something that
the specific species has

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:15.770 align:middle line:84%
done willfully to itself, then
it's a free-will decision.

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:17.720 align:middle line:84%
No one's going to
interfere with that.

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Or the third option
is some outside force

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:25.490 align:middle line:84%
that has planted
something into it

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:30.650 align:middle line:84%
that is artificially designed
in order to bring chaos.

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:33.380 align:middle line:10%
The third option
is something where

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:38.330 align:middle line:10%
most species that are
proactive on these things

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:42.150 align:middle line:10%
would say we need to
interfere on that.

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:43.940 align:middle line:10%
But if it's just
looking as if it

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:46.190 align:middle line:10%
was one of the
two first options,

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:50.300 align:middle line:10%
then they would hesitate
in order to come for help.

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>> But it still seems strange
that our allies, spiritually,

00:36:56.010 --> 00:37:01.040 align:middle line:84%
physically, other intelligences,
would even allow anything like

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:04.320 align:middle line:84%
the installation to be
trying to slow us down.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:07.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if this is
something that humanity

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:11.300 align:middle line:84%
would have done
to itself, then it

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:16.370 align:middle line:84%
would be crazy and
illogical, but it

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:20.570 align:middle line:84%
would be allowed because it's
part of the natural maybe

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:24.170 align:middle line:84%
learning process of that species
to be self-destructive or be

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:28.580 align:middle line:84%
being trapped in something
because there are species that

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:36.800 align:middle line:84%
enjoy states and situations that
other species might not enjoy.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.410 align:middle line:90%
There might be species.

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:42.650 align:middle line:84%
For example,
slavery is something

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:47.330 align:middle line:84%
that humans would
collectively reject

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:50.360 align:middle line:90%
in an ethical morally way.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:54.410 align:middle line:10%
But if you compare that,
for maybe the situation

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:58.730 align:middle line:10%
that certain insects have,
creating their whole experience

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:04.220 align:middle line:10%
around one king or one queen
insect and building on this,

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:06.630 align:middle line:10%
then it's something different.

00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:12.620 align:middle line:84%
We would probably say no,
that's the kind of behavior

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:15.800 align:middle line:84%
that it's not enjoyable
for us, but it might be

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.550 align:middle line:90%
enjoyable for another species.

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:20.840 align:middle line:10%
So, most species I'm
talking about right now,

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:25.430 align:middle line:10%
they would try to understand
and observe the situation first

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:30.330 align:middle line:10%
and have a bigger picture
about what's happening.

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So that might be the
reason why things

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:36.290 align:middle line:90%
were in place for so long.

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:40.370 align:middle line:10%
And the best thing, if I can add
to that, is for every one of us

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:45.350 align:middle line:10%
to make a willingful, and clear
decision of our own destiny

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:46.430 align:middle line:10%
to the universe.

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:51.590 align:middle line:84%
It can be just like
one sentence that you

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:54.350 align:middle line:84%
put before you sleep
or something, just one

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:58.340 align:middle line:84%
sentence a day will clearly
indicate the universe what

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.980 align:middle line:84%
you want, and you have
your own responsibility

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:02.060 align:middle line:90%
about your destiny.

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Like I am one with the light.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.380 align:middle line:90%
The light is one with me.

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in the hands
of God forever.

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:11.360 align:middle line:90%
>> That's pretty nice.

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:16.250 align:middle line:84%
Or, like the people of the
community of Gaia said it,

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:20.050 align:middle line:84%
"all shift happily now,"
which I really enjoy.

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, thanks for joining me
on another special Truth Hunter.

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for
having me, Linda.

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:30.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Coming up on the
next Truth Hunter.

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Someone came up to me
and asked me if I'm as well

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:36.340 align:middle line:90%
a comedian.

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And this being seemed to be
part of a group of reptiles that

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:46.960 align:middle line:84%
blended into society by
irradiating frequency

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.210 align:middle line:90%
so that they seemed human.

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:54.220 align:middle line:10%
>> The greys sell these
little fabricated bodies.

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:59.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, they're selling
their own AI self.

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:03.450 align:middle line:10%
>> You can have one if you
get in contact with the greys.

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:06.000 align:middle line:90%
