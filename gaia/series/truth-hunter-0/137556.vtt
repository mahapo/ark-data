00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.883 align:middle line:84%
Hi, I'm Linda
Moulton Howe.

00:00:07.883 --> 00:00:10.677 align:middle line:84%
Since graduating
from Stanford University

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:12.387 align:middle line:84%
where I produced
documentaries

00:00:12.387 --> 00:00:14.431 align:middle line:84%
about medicine
and science,

00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:18.560 align:middle line:84%
I have investigated the world
with the pressure of fact.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.022 align:middle line:84%
I am a truth hunter
on this planet,

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:25.484 align:middle line:84%
this solar system and
the universe beyond.

00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:29.446 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.216 align:middle line:84%
>> "Truth Hunter" includes
investigations of symbols

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:53.178 align:middle line:84%
discovered on the surfaces
of UFO debris in the Roswell

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:57.933 align:middle line:10%
crashes of the 1940s and beyond
to many other locations that

00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:02.771 align:middle line:10%
lead up to US Army
Sergeant CJ, I call him,

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:07.192 align:middle line:84%
and his wife
on June 29, 2015.

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:11.029 align:middle line:84%
They were faced with an
820 foot diameter disk

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:13.615 align:middle line:84%
above their truck
in Wadley, Georgia.

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:16.033 align:middle line:84%
Across the middle
of the huge disk

00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:19.288 align:middle line:84%
were symbols, that I
recognized a couple of them

00:01:19.288 --> 00:01:23.792 align:middle line:84%
as nearly the same as symbols
drawn by Staff Sergeant James

00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:27.629 align:middle line:84%
Penniston after midnight
on December 26, 1980

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:32.259 align:middle line:84%
in Rendlesham Forest near
RAF Bentwaters Woodbridge.

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.221 align:middle line:84%
So let's start now with a
comparison of the Wadley craft

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:40.309 align:middle line:84%
symbols with those in the
Rendlesham Forest incident.

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:43.020 align:middle line:84%
The far left symbol on
the Wadley, Georgia disk

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.857 align:middle line:84%
seems to match the
far left bottom symbol

00:01:46.857 --> 00:01:49.901 align:middle line:84%
that Staff Sergeant
James Penniston sketched

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:53.697 align:middle line:84%
after he touched raised
symbols on a nine foot

00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:58.702 align:middle line:84%
long, black, glassy, triangular
craft in Rendlesham Forest.

00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:01.788 align:middle line:84%
That was in England,
and it was about 3:00 AM

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:04.999 align:middle line:90%
on December 26, 1980.

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:08.836 align:middle line:84%
Also, Sergeant Penniston's
ring around that triangle

00:02:08.836 --> 00:02:12.799 align:middle line:84%
with the two black circles
resembles the second symbol

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.302 align:middle line:84%
from the right on
the Wadley disk

00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:20.599 align:middle line:84%
that has a ring around a
triangle with three circles.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.019 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant CJ and his wife
were very confused about

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.312 align:middle line:90%
what had happened.

00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:28.607 align:middle line:84%
CJ recalculated his
GPS and continued

00:02:28.607 --> 00:02:31.735 align:middle line:84%
driving northwest
to Atlanta, Georgia

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:34.279 align:middle line:90%
again, on a different road.

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:37.574 align:middle line:84%
They finally checked into the
Magnuson Hotel in Kennesaw,

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:44.331 align:middle line:84%
north of Atlanta, at
7:36 AM on June 29, 2015.

00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:46.875 align:middle line:84%
They slept in the
day and then got back

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:49.293 align:middle line:84%
on the road, headed
for Kentucky.

00:02:49.293 --> 00:02:52.506 align:middle line:84%
The credit card sales
receipt for the Motel 6

00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:57.010 align:middle line:84%
in Paducah, Kentucky, shows
CJ and his family checked

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.599 align:middle line:90%
in at 5:13 AM on June 30, 2015.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.353 align:middle line:90%
Exhausted, everyone fell asleep.

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:09.189 align:middle line:84%
But Sergeant CJ found
himself waking up

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.483 align:middle line:84%
in their Motel 6
bathroom holding

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:14.736 align:middle line:84%
a ballpoint pen in one hand
and the letter-size motel

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:16.363 align:middle line:90%
receipt in the other.

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:19.241 align:middle line:84%
CJ was staring at the back
of the receipt, covered

00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:21.952 align:middle line:84%
with squares and
lines that trailed off

00:03:21.952 --> 00:03:24.579 align:middle line:90%
to the angry, perplexed letters.

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.166 align:middle line:90%
What the-- WTF.

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:32.087 align:middle line:84%
For our first recorded interview
about this high strangeness,

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:35.090 align:middle line:84%
he asked that his voice
be electronically altered

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.636 align:middle line:84%
because he is active Army, and
he wants to remain anonymous.

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:43.849 align:middle line:84%
So what you are about to hear
is a distorted male voice.

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.977 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant CJ talks
about a vivid dream

00:03:46.977 --> 00:03:50.856 align:middle line:84%
that he had before becoming
conscious in that bathroom.

00:03:50.856 --> 00:03:54.025 align:middle line:84%
In the dream, light gray
colored alien beings

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:58.530 align:middle line:84%
wearing dark lenses over
eyes similar to but larger

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.911 align:middle line:84%
than human eyes are warning
about a threat to Earth.

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:10.167 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen the symbols in
sleep or in your mind's eye?

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:11.793 align:middle line:90%
>> Usually in my sleep.

00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:13.628 align:middle line:84%
And that first time
that it happened,

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:17.257 align:middle line:84%
when I was in that hotel, I do
not remember getting out of bed

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:19.259 align:middle line:84%
and walking into the
bathroom with a pen,

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.179 align:middle line:84%
in my hotel, where she
had been doing that.

00:04:22.179 --> 00:04:26.808 align:middle line:84%
I literally woke up standing
there after I had finished.

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:29.019 align:middle line:84%
>> Have the symbols
been repeated,

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:31.813 align:middle line:84%
in addition to the squares
and the vertical lines?

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I've seen them
again in dreams.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.486 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you describe that dream?

00:04:37.486 --> 00:04:38.278 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:42.699 align:middle line:84%
It's dark all the way around,
and their being scrolled past

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.159 align:middle line:90%
from right to left.

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:48.413 align:middle line:84%
They're slightly illuminated,
like a light blue color.

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:51.291 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you getting any
impression of what they are

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:53.877 align:middle line:90%
saying in your dream?

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:57.464 align:middle line:84%
>> Something Council
of five, I believe?

00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Council of five?

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.342 align:middle line:90%
And what are they saying?

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:02.761 align:middle line:90%
>> It's more of a warning.

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:04.804 align:middle line:90%
A preparation for something.

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:09.434 align:middle line:84%
An alert of what may
come, or what could come,

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:14.231 align:middle line:84%
or what is soon to come, or
something to that effect.

00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:17.901 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing what
they can to try to help us.

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:21.279 align:middle line:84%
They're almost to the point
where they're outnumbered,

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:25.617 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
need to assist and get

00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:27.953 align:middle line:84%
to where we need to
be sooner in order

00:05:27.953 --> 00:05:30.914 align:middle line:90%
to be able to stand a chance.

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:36.169 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you see any humanoids
of any shape or size or type

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.463 align:middle line:90%
in any of your dreams?

00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:39.464 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, ma'am.

00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:42.133 align:middle line:90%
>> Which type?

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:46.263 align:middle line:84%
>> Skin similar to ours,
however, grayish in color.

00:05:46.263 --> 00:05:47.764 align:middle line:90%
Elongated heads.

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:49.641 align:middle line:90%
Larger sockets for eyes.

00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:50.767 align:middle line:90%
Larger eyes.

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:53.353 align:middle line:84%
In the dream that
I was seeing there

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:56.231 align:middle line:84%
was one about where
my feet would be,

00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:58.858 align:middle line:84%
and I could see
expressionless on his face

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:03.572 align:middle line:84%
as a little bit of worry, but
was trying to keep being calm.

00:06:03.572 --> 00:06:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you get the telepathic
impressions of warning there

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.164 align:middle line:84%
aren't enough of us,
there's more of them.

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:15.333 align:middle line:84%
Something is going
to happen that's

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:19.337 align:middle line:84%
going to be a big problem, and
that these beings have been

00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:22.424 align:middle line:84%
trying to help, and now
they can't because they

00:06:22.424 --> 00:06:26.261 align:middle line:84%
don't have enough numbers
versus what is there?

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:29.347 align:middle line:84%
>> Similar, perhaps, but I
think it's more along the lines

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:32.475 align:middle line:84%
of what we're doing
that's going to harm us,

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:36.229 align:middle line:84%
such as sending
signals out into space,

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.857 align:middle line:90%
is not a safe thing to do.

00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:42.402 align:middle line:84%
That we have technology
that we need to expand on,

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:44.863 align:middle line:84%
but it's being
kept from everyone,

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:46.948 align:middle line:84%
behind locked doors
or closed doors,

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:51.077 align:middle line:84%
and only to certain individuals,
or something to that effect.

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:54.456 align:middle line:84%
And allow all minds
to come together

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:57.500 align:middle line:84%
to get things done a
little bit quicker.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.753 align:middle line:90%
>> Or what is going to happen?

00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:02.756 align:middle line:84%
>> Whatever's going to happen
might negatively affect us.

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:04.883 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
that might be though.

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:07.844 align:middle line:84%
>> And if there is a
warning or an alert.

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:12.807 align:middle line:84%
That would imply that something
is coming that may be harmful.

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:13.642 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:07:13.642 --> 00:07:17.937 align:middle line:84%
I know it's something that
will affect us here on Earth.

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:22.275 align:middle line:84%
I know that at our current
advancement and technology

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:25.945 align:middle line:84%
and how we're progressing
is happening to slow.

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:30.617 align:middle line:84%
And the way to fix that
is opening up and allowing

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:33.745 align:middle line:84%
everyone here who's
kept in the dark

00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:35.580 align:middle line:84%
or not being told
the information,

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:40.293 align:middle line:84%
we need to allow outside
minds in in order

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:43.046 align:middle line:84%
to solve the issues
that we're having,

00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:45.840 align:middle line:84%
to increase our
advancement in technology,

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.428 align:middle line:84%
and speed up our
process for advancement.

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:54.099 align:middle line:84%
>> If that doesn't happen,
what bad could happen?

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:58.019 align:middle line:84%
>> i really don't have
an answer for that.

00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:01.606 align:middle line:84%
>> About the Council of Five,
Sergeant CJ told me he had

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:05.610 align:middle line:84%
never heard about it
outside of the dream.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:09.948 align:middle line:84%
When you Google ET or
alien council of five,

00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:13.410 align:middle line:84%
this is one of the websites
that comes up that lists five

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:16.955 align:middle line:84%
alleged alien races
that include, all caps,

00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:20.457 align:middle line:90%
E-M-E-R-T-H-E-R, EMERTHER.

00:08:20.457 --> 00:08:24.212 align:middle line:84%
The website Alien Axioms
describes the EMERTHER

00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:27.507 align:middle line:84%
as quote, "one of
the founder races

00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:30.510 align:middle line:84%
of the Council of
Five, ancient and more

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:34.597 align:middle line:84%
advanced on many levels than
most cosmic intelligences.

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:37.933 align:middle line:84%
Allegedly, it was the EMERTHER
that wanted to meet with

00:08:37.933 --> 00:08:42.731 align:middle line:84%
or did meet with American
President Dwight Eisenhower

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:46.401 align:middle line:84%
to perhaps discuss
atomic bomb tests.

00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:49.529 align:middle line:84%
The EMERTHER warned
humans that atomic bombs

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:52.699 align:middle line:84%
must be stopped, because
the nuclear blasts were

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:55.452 align:middle line:90%
tearing into other dimensions.

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:59.706 align:middle line:84%
The website states, without
giving sources, quote, "very

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:03.042 align:middle line:84%
little is known about
the five alien races that

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:05.170 align:middle line:90%
make up the Council of Five.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.548 align:middle line:84%
These five races have been
protecting Earth and humans

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:12.302 align:middle line:84%
for a long time, and
they last met together

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:15.972 align:middle line:90%
on this planet in 1944."

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:18.558 align:middle line:90%
Close quote.

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:21.436 align:middle line:84%
I asked Sergeant
CJ why he thought

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:24.564 align:middle line:84%
advanced intelligences would
be communicating with Earth

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:27.150 align:middle line:90%
humans in binary code.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.612 align:middle line:84%
And he replied, quote,
"well, maybe it's

00:09:30.612 --> 00:09:33.782 align:middle line:84%
like the yin and yang
symbol of black and white.

00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:36.993 align:middle line:84%
So 0's and 1's can be
used all over the universe

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:37.869 align:middle line:90%
to communicate."

00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:39.621 align:middle line:90%
Close quote.

00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:43.792 align:middle line:84%
On Earth, this is what standard
ASCII 8-bit binary code

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:44.918 align:middle line:90%
looks like.

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:46.920 align:middle line:84%
It starts with the
number 0, which

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.924 align:middle line:84%
is equivalent to the 8
characters, 0, 0, 1, 1,

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:53.843 align:middle line:90%
space 0, 0, 0, 0.

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:57.806 align:middle line:84%
Capital letters are different
from lower case letters.

00:09:57.806 --> 00:10:00.350 align:middle line:84%
Punctuation, such as
periods and commas,

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:05.104 align:middle line:84%
each have their own
8-bit code designators.

00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:08.691 align:middle line:84%
I had Sergeant CJ's squares
and ones translated.

00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:11.945 align:middle line:84%
Here is the first page
showing how letters and words

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:15.240 align:middle line:90%
emerge in ASCII binary code.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:20.912 align:middle line:84%
Continuous protection
of humanity.

00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:31.172 align:middle line:84%
49 degrees, 27 minutes north,
11 degrees, 5 minutes east.

00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:36.177 align:middle line:90%
Expose hidden knowledge to ALL.

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:39.889 align:middle line:90%
"ALL" all caps.

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:45.895 align:middle line:84%
Citizens advancement imperative
for planetary survival.

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:58.741 align:middle line:84%
Beware of Orion 1350.3 5 and
Z Reticuli 39.1 question mark.

00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:01.661 align:middle line:84%
The question mark is
from the translator.

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:07.667 align:middle line:84%
Then the number 70, avoid,
and the bracket signal

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:10.837 align:middle line:84%
was an interpretation
by the translator.

00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:15.133 align:middle line:90%
It said, avoid messages sent.

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:17.176 align:middle line:84%
Now, here is the
whole translation

00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:19.846 align:middle line:84%
for all of the
squares and lines.

00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:23.308 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant CJ rode on the
back of that Motel 6

00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:26.603 align:middle line:84%
letter-size receipt
in Paducah, Kentucky.

00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Continuous protection
of humanity,

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:35.403 align:middle line:84%
49 degrees, 27 minutes north,
11 degrees, five minutes east.

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:39.157 align:middle line:84%
Expose hidden knowledge
to all citizens.

00:11:39.157 --> 00:11:43.328 align:middle line:84%
Advancement imperative
for planetary survival.

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:53.588 align:middle line:84%
Beware of Orion 1350.3 and Z
Reticuli 39.1 question mark 70.

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:56.591 align:middle line:90%
Avoid messages sent.

00:11:56.591 --> 00:12:04.557 align:middle line:84%
And now we know the
numbers 1350.3 and 39.1

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:08.394 align:middle line:84%
question mark 70
do have a match.

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:12.815 align:middle line:84%
In the distance from the
Earth to the Orion nebula,

00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:18.279 align:middle line:84%
which is 1,350 light
years from Earth.

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And to the binary star
system of Zeta Reticuli,

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:27.830 align:middle line:84%
that is 39.17 light
years from Earth.

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.416 align:middle line:84%
Earlier references
to Zeta Reticuli 1

00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:33.419 align:middle line:84%
first turned up in the
1961 Betty and Barney Hill

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:36.214 align:middle line:84%
abduction in the White
Mountains of New Hampshire.

00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:39.717 align:middle line:84%
That was the first worldwide
reported human abduction

00:12:39.717 --> 00:12:42.095 align:middle line:90%
by gray alien beings.

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:44.180 align:middle line:84%
Betty Hill said one
of the gray entities

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:47.976 align:middle line:84%
showed her a three-dimensional
hologram of stars

00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:52.981 align:middle line:84%
that had connecting lines
that the gray telepathically

00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:57.777 align:middle line:84%
downloaded into Betty's mind
were trade routes connecting

00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:02.782 align:middle line:84%
some star systems in our
arm of the Milky Way galaxy.

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:05.118 align:middle line:84%
Instead of solid
lines, some stars

00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:07.537 align:middle line:90%
were connected by dashed lines.

00:13:07.537 --> 00:13:09.998 align:middle line:84%
The gray being
telepathed to Betty

00:13:09.998 --> 00:13:12.750 align:middle line:84%
that those were
exploration routes,

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:18.423 align:middle line:84%
and that our sun and solar
system were being explored.

00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:21.551 align:middle line:84%
The last line,
avoid messages sent,

00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:25.722 align:middle line:84%
seems to relate to Sergeant
CJ's dream information

00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:27.932 align:middle line:84%
about the danger of
Earth sending out

00:13:27.932 --> 00:13:31.894 align:middle line:84%
SETI signals without knowing
who is on the other end.

00:13:31.894 --> 00:13:37.066 align:middle line:84%
That same warning came in 2015
from Elon Musk, Bill Gates,

00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:40.278 align:middle line:84%
and physicist Stephen
Hawking, about both SETI

00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:44.949 align:middle line:84%
and relying too much on
artificial intelligence.

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to the
first line that says,

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.580 align:middle line:84%
continuous protection
of humanity,

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:55.043 align:middle line:84%
49 degrees, 27 minutes
north, and 11 degrees,

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:56.794 align:middle line:90%
five minutes east.

00:13:56.794 --> 00:13:58.755 align:middle line:84%
If that latitude
and longitude are

00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:01.049 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be a
location on Earth

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:04.177 align:middle line:84%
where ETs from the
Council of Five

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:08.056 align:middle line:84%
are supposed to be
protecting humans, how odd

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:13.770 align:middle line:84%
that it turns out to be town
center of Nuremberg, Germany.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:17.982 align:middle line:84%
Nuremberg was a significant city
for the Nazis in World War II,

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:20.443 align:middle line:84%
and the location of the
International War crime

00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:23.446 align:middle line:90%
trials after the war ended.

00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:26.783 align:middle line:84%
But Nuremberg was also famous
more than 400 years ago

00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:31.120 align:middle line:84%
in 1561, when immense
black cylinders appeared

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.040 align:middle line:84%
in an early dawn sky and
released many strange smaller

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:40.254 align:middle line:84%
blue, black, red, and orange
spheres, rods, and crosses.

00:14:40.254 --> 00:14:43.966 align:middle line:84%
Many people watched the aerial
machines clash and battle

00:14:43.966 --> 00:14:47.136 align:middle line:84%
above a great black
spear that remains

00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:51.474 align:middle line:84%
stationary for the entire
hour-long conflict.

00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:54.143 align:middle line:90%
Some UFOs crashed and burned.

00:14:54.143 --> 00:14:56.896 align:middle line:84%
You can see it in the lower
right of this famous woodcut

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:59.607 align:middle line:90%
by German artist, Hans Glaser.

00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:02.610 align:middle line:84%
So who, in that
aerial UFO battle,

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.029 align:middle line:84%
might have been
protecting humanity?

00:15:05.029 --> 00:15:08.533 align:middle line:84%
As stated in the
Sergeant CJ binary code,

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:13.287 align:middle line:84%
quote, "continuous protection
of humanity" close quote.

00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:15.873 align:middle line:90%
What could the battle be about?

00:15:15.873 --> 00:15:18.835 align:middle line:84%
Now let's go deeper into
binary code messages

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:21.796 align:middle line:84%
by comparing
Sergeant CJ's string

00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:25.758 align:middle line:84%
of 0's and 1's to Sergeant
Jim Penniston's back

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:28.928 align:middle line:90%
on December 26, 1980.

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:31.722 align:middle line:84%
That was the night that Sergeant
Penniston, with Airman First

00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:35.226 align:middle line:84%
class John Burroughs
and Airman Ed Cabansag,

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:37.436 align:middle line:84%
were ordered into
Rendlesham Forest, England,

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:40.648 align:middle line:84%
to investigate strange
colored lights moving around

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:43.442 align:middle line:84%
in the tall forest
on civilian land

00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:46.320 align:middle line:84%
that ran along RAF
Bentwaters Woodbridge.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:50.449 align:middle line:84%
That was then NATO's
largest airbase.

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:54.412 align:middle line:84%
This is a page one of the
binary code written down

00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:57.456 align:middle line:84%
by Sergeant Penniston
after he touched the raised

00:15:57.456 --> 00:16:01.460 align:middle line:84%
symbols on the surface of
a mysterious, black, glassy

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:05.006 align:middle line:84%
triangular craft on
the forest ground.

00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:08.843 align:middle line:84%
The red vertical lines
mark off the groups

00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:13.431 align:middle line:84%
of eight 0's and 1's to
match against the ASCII code

00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:16.142 align:middle line:84%
translation for
letters and numbers.

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:19.520 align:middle line:84%
At the right is the
summary translation.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:24.609 align:middle line:84%
And this is now Sergeant
Penniston in 1980.

00:16:24.609 --> 00:16:29.947 align:middle line:90%
Exploration of humanity unclear.

00:16:29.947 --> 00:16:35.328 align:middle line:84%
Then numbers, and
then the number 8100.

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:38.206 align:middle line:84%
This is page two of
Penniston's binary code

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:41.876 align:middle line:84%
that translates to a
latitude and longitude.

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:47.673 align:middle line:84%
And in all caps, the
word "CONTINUOUS."

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:53.679 align:middle line:84%
Page three translates in all
caps, FOR PLANETARY ADVANCE.

00:16:57.183 --> 00:17:02.897 align:middle line:84%
Fourth coordinate continuous
CEPR question mark.

00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:05.358 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what that is.

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:06.358 align:middle line:90%
The word "before."

00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:12.823 align:middle line:84%
And then page five,
Penniston binary code,

00:17:12.823 --> 00:17:18.496 align:middle line:84%
after the word before,
Penniston's writing stops.

00:17:18.496 --> 00:17:21.499 align:middle line:90%
End of transmission.

00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:25.169 align:middle line:84%
After those first five pages
of code were translated,

00:17:25.169 --> 00:17:29.465 align:middle line:84%
Penniston then released one
more batch of 0's and 1's.

00:17:29.465 --> 00:17:33.803 align:middle line:84%
This is Penniston's personally
approved and official release

00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:36.138 align:middle line:84%
of his binary code
translation that

00:17:36.138 --> 00:17:39.350 align:middle line:84%
adds six latitude and
longitude coordinates

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:45.523 align:middle line:84%
for Caracol, Belize, Sedona,
Arizona, the great pyramid

00:17:45.523 --> 00:17:49.277 align:middle line:84%
of Giza, Egypt, the
Nazca Lines of Peru,

00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:53.614 align:middle line:84%
Tai Shan Qu, China, where the
green symbols were on that

00:17:53.614 --> 00:17:59.120 align:middle line:84%
UFO, the temple of
Apollo in Naxos, Greece.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.497 align:middle line:90%
And then came these words.

00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:04.041 align:middle line:90%
Eyes of your eyes--

00:18:04.041 --> 00:18:05.710 align:middle line:90%
in all caps.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.838 align:middle line:84%
And then a repeat of the
controversial latitude

00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:12.550 align:middle line:84%
longitude that some
interpret as being

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:17.638 align:middle line:84%
Hy-Brasil, Mythical off the
Western coast of Ireland,

00:18:17.638 --> 00:18:20.725 align:middle line:90%
or Woodbridge, England.

00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:24.437 align:middle line:84%
And in the last
line, the number 8100

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:31.652 align:middle line:84%
is repeated as all
caps, ORIGIN YEAR 8100.

00:18:31.652 --> 00:18:37.491 align:middle line:84%
If you subtract Earth
year 1980 from 8100,

00:18:37.491 --> 00:18:42.663 align:middle line:84%
you get 6,120 years,
perhaps in the future,

00:18:42.663 --> 00:18:44.999 align:middle line:90%
for the time travelers.

00:18:44.999 --> 00:18:48.836 align:middle line:84%
But Penniston, in
hypnosis, said,

00:18:48.836 --> 00:18:52.214 align:middle line:84%
that he was telepathed
that they were from 40,000

00:18:52.214 --> 00:18:55.634 align:middle line:90%
years in our future.

00:18:55.634 --> 00:18:58.846 align:middle line:84%
But it can also be argued
that the time travelers

00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:03.059 align:middle line:84%
from a distant future were not
referring to Earth-based 365

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:05.519 align:middle line:90%
day year cycles of time.

00:19:05.519 --> 00:19:07.772 align:middle line:84%
It is also important
to understand

00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:10.149 align:middle line:84%
that Sergeant
Penniston did not have

00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:13.736 align:middle line:84%
any decimal placements in
his string of 0's and 1's

00:19:13.736 --> 00:19:15.112 align:middle line:90%
in his notebook.

00:19:15.112 --> 00:19:17.782 align:middle line:84%
So each latitude
and longitude could

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:22.745 align:middle line:84%
be any one of 24
possibilities, according

00:19:22.745 --> 00:19:26.749 align:middle line:84%
to an astronomer, Mike Reed,
who did the original binary

00:19:26.749 --> 00:19:27.917 align:middle line:90%
translations.

00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:32.213 align:middle line:84%
For example, in the second
line latitude and longitude,

00:19:32.213 --> 00:19:35.466 align:middle line:84%
when a decimal was tried
in a different position

00:19:35.466 --> 00:19:38.844 align:middle line:84%
than the Hy-Brasil
option, it precisely

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:41.222 align:middle line:84%
matched the town
center of Woodbridge,

00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:44.975 align:middle line:84%
not far from the airbase
and Rendlesham Forest.

00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:48.354 align:middle line:84%
The scientists felt strongly
the Woodbridge option made

00:19:48.354 --> 00:19:52.733 align:middle line:84%
more sense because the
black triangle craft,

00:19:52.733 --> 00:19:55.736 align:middle line:84%
if it's a time travel
device, it would likely

00:19:55.736 --> 00:20:00.074 align:middle line:84%
be emitting a continuous
stream of location information

00:20:00.074 --> 00:20:04.703 align:middle line:84%
to whoever sent the black
triangle to Rendlesham Forest.

00:20:04.703 --> 00:20:08.916 align:middle line:84%
Astronomer Reed thought that
land options were more logical

00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:10.584 align:middle line:90%
than oceans.

00:20:10.584 --> 00:20:12.586 align:middle line:84%
But the "Ancient
Aliens" producers

00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:15.714 align:middle line:84%
preferred the mythical
ocean idea of Hy-Brasil,

00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:18.759 align:middle line:84%
since it fit with their
ancient aliens theme.

00:20:18.759 --> 00:20:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Hy-Brasil was supposed
to be an ancient island

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:26.058 align:middle line:84%
west of Ireland that only
appeared once every seven

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:27.184 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:20:27.184 --> 00:20:29.186 align:middle line:84%
Adding to its mystery
were the tales

00:20:29.186 --> 00:20:32.606 align:middle line:84%
of people in boats who
tried to reach the island,

00:20:32.606 --> 00:20:34.150 align:middle line:90%
but they never could.

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:38.237 align:middle line:84%
However, astronomer Mike Reed
argued that the Woodbridge town

00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:41.323 align:middle line:84%
center was so close to where
the black, glassy triangular

00:20:41.323 --> 00:20:44.118 align:middle line:84%
craft, and its symbols
were telepathically

00:20:44.118 --> 00:20:48.497 align:middle line:84%
sending the binary code into
Sergeant Penniston's mind,

00:20:48.497 --> 00:20:53.127 align:middle line:84%
the town center Woodbridge
made sense to him.

00:20:53.127 --> 00:20:58.507 align:middle line:84%
Let's now compare CJ's
first June 30, 2016

00:20:58.507 --> 00:21:05.014 align:middle line:84%
binary translation on the
top with Sergeant Penniston's

00:21:05.014 --> 00:21:11.353 align:middle line:84%
first binary release from his
December 26, 1980 encounter.

00:21:11.353 --> 00:21:17.359 align:middle line:84%
The words that stand out
as similar are continuous,

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:22.281 align:middle line:84%
humanity, advance
planetary survival.

00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:24.825 align:middle line:84%
Another warning about
planetary survival

00:21:24.825 --> 00:21:28.496 align:middle line:84%
came in this binary code
discovered in a wheat field

00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:30.915 align:middle line:84%
next to Crabwood Copse
in the village of Pitt,

00:21:30.915 --> 00:21:36.587 align:middle line:84%
near Winchester Hampshire,
England, on August 15, 2002.

00:21:36.587 --> 00:21:39.882 align:middle line:84%
The gray alien head
and binary code disk

00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:44.845 align:middle line:84%
is in front of BBC Winchester's
tall broadcast antenna.

00:21:44.845 --> 00:21:47.348 align:middle line:84%
And those 60 thin
horizontal lines

00:21:47.348 --> 00:21:52.811 align:middle line:84%
are thought to simulate an
early 20th century TV broadcast.

00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:56.273 align:middle line:84%
The implication seemed to be
that the crop formation was

00:21:56.273 --> 00:22:00.027 align:middle line:90%
a reply to Earth TV signals.

00:22:00.027 --> 00:22:02.530 align:middle line:84%
The start of the
Crabwood August 15,

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:11.330 align:middle line:84%
2002 binary spiral of
code begins 0100 0010;

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:14.917 align:middle line:84%
which equals the
capital letter B.

00:22:14.917 --> 00:22:18.420 align:middle line:84%
The entire ASCII 8-bit
translation of the Crabwood

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:23.551 align:middle line:84%
spiral binary code is "beware
the bearers of false gifts

00:22:23.551 --> 00:22:25.844 align:middle line:90%
and their broken promises.

00:22:25.844 --> 00:22:28.722 align:middle line:90%
Much pain, but still time.

00:22:28.722 --> 00:22:32.977 align:middle line:84%
Believe--" misspelled--
"there is good out there.

00:22:32.977 --> 00:22:35.521 align:middle line:90%
We oppose DECEPTION.

00:22:35.521 --> 00:22:36.814 align:middle line:90%
All caps.

00:22:36.814 --> 00:22:41.068 align:middle line:90%
Conduit closing," close quote.

00:22:41.068 --> 00:22:43.529 align:middle line:84%
But was the warning
from the alien

00:22:43.529 --> 00:22:46.991 align:middle line:84%
depicted in the wheat
holding the binary disk?

00:22:46.991 --> 00:22:51.453 align:middle line:84%
Or was the warning about the
alien in the wheat pattern?

00:22:51.453 --> 00:22:54.707 align:middle line:84%
The three star-like objects
on the alien's shoulder

00:22:54.707 --> 00:22:57.626 align:middle line:84%
resemble the famous
Orion Belt stars.

00:22:57.626 --> 00:23:00.462 align:middle line:84%
So many people think there
is a threat from something

00:23:00.462 --> 00:23:04.008 align:middle line:84%
associated with the
Orion constellation.

00:23:04.008 --> 00:23:08.470 align:middle line:84%
Then in early 2016 came a
retired Navy whistleblower,

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.681 align:middle line:84%
William Mills
Tompkins, who said that

00:23:10.681 --> 00:23:13.809 align:middle line:84%
from World War II on,
for several years,

00:23:13.809 --> 00:23:16.979 align:middle line:84%
he worked building
scale models of UFOs

00:23:16.979 --> 00:23:20.858 align:middle line:84%
and learned that the United
States government had

00:23:20.858 --> 00:23:25.195 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial allies
that protected humanity

00:23:25.195 --> 00:23:27.698 align:middle line:84%
and Earth from
marauding, bullying,

00:23:27.698 --> 00:23:30.701 align:middle line:84%
humanoid reptilians
that originated

00:23:30.701 --> 00:23:34.496 align:middle line:84%
in the constellations
Orion and Draco.

00:23:34.496 --> 00:23:39.001 align:middle line:84%
A similar message was repeated
13 years later on June 23,

00:23:39.001 --> 00:23:46.008 align:middle line:84%
2015, near the airport of Turin,
Italy, also known as Turin.

00:23:46.008 --> 00:23:49.261 align:middle line:84%
This city is where Jesus
Christ's alleged burial

00:23:49.261 --> 00:23:51.263 align:middle line:90%
shroud is kept.

00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:55.643 align:middle line:84%
Geneticist Horace Drew,
PhD, from Sydney, Australia

00:23:55.643 --> 00:23:57.853 align:middle line:84%
tackled these very
difficult rings

00:23:57.853 --> 00:24:03.734 align:middle line:84%
of binary code that included 128
small circles in straight lines

00:24:03.734 --> 00:24:08.405 align:middle line:84%
between 16 triangular rays
of the outermost ring.

00:24:08.405 --> 00:24:11.116 align:middle line:84%
His binary translation
of that outer ring

00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:17.039 align:middle line:90%
is "beware ET bearing gifts."

00:24:17.039 --> 00:24:22.586 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Drew said the Turin, Italy,
June 23, 2015 summer solstice

00:24:22.586 --> 00:24:26.590 align:middle line:84%
sweep pattern, quote, "it
looks like a clock, where

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:29.343 align:middle line:84%
we have to rotate the
inner wheel to match

00:24:29.343 --> 00:24:30.177 align:middle line:90%
the outer wheel."

00:24:30.177 --> 00:24:31.387 align:middle line:90%
Close quote.

00:24:31.387 --> 00:24:34.848 align:middle line:84%
Even though the inner ring
binary code is not clear,

00:24:34.848 --> 00:24:39.269 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Drew thinks some of it
warns about a Trojan horse

00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:41.355 align:middle line:90%
event coming to Earth.

00:24:41.355 --> 00:24:45.192 align:middle line:84%
He wonders if the Trojan
horse is an invasion attack

00:24:45.192 --> 00:24:49.238 align:middle line:84%
by non-humans from
Orion and Zeta Reticuli,

00:24:49.238 --> 00:24:55.119 align:middle line:84%
warned about also in Sergeant
CJ's binary code of June 30,

00:24:55.119 --> 00:24:56.787 align:middle line:90%
2015.

00:24:56.787 --> 00:25:04.294 align:middle line:84%
And that was only seven days
after the Turin, Italy warning.

00:25:04.294 --> 00:25:07.631 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant CJ Did receive
more telepathic downloads

00:25:07.631 --> 00:25:09.591 align:middle line:90%
coming into his head at night.

00:25:09.591 --> 00:25:13.554 align:middle line:84%
He said the squares and lines
came faster than before,

00:25:13.554 --> 00:25:16.306 align:middle line:84%
so it was hard for him
to write it all down.

00:25:16.306 --> 00:25:19.893 align:middle line:84%
He also could see that some
of the squares were darkened,

00:25:19.893 --> 00:25:23.147 align:middle line:84%
and he managed to get some of
the new communication written

00:25:23.147 --> 00:25:28.402 align:middle line:84%
down along with his comments
about what was happening.

00:25:28.402 --> 00:25:33.031 align:middle line:84%
From October 27 to the
first week of January, 2016.

00:25:33.031 --> 00:25:36.493 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant CJ was waking
up a lot, yelling.

00:25:36.493 --> 00:25:38.203 align:middle line:84%
I talked with his
wife, and she said

00:25:38.203 --> 00:25:40.622 align:middle line:84%
he would wake her
up talking loudly

00:25:40.622 --> 00:25:44.001 align:middle line:84%
and was often saying
a string of numbers.

00:25:44.001 --> 00:25:47.629 align:middle line:84%
She told me near tears
how much it scared her,

00:25:47.629 --> 00:25:49.965 align:middle line:90%
and she wanted it to stop.

00:25:49.965 --> 00:25:53.093 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant CJ said he was
trying to concentrate

00:25:53.093 --> 00:25:55.429 align:middle line:84%
on the dark shadings
in the squares

00:25:55.429 --> 00:26:00.225 align:middle line:84%
that he hadn't been able to copy
before because the images moved

00:26:00.225 --> 00:26:04.605 align:middle line:84%
too fast in his mind's
eye, moving right to left.

00:26:04.605 --> 00:26:07.900 align:middle line:84%
But finally, he thought that
he was getting some of it

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.152 align:middle line:90%
in these new pages.

00:26:10.152 --> 00:26:12.488 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Drew researched
binary codes,

00:26:12.488 --> 00:26:16.074 align:middle line:84%
and he found this one at
thinkersmith.org that uses

00:26:16.074 --> 00:26:20.579 align:middle line:84%
squares that are either clear
or blackened to represent

00:26:20.579 --> 00:26:23.123 align:middle line:90%
1's and 0's.

00:26:23.123 --> 00:26:27.669 align:middle line:84%
Horace Drew applied it to
Sergeant CJ's new pages.

00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:32.341 align:middle line:84%
On the far left of this graphic,
Dr. Drew's binary translations

00:26:32.341 --> 00:26:34.218 align:middle line:84%
are in red letters
going vertically

00:26:34.218 --> 00:26:38.555 align:middle line:84%
down the page, next to
matching binary code spelling

00:26:38.555 --> 00:26:41.225 align:middle line:90%
the first word, imminent.

00:26:43.977 --> 00:26:47.523 align:middle line:84%
"Imminent threat soon
upon Earth's leaders

00:26:47.523 --> 00:26:49.525 align:middle line:90%
and civilizations.

00:26:49.525 --> 00:26:54.488 align:middle line:84%
Expose and disband hidden
knowledge to all citizens.

00:26:54.488 --> 00:26:59.493 align:middle line:84%
Employ safe and controlled
joint study to all minds.

00:26:59.493 --> 00:27:03.539 align:middle line:84%
Progression imperative
for combined survival.

00:27:03.539 --> 00:27:07.709 align:middle line:84%
Embrace this--" and
there was a space--

00:27:07.709 --> 00:27:09.545 align:middle line:90%
"vessel threat."

00:27:09.545 --> 00:27:14.633 align:middle line:84%
And then the number 000,
and then the word journey,

00:27:14.633 --> 00:27:19.221 align:middle line:84%
followed by brackets around
a 12, followed by ly,

00:27:19.221 --> 00:27:25.686 align:middle line:84%
which on Earth, ly is used by
astronomers to mean light year.

00:27:25.686 --> 00:27:27.813 align:middle line:90%
12 light years.

00:27:27.813 --> 00:27:29.523 align:middle line:90%
And then Ikes.

00:27:29.523 --> 00:27:31.859 align:middle line:90%
Is that President Eisenhower?

00:27:31.859 --> 00:27:39.741 align:middle line:84%
Ikes embedded citizens
are ready ais close.

00:27:39.741 --> 00:27:44.955 align:middle line:84%
The word evolve,
followed by six ones.

00:27:44.955 --> 00:27:50.460 align:middle line:84%
We don't understand it, but
that's the literal ASCII code.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:55.799 align:middle line:84%
Then, royal EMERTHER,
EMERTHER all caps.

00:27:55.799 --> 00:27:59.344 align:middle line:84%
Warning, expose foreign
technology to all.

00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:04.349 align:middle line:84%
Evolutionary advancement
needed to prevent takeover.

00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:09.980 align:middle line:84%
Bracket, the number 3,
and a single quote mark.

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:13.942 align:middle line:84%
In the last paragraph
is that all caps word,

00:28:13.942 --> 00:28:17.321 align:middle line:84%
EMERTHER, that on
the web is associated

00:28:17.321 --> 00:28:20.908 align:middle line:90%
with an alien Council of Five.

00:28:20.908 --> 00:28:24.995 align:middle line:84%
Then, on February
18, 2016, Sergeant CJ

00:28:24.995 --> 00:28:29.999 align:middle line:84%
found that he had added five
new lines of squares and lines

00:28:29.999 --> 00:28:32.419 align:middle line:90%
without darkening any of them.

00:28:32.419 --> 00:28:36.214 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant CJ e-mailed
me, quote, "it was fast,

00:28:36.214 --> 00:28:39.009 align:middle line:84%
and I was unsure if I
drew them down correctly.

00:28:39.009 --> 00:28:42.179 align:middle line:84%
It felt like it was not
meant for me to write them,

00:28:42.179 --> 00:28:46.183 align:middle line:84%
and I felt weird about it like
it was not clear enough for me.

00:28:46.183 --> 00:28:47.976 align:middle line:84%
I just did the
best I could, and I

00:28:47.976 --> 00:28:51.813 align:middle line:84%
figured it was probably
all messed up or wrong.

00:28:51.813 --> 00:28:54.858 align:middle line:84%
They are the only ones I
have had since I sent you

00:28:54.858 --> 00:28:57.069 align:middle line:90%
photos of my notebook.

00:28:57.069 --> 00:28:59.279 align:middle line:84%
I could not darken
the boxes and lines

00:28:59.279 --> 00:29:01.365 align:middle line:84%
because they were
moving too fast,

00:29:01.365 --> 00:29:04.076 align:middle line:84%
and I was having a hard
time concentrating.

00:29:04.076 --> 00:29:06.370 align:middle line:84%
There was much more
to it, but I could not

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:07.871 align:middle line:90%
keep up concentrating."

00:29:07.871 --> 00:29:09.539 align:middle line:90%
Close quote.

00:29:09.539 --> 00:29:13.043 align:middle line:84%
I sent them to Dr.
Drew, and what he sent

00:29:13.043 --> 00:29:15.837 align:middle line:90%
back was a surprise.

00:29:15.837 --> 00:29:20.050 align:middle line:84%
There were five clumps of
letters and five unknown words.

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:24.721 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Drew did know that the last
two letters, ki, originally

00:29:24.721 --> 00:29:27.683 align:middle line:90%
meant Earth in ancient Sumerian.

00:29:27.683 --> 00:29:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And the letters and
the words are nabu,

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:35.023 align:middle line:84%
rakbu, capital H
laraak, sanu, ki.

00:29:35.023 --> 00:29:39.987 align:middle line:84%
I sent the five words to
Professor Joshua Jeffers, PhD,

00:29:39.987 --> 00:29:42.781 align:middle line:84%
research specialist,
royal inscriptions

00:29:42.781 --> 00:29:46.076 align:middle line:84%
of the Neo-Assyrian period
project at the University

00:29:46.076 --> 00:29:50.414 align:middle line:84%
of Pennsylvania in the Museum
of Archeology and Anthropology

00:29:50.414 --> 00:29:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Babylonian section,
Philadelphia.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:57.838 align:middle line:84%
Here is his march
24, 2016 reply.

00:29:57.838 --> 00:30:00.257 align:middle line:84%
The first two words
and the fourth word

00:30:00.257 --> 00:30:03.301 align:middle line:84%
look to be Akkadian
and not Sumerian.

00:30:03.301 --> 00:30:07.431 align:middle line:84%
The first could be the god
Nabu, but without the cuneiform,

00:30:07.431 --> 00:30:12.602 align:middle line:84%
it is difficult to say, since
there is no divine classifier,

00:30:12.602 --> 00:30:16.565 align:middle line:84%
as it's known,
before the word Nabu.

00:30:16.565 --> 00:30:19.776 align:middle line:90%
Well, what is Nabu?

00:30:19.776 --> 00:30:24.656 align:middle line:84%
Nabu was one of the three most
important gods in Sumeria.

00:30:24.656 --> 00:30:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Nabu was the keeper
of the Tablets

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:30.328 align:middle line:84%
of Destiny, that
recorded humanity's fate.

00:30:30.328 --> 00:30:32.372 align:middle line:84%
He was son of
Marduk and grandson

00:30:32.372 --> 00:30:35.792 align:middle line:90%
of Enki-Ea of the Annunaki.

00:30:35.792 --> 00:30:40.297 align:middle line:84%
Nabu's grandfather, Ea, is
the creator and protector

00:30:40.297 --> 00:30:45.385 align:middle line:84%
of humanity because Ea
created humans out of clay

00:30:45.385 --> 00:30:49.264 align:middle line:84%
to be worker slaves for
the Mesopotamian gods.

00:30:49.264 --> 00:30:53.101 align:middle line:84%
But the supreme god, Enlil,
was irritated by the noise

00:30:53.101 --> 00:30:57.147 align:middle line:84%
the humans made, apparently
because we aren't telepathic,

00:30:57.147 --> 00:30:59.483 align:middle line:90%
and we have to talk out loud.

00:30:59.483 --> 00:31:03.820 align:middle line:84%
So Enlil wanted to destroy
Ea's human slave creation

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.989 align:middle line:90%
with a devastating flood.

00:31:05.989 --> 00:31:09.117 align:middle line:84%
But Ea realized
what Enlil was up to

00:31:09.117 --> 00:31:11.369 align:middle line:84%
and got a friend
to build an arc so

00:31:11.369 --> 00:31:17.375 align:middle line:84%
that humanity could escape god
Enlil's act of annihilation.

00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:21.379 align:middle line:84%
Professor Jeffers continues,
quote, "the second word,

00:31:21.379 --> 00:31:25.509 align:middle line:84%
"rakbu," would be the noun,
"rider," from the verb

00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:30.388 align:middle line:84%
rakabu, to ride, frequently
meant upon a horse or chariot.

00:31:30.388 --> 00:31:32.766 align:middle line:84%
The middle third
word could possibly

00:31:32.766 --> 00:31:35.435 align:middle line:84%
be the word for
the city of Larsa

00:31:35.435 --> 00:31:40.273 align:middle line:84%
in Southern Mesopotamia,
today, modern Iraq, written out

00:31:40.273 --> 00:31:41.817 align:middle line:90%
phonetically.

00:31:41.817 --> 00:31:45.987 align:middle line:84%
It should be larak,
without a doubled A,

00:31:45.987 --> 00:31:50.992 align:middle line:84%
but the H is nonsensical
for Sumerian and Akkadian

00:31:50.992 --> 00:31:52.661 align:middle line:90%
and is puzzling.

00:31:52.661 --> 00:31:55.038 align:middle line:84%
The fourth word,
"sanu," could be

00:31:55.038 --> 00:31:59.209 align:middle line:84%
an infinitive of the
verb "to do again,

00:31:59.209 --> 00:32:03.588 align:middle line:84%
or a second time," or even
"to be different and strange."

00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:08.301 align:middle line:84%
And the fifth word, ki,
by itself can be Sumerian,

00:32:08.301 --> 00:32:11.263 align:middle line:84%
and would mean
"earth" or "land."

00:32:11.263 --> 00:32:14.474 align:middle line:84%
Close quote from the
professor at the University

00:32:14.474 --> 00:32:16.518 align:middle line:90%
of Pennsylvania.

00:32:16.518 --> 00:32:20.188 align:middle line:84%
The precise meaning of the
five Mesopotamian words

00:32:20.188 --> 00:32:21.815 align:middle line:90%
remain unclear.

00:32:21.815 --> 00:32:24.151 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant CJ is
waiting to see if he

00:32:24.151 --> 00:32:26.570 align:middle line:84%
has any more telepathic
downloads that

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:33.326 align:middle line:84%
might explain more about these
Sumerian and Akkadian words.

00:32:33.326 --> 00:32:36.329 align:middle line:84%
But here is one more
look at everything

00:32:36.329 --> 00:32:40.292 align:middle line:84%
translated from binary
transmissions to Sergeant CJ

00:32:40.292 --> 00:32:41.084 align:middle line:90%
so far.

00:32:46.173 --> 00:32:51.052 align:middle line:84%
Some whistleblowers say that
advanced ET technology includes

00:32:51.052 --> 00:32:53.680 align:middle line:84%
control and
manipulation of gravity,

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:58.226 align:middle line:84%
camouflaging matter with
invisibility, 3-D holograms,

00:32:58.226 --> 00:33:01.188 align:middle line:84%
and the ability to
fold space and time

00:33:01.188 --> 00:33:05.650 align:middle line:84%
in point-to-point transportation
around the cosmos.

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:09.863 align:middle line:84%
What happened in Rendlesham
Forest on December 26, 1980

00:33:09.863 --> 00:33:13.033 align:middle line:84%
was apparently of great
interest to America's Defense

00:33:13.033 --> 00:33:15.285 align:middle line:90%
Intelligence Agency.

00:33:15.285 --> 00:33:17.746 align:middle line:84%
The DIA had remote
viewers working

00:33:17.746 --> 00:33:21.458 align:middle line:84%
at Fort Meade, Maryland, next
door to the National Security

00:33:21.458 --> 00:33:25.253 align:middle line:90%
Agency, in 1986.

00:33:25.253 --> 00:33:29.507 align:middle line:84%
There, remote viewer Lyn
Buchanan worked in a DIA unit

00:33:29.507 --> 00:33:32.510 align:middle line:90%
called DTS.

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:36.514 align:middle line:84%
Their goal was to research how
accurately psychic abilities

00:33:36.514 --> 00:33:40.352 align:middle line:84%
could be used in their spy
program, called Stargate.

00:33:40.352 --> 00:33:46.149 align:middle line:84%
On July 14, 1986, one of Lyn's
assigned practice targets

00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:48.777 align:middle line:84%
was the Rendlesham
Forest Incident.

00:33:48.777 --> 00:33:52.155 align:middle line:84%
But only his monitor knew the
target that was on a three

00:33:52.155 --> 00:33:56.368 align:middle line:84%
by five card in a file
drawer in another room.

00:33:56.368 --> 00:33:59.496 align:middle line:84%
Further, Lyn knew nothing
about the military mystery

00:33:59.496 --> 00:34:03.250 align:middle line:84%
that had occurred six
years before on December 26

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:06.044 align:middle line:90%
to 28, 1980.

00:34:06.044 --> 00:34:09.880 align:middle line:84%
But what Lyn did see
in remote viewing

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:13.885 align:middle line:84%
seems to link to the repeating
theme in the binary code

00:34:13.885 --> 00:34:17.764 align:middle line:84%
messages about
planetary survival.

00:34:17.764 --> 00:34:21.141 align:middle line:84%
But is the threat
only to humans,

00:34:21.141 --> 00:34:24.396 align:middle line:84%
or could it be there is
an existential threat

00:34:24.396 --> 00:34:26.982 align:middle line:84%
to both humans
and ET allies that

00:34:26.982 --> 00:34:31.152 align:middle line:84%
inhabit Earth, what
government insiders have long

00:34:31.152 --> 00:34:35.156 align:middle line:90%
called the Alien Presence.

00:34:35.156 --> 00:34:37.199 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed Lyn
Buchanan recently

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:41.621 align:middle line:84%
about this 2008
CIA-released document.

00:34:41.621 --> 00:34:46.751 align:middle line:84%
It is Lyn's original 1986
Rendlesham Forest controlled

00:34:46.751 --> 00:34:49.087 align:middle line:90%
remote viewing session.

00:34:49.087 --> 00:34:53.257 align:middle line:84%
None of us, including Lyn, knew
that it had been unclassified

00:34:53.257 --> 00:34:57.637 align:middle line:84%
and posted on the
CIA website in 2015

00:34:57.637 --> 00:35:01.308 align:middle line:84%
until John Burroughs, who
had been affected by lights

00:35:01.308 --> 00:35:04.144 align:middle line:84%
at RAF Bentwaters,
was told to go

00:35:04.144 --> 00:35:07.522 align:middle line:90%
to a specific URL on the web.

00:35:07.522 --> 00:35:14.112 align:middle line:84%
It was the CIA website, and
there was the 1986 transcript

00:35:14.112 --> 00:35:18.825 align:middle line:84%
of Lyn Buchanan's remote viewing
session of Rendlesham Forest.

00:35:18.825 --> 00:35:21.453 align:middle line:84%
Why was it put
there, Lyn wondered,

00:35:21.453 --> 00:35:25.498 align:middle line:90%
without anyone even telling him?

00:35:25.498 --> 00:35:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>> As always, I got
encrypted coordinates,

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.254 align:middle line:84%
so I had no idea
I was viewing it.

00:35:31.254 --> 00:35:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And I was viewing one
specific night of that,

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.554 align:middle line:90%
I found out later--

00:35:42.682 --> 00:35:44.267 align:middle line:90%
of the several nights.

00:35:44.267 --> 00:35:47.312 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
only one I had viewed.

00:35:47.312 --> 00:35:52.359 align:middle line:84%
But during that, they had
me describe the craft,

00:35:52.359 --> 00:35:56.071 align:middle line:84%
and then they had me
go inside the craft

00:35:56.071 --> 00:36:00.825 align:middle line:84%
and draw the floor plans,
draw the internal plans,

00:36:00.825 --> 00:36:03.286 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:36:03.286 --> 00:36:08.083 align:middle line:84%
What I got in the beginning was
just a control room, a control

00:36:08.083 --> 00:36:14.381 align:middle line:84%
panel, just like you would
expect for any flight deck.

00:36:14.381 --> 00:36:15.799 align:middle line:90%
The entire thing was empty.

00:36:15.799 --> 00:36:19.177 align:middle line:84%
I went ahead and went
through the rest of the ship.

00:36:19.177 --> 00:36:22.055 align:middle line:90%
But I went into the computer.

00:36:22.055 --> 00:36:24.224 align:middle line:90%
I can read computers.

00:36:24.224 --> 00:36:27.394 align:middle line:84%
And I went into the
computer and found out

00:36:27.394 --> 00:36:29.396 align:middle line:90%
that it was autonomous.

00:36:29.396 --> 00:36:30.980 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't controlled by anybody.

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:32.440 align:middle line:90%
It was autonomous.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:36.694 align:middle line:84%
And it was looking
for something.

00:36:36.694 --> 00:36:38.238 align:middle line:90%
Several things, in fact.

00:36:38.238 --> 00:36:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And when it found it, when
it found one of those things

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:45.495 align:middle line:84%
it was looking for,
programmed to look for.

00:36:45.495 --> 00:36:50.667 align:middle line:84%
It would radio back to
somebody and say, I found it,

00:36:50.667 --> 00:36:55.672 align:middle line:84%
and then later, they would
know exactly where to come.

00:36:55.672 --> 00:37:01.344 align:middle line:90%
From the outside, it was shiny.

00:37:01.344 --> 00:37:04.055 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] Of course.

00:37:04.055 --> 00:37:11.438 align:middle line:84%
It seemed to me on the
outside like it was maybe

00:37:11.438 --> 00:37:15.608 align:middle line:84%
about five or six times
the size of a car.

00:37:15.608 --> 00:37:17.026 align:middle line:90%
Now, when I got on the inside--

00:37:19.779 --> 00:37:22.282 align:middle line:84%
of course, if they were
smaller, it would look--

00:37:22.282 --> 00:37:25.452 align:middle line:84%
I would have shrunk to that,
and it would have-- you know.

00:37:25.452 --> 00:37:28.413 align:middle line:84%
But on the inside,
it looked pretty big.

00:37:28.413 --> 00:37:31.583 align:middle line:84%
There were
compartments and things

00:37:31.583 --> 00:37:34.627 align:middle line:84%
like that and this
control panel,

00:37:34.627 --> 00:37:37.046 align:middle line:90%
which was totally unmanned.

00:37:37.046 --> 00:37:39.757 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the things about
controlled remote viewing

00:37:39.757 --> 00:37:43.761 align:middle line:84%
is that your conscious mind
works best present time.

00:37:43.761 --> 00:37:47.891 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious mind can go
anywhere in time and space.

00:37:47.891 --> 00:37:50.894 align:middle line:84%
And so you give
the command, move

00:37:50.894 --> 00:37:53.563 align:middle line:90%
to that time and that place.

00:37:53.563 --> 00:37:57.066 align:middle line:90%
Now, what am I seeing here?

00:37:57.066 --> 00:38:01.696 align:middle line:84%
Present-- and your conscious
mind says, oh, now I'm seeing--

00:38:01.696 --> 00:38:03.281 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:38:03.281 --> 00:38:10.830 align:middle line:84%
We were never officially
tasked with ETs or UFOs.

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:12.916 align:middle line:84%
During the entire
project, we were never

00:38:12.916 --> 00:38:17.253 align:middle line:90%
officially tasked with those.

00:38:17.253 --> 00:38:25.386 align:middle line:84%
And so we had done a
lot of ETs, and I never

00:38:25.386 --> 00:38:32.769 align:middle line:84%
found one that had any indicator
that it was a time machine.

00:38:32.769 --> 00:38:38.608 align:middle line:84%
I think it was just a drone that
was automated to go find things

00:38:38.608 --> 00:38:42.695 align:middle line:90%
and drone, phone home.

00:38:42.695 --> 00:38:44.572 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:38:46.491 --> 00:38:47.825 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:38:47.825 --> 00:38:49.327 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
it was looking for,

00:38:49.327 --> 00:38:53.957 align:middle line:84%
but evidently it found
it at Rendlesham Forest.

00:38:53.957 --> 00:38:59.295 align:middle line:84%
>> Since 1979, I have
interviewed some 1,500 people

00:38:59.295 --> 00:39:02.966 align:middle line:84%
in what is called the
human abduction syndrome.

00:39:02.966 --> 00:39:06.094 align:middle line:84%
And what has emerged,
over more than 30 years,

00:39:06.094 --> 00:39:10.306 align:middle line:84%
is the repeating theme that an
alien presence is harvesting

00:39:10.306 --> 00:39:13.268 align:middle line:90%
genetic material from Earth.

00:39:13.268 --> 00:39:16.896 align:middle line:84%
Time machines,
incubators of alien life,

00:39:16.896 --> 00:39:20.608 align:middle line:84%
trying to survive in
planet-seeding missions.

00:39:20.608 --> 00:39:24.862 align:middle line:84%
ET hybrids and clones,
eons beyond us,

00:39:24.862 --> 00:39:28.199 align:middle line:90%
as the MJ-12 documents say.

00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:32.161 align:middle line:84%
Whistleblowers have reported
that alien technologies can

00:39:32.161 --> 00:39:35.957 align:middle line:84%
make their various spacecraft,
androids, and other ET

00:39:35.957 --> 00:39:39.586 align:middle line:84%
technologies invisible
to human eyes.

00:39:39.586 --> 00:39:43.131 align:middle line:84%
This Naval ship fading
into invisibility

00:39:43.131 --> 00:39:48.052 align:middle line:84%
is an October 2015 Northrop
Grumman Facebook posting.

00:39:48.052 --> 00:39:53.516 align:middle line:84%
In addition to invisibility, the
extraterrestrial technology is

00:39:53.516 --> 00:39:58.605 align:middle line:84%
described as functioning with
self-activating software that

00:39:58.605 --> 00:40:01.649 align:middle line:84%
can neutralize gravity and
project three-dimensional

00:40:01.649 --> 00:40:06.487 align:middle line:84%
holograms as camouflage the
human eyes and minds cannot

00:40:06.487 --> 00:40:09.324 align:middle line:90%
detect in the earth environment.

00:40:09.324 --> 00:40:14.370 align:middle line:84%
The alien goal, they say, is
to harvest genetic material

00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:18.416 align:middle line:84%
from this planet's animal
and human life in order

00:40:18.416 --> 00:40:24.130 align:middle line:84%
to create a large ongoing
supply of rapid-cycle cloned

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:28.676 align:middle line:84%
and hybridized body containers,
with very advanced technology,

00:40:28.676 --> 00:40:31.554 align:middle line:84%
that some people in
human abduction syndrome

00:40:31.554 --> 00:40:35.808 align:middle line:84%
refer to as the
Resurrection Tubes.

00:40:35.808 --> 00:40:39.103 align:middle line:84%
I first learned about the
cloning tube technology

00:40:39.103 --> 00:40:42.732 align:middle line:90%
the first week of March of 1991.

00:40:42.732 --> 00:40:44.484 align:middle line:84%
That's when I
received in the mail

00:40:44.484 --> 00:40:48.863 align:middle line:84%
a large envelope that contained
an audio cassette, a letter,

00:40:48.863 --> 00:40:53.826 align:middle line:84%
and several color drawings from
a woman named Linda Porter.

00:40:53.826 --> 00:40:57.330 align:middle line:84%
She was born in 1946
and began having

00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:04.504 align:middle line:84%
memorable experiences with
non-humans by age 12 in 1958

00:41:04.504 --> 00:41:07.840 align:middle line:84%
She had decided it was
important to reach me

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.926 align:middle line:84%
after hearing a
conference presentation

00:41:09.926 --> 00:41:13.429 align:middle line:84%
that I had given in California
concerning eyewitness

00:41:13.429 --> 00:41:17.642 align:middle line:84%
testimony about nonhuman
intelligences interacting

00:41:17.642 --> 00:41:19.477 align:middle line:90%
with our planet.

00:41:19.477 --> 00:41:22.480 align:middle line:84%
She was concerned
about her vulnerability

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:26.025 align:middle line:84%
as a person caught up in the
human abduction syndrome,

00:41:26.025 --> 00:41:29.529 align:middle line:84%
and she was frightened about
the United States government's

00:41:29.529 --> 00:41:34.701 align:middle line:84%
policy of hiding
the alien presence.

00:41:34.701 --> 00:41:39.747 align:middle line:84%
Her letter to me began, quote,
"we-- meaning abductees--

00:41:39.747 --> 00:41:42.917 align:middle line:84%
are caught in the middle of
a series of ongoing events

00:41:42.917 --> 00:41:45.253 align:middle line:84%
that will one day prove
to be historically

00:41:45.253 --> 00:41:48.715 align:middle line:84%
significant to the
future of the Earth.

00:41:48.715 --> 00:41:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, because
of our continuing

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:55.012 align:middle line:84%
non-voluntary interactions
with these beings,

00:41:55.012 --> 00:41:57.849 align:middle line:84%
we have, in a sense,
become victims

00:41:57.849 --> 00:42:01.018 align:middle line:90%
of both sides of the phenomena.

00:42:01.018 --> 00:42:04.689 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, we
are used by the aliens

00:42:04.689 --> 00:42:09.193 align:middle line:84%
for their own purposes,
whatever those purposes may be.

00:42:09.193 --> 00:42:13.573 align:middle line:84%
On the other, if we speak
out, we risk ridicule

00:42:13.573 --> 00:42:15.950 align:middle line:84%
from the public,
and in some cases,

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:19.120 align:middle line:84%
possible harassment
and/or intimidation

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:22.415 align:middle line:84%
by government and
military personnel.

00:42:22.415 --> 00:42:26.502 align:middle line:84%
If you could look directly
into these creatures' eyes,

00:42:26.502 --> 00:42:31.591 align:middle line:84%
you'd realize that every detail
of your life, no matter how

00:42:31.591 --> 00:42:38.389 align:middle line:84%
personal, no matter how mundane,
how minute, is known to them.

00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:41.142 align:middle line:84%
It makes me wonder,
are we some kind

00:42:41.142 --> 00:42:43.603 align:middle line:84%
of Ken and Barbie
dolls being played

00:42:43.603 --> 00:42:47.356 align:middle line:84%
with by an emotionally
immature race of beings

00:42:47.356 --> 00:42:49.817 align:middle line:90%
with no sense of morality?

00:42:49.817 --> 00:42:55.948 align:middle line:84%
Or are we pawns held in the
grasp, maybe of a dying race,

00:42:55.948 --> 00:42:59.076 align:middle line:84%
that will do anything
for their own survival,

00:42:59.076 --> 00:43:02.955 align:middle line:84%
including the cold-blooded
manipulation of another

00:43:02.955 --> 00:43:08.169 align:middle line:84%
species--" which
is us, we humans--

00:43:08.169 --> 00:43:12.131 align:middle line:84%
"and the brutal mutilation
of helpless animals?

00:43:12.131 --> 00:43:16.219 align:middle line:84%
Unless a person has been through
the trauma of an abduction,

00:43:16.219 --> 00:43:20.264 align:middle line:84%
they cannot comprehend how these
entities can strip the mind

00:43:20.264 --> 00:43:23.893 align:middle line:84%
and soul as easily as they
can strip the clothes off

00:43:23.893 --> 00:43:25.144 align:middle line:90%
of a body.

00:43:25.144 --> 00:43:28.272 align:middle line:84%
They can scan details
of a person's life

00:43:28.272 --> 00:43:30.608 align:middle line:84%
with such facility
that they make

00:43:30.608 --> 00:43:34.111 align:middle line:84%
you feel as if you are an
interesting piece of lint

00:43:34.111 --> 00:43:37.448 align:middle line:90%
caught between their toes.

00:43:37.448 --> 00:43:39.909 align:middle line:84%
In the blink of an
eye, these beings

00:43:39.909 --> 00:43:44.038 align:middle line:84%
devastate all personal
freedom, all sense of privacy,

00:43:44.038 --> 00:43:47.583 align:middle line:84%
and all prospects for
living a normal existence.

00:43:47.583 --> 00:43:50.837 align:middle line:84%
A person's life is
never the same again.

00:43:50.837 --> 00:43:54.882 align:middle line:90%
He or she is changed forever."

Close quote.

00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:59.804 align:middle line:84%
Linda Porter's words
speak for a lot

00:43:59.804 --> 00:44:04.350 align:middle line:84%
of abductees who have interacted
with gray, blond, reptilian, or

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:06.394 align:middle line:90%
insect humanoids.

00:44:06.394 --> 00:44:11.107 align:middle line:84%
But some abductees think that
there are friendly non-humans

00:44:11.107 --> 00:44:14.110 align:middle line:84%
which are actually trying to
help people advance to more

00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:20.491 align:middle line:84%
stability, that could help the
non-humans to survive as well.

00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:23.995 align:middle line:84%

from Earth's future
that are here also.

00:44:43.264 --> 00:44:44.974 align:middle line:84%
That was something
that was necessary

00:44:44.974 --> 00:44:47.268 align:middle line:84%
because Earth

about a while back?

00:44:57.028 --> 00:45:00.781 align:middle line:84%
Some type of technology
fell into the wrong hands,

00:45:00.781 --> 00:45:04.327 align:middle line:84%

I don't know if it has been
changed, at least not yet.

00:45:10.499 --> 00:45:13.461 align:middle line:84%

00:45:24.347 --> 00:45:27.975 align:middle line:84%
interviewed who experienced
being raised and lowered

00:45:27.975 --> 00:45:31.145 align:middle line:84%
in a tube of light and
passed through walls

00:45:31.145 --> 00:45:33.940 align:middle line:84%
that felt like thousands
of little feathers

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:36.192 align:middle line:90%
all over their bodies.

00:45:36.192 --> 00:45:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Linda said the light, too, is
different from the tunnels that

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:42.740 align:middle line:90%
opened up inside of her bedroom.

Traveling through the
tunnel was what made me ill.

00:46:00.633 --> 00:46:04.595 align:middle line:84%
It had something to do with
change in physical density

00:46:04.595 --> 00:46:06.973 align:middle line:90%
of two differing dimensions."

00:46:09.767 --> 00:46:14.897 align:middle line:84%
Linda told me that in 1963,
when she was 17 years old,

00:46:14.897 --> 00:46:17.441 align:middle line:84%
she was abducted from
her Covina, California

00:46:17.441 --> 00:46:21.779 align:middle line:84%
home by gray-colored
beings with large eyes.

00:46:21.779 --> 00:46:26.784 align:middle line:84%
These gray beings seem to be
the Extraterrestrial Biological

00:46:26.784 --> 00:46:31.038 align:middle line:84%
Entities, or EBENs, that are
described in leaked government

00:46:31.038 --> 00:46:35.042 align:middle line:84%
documents as friendly
and concerned about Earth

00:46:35.042 --> 00:46:37.044 align:middle line:90%
and human evolution.

00:46:37.044 --> 00:46:40.131 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps they
are the EMERTHERS

referenced in Sergeant
CJ's binary downloads.

00:46:45.052 --> 00:46:47.722 align:middle line:84%
Linda Porter was
shown a procedure

00:46:47.722 --> 00:46:51.517 align:middle line:84%
to transfer the
soul or life force

00:46:51.517 --> 00:46:56.772 align:middle line:84%
from a dying man into a
healthy younger clone of a man.

00:46:56.772 --> 00:47:01.402 align:middle line:84%
Linda could see in one of the
cloning resurrection tubes.

00:47:01.402 --> 00:47:03.863 align:middle line:84%
The gray being told
Linda telepathically

00:47:03.863 --> 00:47:07.700 align:middle line:84%
that the same soul transfer
would be done with her.

00:47:10.327 --> 00:47:14.623 align:middle line:84%
That gray being explained
telepathically to Linda

00:47:14.623 --> 00:47:17.334 align:middle line:84%
that she had rheumatic
fever as a teenager that

00:47:17.334 --> 00:47:19.253 align:middle line:90%
damaged her heart.

00:47:19.253 --> 00:47:23.924 align:middle line:84%
The gray non-human said it was
vital that Linda Porter's soul

00:47:23.924 --> 00:47:29.055 align:middle line:84%
entity continue in the
same genetic body container

00:47:29.055 --> 00:47:31.807 align:middle line:84%
that she had been
born with in order

00:47:31.807 --> 00:47:36.520 align:middle line:84%
to accomplish an
unknown alien agenda.

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:40.649 align:middle line:84%
Linda watched a golden,
yellow-orange light rise out

00:47:40.649 --> 00:47:45.362 align:middle line:84%
of the top of the dead man's
spine and elongate in the air

00:47:45.362 --> 00:47:50.743 align:middle line:84%
as it moved across the room
to a row of body-sized tubes,

00:47:50.743 --> 00:47:53.871 align:middle line:84%
lighted from the top
and from the bottom,

00:47:53.871 --> 00:47:57.958 align:middle line:84%
and filled with a strange,
purple-looking gas.

00:47:57.958 --> 00:48:00.503 align:middle line:84%
Inside the tubes,
on the far right,

00:48:00.503 --> 00:48:04.131 align:middle line:84%
was a cloned body
of the same man,

00:48:04.131 --> 00:48:06.634 align:middle line:90%
but about 10 years younger.

00:48:06.634 --> 00:48:09.887 align:middle line:84%
Linda Porter said there was
a problem about Earth body

00:48:09.887 --> 00:48:14.475 align:middle line:84%
containers, souls,
other dimensions,

00:48:14.475 --> 00:48:17.353 align:middle line:90%
and altered timelines.

00:48:17.353 --> 00:48:21.607 align:middle line:84%
Linda said, quote, "I was told
that the resurrected cloned

00:48:21.607 --> 00:48:24.777 align:middle line:84%
man would be
relocated elsewhere,

00:48:24.777 --> 00:48:29.532 align:middle line:84%
maybe Australia, and would
continue on with his life."

Close quote.

00:48:31.117 --> 00:48:35.204 align:middle line:84%
Linda thought that it was
vital to the non-human entities

00:48:35.204 --> 00:48:39.166 align:middle line:84%
that the man's soul
continue functioning longer

00:48:39.166 --> 00:48:42.169 align:middle line:84%
inside the same
kind of container

00:48:42.169 --> 00:48:45.506 align:middle line:84%
that his older,
sick body had been.

00:48:45.506 --> 00:48:48.551 align:middle line:84%
Linda thought that one of the
reasons that the non-humans

00:48:48.551 --> 00:48:51.470 align:middle line:84%
take tissue samples
from abductees when they

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:54.557 align:middle line:84%
are as young as
four years old is

00:48:54.557 --> 00:48:57.601 align:middle line:84%
to have this tissue
in reserve in case

00:48:57.601 --> 00:49:02.231 align:middle line:84%
a new body for the abductee
to keep going in human life

00:49:02.231 --> 00:49:05.693 align:middle line:90%
becomes necessary later on.

00:49:05.693 --> 00:49:09.697 align:middle line:84%
Linda explained,

00:49:09.697 --> 00:49:12.116 align:middle line:90%
can be stored indefinitely.

00:49:12.116 --> 00:49:14.326 align:middle line:84%
The containers in the
sketch with the three

00:49:14.326 --> 00:49:18.414 align:middle line:84%
people in the tubes
are storage containers.

00:49:18.414 --> 00:49:20.499 align:middle line:84%
The containers in
both new sketches

00:49:20.499 --> 00:49:23.961 align:middle line:84%
I sent you are
activation containers.

00:49:23.961 --> 00:49:25.629 align:middle line:84%
They have a light
in the top that

00:49:25.629 --> 00:49:29.758 align:middle line:84%
must be on the person for
unknown amount of hours

00:49:29.758 --> 00:49:35.055 align:middle line:84%
before a body can be activated
if a body has been in storage.

00:49:35.055 --> 00:49:39.435 align:middle line:84%
If the body is newly made,
it does not need light.

00:49:39.435 --> 00:49:42.646 align:middle line:84%
In the sketch with the
three people in the tubes,

00:49:42.646 --> 00:49:45.900 align:middle line:84%
the body on the far
right was the younger one

00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:49.945 align:middle line:90%
given to the dying man.

00:49:49.945 --> 00:49:52.990 align:middle line:84%
I got the impression,
she said, the aliens

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:56.869 align:middle line:84%
do not like to do this
soul transfer very often.

00:49:56.869 --> 00:50:00.956 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I got the feeling
the aliens are not supposed

00:50:00.956 --> 00:50:03.167 align:middle line:90%
to be doing this at all.

00:50:03.167 --> 00:50:05.669 align:middle line:84%
But they seem to be
backed into a corner

00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:07.922 align:middle line:90%
and have no other recourse.

00:50:07.922 --> 00:50:11.217 align:middle line:84%
They also seem to be
trying to hide all of this

00:50:11.217 --> 00:50:13.677 align:middle line:90%
from some higher form of life.

00:50:13.677 --> 00:50:18.307 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the authority is that
prohibits this soul transfer

00:50:18.307 --> 00:50:21.936 align:middle line:84%
also prohibits the
ETs from interfering

00:50:21.936 --> 00:50:24.980 align:middle line:90%
on this planet Earth.

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:28.275 align:middle line:90%
But the Greys are interfering.

00:50:28.275 --> 00:50:31.403 align:middle line:84%
Whoever the authority
is is much higher

00:50:31.403 --> 00:50:35.366 align:middle line:84%
evolved than they are and
wields a great deal of power

00:50:35.366 --> 00:50:40.746 align:middle line:84%
over many, many other
realms of existence."

00:50:40.746 --> 00:50:44.583 align:middle line:84%
Linda Porter said there is
much, much more to existence

00:50:44.583 --> 00:50:47.461 align:middle line:84%
than we could ever
begin to understand.

00:50:47.461 --> 00:50:49.546 align:middle line:84%
Much of what we have
been taught regarding

00:50:49.546 --> 00:50:54.343 align:middle line:84%
the physical universe and the
laws that govern it is wrong.

00:50:54.343 --> 00:50:58.847 align:middle line:84%
The EBEN doing the soul
transfer from her diseased body

00:50:58.847 --> 00:51:02.559 align:middle line:84%
to her new cloned body in
one of the lighted tubes,

00:51:02.559 --> 00:51:07.690 align:middle line:84%
gave Linda Porter an overview
of how the cosmos is constructed

00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:11.443 align:middle line:90%
from the EBEN's point of view.

00:51:11.443 --> 00:51:17.283 align:middle line:84%
The universe, she said, is
built on sound patterns, which

00:51:17.283 --> 00:51:20.703 align:middle line:84%
is why so many different
world dimensions can

00:51:20.703 --> 00:51:23.455 align:middle line:90%
exist in the same space.

00:51:23.455 --> 00:51:26.667 align:middle line:84%
Each is on a
different frequency.

00:51:26.667 --> 00:51:30.296 align:middle line:84%
Disrupt a world dimension to
the point that you destroy

00:51:30.296 --> 00:51:34.633 align:middle line:84%
the carrier wave that it
exists on, and you have created

00:51:34.633 --> 00:51:40.306 align:middle line:84%
a whole inexistence that cannot
support the dimension above

00:51:40.306 --> 00:51:42.016 align:middle line:90%
or below it.

00:51:42.016 --> 00:51:45.602 align:middle line:84%
Each frequency, besides
maintaining its own world

00:51:45.602 --> 00:51:51.734 align:middle line:84%
dimension, also supports or
holds in place the one above it

00:51:51.734 --> 00:51:53.360 align:middle line:90%
and below it.

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:56.739 align:middle line:90%
Everything is interdependent.

00:51:56.739 --> 00:51:59.908 align:middle line:84%
There are countless worlds'
dimensions occupying

00:51:59.908 --> 00:52:04.079 align:middle line:84%
the same space without
being aware of one another

00:52:04.079 --> 00:52:08.167 align:middle line:84%
because of having their
own individual octaves.

00:52:08.167 --> 00:52:12.713 align:middle line:84%
The octave frequency holds
the world dimension in place

00:52:12.713 --> 00:52:16.508 align:middle line:84%
and causes it to exist
safely without interfering

00:52:16.508 --> 00:52:21.138 align:middle line:84%
with or even being aware
of other worlds around it.

00:52:21.138 --> 00:52:24.975 align:middle line:84%
This frequency acts as a
buffer zone to keep everything

00:52:24.975 --> 00:52:26.685 align:middle line:90%
in its place.

00:52:26.685 --> 00:52:30.689 align:middle line:84%
You do anything to disrupt it,
and you begin a collapse that

00:52:30.689 --> 00:52:34.193 align:middle line:90%
starts a deadly chain reaction.

00:52:34.193 --> 00:52:38.697 align:middle line:84%
If the density of this collapse
reaches a certain weight,

00:52:38.697 --> 00:52:42.701 align:middle line:84%
spacetime itself
begins to collapse.

00:52:42.701 --> 00:52:45.746 align:middle line:84%
Atomic and hydrogen
bombs physically

00:52:45.746 --> 00:52:48.791 align:middle line:90%
tear into other dimensions.

00:52:48.791 --> 00:52:52.169 align:middle line:84%
And whatever the experiment
is that our government

00:52:52.169 --> 00:52:56.507 align:middle line:84%
in the United States is
involved with in outer space,

00:52:56.507 --> 00:53:01.261 align:middle line:84%
if successful, it will
change the density of matter

00:53:01.261 --> 00:53:04.932 align:middle line:84%
to such an extent that
the chain reaction started

00:53:04.932 --> 00:53:09.645 align:middle line:84%
will not be able to be stopped
by anybody in any world

00:53:09.645 --> 00:53:12.731 align:middle line:90%
or dimension.

00:53:12.731 --> 00:53:14.983 align:middle line:84%
Linda Porter said
there are literally

00:53:14.983 --> 00:53:18.987 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of different alien
life forms here trying to stop

00:53:18.987 --> 00:53:21.490 align:middle line:84%
what is happening,
as it is putting

00:53:21.490 --> 00:53:23.700 align:middle line:90%
their own worlds at risk.

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:26.703 align:middle line:84%
Some, as I had mentioned
in earlier letters,

00:53:26.703 --> 00:53:28.831 align:middle line:84%
are not supposed
to be interfering,

00:53:28.831 --> 00:53:31.500 align:middle line:90%
but are doing so anyway.

00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:36.380 align:middle line:84%
What they are all trying to
do is stop a ripple effect

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:38.549 align:middle line:84%
that will emanate
outward from Earth

00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:42.636 align:middle line:84%
should this government
experiment succeed.

00:53:42.636 --> 00:53:46.473 align:middle line:84%
With all their technology,
why don't the aliens

00:53:46.473 --> 00:53:50.310 align:middle line:84%
or their superiors just walk
in and stop the whole thing

00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:51.395 align:middle line:90%
themselves?

00:53:51.395 --> 00:53:56.191 align:middle line:84%
Why do they need us
abductees to speak for them?

00:53:56.191 --> 00:53:59.236 align:middle line:84%
Something just doesn't
make any sense.

00:53:59.236 --> 00:54:03.532 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if we are being lied
to, used for some purpose

00:54:03.532 --> 00:54:08.871 align:middle line:84%
to put over ideas that
they want us to believe.

00:54:08.871 --> 00:54:12.999 align:middle line:84%
If there is an experiment,
maybe if it succeeds,

00:54:12.999 --> 00:54:17.129 align:middle line:84%
it will put us in competition
with the aliens for something

00:54:17.129 --> 00:54:19.715 align:middle line:90%
they don't want to share.

00:54:19.715 --> 00:54:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're trying to scare
us out of their neighborhood.

00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:28.265 align:middle line:84%
A similar warning about a
government experiment in space

00:54:28.265 --> 00:54:31.602 align:middle line:84%
was described by another woman
in the abduction syndrome named

00:54:31.602 --> 00:54:32.936 align:middle line:90%
Judy Doraty.

00:54:32.936 --> 00:54:35.272 align:middle line:84%
I met Judy in
spring 1980, when I

00:54:35.272 --> 00:54:38.317 align:middle line:84%
was producing the TV
documentary, "A Strange

00:54:38.317 --> 00:54:42.362 align:middle line:84%
Harvest," about the worldwide
animal mutilation phenomenon.

00:54:42.362 --> 00:54:47.159 align:middle line:84%
Law enforcement told me as
far back as September 1979

00:54:47.159 --> 00:54:51.330 align:middle line:84%
that they knew the perpetrators
of animal mutilations

00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:54.291 align:middle line:84%
are creatures from
outer space because

00:54:54.291 --> 00:54:57.044 align:middle line:84%
of the bloodless surgical
excisions on both

00:54:57.044 --> 00:55:01.006 align:middle line:84%
the surface of animals and the
removal of internal organs,

00:55:01.006 --> 00:55:05.219 align:middle line:84%
such as hearts and trachea,
without any surgical excisions

00:55:05.219 --> 00:55:08.680 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of
the animal's body.

00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:14.311 align:middle line:84%
Some whistleblowers say that
advanced ET technology includes

00:55:14.311 --> 00:55:16.897 align:middle line:84%
control and
manipulation of gravity,

00:55:16.897 --> 00:55:21.902 align:middle line:84%
camouflaging matter with
invisibility, 3-D holograms,

00:55:21.902 --> 00:55:24.947 align:middle line:84%
and the ability to
fold space and time

00:55:24.947 --> 00:55:29.243 align:middle line:84%
in point-to-point transportation
around the cosmos.

00:55:29.243 --> 00:55:32.162 align:middle line:84%
We'll hear from some
government whistleblowers

00:55:32.162 --> 00:55:34.248 align:middle line:90%
on the next "Truth Hunter."

00:55:34.248 --> 00:55:36.542 align:middle line:90%
This is Linda Moulton Howe.

00:55:36.542 --> 00:55:40.295 align:middle line:84%
Please stay tuned to my Gaia
series for more revelations

00:55:40.295 --> 00:55:43.257 align:middle line:84%
about our universe,
this solar system,

00:55:43.257 --> 00:55:45.300 align:middle line:90%
and the planet we live on.
