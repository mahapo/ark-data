00:00:25.347 --> 00:00:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>> In all my investigations
of UFO and ET mysteries,

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.020 align:middle line:84%
the most compelling case with
the most eyewitnesses and hard

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.670 align:middle line:84%
physical evidence is RAF
Bentwaters Woodbridge.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.750 align:middle line:84%
In December of 1980, that
UK and American airbase

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.670 align:middle line:90%
was NATO's largest.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Adding to its sensitivity
was a big dark secret.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.000 align:middle line:84%
At the time that
the weapons storage

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.110 align:middle line:84%
areas on both the Bentwaters
and Woodbridge sides of the base

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.040 align:middle line:84%
did contain tactical
nuclear weapons,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.000 align:middle line:84%
strange, unidentified, red,
blue, orange, and white lights

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.099 align:middle line:84%
and beams showed up
in nearby Rendlesham

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Forest for three nights in a
row after midnight December

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.220 align:middle line:90%
26, 27, and 28, 1980.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.030 align:middle line:84%
There was physical evidence
of a triangle pattern embedded

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.980 align:middle line:84%
in the forest floor and above
background radioactivity

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.920 align:middle line:90%
on scorched trees and soil.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.540 align:middle line:84%
That's when a secrecy lid was
slammed down hard by military

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.690 align:middle line:90%
and intelligence authorities.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.050 align:middle line:84%
Where was RAF
Bentwaters Woodbridge?

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.010 align:middle line:84%
95 miles northeast of
London in Suffolk County.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.220 align:middle line:84%
The green circle marks the
airbase between Woodbridge

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.550 align:middle line:90%
and Orford near the North Sea.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.600 align:middle line:10%
On this map, Rendlesham Forest
is all the darker green color

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.000 align:middle line:10%
east of Woodbridge,
growing around

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.460 align:middle line:10%
between the black rectangles RAF
Woodbridge and RAF Bentwaters.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.990 align:middle line:84%
In 1942 as the Second
World War intensified,

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.410 align:middle line:84%
the British Royal Air Force
constructed the air base.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.039 align:middle line:84%
And at first they
called it RAF Butley.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.000 align:middle line:84%
The forest was important to
camouflage the air base's war

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.960 align:middle line:84%
activities, so even
more trees were planted

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.810 align:middle line:90%
to enlarge Rendlesham Forest.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.960 align:middle line:10%
After the end of World
War II, RAF Butley

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.730 align:middle line:10%
was renamed RAF Bentwaters by
Britain's Ministry of Defense

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.520 align:middle line:10%
and leased to the
United States Air Force

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.480 align:middle line:10%
for its 81st
Fighter-Interceptor Wing.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.250 align:middle line:10%
By 1958, RAF Bentwaters
and RAF Woodbridge

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.310 align:middle line:10%
became a joint US
and Royal Air Force

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.010 align:middle line:10%
complex with a big thick
Rendlesham Forest in between.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.000 align:middle line:84%
By December 1980, RAF
Bentwaters Woodbridge

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.630 align:middle line:84%
was the largest
NATO base in Europe.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.500 align:middle line:84%
But a decade later in
1992, the United States

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.220 align:middle line:84%
canceled its involvement
with RAF Bentwaters.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.080 align:middle line:84%
But back in 1980, the alliance
was critical for NATO's largest

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.080 align:middle line:90%
airbase.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.100 align:middle line:84%
This Google aerial
shows underlined in red

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.870 align:middle line:84%
the Woodbridge and
Bentwaters weapon storage

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.180 align:middle line:84%
areas, also known
as WSAs, that had

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.790 align:middle line:90%
the tactical nuclear weapons.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.470 align:middle line:84%
The RAF Woodbridge runway ends
at the east gate and folly

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.970 align:middle line:84%
house, surrounded by the
dark green Rendlesham Forest.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.640 align:middle line:10%
Further east is a large open
field labeled "farmhouse."

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.110 align:middle line:84%
That field has a section
called Capel Green where

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.070 align:middle line:84%
the small orange circle
marks the site of UFO lights

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.540 align:middle line:90%
and craft.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.290 align:middle line:84%
The orange path is where Staff
Sergeant James Penniston,

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Airman First Class John
Burroughs, and Airman Ed

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Cabansag traveled
in a security pickup

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.180 align:middle line:84%
to investigate strange,
unidentified aerial lights

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.680 align:middle line:84%
after midnight on
December 26, 1980.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.400 align:middle line:84%
At the orange circle in the
forest next to Capel Green

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.820 align:middle line:84%
is where Penniston and
Burroughs were engulfed

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.670 align:middle line:90%
in bright, white light.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And Sergeant Penniston says
he walked around and touched

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.610 align:middle line:84%
a black triangular craft
that felt like glass.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.540 align:middle line:84%
The RAF Bentwaters WSA
was the American side

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.120 align:middle line:84%
of the base about four miles
north of RAF Woodbridge.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Nuc bunkers along a hot row
were watched 24 hours a day

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.790 align:middle line:90%
by security.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.850 align:middle line:84%
This photograph is
from a Bentwaters tower

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.600 align:middle line:84%
some 50 feet high looking over
the nuclear weapons storage

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.790 align:middle line:90%
area.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.800 align:middle line:10%
And here is the famous Orford
Ness Lighthouse, six miles east

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.000 align:middle line:10%
of the base.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Government agents tried
to use the lighthouses

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.150 align:middle line:84%
as a phony explanation
for all the lights

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.480 align:middle line:84%
and beams activity
in Rendlesham Forest.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.740 align:middle line:84%
I was surprised to learn that
RAF Bentwaters Woodbridge was

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.380 align:middle line:84%
infamous for having
strange lights

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.140 align:middle line:84%
and beams long
before December 1980.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.100 align:middle line:84%
Many people in different
parts of the large airbase

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.390 align:middle line:84%
had seen strange lights
and beams around the base.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.460 align:middle line:84%
But sightings were usually
not reported to avoid hassles

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.680 align:middle line:90%
with authorities.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.200 align:middle line:84%
As RAF Bentwaters Airman First
Class Doc Rhodes told me,

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.420 align:middle line:84%
quote, "When I got to
Bentwaters fresh from basic

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.650 align:middle line:84%
in January, 1980, I was told
by some of the more experienced

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.640 align:middle line:84%
guys, if you see a light or
something strange floating

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.550 align:middle line:90%
in the skies, don't report it.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.480 align:middle line:84%
You'll only make trouble
for yourself," close quote.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.570 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Doc Rhodes
sketched for me

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.710 align:middle line:84%
what he remembered seeing
at the beginning of 1980,

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.370 align:middle line:84%
when in January he was stationed
at the Woodbridge main gate

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.540 align:middle line:90%
one night.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.010 align:middle line:84%
He said a very large aerial
light stopped in the air

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.160 align:middle line:84%
without any sound
near the main gate

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.310 align:middle line:84%
and emitted a series
of light beams down

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.540 align:middle line:84%
toward the flight line where
the Woodbridge Weapon Storage

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.430 align:middle line:90%
Area was.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.270 align:middle line:84%
But Doc Rhodes said
he never reported

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.390 align:middle line:84%
that astonishing aerial
light and the beam

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:37.000 align:middle line:84%
that it emitted because of the
warning not to cause trouble.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.060 align:middle line:84%
But the lights and
beams kept coming.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.740 align:middle line:84%
By the end of 1980, military
security and law enforcement

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.050 align:middle line:84%
from Charlie and
Delta flights were

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.830 align:middle line:84%
involved with strange
unidentified lights, beams,

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:56.620 align:middle line:84%
and craft that persisted for a
72 hour period from December 26

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.240 align:middle line:90%
to 28.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.770 align:middle line:84%
It began after midnight
on December 26, 1980.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Afterward, the rumors started
that 20-year-old Airman First

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.380 align:middle line:84%
Class John Burroughs from
Charlie flight law enforcement

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:16.060 align:middle line:84%
had either jumped up on a
UFO in Rendlesham Forest

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:20.260 align:middle line:90%
or rose up in a beam of light.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:25.120 align:middle line:84%
John Burroughs was born in
Bloomington, Illinois in 1960

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.830 align:middle line:84%
and joined the US
Air Force right

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.930 align:middle line:90%
after high school graduation.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.140 align:middle line:84%
He received orders to go
to RAF Bentwaters, England,

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:36.790 align:middle line:84%
and arrived in July
1979, about 18 months

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:41.320 align:middle line:84%
before the highly strange
Rendlesham Forest encounters.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:46.060 align:middle line:84%
John remained in the Air Force
until his retirement in 2005

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.040 align:middle line:90%
as a Tech Sergeant.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.400 align:middle line:84%
John's conscious
memory has been blocked

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.000 align:middle line:84%
about what happened to him
on two different nights.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.330 align:middle line:84%
First, after midnight
on December 26,

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:04.360 align:middle line:84%
and then two nights later around
4:00 AM on December 28, 1980.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.750 align:middle line:84%
John was confused by
the airbase rumors

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:12.100 align:middle line:84%
that he jumped up on a UFO,
because he could not clearly

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.930 align:middle line:84%
remember what
happened when he was

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.930 align:middle line:90%
near the lights on either night.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.060 align:middle line:84%
In this "Truth
Hunter," I'm going

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:24.280 align:middle line:84%
to share brief excerpts from
a private November 11, 1988

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.190 align:middle line:84%
hypnosis session with
John Burroughs done

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:31.850 align:middle line:84%
at the home of Curt
Brubaker in Los Angeles.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:35.720 align:middle line:84%
This 1988 videotape
is deteriorated.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.809 align:middle line:84%
But as Burroughs speaks
rapidly about walking

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:41.900 align:middle line:84%
next to Staff Sergeant
Penniston on December 26

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.010 align:middle line:84%
after midnight, as they
approach unidentified area

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:51.080 align:middle line:84%
lights in the trees, this may
be the closest that any of us

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.860 align:middle line:90%
will ever get to what happened.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Lights, lights.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:58.430 align:middle line:90%
A weird, oval shaped light.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:59.530 align:middle line:90%
It-- it's hovering.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.639 align:middle line:90%
It's hovering.

00:09:01.639 --> 00:09:02.970 align:middle line:90%
It's hovering.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.586 align:middle line:90%
It's strobing.

00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Flashing back and forth?

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:06.390 align:middle line:90%
Flashing on and off?

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>> They're white.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:10.055 align:middle line:84%
It's white, but it's- but
there's lights below it.

00:09:10.055 --> 00:09:11.409 align:middle line:90%
There's blue lights below it.

00:09:11.409 --> 00:09:13.492 align:middle line:84%
There's the orange lights,
there's the red lights.

00:09:13.492 --> 00:09:14.965 align:middle line:90%
It's like sun.

00:09:14.965 --> 00:09:17.930 align:middle line:84%
It's like the sun, but it's
not shape like the sun.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:19.700 align:middle line:90%
It's like an oval shaped thing.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's pulsating,
it's pulsating.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>> How far away is it?

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Ten feet, maybe 15.

00:09:25.635 --> 00:09:26.970 align:middle line:90%
>> How big is it?

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.310 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:29.285 align:middle line:90%
It keeps changing.

00:09:29.285 --> 00:09:30.085 align:middle line:90%
It keeps changing.

00:09:47.946 --> 00:09:48.437 align:middle line:90%
It's down low again.

00:09:48.437 --> 00:09:49.419 align:middle line:84%

through the trees?

00:09:50.544 --> 00:09:51.383 align:middle line:90%

Tell them, tell them, tell
them we're going to follow it.

00:09:54.329 --> 00:09:54.840 align:middle line:90%
We got to follow it.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.570 align:middle line:84%
I can't reach them
on them on the radio.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:56.676 align:middle line:90%
The hell with the radio.

00:09:56.676 --> 00:09:57.800 align:middle line:90%
Put it down, we don't need.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.970 align:middle line:90%

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:01.820 align:middle line:90%
We don't care what they say.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:02.816 align:middle line:90%
We've got to find out.

00:10:02.816 --> 00:10:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Something is there,
we've got to find out.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:05.110 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:06.302 align:middle line:90%
Spread out, spread out more.

00:10:06.302 --> 00:10:07.298 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's go.

00:10:07.298 --> 00:10:07.796 align:middle line:90%
OK, move, move.

00:10:07.796 --> 00:10:08.596 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:08.596 --> 00:10:10.286 align:middle line:90%
Be careful, be careful.

00:10:10.286 --> 00:10:11.282 align:middle line:90%
I feel weird.

00:10:11.282 --> 00:10:13.772 align:middle line:84%
I feel, I feel, I
feel, I feel tingly.

00:10:13.772 --> 00:10:14.768 align:middle line:90%
I feel tingly.

00:10:14.768 --> 00:10:15.764 align:middle line:90%
We all feel tingly.

00:10:15.764 --> 00:10:17.258 align:middle line:90%
We all, we all got to know.

00:10:17.258 --> 00:10:19.250 align:middle line:90%
We got to know, we got to know.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:20.117 align:middle line:90%
Is it a UFO, John?

I don't know, I don't know.

00:10:21.242 --> 00:10:22.043 align:middle line:90%
What is a UFO?

00:10:22.043 --> 00:10:22.842 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:10:22.842 --> 00:10:23.732 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:10:23.732 --> 00:10:25.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not real.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:26.770 align:middle line:90%
We can hear humming now.

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:28.434 align:middle line:90%
We can hear humming now.

00:10:28.434 --> 00:10:29.350 align:middle line:90%

This is weird, this is weird.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.329 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't we bring our guns?

00:10:33.329 --> 00:10:34.536 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't we bring our guns?

00:10:34.536 --> 00:10:35.650 align:middle line:90%
Could it be trying to us?

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:37.191 align:middle line:84%
I feel, I feel like
I'm being pulled,

00:10:37.191 --> 00:10:38.545 align:middle line:90%
something is pulling me.

00:10:38.545 --> 00:10:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Oh god, Sergeant
Penniston, what's going on?

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:41.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, it's
pulling it towards us.

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.010 align:middle line:90%
It's pulling it towards us.

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:44.437 align:middle line:90%
Oh look, it just changed again.

00:10:44.437 --> 00:10:45.895 align:middle line:84%
It's small, it's
small, it's small.

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:46.695 align:middle line:90%
It's small.

00:10:46.695 --> 00:10:47.755 align:middle line:90%
Now it's moving back.

00:10:47.755 --> 00:10:48.685 align:middle line:90%
Now it's moving back.

00:10:48.685 --> 00:10:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Now it's moving back,
now it's moving back.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:52.400 align:middle line:90%
Look, look, it just--

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.200 align:middle line:84%
look, look how
fast it moved back.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Look, it's-- it's a
quarter mile back now.

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.020 align:middle line:90%
It's a quarter mile back now.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:58.960 align:middle line:90%
Let's start running.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.335 align:middle line:84%
We can't let it
get away from us.

00:11:00.335 --> 00:11:02.100 align:middle line:90%
We got to know where it is.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.580 align:middle line:90%
OK, well it's gone.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.840 align:middle line:84%
OK, security control, return
to base, return to base,

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.640 align:middle line:90%
return to base.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.440 align:middle line:90%

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.576 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:11:08.576 --> 00:11:10.512 align:middle line:84%
Thirty minutes, hour,

00:11:10.512 --> 00:11:12.132 align:middle line:90%
OK, keep in radio contact.

00:11:12.132 --> 00:11:12.932 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:12.932 --> 00:11:14.394 align:middle line:90%
And we just start walking back.

00:11:14.394 --> 00:11:15.352 align:middle line:90%
And I'm talking to him.

00:11:15.352 --> 00:11:16.320 align:middle line:90%

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.288 align:middle line:90%

00:11:17.288 --> 00:11:19.720 align:middle line:84%

Bananachek.

We're walking, we're walking.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.740 align:middle line:90%
And we're walking back.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:25.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:26.520 align:middle line:90%
What was it?

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.480 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.950 align:middle line:90%
John, what do you think it is?

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:30.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.400 align:middle line:90%
Do I look scared?

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.850 align:middle line:90%
You look pale.

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:36.410 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what I saw, John.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:37.600 align:middle line:90%
I think it was UFO.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
believe what I saw.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.030 align:middle line:84%
He goes, you know, John, it
seemed like we were there

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:46.666 align:middle line:90%
and all of a sudden we're here.

00:11:46.666 --> 00:11:49.334 align:middle line:84%
Why couldn't we get
radio contact with them?

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:50.500 align:middle line:90%
We should have been able to.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.610 align:middle line:84%
We were-- we were,
we were, we were,

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:56.389 align:middle line:84%
there was repeater
stations, there was towers,

00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:58.884 align:middle line:90%
but we lost contact with them.

00:11:58.884 --> 00:12:00.381 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:12:00.381 --> 00:12:02.575 align:middle line:84%
Well, well, what
are we going to do?

00:12:02.575 --> 00:12:03.375 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:12:03.375 --> 00:12:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Let's just see what
happens when we get back.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.285 align:middle line:84%
So we're walking and it's
cold and we're walking.

00:12:08.285 --> 00:12:10.159 align:middle line:84%
And we come across a
creak that we don't even

00:12:10.159 --> 00:12:10.361 align:middle line:90%
remember crossing.

00:12:10.361 --> 00:12:11.858 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember this, John?

00:12:11.858 --> 00:12:14.086 align:middle line:90%
No, I don't remember this.

00:12:14.086 --> 00:12:15.210 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that, John?

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.158 align:middle line:90%
No, I don't remember that.

00:12:17.158 --> 00:12:18.640 align:middle line:90%
Well, how did we get there?

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.616 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:12:20.616 --> 00:12:23.760 align:middle line:84%
Could we, could we, could
we have been moved by it?

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.750 align:middle line:84%
Could something have
picked us off the ground?

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:26.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:29.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to talk about it.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.810 align:middle line:84%
The British police are there,
the shift commander is there.

There's other law
enforcement patrols there.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:40.940 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was concerned.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.430 align:middle line:84%
They go, they go, we
lost contact with you

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.580 align:middle line:90%
for 45 minutes, 50 minutes.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.350 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know where you were.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:52.700 align:middle line:84%
We saw-- the WSA tower saw all
kinds of lights in the air.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:55.790 align:middle line:84%
They thought they saw something
being beamed up in the air,

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:57.230 align:middle line:90%
but they weren't sure.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:58.970 align:middle line:90%
They thought we lost you, John.

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.392 align:middle line:84%
We thought, we thought
we lost you guys.

00:13:01.392 --> 00:13:04.224 align:middle line:90%
Well, what happened?

00:13:04.224 --> 00:13:06.590 align:middle line:90%

John, Jim, and I went
to Woodbridge, England

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:46.430 align:middle line:84%
in December, 2010 with
Prometheus Productions

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:50.420 align:middle line:84%
and their "Ancient Aliens" TV
crew on the 30th anniversary

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:55.700 align:middle line:84%
of all the December 1980 light
phenomena in Rendlesham Forest.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Our goal was to see if
Jim and John could find

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.830 align:middle line:90%
the original encounter site.

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:05.890 align:middle line:84%
When John saw the stop
sign in this photo

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:08.890 align:middle line:84%
on a logging road not
far from the east gate,

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:11.830 align:middle line:84%
he wanted to explore
there, because John vividly

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:16.000 align:middle line:84%
remembered that's where he
had been with his C-flight law

enforcement supervisor
Staff Sergeant Bud Stevens

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:24.090 align:middle line:84%
when they first saw the
strange lights over the trees.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So we turned,
we turned in here.

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:26.931 align:middle line:90%
And I got out.

00:15:26.931 --> 00:15:28.888 align:middle line:84%
And when I got out,
because remember the driver

00:15:28.888 --> 00:15:29.780 align:middle line:90%
is on the other side.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.800 align:middle line:84%
I got out, I opened the
door and I'm looking.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.650 align:middle line:84%
I look at Bud, and it was like
static electricity in here.

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:39.660 align:middle line:84%
It was like a real
weird feeling.

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.000 align:middle line:90%
I said, this ain't right.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And I says, we need to back
up there and let them know

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:45.300 align:middle line:90%
what's going on, let them know.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.900 align:middle line:90%
Because we felt threatened here.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.462 align:middle line:84%
Because we felt like
something could happen to us.

00:15:49.462 --> 00:15:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And the fact was that we
wanted to get back up there.

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Because if something
happened to us,

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.570 align:middle line:84%
how were we going to explain we
were out here without anybody

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:55.570 align:middle line:90%
knowing?

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:58.840 align:middle line:84%
That's the way we felt.
And we boogied right back

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.840 align:middle line:90%
to that gate shack.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And I told the controllers
what was going on.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I remember was
Bud and I are standing here

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.160 align:middle line:84%
and I'm explaining
to them on the phone.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And he calls security--
was it eight?

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Security eight.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:16.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Respond down to the
East Gate, code two.

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Police four and five
have spotted a UFO.

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:20.960 align:middle line:90%
And he said UFO on the radio.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, but--

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.885 align:middle line:84%
>> And Bud and I looked at
each other and we went--

00:16:23.885 --> 00:16:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>> But that UFO
did not mean UFO.

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:29.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Why did you just say that?

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.754 align:middle line:84%
Because we didn't want
anything being said.

00:16:31.754 --> 00:16:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Why would you be concerned
that someone said UFO?

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.003 align:middle line:90%
Why would that bother you?

00:16:35.003 --> 00:16:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Because UFO to
me meant aliens.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And what we were
doing at the time was

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:40.670 align:middle line:84%
I could not tell
him what it was.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:43.060 align:middle line:10%
It was so bizarre,
what we were seeing.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.130 align:middle line:10%
I was trying to
explain to him, and he

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.680 align:middle line:10%
wasn't grasping as far as--

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.500 align:middle line:10%
I guess he was grasping that
it was so bizarre that he--

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.350 align:middle line:10%
we didn't call it a UFO.

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:54.520 align:middle line:84%
He called it a UFO
after talking to us.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:55.930 align:middle line:90%
We never described it as a UFO.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.160 align:middle line:84%
There's some kind of
weird lights in the forest

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.910 align:middle line:84%
and above the trees that
we don't know what it is.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's as far
as down the road.

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:04.300 align:middle line:84%
It's starting to
look like it's going

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.520 align:middle line:90%
to come up the road toward us.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.599 align:middle line:84%
>> John was talking about
Sergeant Donnie Dillard.

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:13.480 align:middle line:84%
John talked with him by
phone about the lights,

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.970 align:middle line:84%
and then Dillard
called security eight

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:20.619 align:middle line:84%
and used the word UFO
on the radio, which

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:22.540 align:middle line:90%
dismayed John Burroughs.

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Because he was concerned
about the ridicule

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:30.550 align:middle line:84%
and harassment that comes to
eyewitnesses after UFO reports.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:34.270 align:middle line:84%
The light phenomenon was
then officially confirmed

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:38.960 align:middle line:84%
in a statement of witness
that C-flight shift commander,

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Lieutenant Fred Buran had
typed up on January 2, 1981,

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:46.120 align:middle line:84%
a week after Burroughs
and Penniston's

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.360 align:middle line:84%
dramatic interactions with
strange lights in Rendlesham

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.590 align:middle line:90%
Forest.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Lieutenant Buran
officially stated the date

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:58.060 align:middle line:84%
as December 26,
1980 and specified

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:02.650 align:middle line:84%
the time of events at 3:00
AM for reasons unknown.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Because Burroughs,
Penniston, and Bud Stevens

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.740 align:middle line:84%
all insist that the lights
in Rendlesham Forest

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:12.850 align:middle line:84%
could be seen from the east
gate soon after midnight

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:15.550 align:middle line:90%
on December 26, 1980.

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:18.400 align:middle line:84%

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:35.650 align:middle line:84%
I was on duty at building 679
central security control when I

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:39.340 align:middle line:84%
was notified that Airman First
Class Burroughs had sighted

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:43.150 align:middle line:84%
some strange lights in the
wooded area east of the runway

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:45.720 align:middle line:90%
at RAF Woodbridge.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Staff Sergeant Penniston
said that he had never

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:51.900 align:middle line:84%
seen lights of this color or
nature in the area before.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:55.950 align:middle line:84%
He described them as red,
blue, white, and orange.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Staff Sergeant Penniston
requested permission

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.240 align:middle line:90%
to investigate.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.270 align:middle line:84%
I monitored their progress
of Penniston, Burroughs,

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:06.600 align:middle line:84%
and Cabansag as they
entered the wooded area.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.000 align:middle line:84%
They appeared to get
very close to the lights.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And at one point Staff
Sergeant Penniston

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:17.220 align:middle line:84%
stated that it was a
definite mechanical object.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.050 align:middle line:84%
Staff Sergeant
Penniston reported

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:20.970 align:middle line:90%
getting near the object.

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden
said they had gone past it

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.110 align:middle line:84%
and we're looking at
a marker beacon that

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:31.560 align:middle line:84%
was in the same general
direction as the other lights.

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.530 align:middle line:84%
This may relate to
the missing time.

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:37.590 align:middle line:84%
I ask him through
Staff Sergeant Coffey

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:39.660 align:middle line:90%
if he could have been mistaken.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:45.300 align:middle line:84%
To which Penniston replied that
had I seen the other lights,

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.580 align:middle line:90%
I would know the difference.

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Staff Sergeant Penniston
seemed somewhat agitated

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.380 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.890 align:middle line:84%
They continued to look
further to no avail.

00:19:55.890 --> 00:20:00.000 align:middle line:84%
At approximately 0354 hours,
which is near 4:00 AM,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.110 align:middle line:84%
I terminated the investigation
and ordered all units back

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.970 align:middle line:90%
to their normal duties.

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.010 align:middle line:84%
I directed Staff
Sergeant Penniston

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:13.390 align:middle line:84%
to take notes of the incident
when he came in that morning.

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:18.190 align:middle line:84%
After talking with him face to
face concerning the incident,

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:21.730 align:middle line:84%
I am convinced that
he saw something out

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:26.380 align:middle line:84%
of the realm of explanation
for him at that time.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Later that morning after
conversing with Captain Mike

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Verrano, the day
shift commander,

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:35.080 align:middle line:84%
I discovered that there had
been several other sightings

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.250 align:middle line:90%
of strange lights."

close quote.

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Jim Penniston had
worked security duties

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:51.900 align:middle line:84%
for the Strategic Air
Command in the 1970s,

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:55.860 align:middle line:84%
was a flight security
controller for Minuteman ICBMs

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.700 align:middle line:84%
at Malmstrom Air
Force Base in Montana.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And in December, 1980 Jim was
C-flight security supervisor

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:06.810 align:middle line:84%
for flight operations
at RAF Bentwaters.

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:11.820 align:middle line:84%
So he was very experienced with
airplanes and plane crashes.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.000 align:middle line:84%
But he had no background
for what he encountered

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.520 align:middle line:90%
in Rendlesham Forest.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:22.020 align:middle line:84%
After the December 26 encounter,
Staff Sergeant Jim Penniston

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:26.910 align:middle line:84%
described the lights becoming
so bright he could not see,

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:30.180 align:middle line:84%
and then dimming down
so much that he suddenly

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:33.270 align:middle line:84%
could see a solid
black triangular shaped

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:36.120 align:middle line:90%
craft emerge out of the light.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:39.450 align:middle line:84%
He estimated the size
as nine feet long

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:43.140 align:middle line:84%
with a fin-like projection
on top of the triangle that

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.570 align:middle line:90%
rose up to about six feet.

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:49.710 align:middle line:84%
On the right front side of the
craft in Jim's illustration,

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:54.090 align:middle line:84%
are raised symbols
like Braille, he said.

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant Penniston sketched
the symbols in his notebook

00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:01.050 align:middle line:84%
that he normally used for
plane crash investigations,

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and then he touched the raised
symbols with his fingertips.

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:10.680 align:middle line:10%
>> There was markings on the
craft, which were very unusual.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:14.550 align:middle line:90%
Probably 2 1/2, 3 feet wide.

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:17.340 align:middle line:10%
If you had a sheet
of smooth glass

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:20.580 align:middle line:10%
and you took a
piece of sand paper

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:23.880 align:middle line:10%
and you laid it on that
glass running from the glass

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.490 align:middle line:10%
to the sand paper,
that's how it felt.

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:28.890 align:middle line:10%
Here's something that is odd.

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:32.830 align:middle line:10%
I lost track of John for
like 45 minutes or so.

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:35.090 align:middle line:90%
I don't know where he was at.

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:37.355 align:middle line:84%
There's like a 45
minute gap of time

00:22:37.355 --> 00:22:41.100 align:middle line:84%
there, which seemed like I
don't know, a couple of minutes.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
caused the distortion.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>> There is confusion about
where Airman Ed Cabansag was

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.650 align:middle line:90%
during all this.

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:51.780 align:middle line:84%
John Burroughs and
Jim Penniston think

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.890 align:middle line:84%
Cabansag was
ordered by Penniston

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:57.150 align:middle line:84%
to stay with the
truck on the road

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.490 align:middle line:84%
from which Penniston
and Burroughs walked

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:02.880 align:middle line:84%
into Rendlesham Forest to
follow the strange lights.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.430 align:middle line:84%
The reason was that
their radios were

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:08.580 align:middle line:84%
full of static as they
tried to follow the lights.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.920 align:middle line:84%
The plan was that
Cabansag might be

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.080 align:middle line:84%
able to receive a
more clear radio

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:15.960 align:middle line:84%
signal from central
security control

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:19.320 align:middle line:84%
if he stayed behind
with the truck.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:23.400 align:middle line:84%
But Ed Cabansag later
said that he thought

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.730 align:middle line:90%
he was with Jim and John.

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:29.220 align:middle line:90%
One fact is certain.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Central security control could
not reach any of the three men

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:38.920 align:middle line:84%
by radio for at
least 45 minutes.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:42.630 align:middle line:84%
When is your very next
memory of John Burroughs?

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>> When the light on the craft
started to generate to a more

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:49.410 align:middle line:84%
white brilliant light is when
I backed away from the craft.

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:54.314 align:middle line:84%
John was maybe 15 feet away,
20 feet away standing there.

00:23:54.314 --> 00:23:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Because you were afraid of
what was happening with this

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:58.530 align:middle line:90%
increasing light?

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:01.440 align:middle line:10%
>> I wasn't sure what it was
going to do, I don't know,

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.060 align:middle line:10%
explode.

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:07.830 align:middle line:10%
The craft lifted off the forest
floor, went to tree top level,

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:11.220 align:middle line:10%
and took off at an
extreme rate of speed.

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And nothing that I know of could
be gone in the blink of an eye.

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:18.740 align:middle line:84%
I had this feeling,
and the feeling

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:24.063 align:middle line:84%
was that there would be a
return sometime of that craft.

00:24:24.063 --> 00:24:26.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, it was
just a very odd thought.

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Delta flight,
photographed here in 1980,

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:37.950 align:middle line:84%
went on midnight duty December
27 to 28 across midnight,

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:40.130 align:middle line:84%
while John Burroughs,
Jim Penniston,

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:44.210 align:middle line:84%
and Ed Cabansag in Charlie
flight were off duty.

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:47.600 align:middle line:84%
At 11:00 PM one
hour before midnight

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:51.020 align:middle line:84%
going into December
27, Delta flight

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.420 align:middle line:84%
gathered their guns in
the nightly procedure

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.460 align:middle line:90%
known as guard mount.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:59.420 align:middle line:10%
One of the new enlistees who had
only arrived at RAF Bentwaters

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:03.050 align:middle line:10%
two months before
in October 1980,

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:06.530 align:middle line:10%
was Lori Buoen, 18
years old, the second

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:09.560 align:middle line:10%
from the right in the middle
row of this D fly drill

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.390 align:middle line:10%
team photograph.

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:14.600 align:middle line:84%
Lori grew up in
Fridley, Minnesota,

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.280 align:middle line:84%
and immediately
after high school

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.560 align:middle line:90%
enlisted in the US Air Force.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Like all new basic airmen, she
was assigned to gate security.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.380 align:middle line:84%
On Christmas night,
December 25, 1980

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.660 align:middle line:84%
she had been at the
Woodbridge main gate

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:33.260 align:middle line:84%
and remembers that the
base commander, Ted Conrad,

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:36.740 align:middle line:84%
brought Christmas dinner to her
and others working the holiday

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.450 align:middle line:90%
swing shift.

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:41.150 align:middle line:84%
The next night, because
she was a basic airman

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:44.630 align:middle line:84%
and not given the privilege
of driving her own vehicle,

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Lori Buoen was driven
from the D-flight guard

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:50.900 align:middle line:84%
mount and dropped off
for a midnight shift

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.690 align:middle line:90%
at the east gate.

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:56.300 align:middle line:90%
This was not normal procedure.

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Usually, swing shifts left
the remote east gate guard

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.910 align:middle line:90%
shack around 9:00 PM.

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:04.220 align:middle line:84%
But the explanation
for putting Lori there

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:08.660 align:middle line:84%
for the December 27th
D-flight midnight shift

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.300 align:middle line:84%
might have been
concern about what

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.370 align:middle line:84%
had happened to
Penniston, Burroughs,

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:15.610 align:middle line:90%
and Cabansag the night before.

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:18.320 align:middle line:84%
Lori said she and
others in D-flight

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:23.420 align:middle line:84%
were not told anything
about the mysterious lights

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:27.170 align:middle line:84%
that C-flight had
investigated the night before.

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, those
lights and craft

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:33.740 align:middle line:84%
were being kept secret under
orders from higher authority.

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:38.240 align:middle line:84%
But that same higher authority
would want more eyes and ears

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:42.830 align:middle line:84%
on Rendlesham Forest in case the
lights or the craft came back.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's apparently
why airman Buoen

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.900 align:middle line:90%
was assigned to the east gate.

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
this is what Lori saw

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:55.010 align:middle line:90%
looking north above the forest.

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:57.650 align:middle line:84%
Lori is an artist and
drew this illustration

00:26:57.650 --> 00:26:59.780 align:middle line:84%
of the small wooden
east gate guard

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:03.350 align:middle line:84%
shack where she watched
a large reddish orange

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:07.400 align:middle line:84%
ball of fiery light in the
sky that moved slowly straight

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.700 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>> If you took three handfuls
of colored fire and put them

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:14.777 align:middle line:84%
together and you saw one color,
then you saw another color,

00:27:14.777 --> 00:27:17.360 align:middle line:84%
then you saw another color, you
get this feeling that it's not

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.817 align:middle line:90%
blinking, but that it's turning.

00:27:18.817 --> 00:27:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And then this was in front
of me on the other side

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:22.090 align:middle line:90%
of the runway in the woods.

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:24.000 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing but
darkness from the trees.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And it just slowly disappeared,
straight down into the horizon

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.870 align:middle line:90%
where the dark trees were.

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:31.709 align:middle line:84%
You could tell it was
big, even though it's

00:27:31.709 --> 00:27:32.750 align:middle line:90%
like looking at the moon.

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:33.950 align:middle line:90%
Is the moon big?

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:37.160 align:middle line:84%
You knew it was big
because you could see it.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:38.932 align:middle line:84%
You knew it was
off in a distance

00:27:38.932 --> 00:27:41.390 align:middle line:84%
and you're thinking it's just
like nothing else you've ever

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:42.500 align:middle line:90%
seen.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.150 align:middle line:84%
You can't even compare
it to something

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:46.730 align:middle line:84%
because there's nothing
to compare it to.

00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Lori, what was the first
thing you did after seeing this

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:54.650 align:middle line:84%
bright orange light
disappear into the forest?

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember the metal phone
inside of that little wooden

00:27:58.700 --> 00:27:59.500 align:middle line:90%
guard shack.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:02.165 align:middle line:84%
You have to open up the
metal lid on the wall.

00:28:02.165 --> 00:28:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And I remember lifting it up
and calling the desk sergeant

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:07.276 align:middle line:84%
saying I saw a big ball
of fire or whatever.

00:28:07.276 --> 00:28:09.150 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's got to come
down to the east gate.

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:10.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be
down here by myself.

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:13.460 align:middle line:84%
I just saw this
huge ball of light

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.530 align:middle line:90%
just disappear into the forest.

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
thing I remember

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:18.540 align:middle line:90%
is Trementozzi being there.

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:19.740 align:middle line:90%
He was in police five.

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:21.120 align:middle line:90%
He came to my gate.

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And I remember we sat there
listening to the radio, which

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:28.230 align:middle line:84%
is a Motorola, as Bonnie,
Lieutenant Tamplin, Bonnie

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Tamplin talking to Sergeant
Bob Ball, Robert Ball.

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember
the fear in her voice.

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:36.000 align:middle line:90%
She was scared to death.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And she was just Bob,
Bob, where are you?

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:39.820 align:middle line:90%
I can't see anything.

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:41.590 align:middle line:90%
And she was so scared.

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:44.160 align:middle line:10%
And this was our Lieutenant.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.740 align:middle line:10%
They said it was just
Orford Lighthouse, which

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:50.060 align:middle line:10%
was ridiculous, because I
lived in Orford at the time.

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.006 align:middle line:10%
And then they said it was Mars.

00:28:52.006 --> 00:28:53.380 align:middle line:10%
What, do they
think we're stupid?

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.760 align:middle line:10%
You know, obviously
it was to shut us up

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.350 align:middle line:10%
and to cover it all up.

00:28:57.350 --> 00:29:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>> The big red sphere that Lori
saw and reported to central

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.460 align:middle line:84%
security control was
north of the base,

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:08.510 align:middle line:84%
a completely different direction
from the Orford Lighthouse that

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:10.580 align:middle line:90%
was to the east.

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And here is what that
pin point of light

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:17.180 align:middle line:84%
six miles to the east
and close to the horizon

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.670 align:middle line:90%
looked like from a farm field.

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:22.040 align:middle line:84%
No one could even
see the lighthouse

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:25.250 align:middle line:84%
through the thick
trees at the east gate.

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:29.090 align:middle line:10%
And yet, US and UK
counter-intelligence

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:33.830 align:middle line:10%
tried the preposterous lie that
all the bright, colorful lights

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:37.130 align:middle line:10%
and beams were only
the Orford Lighthouse.

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:39.230 align:middle line:10%
Other military law
enforcement people

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:43.120 align:middle line:10%
also saw unidentified colorful
strange lights that night

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:47.840 align:middle line:10%
of December 27, 1980,
including senior airman John

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.780 align:middle line:10%
Trementozzi in police five.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:54.620 align:middle line:10%
Airman Lori Buoen talked
to him at the east gate.

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The lights were
red, green, and white.

00:29:58.130 --> 00:29:59.930 align:middle line:90%
We notified the control tower.

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:01.730 align:middle line:90%
The lights were not blinking.

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:05.750 align:middle line:84%
There were three steady lights
and they'd be in one spot,

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:09.860 align:middle line:84%
then it would disappear, go
to another spot appear again.

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.900 align:middle line:90%
Go to another spot, appear.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.670 align:middle line:90%
And no noise.

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:14.810 align:middle line:90%
Very weird.

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:18.470 align:middle line:84%
We watched that probably
for a good hour and a half.

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Around 2:00 to 3:30 AM?

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>> We notified
our desk sergeant,

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:28.090 align:middle line:84%
who in turn notifies the
sergeant on duty, shift leader.

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:32.810 align:middle line:84%
The colonels were
notified, Colonel Halt.

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Colonel Charles Halt was
Deputy Base Commander at RAFT

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.500 align:middle line:84%
