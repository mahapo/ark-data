00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.200 align:middle line:10%
>> The first time that someone
tried to put the baffling

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.980 align:middle line:10%
puzzle pieces of other life in
the universe together for me

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.680 align:middle line:10%
in a more coherent
picture was October 1983.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.270 align:middle line:84%
That's when I was still
trying to go forward

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.390 align:middle line:84%
with the HBO project in spite of
government efforts to block me.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.890 align:middle line:84%
A Washington, D.C,
military source

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.770 align:middle line:84%
who claimed first
hand interaction

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.590 align:middle line:84%
with at least one
type of non-human

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.770 align:middle line:84%
agreed to talk with me off
the record about the type

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.410 align:middle line:84%
that he knew as extraterrestrial
biological entities, also known

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.330 align:middle line:90%
as EBENs.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.260 align:middle line:84%
He was aware that
on April, 9 1983,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.490 align:middle line:84%
at Kirtland Air Force Base I
was shown an alleged briefing

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.760 align:middle line:84%
document for an
unnamed US president.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And it said extraterrestrial
biological entities, or EBENs,

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.910 align:middle line:84%
had manipulated DNA in
already evolving primates

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.210 align:middle line:90%
to create homosapien.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.810 align:middle line:84%
The military source
told me that was true.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.630 align:middle line:84%
But he stressed that no one
in the American government

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.760 align:middle line:84%
with access to
that knowledge ever

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.630 align:middle line:84%
wanted to be alive if or when
such an announcement were

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.100 align:middle line:84%
broadcast to the world that
humans are someone else's

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.220 align:middle line:90%
experimental androids.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.550 align:middle line:84%
He told me that he had talk
firsthand with a US Air Force

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.210 align:middle line:84%
captain who received telepathic
communication from one

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.930 align:middle line:84%
non-human at a crash site
in the Roswell region.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.670 align:middle line:90%
He said 1949, not 1947.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Because the captain, more than
anyone else at the crash site,

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.440 align:middle line:84%
could clearly and receive
mind to mind communication

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.920 align:middle line:84%
from the non-human,
an EBEN, the captain

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.850 align:middle line:84%
was assigned to live with this
entity called EBE 1 at the Los

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Alamos Laboratory in
New Mexico until EBE

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.400 align:middle line:84%
died of unknown causes
on June 18, 1952.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.520 align:middle line:84%
That Air Force captain said
one of the most important

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.290 align:middle line:84%
transmissions that he ever
received from this EBEN was,

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.380 align:middle line:90%
quote, we made you.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.730 align:middle line:90%
We put you here on Earth.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.910 align:middle line:90%
But you have to live it.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.710 align:middle line:90%
Close quote.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.540 align:middle line:10%
I typed up notes after the
October 18, 1983, meeting

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.150 align:middle line:10%
that began with this
military source talking

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.880 align:middle line:10%
about information
gained from EBE 1

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.450 align:middle line:10%
and another captured
being called EBE 2.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Here are some brief excerpts
from my October 1983 notes

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.020 align:middle line:90%
in Washington, D.C.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.630 align:middle line:10%
October 18.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.920 align:middle line:90%
EBE 2.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Trying to teach human scientists
about their EBEN technology.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.960 align:middle line:84%
They use a completely different
set of physical laws than ours.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Our physics would not apply
in their civilization,

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.820 align:middle line:90%
but there's can apply in ours.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.210 align:middle line:84%
They, the EBENs, travel
interdimensionally

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.330 align:middle line:84%
many times faster than
the speed of light,

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.800 align:middle line:84%
like the corner of a napkin
folded to its opposite corner.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.320 align:middle line:84%
There are many
dimensions, two of which

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.260 align:middle line:84%
we might relate to but at least
a dozen dimensions we would not

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.790 align:middle line:90%
relate to.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.160 align:middle line:90%
All EBENs look alike.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Their society is worldwide on
a planet in the Zeta Reticuli

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.350 align:middle line:84%
binary solar system about
39 light years from Earth.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.650 align:middle line:90%
Hive minds, all telepathic.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.210 align:middle line:90%
Leaders are for life.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Even though they look
pretty much the same,

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.050 align:middle line:84%
there are personality
differences.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.280 align:middle line:84%
The EBENs brought five
different humanoid species,

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.990 align:middle line:90%
he said to me.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.320 align:middle line:84%
Juvenile delinquents,
possibly, from somewhere else

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.250 align:middle line:84%
in the cosmos to this planet
Earth a long time ago.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Our whole planet is a
sociological experiment,

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.500 align:middle line:90%
according to this whistleblower.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.630 align:middle line:84%
That's why the EBENs persist
in the so-called guardian

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.360 align:middle line:84%
rule versus the renegade blonde,
Swedes, Nordics, and other ET

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.320 align:middle line:90%
types.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Are their secret wars
ongoing to protect

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.820 align:middle line:84%
humans that are kept in
a state of ignorance?

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.330 align:middle line:84%
He said the problem is
if the EBENs go away

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.030 align:middle line:90%
from Earth, what will happen?

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.400 align:middle line:84%
They have a computer
base inside of our moon

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.090 align:middle line:84%
and throughout our
solar system, he said.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.490 align:middle line:84%
Is that sufficient
monitoring to keep

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.210 align:middle line:84%
the blonde Swedes, reptilians,
and others in check?

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.900 align:middle line:84%
He said the Swedes, quote,
have a large menagerie

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.370 align:middle line:84%
of cloned biological
entities, close quote, which

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.890 align:middle line:90%
do work for them everywhere.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.190 align:middle line:10%
He talked to me about the
presidents and what they knew.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.890 align:middle line:10%
He said Truman, 1945 to 1953,
knew everything at the time.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:31.200 align:middle line:10%
And then Ike, 1953 to
1961, knew everything,

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.480 align:middle line:10%
but put a lid on it.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.190 align:middle line:10%
Then came Kennedy, 1961 to 1963.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.540 align:middle line:10%
He wanted to tell the whole
world about the alien presence

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.040 align:middle line:10%
and was killed in Dallas
on November 22, 1963,

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.950 align:middle line:10%
for trying to open up the truth.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.910 align:middle line:10%
LBJ, 1963 to '69.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.150 align:middle line:10%
He did not want to know
because he heard rumors

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.000 align:middle line:10%
about what happened to Kennedy.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.850 align:middle line:10%
Nixon, 1969 to 1974.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.420 align:middle line:10%
Knew and bragged about
his inside knowledge

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.760 align:middle line:10%
to friends, showed
Jackie Gleason

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:10%
some retrieved craft
and ET bodies preserved

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.230 align:middle line:10%
in tubes hanging on walls
underground at an Eglin Air

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.980 align:middle line:10%
Force Base near Fort
Walton Beach, Florida.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.720 align:middle line:90%
Ford, 1974 to 1977.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.310 align:middle line:84%
The whistleblower
said he did not

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.940 align:middle line:84%
know if he was ever
briefed on anything.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.200 align:middle line:10%
Jimmy Carter, 1977 to 1981.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.960 align:middle line:10%
Briefed in 1976 and again
later on, but decided the story

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.690 align:middle line:10%
was too big to deal with.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.370 align:middle line:10%
Ronald Reagan 1981 to 1989.

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.410 align:middle line:10%
He was briefed
during the campaign

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:53.760 align:middle line:10%
because he was so pro-military
that MJ12 wanted to quiet him

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:59.310 align:middle line:10%
down a little, and then he
was briefed in March 1981

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.825 align:middle line:10%
after the election by
CIA director with CIA,

00:07:02.825 --> 00:07:07.990 align:middle line:10%
DIA, NSA, and NRO
advisors present.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And about that
word, reincarnation,

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:19.170 align:middle line:84%
he said that the EBENs described
this, quote, only so many souls

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.070 align:middle line:84%
are allowed per
planet, close quote.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.840 align:middle line:84%
They are recycled constantly
at birth and death.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.230 align:middle line:90%
But why?

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:32.190 align:middle line:84%
After that conversation,
I didn't know who to trust

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.160 align:middle line:90%
or what to believe in 1983.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.940 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't do anything public
with this Washington D.C.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.220 align:middle line:90%
Military sources of information.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Then a decade later, an alleged
1950s government document

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:49.240 align:middle line:90%
was leaked on March 7, 1994.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.240 align:middle line:90%
This is its title.

is strictly forbidden and is
punishable by federal law.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Since the US war
office was transitioned

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.110 align:middle line:84%
to the US Department of the Army
under the Department of Defense

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:47.850 align:middle line:84%
in 1949, the implication is
that this SUM 1-01 Training

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:51.510 align:middle line:84%
Manual for Extraterrestrial
Entities and Technology

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Recovery and Disposal was
first produced before 1949

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.420 align:middle line:90%
and updated in April 1954.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.690 align:middle line:84%
The unofficial leak of
this SUM 1-01 manual

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.410 align:middle line:84%
started at a La Crosse,
Wisconsin, pharmacy

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.980 align:middle line:84%
pages of text and
drawings showed up

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.710 align:middle line:84%
on 35 millimeter
negative film addressed

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:18.630 align:middle line:84%
to Don Berliner at the Fund
for UFO Research in Maryland.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:24.960 align:middle line:84%
The film was in an envelope
postmarked March 7, 1994.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Don Berliner gave Bob Wood,
an aerospace engineer retiring

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.230 align:middle line:84%
from McDonnell
Douglas, permission

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.960 align:middle line:84%
to print the
negatives for study.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.800 align:middle line:84%
The first negative frame
was the SUM 1-01 cover.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:43.450 align:middle line:84%
Then, on page 6 of the training

EBE Type 1.

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:54.070 align:middle line:84%
These entities are
humanoid and might

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:57.610 align:middle line:84%
be mistaken for human
beings of the Oriental race

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:59.890 align:middle line:90%
if seen from a distance.

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:03.280 align:middle line:84%
They are bipedal, five feet
to five feet four inches

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.880 align:middle line:84%
in height, and weigh
80 to 100 pounds.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Proportionally, they
are similar to humans,

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:13.300 align:middle line:84%
although the cranium is somewhat
larger and more rounded.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.670 align:middle line:10%
The skin is a pale,
chalky, yellow in color,

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:19.570 align:middle line:10%
thick and slightly
pebbled in appearance.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:24.220 align:middle line:84%
This was odd to read because the
gray EBENs and other gray types

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.650 align:middle line:84%
are not described by
people, let's say,

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:29.350 align:middle line:84%
in the human abduction
or a whistleblower

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.170 align:middle line:90%
or as chalky yellow in color.

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Is this yet another
type or something

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.830 align:middle line:84%
related to the
metabolism of the EBENs?

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:41.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm now showing a
charcoal illustration

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.680 align:middle line:84%
that a government whistleblower
told me, quote, is almost

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:48.190 align:middle line:84%
like a photograph of an
EBEN, the acronym the US

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:51.370 align:middle line:84%
government uses for
extraterrestrial biological

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:52.660 align:middle line:90%
entities.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:58.000 align:middle line:84%
The SUM 1-01 manual continues,
quote, the eyes are small,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.320 align:middle line:84%
wide set, almond-shaped,
with brownish black irises

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.450 align:middle line:90%
with very large pupils.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:07.450 align:middle line:84%
The whites of the eyes are
not like that of humans,

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:09.790 align:middle line:90%
but have a pale gray cast.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:13.030 align:middle line:84%
The ears are small and
set low on the skull.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:15.730 align:middle line:84%
The nose is thin and
long and the mouth

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:19.300 align:middle line:84%
is wider than in humans
and nearly lipless.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:23.080 align:middle line:84%
There is no apparent facial
hair and very little body hair,

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.170 align:middle line:84%
that being very fine and
confined to the under

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:28.610 align:middle line:90%
arm and the groin area.

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:32.170 align:middle line:84%
The body is thin and
without apparent body fat,

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:34.450 align:middle line:84%
but the muscles
are well-developed.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:37.270 align:middle line:84%
The hands are small
with four long digits

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.000 align:middle line:90%
but no opposable thumb.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.820 align:middle line:84%
The outside digit is
jointed in a manner

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.460 align:middle line:84%
as to be nearly
opposable and there

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:51.100 align:middle line:84%
is no webbing between the
fingers as there is in humans.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.280 align:middle line:84%
The legs are slightly
but noticeably bowed

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.350 align:middle line:84%
and the feet are somewhat
splayed and proportionally

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:58.630 align:middle line:90%
large.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:02.695 align:middle line:84%
A second type on page 6 of
the SUM 1-01 manual states,

00:12:02.695 --> 00:12:04.840 align:middle line:90%
EBA Type 2.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.470 align:middle line:84%
These smaller entities are
humanoid but differ from Type 1

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.150 align:middle line:90%
in many respects.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.700 align:middle line:10%
They are bipedal,
three feet five inches

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.860 align:middle line:10%
to four feet two
inches in height,

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.370 align:middle line:10%
and weigh 25 to 50 pounds.

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:22.630 align:middle line:10%
Proportionally, the head is much
larger than humans or Type 1

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:27.610 align:middle line:10%
EBEs the cranium being
much larger and elongated.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:31.090 align:middle line:84%
The eyes are very large,
slanted, and nearly wrap

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.220 align:middle line:90%
around the side of the skull.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.830 align:middle line:84%
They are black with
no white showing.

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.560 align:middle line:84%
There is no
noticeable brow ridge

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.590 align:middle line:84%
and the skull has a slight
peak that runs over the crown.

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:47.500 align:middle line:84%
The nose consists of only two
small slits, which sit high

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.810 align:middle line:90%
above the slit-like mouth.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.210 align:middle line:90%
There are no external ears.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:55.450 align:middle line:84%
The skin is a pale
bluish gray color,

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.270 align:middle line:84%
being somewhat darker on
the back of the creature,

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:01.060 align:middle line:84%
and is very smooth
and fine celled.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.540 align:middle line:84%
There is no hair on either
the face or the body

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:08.470 align:middle line:84%
and these creatures do not
appear to be mammalian.

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:11.890 align:middle line:84%
The arms are long in
proportion to the legs

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:16.700 align:middle line:84%
and the hands have three long
tapering fingers and a thumb,

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.800 align:middle line:84%
which is nearly as
long as the fingers.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.080 align:middle line:84%
The second finger is
thicker than the other,

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.050 align:middle line:84%
but not as long as
the index finger.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:28.020 align:middle line:84%
The feet are small and
narrow and four toes

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.220 align:middle line:84%
are joined together
inside a membrane.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Would a membrane
around four toes

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.810 align:middle line:84%
explain tracks at
animal mutilation sites

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:39.530 align:middle line:84%
where ranchers and
law enforcement

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:43.460 align:middle line:84%
have described hoof-like
tracks or ice cream

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.470 align:middle line:90%
cone shaped tracks?

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:49.100 align:middle line:10%
It is not definitely known
where either type of creature

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:52.400 align:middle line:10%
originated, but it seems
certain that they did not

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.840 align:middle line:10%
evolve on Earth.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.660 align:middle line:10%
It is further evident,
although not certain,

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.640 align:middle line:10%
that they may have
originated on two

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.800 align:middle line:10%
different planets, close quote.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is from the SUM
1-01 training manual.

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:09.320 align:middle line:84%
Today I can add the probability
that EBE 1 types genetically

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:15.050 align:middle line:84%
manufactured EBE type 2s
to do work on this planet.

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:17.090 align:middle line:84%
That means abductees
have usually

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:22.220 align:middle line:84%
been handled by the small large
black eyed little guys, not

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:25.460 align:middle line:84%
the prime EBEN intelligence
behind the genetically

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:29.720 align:middle line:84%
cloned biological
entities or androids.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:34.400 align:middle line:84%
The concept of cloned biological
entities of various types made

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.820 align:middle line:84%
by EBENs and other
extraterrestrial types

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:41.600 align:middle line:84%
has emerged in more
details about five

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.560 align:middle line:84%
different non-human
species, allegedly presented

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:50.530 align:middle line:84%
in a briefing for US
President Ronald Reagan.

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:53.980 align:middle line:84%
This Release 27a,
Reagan Briefing,

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:57.130 align:middle line:84%
was included in a
series of 35 reports

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:02.740 align:middle line:84%
from 2005 to 2007
posted in order, quote,

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:05.380 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate the
gradual release

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.990 align:middle line:84%
of confidential
documents pertaining

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:13.720 align:middle line:84%
to a top secret exchange program
of 12 US military personnel

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.920 align:middle line:84%
to Serpo, a planet
of Zeta Reticuli.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And this happened between
the years 1965 to 1978.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:26.620 align:middle line:84%
The information began
to be released on 2

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:30.640 align:middle line:84%
November 2005 by a
retired senior official

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:35.560 align:middle line:84%
within the United States
Defense Intelligence Agency.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.290 align:middle line:90%
He calls himself Anonymous.

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Until he chooses to
make his name known,

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.440 align:middle line:84%
this is the way he will
be represented here.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.740 align:middle line:84%
Anonymous reports that he
is not acting individually

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:51.160 align:middle line:84%
and is part of a group
of six DIA personnel

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.300 align:middle line:84%
working together as an alliance
of three current and three

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:59.620 align:middle line:84%
former defense intelligence
agency employees.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:04.480 align:middle line:84%
He is their chief
spokesman, close quote.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.880 align:middle line:84%
The following
excerpts are allegedly

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.760 align:middle line:84%
from a transcript
of a tape recording

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:13.210 align:middle line:84%
made at Camp David, Maryland,
for President Ronald Reagan

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:17.920 align:middle line:84%
on March 6 and March 8
1981 about the subject

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.820 align:middle line:84%
of, quote, unidentified
flying objects

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:26.590 align:middle line:84%
and extraterrestrial visitation
of Earth, close quote.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Leading the discussion was
CIA director William Casey,

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:36.160 align:middle line:84%
along with the CIA advisors and
a caretaker of the ET history.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Casey was Reagan's
campaign manager in 1980,

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:43.540 align:middle line:84%
and then President Reagan asked
Casey to become CIA director

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:47.090 align:middle line:90%
from 1981 to 1987.

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:51.670 align:middle line:84%
That means this briefing,
March 6 to 8, 1981,

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:54.640 align:middle line:84%
was only two months
after Ronald Reagan first

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:59.170 align:middle line:84%
took office on January 20,
1981, as President of the United

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:00.580 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:04.030 align:middle line:84%
I begin with excerpts from
the presidential briefing

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:07.700 align:middle line:84%
as the anonymous caretaker
speaks to President Reagan.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.300 align:middle line:84%
Quote, the United
States of America

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.089 align:middle line:84%
has been visited by
extraterrestrial visitors

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:15.230 align:middle line:90%
since 1947.

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:18.369 align:middle line:84%
We have proof of
that, close quote.

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:22.569 align:middle line:84%
My own note is that the
truth about crashes,

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:26.430 align:middle line:84%
that we appear to have a
history of a crash retrieval

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:29.020 align:middle line:84%
six years before
Roswell events and that

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:33.190 align:middle line:84%
was in Cape Girardeau, Missouri,
allegedly in the first part

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:37.150 align:middle line:84%
of 1941 and discussed
in leaked Majestic

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:40.840 align:middle line:84%
12 documents, from which a
quote, neutronic propulsion

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.870 align:middle line:84%
device was retrieved
and later delivered

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:46.480 align:middle line:84%
to Robert Oppenheimer
when he began work

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.360 align:middle line:84%
at Los Alamos, New
Mexico, to produce

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.660 align:middle line:90%
the first American atomic bomb.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.450 align:middle line:84%
The caretaker says,
however, we also

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.700 align:middle line:84%
have some proof that
Earth has been visited

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:01.240 align:middle line:84%
for many thousands of
years by various races

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.760 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrial visitors.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:08.260 align:middle line:84%
Mr. President, I'll just refer
to those visitors as ETs.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:13.690 align:middle line:84%
In July 1947, a remarkable
event occurred in New Mexico.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:17.860 align:middle line:84%
During a storm, two
ET spacecraft crashed.

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:22.330 align:middle line:84%
One crashed southwest of Corona,
New Mexico, and one crash

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:24.520 align:middle line:90%
near Datil, New Mexico.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.100 align:middle line:84%
The US Army eventually
found both sites

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.950 align:middle line:84%
and recovered all of the
debris and one live alien.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:35.050 align:middle line:84%
I'll refer to this
live alien as EBE 1.

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:36.760 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Do we have codes or a
special terminology for this,

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:42.220 align:middle line:90%
President Reagan asked.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Mr. President, EBE means
extraterrestrial biological

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.220 align:middle line:90%
entity.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.500 align:middle line:84%
It was a code designated
to this creature

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.440 align:middle line:84%
by the US Army
back in those days.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.020 align:middle line:84%
This creature was
not human and we

00:18:56.020 --> 00:19:00.160 align:middle line:84%
had to decide on a term for
it, so scientists designated

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.650 align:middle line:90%
the creature as EBE 1.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:05.800 align:middle line:90%
We also referred to it as Noah.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.870 align:middle line:84%
There was different
terminology used

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:11.350 align:middle line:84%
by various aspects of the
US military and intelligence

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:13.000 align:middle line:90%
community back then.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.710 align:middle line:90%
Can we classify them?

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:17.740 align:middle line:84%
Can we connect them
with anything earthly?

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:19.420 align:middle line:90%
No, Mr. President.

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:22.600 align:middle line:84%
They don't have any similar
characteristics of a human,

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:27.160 align:middle line:84%
with the exception that they
have eyes, ears, and a mouth.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Their internal body
organs are different,

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.500 align:middle line:84%
their skin is entirely
different from human.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:37.820 align:middle line:84%
We could not classify any part
of the aliens with humans.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:41.230 align:middle line:84%
They had blood and skin,
although considerably different

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:42.820 align:middle line:90%
than human skin.

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Their eyes had two
different eyelids, probably

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:48.400 align:middle line:84%
because their home
planet was very bright.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.210 align:middle line:10%
Is time the same on
their planet as on ours?

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:53.740 align:middle line:10%
No, Mr. President.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:57.800 align:middle line:10%
Time is very different on the
EBEN planet, which, by the way,

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.380 align:middle line:10%
we call Serpo.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:04.750 align:middle line:84%
When you look in Latin and
you find the word S-E-R-P-O,

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:08.980 align:middle line:84%
it means to creep or crawl,
perhaps they meant like

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:10.660 align:middle line:90%
a snake.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Their day is
approximately 40 hours.

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.820 align:middle line:84%
That is measured by the
movement of their two suns.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.330 align:middle line:84%
The solar system
containing Serpo

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:23.770 align:middle line:84%
is a binary star system, two
suns rather than the one sun

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:25.870 align:middle line:90%
like our solar system.

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:30.130 align:middle line:10%
The distance from Earth to
Serpo is about 40 light years.

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:34.870 align:middle line:84%
They can travel that in about
nine months of our time.

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:38.050 align:middle line:84%
I am no scientist, but
as I mentioned earlier

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.390 align:middle line:84%
they can travel
that great distance

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:44.140 align:middle line:90%
by means of space tunnels.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.200 align:middle line:84%
They seem to be able to
bend the distance from one

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.600 align:middle line:90%
point in space to another.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Just how they do this must
be explained scientifically.

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.530 align:middle line:90%
Are they all friendly?

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:57.730 align:middle line:90%
Adviser number one.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Mr. President, that is a very
difficult question to answer.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:04.150 align:middle line:84%
There are many
parameters that we

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:07.700 align:middle line:90%
follow to evaluate the threat.

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:11.020 align:middle line:84%
However, we have
little intelligence

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.330 align:middle line:90%
on four of the five visitors.

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:16.510 align:middle line:84%
We have plenty of
intel on the EBENs.

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.910 align:middle line:84%
They've given us
everything we've asked for.

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.490 align:middle line:84%
They have also helped us to
understand the other four

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:23.140 align:middle line:90%
species.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:24.655 align:middle line:10%
I'm afraid to say,
Mr. President--

00:21:24.655 --> 00:21:29.290 align:middle line:10%
and please don't
misunderstand my words--

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:34.510 align:middle line:10%
but we think one of the
species is very hostile.

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:37.440 align:middle line:10%
William Casey, CIA Director.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.630 align:middle line:10%
Mr. President, we
have intelligence

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:44.620 align:middle line:10%
that would indicate this
one species of aliens

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.740 align:middle line:10%
have abducted people from Earth.

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:50.290 align:middle line:10%
They have performed
scientific and medical tests

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:51.700 align:middle line:10%
on these humans.

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:56.710 align:middle line:10%
To the best of our knowledge,
no humans have been killed.

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:59.410 align:middle line:10%
But as adviser
number one stated,

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:01.540 align:middle line:10%
the intelligence
is from witnesses

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:05.710 align:middle line:10%
and we haven't thoroughly
evaluated this intelligence.

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:10.060 align:middle line:84%
We have captured one of
these hostile aliens.

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:14.860 align:middle line:84%
This gets into some very, very
sensitive areas, Mr. President.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.830 align:middle line:84%
I strongly suggest we
end this discussion

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and move on to any further
questions that you might have

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.350 align:middle line:90%
and then get back to this.

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:26.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we are
prepared to provide you

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.810 align:middle line:84%
with accurate answers
to your questions

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:32.890 align:middle line:84%
about the potentially
hostile aliens at this time.

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:34.710 align:middle line:90%
Close quote.

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:40.010 align:middle line:90%
And that was March 6 to 8 1981.

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:42.800 align:middle line:84%
President Reagan
said, OK, but expect

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.810 align:middle line:84%
this to be given to me
as soon as possible.

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:48.950 align:middle line:84%
I want to know everything
about these hostile creatures.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:52.250 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, we should
start forming policies

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:54.650 align:middle line:90%
on how to deal with them.

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Advisor number one, do we have
operational war plans on this?

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Adviser number one,
yes, Mr. President.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:07.670 align:middle line:84%
We have war plans on
all potential threats

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:08.900 align:middle line:90%
to our country.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:14.520 align:middle line:84%
William Casey, OK, give the
president the names, caretaker.

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.100 align:middle line:90%
OK, thank you, Mr. President.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:21.270 align:middle line:10%
The five non-human
species are called

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:29.790 align:middle line:10%
EBENs, Arkaloids, Quadloids,
Heplaloids, and trantaloids.

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:33.090 align:middle line:84%
These names were given
to the alien species

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:38.740 align:middle line:84%
by the intelligence community,
specifically by MJ 5.

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.580 align:middle line:90%
The EBENs are friendly.

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:45.670 align:middle line:84%
The trantaloids are
the dangerous ones.

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:49.090 align:middle line:84%
We call a hostile
aliens simply that, HAV,

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:52.310 align:middle line:90%
meaning hostile alien visitors.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:58.060 align:middle line:84%
MJ 12 placed that code on them
back as early in the 1950s.

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:01.370 align:middle line:90%
A note about MJ 5.

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:04.770 align:middle line:84%
A member of Majestical
or Majority 12,

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:07.970 align:middle line:84%
also known as MJ
12, is this group

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.960 align:middle line:84%
that was originally
organized in September 1947

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:16.880 align:middle line:84%
after the July 1947 Roswell
and other UFO crash incidents.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.160 align:middle line:84%
That's when President
Harry Truman organized

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:23.660 align:middle line:84%
MJ 12 as a secret committee of
scientists, military leaders,

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.940 align:middle line:84%
businessmen, and
government officials

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:29.510 align:middle line:84%
under an executive order
to monitor and analyze

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:33.830 align:middle line:84%
the interactions of non-human
intelligences with Earth

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:38.690 align:middle line:84%
and to organize back engineering
of advanced ET technologies

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:42.290 align:middle line:90%
retrieved from downed ET craft.

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:46.250 align:middle line:84%
In the briefing President
Ronald Reagan said,

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:52.340 align:middle line:84%
you mean to say these HAVs have
been visiting us and kidnapping

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:56.210 align:middle line:90%
our people since the 1950s?

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:59.580 align:middle line:84%
William Casey--
Mr. President, we

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:02.040 align:middle line:84%
have some indication
that they might

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:05.310 align:middle line:84%
have been doing
this for some time,

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:09.360 align:middle line:84%
but we can be sure that the
EBENs have never done this.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.090 align:middle line:84%
They are extremely
peaceful and they would not

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:16.170 align:middle line:84%
harm a living soul, including
animals, close quote.

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:20.520 align:middle line:84%
In contrast to what the CIA
director told President Reagan,

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.760 align:middle line:84%
this can't be a true
statement about the EBENs

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.210 align:middle line:84%
because it was EBENs that
abducted the Colorado

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:32.950 align:middle line:84%
couple from the Longmont
Highway in November of 1980.

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:34.860 align:middle line:90%
President Reagan, my God.

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Just knowing we have names
for these things is amazing.

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:41.010 align:middle line:90%
Which one did we capture?

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:45.300 align:middle line:84%
William Casey-- well, Mr.
President, we have a trantaloid

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.430 align:middle line:90%
but it is dead.

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:52.920 align:middle line:84%
We captured it in 1961 in Canada
and we had it in captivity

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:56.470 align:middle line:90%
until 1962 when it died.

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:58.780 align:middle line:90%
Adviser number one--

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Mr. President, these hostile
aliens are pretty sneaky.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.560 align:middle line:84%
They seem to appear
and disappear,

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.640 align:middle line:84%
which is beyond our
technical understanding.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:13.900 align:middle line:84%
They also seem to
float or defy gravity.

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:17.050 align:middle line:84%
We have actual photographs
of them doing this.

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:19.150 align:middle line:84%
We have a classic
abduction incident

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:22.810 align:middle line:84%
that was recorded by military
intelligence personnel.

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:26.920 align:middle line:84%
It happened in 1979
near a military base.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.870 align:middle line:90%
President Reagan-- where?

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:33.150 align:middle line:84%
Adviser number
one-- in New Mexico.

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:36.920 align:middle line:84%
The caretaker, New Mexico
is similar to the home

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.650 align:middle line:90%
planet of the EBENs.

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:42.680 align:middle line:84%
I now understand that
the EBENs originally

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:47.180 align:middle line:84%
come from a desert-like planet
in the binary G2 solar system

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Zeta 1 and 2 Reticuli,
and this is information

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:53.000 align:middle line:84%
that comes from abductees
I've interviewed

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.040 align:middle line:84%
and from other
government whistleblowers

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.950 align:middle line:84%
and this is what they're
talking about right now

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:00.590 align:middle line:84%
in this briefing with
President Reagan.

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Those binary suns are very
similar to our own yellow sun.

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And they say to
President Reagan, quote,

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:14.060 align:middle line:84%
since we do not know which
planet the trantaloids came

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:15.500 align:middle line:90%
from--

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.450 align:middle line:84%
and then the caretaker
is interrupted

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:19.520 align:middle line:90%
by advisor number four.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Adviser number four
says, I think we do.

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:26.120 align:middle line:84%
I think the EBENs gave
us that information.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.845 align:middle line:90%
We know the star group.

00:27:27.845 --> 00:27:31.910 align:middle line:84%
It is close to our solar
system in astronomical terms,

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:34.710 align:middle line:84%
maybe ten and a half
light years away.

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:40.790 align:middle line:84%
It's on the third planet of the
Epsilon Eridani solar system.

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:44.930 align:middle line:84%
It's the trantaloids, and
they are actually closer to us

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:48.490 align:middle line:90%
than the EBENs are.

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Epsilon Eridani on the left
is an orange dwarf star

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:55.570 align:middle line:84%
in the constellation
Eridanus, a cooler,

00:27:55.570 --> 00:28:01.840 align:middle line:84%
fainter K2V solar spectrum
compared to our G2V sun.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:05.920 align:middle line:84%
At 10.5 light years from
Earth, Epsilon Eridani

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.470 align:middle line:84%
is in a multiple
star system and has

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:14.560 align:middle line:84%
an estimated 82% of our sun's
mass on the right and 74%

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:20.530 align:middle line:84%
of our sun's radius, but only
34% of our sun's luminosity.

Our sun is much brighter.

The Reagan briefing indicates
the third planet in the Epsilon

Eridani solar system
is the home of

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:39.700 align:middle line:90%
the hostile insect trantaloids.

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Epsilon Eridani has a large
ring Jupiter-like gaseous planet

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:50.440 align:middle line:84%
called Epsilon Eridani B and
probable second rocky planet

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:54.580 align:middle line:84%
called Epsilon Eridani
C. And it might even

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:59.290 align:middle line:84%
have a third distant planet
in one of two asteroid belts.

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:11.980 align:middle line:84%
In the lower left of our solar

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:14.440 align:middle line:90%
also underlined in red.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Not far from Epsilon Eridani
is Tau Ceti, underlined in red.

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.090 align:middle line:10%
And Tau Ceti has been
referenced by people

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:26.320 align:middle line:10%
in the human abduction
syndrome as a solar system also

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.540 align:middle line:10%
containing humanoid life.

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:32.620 align:middle line:10%
When astronomers Frank
Drake and Carl Sagan in 1960

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.810 align:middle line:10%
first started to look
for radio signals

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:37.870 align:middle line:10%
from intelligent
extraterrestrials,

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:39.820 align:middle line:10%
they turned their
radio telescope

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:44.080 align:middle line:10%
on both Epsilon
Eridani and Tau Ceti,

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.420 align:middle line:10%
but no signals were found then.

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:49.240 align:middle line:10%
President Reagan's
1981 briefers would

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.600 align:middle line:10%
say that is because
SETI was looking

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:57.940 align:middle line:10%
in the wrong frequencies or
the very advanced trantaloids

00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:02.420 align:middle line:10%
have a way to
cloak their planet.

Was this Astronomy Magazine
cover in December 2007

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:10.070 align:middle line:10%
another leak from government
intelligence sources

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:12.950 align:middle line:10%
trying to condition
the public that there

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:17.300 align:middle line:10%
is other life in our galaxy
and beyond because they already

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:19.790 align:middle line:10%
know about the dangerous
trantaloids insect

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:24.740 align:middle line:10%
beings on a planet in the
Epsilon Eridani solar system?

extraterrestrial groups that

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:35.120 align:middle line:84%
