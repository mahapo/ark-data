>> With me today, on this
"Truth Hunter" special, is Tim,

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.610 align:middle line:10%
a tactical advisor to covert
German analysts trying

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.720 align:middle line:10%
to understand the missions
and strategies of non-human

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.090 align:middle line:10%
intelligences on our planet, in
this solar system, and beyond.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Tim, welcome to "Truth
Hunters" and this special.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Linda.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, one of the most popular
questions that comes to me

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.050 align:middle line:84%
in our files are from people
who say, this is a big universe,

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.480 align:middle line:84%
13.8 billion light years,
and there are people who talk

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.270 align:middle line:84%
as if they are just walking
out to go to the store,

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.120 align:middle line:84%
and they're on
another solar system.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.230 align:middle line:84%
But there is something called
the Alcubierre warp drive,

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.390 align:middle line:90%
and it is serious physics.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And from people who
have talked to me,

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.730 align:middle line:84%
who have military
connections, they

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.890 align:middle line:90%
say we do have a Space Force.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.870 align:middle line:84%
It is secretly out in 22
solar systems right now,

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.230 align:middle line:84%
and that a couple
of times, we've

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.750 align:middle line:84%
even been to Andromeda with
the help of other non-humans.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.090 align:middle line:84%
What is the truth, from your
point of view, about how humans

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.720 align:middle line:84%
are going with ETs,
moving point to point,

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.900 align:middle line:84%
and getting from here
out several light years,

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.940 align:middle line:84%
in maybe an Earth
day or two or three?

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:41.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.940 align:middle line:84%
There are about 15 ways
that repeat itself where--

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.640 align:middle line:84%
how intergalactic
species travel.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.910 align:middle line:84%
One of the easiest
ways to do that

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.090 align:middle line:84%
is through a jump
gate, which is either

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.290 align:middle line:84%
a natural occurring portal
or a artificially set

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.039 align:middle line:84%
up portal in order to connect
two points of the universe.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.120 align:middle line:84%
The underlying physics is that
everything in the universe

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.330 align:middle line:84%
is, on one scale, only
one point of existence

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.340 align:middle line:84%
that is connected to any
other points in all existence.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.770 align:middle line:84%
With that being said, if you
are only one point of existence,

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.100 align:middle line:84%
you can basically
shift the positioning

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.370 align:middle line:84%
of where you are through
that one point field.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.190 align:middle line:84%
So this is basically how a
lot of the transportation

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.230 align:middle line:84%
in the universe
is working, which

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.320 align:middle line:84%
means opening up a
natural portal that

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.450 align:middle line:84%
uses the one-point field in
order to connect these two.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.500 align:middle line:84%
There are several more,
like you could also

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.100 align:middle line:84%
take two different
points in the universe,

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.580 align:middle line:84%
and through a kind of
wormhole situation,

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.510 align:middle line:84%
limit the space that is between
two points of the universe.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.450 align:middle line:84%
So if you have one
point, let's say,

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.770 align:middle line:84%
here, and you have one point in
100 light years away from here,

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.440 align:middle line:84%
you connect those two points
and fold the space inside of it

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.890 align:middle line:90%
to a very dense degree.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And then those two points,
that are actually stretched out

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.970 align:middle line:84%
very far away, are suddenly
very close together,

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.460 align:middle line:84%
and you can go from
one point to another.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Basically, you still
have a distance.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.250 align:middle line:84%
If you connect through the
one-point field, then the field

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.780 align:middle line:90%
itself is the same point.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.905 align:middle line:90%
So you don't have distance.

00:03:49.905 --> 00:03:52.770 align:middle line:90%
It's just the same point.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.100 align:middle line:84%
But if you fold the space
in between two points

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.740 align:middle line:84%
and bring them closer
together, it will take only,

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.230 align:middle line:84%
like, still, like a half
an hour or something

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.920 align:middle line:90%
to get through that two points.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.990 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't take
100 light years.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And there are always
references to space tunnels.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.579 align:middle line:90%
And the space tunnels--

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.540 align:middle line:84%
are they being applied
to both the shortening,

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.870 align:middle line:84%
or is it that there is
something about the structure

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.040 align:middle line:84%
of the universe itself and
the way magnetic fields run

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.650 align:middle line:84%
that there literally are
what we would consider

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.570 align:middle line:84%
to be magnetic field tunnels
that advanced species, know how

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.250 align:middle line:84%
to use to get through the
universe, the matter universe

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.250 align:middle line:90%
quickly?

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you have a
craft that, for example,

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.280 align:middle line:84%
where a circuit is
running around it,

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.080 align:middle line:84%
it creates an electrogravitical
force, which makes it easier.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.320 align:middle line:84%
It's not affected by
the gravitational force

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.600 align:middle line:84%
of outside things,
so it can even

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.750 align:middle line:84%
get into water or into
whatever you want.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.360 align:middle line:90%
So it makes itself--

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.640 align:middle line:84%
it creates its own
gravitational field.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you use
electromagnetic forces,

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.580 align:middle line:84%
which attract one
point to another,

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:22.930 align:middle line:84%
and then this allows a craft to
go 40,000 kilometers per hour.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I remember
Lou Elizondo,

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.270 align:middle line:10%
who was the Defense Intelligence
Agency director of Advanced

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.560 align:middle line:10%
Aerospace Threat Identification
program in the Pentagon,

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.020 align:middle line:10%
he has used as an example,
since the first opening up

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.810 align:middle line:10%
of the last few months,
that we have, on recordings,

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:53.650 align:middle line:10%
a UFO or UAP going 12,000 miles
an hour and stopping on a dime,

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.450 align:middle line:10%
unmoving--

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:55.670 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>> --and says, there's no human
that could withstand that kind

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:00.810 align:middle line:90%
of physics.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And there is no known
human aerospace company

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.980 align:middle line:90%
that has made such a vehicle.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.210 align:middle line:84%
So when we have that
kind of demonstration,

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.680 align:middle line:84%
how do you explain that in
kind of impossible physics?

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>> The craft itself creates a
gravitational field around it.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.580 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way--

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.700 align:middle line:84%
this planet, for example,
has a gravitational field.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, this planet is going
by 100,000 kilometers per hour

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.350 align:middle line:90%
or something through space.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same
way with a craft that

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.820 align:middle line:84%
has a gravitational
field, which means

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:46.440 align:middle line:84%
the people or the subjects
inside of the craft

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.880 align:middle line:84%
are not being affected
when the craft suddenly

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.820 align:middle line:84%
stops because normally, by
normal means of physics, that

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.540 align:middle line:84%
would mean that the forces
outside, by stopping, would

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.130 align:middle line:90%
affect--

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.060 align:middle line:90%
>> The internal.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, it would be
concentrated on the body that

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.530 align:middle line:84%
experienced these forces and
that would certainly bring

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.190 align:middle line:90%
people to-- break people.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Smash.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it would smash.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.860 align:middle line:84%
This is basically--
I mean, if you're

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:20.050 align:middle line:84%
thinking of some cartoons where
you have this girl falling down

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.830 align:middle line:84%
from a high tower or
something, and then Superman

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:29.410 align:middle line:84%
comes from down and catches
it, by normal means of physics,

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:33.910 align:middle line:84%
you would suddenly change
the vector of the forces,

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.790 align:middle line:84%
and that would immediately
destroy that girl that's

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:37.900 align:middle line:90%
falling down, you know.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>> But if there is a
gravitational field,

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.600 align:middle line:84%
it only operates
within this field.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's similar, or
you could compare it

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:52.540 align:middle line:84%
to the situation you have inside
of a plane, where the people

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.270 align:middle line:84%
inside of a plane
are basically not

00:07:55.270 --> 00:08:00.520 align:middle line:84%
affected by the speed that's
going on outside, just

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.530 align:middle line:90%
like a comparative situation.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>> In your one on one
with Greys, about 100,

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.470 align:middle line:84%
has any one of them been
when they have said, Tim,

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:15.040 align:middle line:84%
we're now going to take you in
a craft to a different solar

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.000 align:middle line:90%
system?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.490 align:middle line:90%
>> I've not been off planet.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Not off planet.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:23.530 align:middle line:84%
But have you been in a UFO
traveling in the skies other?

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:25.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.940 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting
thing is-- and I

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.600 align:middle line:84%
think this needs to be mentioned
because a lot of people

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.289 align:middle line:84%
think that these
kinds of travels

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:39.909 align:middle line:84%
are solely focused on
technology, which is not

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:42.640 align:middle line:84%
the case, because
when you develop

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.780 align:middle line:84%
your own psionic strength
well enough, then

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.150 align:middle line:84%
you do not need
technology in order

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.640 align:middle line:90%
to travel these distances.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're talking about
very advanced psionic features.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:00.820 align:middle line:84%
But if you understand
that yourself,

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:06.010 align:middle line:84%
your positioning of yourself,
is the same positioning

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:08.320 align:middle line:84%
of yourself somewhere
else, then it's

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:14.110 align:middle line:84%
just a willingful decision to
get suddenly and immediately

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:17.310 align:middle line:90%
from one place to another.

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:20.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe a dozen times
in the last 40 years,

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.120 align:middle line:84%
in interviewing people in
the abduction syndrome--

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.090 align:middle line:90%
not a lot, but a few--

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:32.850 align:middle line:84%
they will say, I was on
the terrace in Manhattan.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:35.220 align:middle line:90%
I was out looking at the moon.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.790 align:middle line:90%
It was midnight or 1 o'clock.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Suddenly, I don't know
what happened, Linda,

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:42.800 align:middle line:90%
but I'm moving.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm moving fast.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like I'm in some
sort of a translucent bubble.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And I can see stars,
and I'm moving,

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:55.630 align:middle line:84%
but it's just me and my
t-shirt and my jeans.

00:09:55.630 --> 00:10:00.730 align:middle line:84%
What is it that is surrounding
me and moving me through space?

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Interesting that
you brought that up.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:07.480 align:middle line:84%
There are two ways
to travel as a--

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:12.550 align:middle line:84%
under the power of
psionic abilities.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And psionic, for the
general lay audience,

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:23.410 align:middle line:84%
is being able to concentrate
in your mind's eye and energy.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:24.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.880 align:middle line:84%
>> On-- and how would
you fill in those blanks?

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.200 align:middle line:84%
What is it that a person would
most likely concentrate on

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:36.910 align:middle line:84%
to do something with
this energy of focus?

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And have you, yourself, done
an exercise with psionic energy

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.050 align:middle line:84%
that you could explain
what you've done,

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:45.950 align:middle line:84%
and people would
understand better?

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So the easiest explanation
or example for that would be you

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:57.220 align:middle line:84%
feel that your uncle,
whatever, is going to call you,

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.410 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly,
your telephone rings.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.150 align:middle line:90%
>> And we say that's intuition.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>> But there is a logic, a
psychological correlation

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:11.830 align:middle line:84%
between the occurence of the
telephone ringing and yourself

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:13.690 align:middle line:84%
being aware that
it's going to happen.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Like the mind, the psionic,
is picking up what is about

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.640 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's having an impact
on something physically

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:23.230 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Dogs have that very strongly.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.990 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a dog, for
example, and you stay...

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:30.040 align:middle line:90%
something at the...

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.500 align:middle line:84%
whatever-- your office
or something-- and you--

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:37.020 align:middle line:84%
the moment, the very moment you
return to your home, cameras

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.850 align:middle line:84%
show that the dogs suddenly
stand up and go to the door.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:41.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, they know.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>> They know because
they're-- and they rely--

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:49.810 align:middle line:84%
their species, the way that--
the relationship between dogs

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:54.250 align:middle line:84%
and humans work is that
they rely on their psionics

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.240 align:middle line:84%
in order to understand
the human better.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.900 align:middle line:10%
>> And this goes to Stuart
Hameroff and Roger Penrose

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:05.800 align:middle line:10%
having a hypothesis
because in 2014,

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.260 align:middle line:10%
it was found that there
were microscopic--

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:13.630 align:middle line:10%
microtubules are what they're
called-- in the human brain.

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And they think they are
there to do vibration

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.460 align:middle line:90%
with the universal fabric.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And that is the first
time that they--

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:28.750 align:middle line:84%
I would say that there's been
in a peer reviewed journal,

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.910 align:middle line:84%
a discussion that
there could literally

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:34.480 align:middle line:84%
be a part of the
human brain made

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.870 align:middle line:84%
to interact in a
vibratory frequency

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:40.810 align:middle line:90%
way with the universe.

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Inside of your eyes as well.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you are from a
biological scientific

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:45.880 align:middle line:90%
background, right?

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so you know there
are cones inside of the eye.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>> A cone is something that
accelerates a wavelength.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So basically, human eyes
are made in order to bring

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.300 align:middle line:84%
the frequencies into
an accelerated speed.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:06.920 align:middle line:84%
So if someone trains that and
uses those cones correctly,

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.930 align:middle line:84%
it can be also used in order
to transmit wavelengths

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:12.250 align:middle line:90%
into your surrounding.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.428 align:middle line:84%
And everything is
wavelengths, and then--

00:13:14.428 --> 00:13:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And then you get
reflections back.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>> You get 100%
reflections back.

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And the more people
do that collectively--

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.710 align:middle line:84%
and this is why I stress so much
on this Earth shift happening

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.810 align:middle line:84%
now-- and there are
shifts happening now--

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:32.960 align:middle line:84%
the more those fields
connect together and do that,

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:37.600 align:middle line:84%
the more parts of the whole
puzzle of this universe are

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.540 align:middle line:84%
performing something together,
and the stronger the psionics

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:42.340 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:46.720 align:middle line:84%
If enough people are gathering
together and focusing

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.780 align:middle line:84%
their mind pulse to
something, the more parts

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.520 align:middle line:84%
of the whole universe
come together,

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:55.810 align:middle line:84%
and you could even remove
something really incredible

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:58.090 align:middle line:84%
like a mountain or
something, if you have

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:00.770 align:middle line:90%
enough people focusing on that.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>> And it is also the same
reason why I think some

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:10.050 align:middle line:84%
scientists would even say
today, prayer, the intent--

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>> --on treatment or survival
can make a difference.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:17.375 align:middle line:90%
Prayers can make a difference.

00:14:17.375 --> 00:14:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>> It makes a difference, 100%.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Two things-- the more you train
and the more you become aware

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:29.180 align:middle line:84%
of the results, these are the
determining factors to anything

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.090 align:middle line:90%
you learn.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:34.190 align:middle line:84%
The more you practice it and the
more positive results you have,

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:37.310 align:middle line:84%
the better you get at
piano playing or psionics.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're stressing psionics
because you're basically

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:45.620 align:middle line:84%
saying, this is the area where
the non-humans communicate.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:51.560 align:middle line:84%
This is the area that, if humans
were updating their own ability

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:55.070 align:middle line:84%
to concentrate and
have impact, that we

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:58.820 align:middle line:84%
would be able to telepathically
communicate with ETs.

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, but Linda, not only--

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:08.945 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how easy is it to
just communicate and use

00:15:08.945 --> 00:15:11.960 align:middle line:84%
your psionics to solve
certain problems?

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:16.460 align:middle line:84%
If a small sample group
of a few thousand people

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:22.100 align:middle line:84%
can drop the crime
rate of a city by 50%,

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:26.000 align:middle line:84%
then 100,000 people or 1
million people on Gaia,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.270 align:middle line:84%
can affect a field
very efficiently.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't mean that you--
so a level 3 consciousness,

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:37.520 align:middle line:84%
a civilization that is heavily
in level 3 consciousness,

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.940 align:middle line:84%
would do all sorts of
things to solve something.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Like jails, like reintegration
systems, like you name it--

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:51.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- education or
whatever, just to prevent

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:53.010 align:middle line:90%
certain scenarios to happen.

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:57.800 align:middle line:84%
But if you're thinking about
a level four consciousness,

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.710 align:middle line:84%
the only thing you
need to do is focus

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:04.130 align:middle line:84%
as much mind power as
possible onto the field

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.720 align:middle line:90%
and let it create itself.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.300 align:middle line:84%
So that makes things
so much easier.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're on a planet of 8
billion consciousnesses with

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:17.210 align:middle line:84%
the potential of psionics,
but out of those 8 billion,

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:22.190 align:middle line:84%
maybe there are only 30 or 40
million who literally have had

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.460 align:middle line:84%
enough experiences that
they could say, yes,

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.230 align:middle line:90%
I've seen a UFO.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:29.120 align:middle line:90%
I have seen a being.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.730 align:middle line:90%
I know that I've had telepathy.

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:35.430 align:middle line:90%
It's such a tiny fraction.

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:42.210 align:middle line:84%
But part of why we're talking
is that we seem to genuinely

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:46.530 align:middle line:84%
be at a transition,
if you want to call it

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:51.240 align:middle line:84%
an intersection, in the timeline
of Earth, where nothing is ever

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:55.470 align:middle line:84%
going to be the same again
after a period of time.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:17:00.520 align:middle line:84%
It is as if we are in a huge
revolution at every level,

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.020 align:middle line:90%
including the climate.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:02.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And out of this
huge revolution--

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:07.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>> --the assumption
is, on the other side,

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:13.920 align:middle line:84%
whether it is in 2
years or 10 years,

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:19.530 align:middle line:84%
we are actively going to be on
a planet where every being knows

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:22.530 align:middle line:84%
we are not alone
in the universe,

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:28.440 align:middle line:84%
that some are friendly, some
are neutral, some are hostile,

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:35.970 align:middle line:84%
but that we humans must grow
up, that we are not alone,

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:40.810 align:middle line:84%
and that space,
space is our future.

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>> This species, the human
species is a so-called

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:49.170 align:middle line:84%
ascending psionic species,
which means they are already--

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:53.640 align:middle line:84%
everyone is already capable
of the full potential

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.290 align:middle line:90%
of psionic features.

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:57.060 align:middle line:90%
But it's a kind of muscle.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.570 align:middle line:90%
You need to train it.

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:00.930 align:middle line:84%
The more you train
it and the more you

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:03.130 align:middle line:90%
exercise it, the better it gets.

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And when a certain key number of
associates of a certain species

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:19.080 align:middle line:84%
has had a full grown psionic
power, once they achieve that,

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.160 align:middle line:84%
that spreads over to the whole
collective consciousness.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:27.000 align:middle line:84%
So we are approaching,
very quickly,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000 align:middle line:84%
a point where everyone
on this planet

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.820 align:middle line:84%
will see psionic
features in their life

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.160 align:middle line:90%
at almost a daily basis.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And if we were introduced,
whether it was to Greys,

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Tall Whites, Nordics, whatever,
and we started to have actual--

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to say--

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:54.390 align:middle line:84%
communications on a regular
basis somehow on Earth,

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:58.680 align:middle line:84%
would, then, the non-humans
be teaching humans

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:03.600 align:middle line:84%
how to do telepathy because
that's their natural state?

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And would that,
in and of itself,

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:12.060 align:middle line:84%
rapidly evolve humans into the
ability to pick up frequencies

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.370 align:middle line:90%
and do telepathy?

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So on a theoretical
basis, I would say yes.

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Knowing the structure
of Earth systematically,

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.880 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
the species itself

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:31.210 align:middle line:84%
has a tendency to keep
things in their own hands.

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:35.640 align:middle line:84%
So I would assume, even
if there is a possibility

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.460 align:middle line:84%
that a different race
could teach us psionics,

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.460 align:middle line:84%
I would assume that
those in charge

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:45.000 align:middle line:84%
would prefer the situation
where they do that themselves.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Because powerbrokers
don't want to lose control

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:49.740 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth is
what I've been told,

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:54.300 align:middle line:84%
and that has been one of the
big reasons for the citizenry

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.960 align:middle line:84%
of Earth to be kept dumb and
blind about other intelligences

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.280 align:middle line:84%
that the powerbrokers have
been in communication with

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.080 align:middle line:90%
for decades.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but it's a
lose-lose situation.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:04.320 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Because some other species
that have full potential

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:15.630 align:middle line:84%
and develop psionic features can
use that against a planet that

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.780 align:middle line:84%
is not fully
developed, which means

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.940 align:middle line:90%
this raises a security leg.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:25.980 align:middle line:84%
If not enough people are
aware how to defend themselves

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:29.490 align:middle line:84%
against psionic
attacks, then that

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:35.700 align:middle line:84%
means that you either have other
species protecting your planet,

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.370 align:middle line:84%
and you need to pay them,
because that's their mission,

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:43.920 align:middle line:84%
or you're not able to
successfully control

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.280 align:middle line:90%
and protect your own system.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And that is also
why the government

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:55.110 align:middle line:84%
and certain other
interest groups

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:59.370 align:middle line:84%
have this interest
in seeing people

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:05.250 align:middle line:84%
use psionics on a
global scale to learn it

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:10.470 align:middle line:84%
and to enhance it because
the more people develop

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:13.860 align:middle line:84%
their full potential
of psionics, when

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:18.840 align:middle line:84%
this key number is reached,
then everyone within this memory

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.110 align:middle line:84%
collective, memory system
will have this ability.

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And is it true that at least
some subsets of Greys are being

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:33.600 align:middle line:84%
paid in some way to help
protect our planet right now,

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.350 align:middle line:90%
even if we are not told?

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:36.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And are they paid in
chemicals, minerals, gold?

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.697 align:middle line:90%
What are they paid in?

00:21:44.697 --> 00:21:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Ooh, I don't know that.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.880 align:middle line:90%
I don't know the contracts.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.820 align:middle line:84%
I would assume
that the Greys are

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:56.880 align:middle line:84%
capable of producing
any resource

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.040 align:middle line:90%
that they need themselves.

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:05.100 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that Greys are
interested in from this planet

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:10.410 align:middle line:84%
is, A, genetic material
and, B, experiences,

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:17.400 align:middle line:84%
which means anything that they
cannot experience themselves,

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.570 align:middle line:90%
and learn from that.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:25.500 align:middle line:84%
For example, human
emotions, sex, sleep--

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:28.020 align:middle line:84%
sleeping, dreams--
these are all things

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:31.900 align:middle line:90%
that they are interested in.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And what is your personal
knowledge about the craft that

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:39.760 align:middle line:90%
people have been on?

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:45.190 align:middle line:84%
An attorney that has
described and drawn

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:50.030 align:middle line:84%
what he saw on a
big craft, where

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:55.000 align:middle line:84%
there were tubes
and/or big, we'll say,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.400 align:middle line:90%
fish tank-looking things.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.640 align:middle line:84%
But inside, everything
were fetuses

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:04.450 align:middle line:84%
of what looked like
human babies or hybrids

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:12.290 align:middle line:84%
with the Greys growing in either
glass tubes or these tanks.

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And the attorney
has the impression

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:22.580 align:middle line:84%
that it's vital to the
continuation of the Grey

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:26.640 align:middle line:84%
species to be able to
hybridize with humans.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:32.170 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking about
hybrids, that is true.

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:38.290 align:middle line:84%
So some species create
bodies of a certain species

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:39.790 align:middle line:90%
and place them somewhere.

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:45.470 align:middle line:84%
Some have their genetic
stocks in a certain species,

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:46.600 align:middle line:90%
so on and so forth.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:50.530 align:middle line:84%
What the Greys would
love to see is evolve--

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:55.540 align:middle line:84%
like, every species evolve to
the full potential, but being

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.400 align:middle line:90%
part of all these species--

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:04.220 align:middle line:84%
so in the end, at level 7,
we can all unify ourselves.

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.120 align:middle line:84%
So that is mainly the
approach to level 7

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.940 align:middle line:84%
because the consciousness
level of the Greys

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:13.630 align:middle line:84%
is only reaching level
6 consciousness and is,

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:16.720 align:middle line:84%
right now, approaching
level 7 consciousness.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:21.770 align:middle line:84%
But they need every other being
in all existence in order to--

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:26.260 align:middle line:84%
and their experiences and their
evolutionary development--

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:31.270 align:middle line:84%
in order to reunify that
universe that we are.

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And you are so close
in your life to the Greys,

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.790 align:middle line:90%
one way or another.

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that you are a
hybrid, a Homo sapien-Grey

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:44.980 align:middle line:84%
hybrid, and that's why you
do the work that you do?

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone on this planet has
some kind of genetic profile

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:57.310 align:middle line:84%
that contains different
genetic sources from somewhere.

00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Beyond Earth.

00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Beyond Earth.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:04.810 align:middle line:84%
I think the main problem
that we all should approach

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:09.610 align:middle line:84%
is this kind of xenophobia
that might be going on,

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:18.410 align:middle line:84%
which means there is still
something on this planet, which

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:23.270 align:middle line:84%
is, again, a very typical
thing to ape species,

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:26.750 align:middle line:84%
that they are in competition
to other species.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:33.140 align:middle line:84%
They-- even the same species
compared to a different group,

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.920 align:middle line:84%
they react pretty
rejecting to them.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.550 align:middle line:90%
Other species don't do that.

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:41.450 align:middle line:84%
They don't form in
groups, and then they

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:43.700 align:middle line:90%
don't reject any other species.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.220 align:middle line:84%
But this is
something which comes

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:49.290 align:middle line:84%
from the genetics
of an ape species,

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:51.860 align:middle line:84%
and this is played
out as racism,

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:56.390 align:middle line:84%
for example, which means,
oh, that person is not

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:58.640 align:middle line:90%
belonging to my tribe.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.760 align:middle line:90%
So I might reject that.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.760 align:middle line:84%
This is something especially
true for ape species,

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:10.670 align:middle line:84%
and this is still active,
though it's subconsciously

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:12.710 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of people.

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:17.210 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that
an ascending ape species

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:19.820 align:middle line:84%
needs to deal with,
to get rid of that,

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.710 align:middle line:84%
and to understand that
we are all connected,

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:25.610 align:middle line:84%
we are all the same
being, although we

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:30.020 align:middle line:84%
are all different and
individual in ourselves.

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.790 align:middle line:90%
>> And the powerbrokers--

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:35.630 align:middle line:90%
they don't want to lose control.

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think that has been
one of the big blocks

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:45.110 align:middle line:84%
because if we are introduced
to Tall Whites, Greys,

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:49.970 align:middle line:84%
the Tall Whites can
demonstrate superior, hugely

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:53.150 align:middle line:84%
superior brainpower the
powerbrokers, right now, are

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:56.090 align:middle line:84%
depending upon to help
get us through this very

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:57.540 align:middle line:90%
rough decade on the Earth.

00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:02.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's-- my quick
point is it's happening.

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:04.340 align:middle line:84%
It's happening
behind the scenes.

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:05.507 align:middle line:90%
>> It's happening right now.

00:27:05.507 --> 00:27:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>> There's collaboration--
yes, exactly,

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:08.675 align:middle line:90%
right now on this planet.

00:27:08.675 --> 00:27:10.217 align:middle line:84%
>> In front on the
Earth of everyone.

00:27:10.217 --> 00:27:13.580 align:middle line:84%
>> ETs with our military, with
our scientists, with doctors,

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.610 align:middle line:90%
with aerospace--

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:20.620 align:middle line:84%
and yet those that are
getting the help say, no,

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:23.980 align:middle line:84%
the citizenry of the
planet cannot be told.

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:26.920 align:middle line:90%
They can be told, but we cannot.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And there, fundamentally, to
me, is a wrong conclusion.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:35.350 align:middle line:84%
I honestly feel in
my soul and my heart

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:38.650 align:middle line:84%
that if in World War
II, all of humanity

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:42.820 align:middle line:84%
had been told about
extraterrestrial agreements

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:50.890 align:middle line:84%
with the German world,
that Hitler would not

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:54.520 align:middle line:84%
have been able to
co-opt what he did

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.590 align:middle line:84%
and that the whole world would
have to have grown up really

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:58.390 align:middle line:90%
fast.

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:01.090 align:middle line:84%
But we would have
become stronger,

00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:06.340 align:middle line:84%
and we might not be in the
same sort of tragic situation

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:10.960 align:middle line:84%
that we are in now and wondering
what kind of existential events

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.130 align:middle line:90%
are coming.

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:14.690 align:middle line:90%
Knowledge could have been power.

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And I say that in contrast
because, right now,

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:24.080 align:middle line:84%
we still have some time in
which the powerbrokers could

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:28.460 align:middle line:84%
make the decision that
the whole planet deserves

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:29.880 align:middle line:90%
to know the truth.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.590 align:middle line:84%
Let the chips fall where
they may, because it couldn't

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:38.390 align:middle line:84%
get any worse than how this
whole decade might unfold,

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:40.490 align:middle line:84%
if we are still
kept in the dark,

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:44.750 align:middle line:84%
while the powerbrokers are
working with advanced ETs, who

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:50.960 align:middle line:84%
are helping, but the planet
is not evolving with them.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so I mean a lot of
non-terrestrial lifeforms would

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:58.480 align:middle line:90%
totally sign to that.

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.030 align:middle line:84%
I personally am not here
to interfere with the power

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:03.040 align:middle line:90%
structure at all.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:06.190 align:middle line:84%
But I would say one
of the main concerns

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:13.210 align:middle line:84%
to closed societies is outside
forces and outside systems.

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:15.140 align:middle line:84%
So if you compare
that, for example,

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.650 align:middle line:84%
to a situation
around the Cold War,

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:19.750 align:middle line:84%
where you had an
Iron Curtain, even

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Germany being divided
into two separate parts,

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.080 align:middle line:84%
where one of those
parts is trying

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:30.940 align:middle line:84%
to build a wall around
itself in order to keep them,

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:34.390 align:middle line:84%
their people away
from the influences

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:35.890 align:middle line:90%
of an outside system.

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:39.710 align:middle line:90%
And this is a major concern.

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:44.950 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a species
and a civilization that

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:50.450 align:middle line:84%
works very well, that
might have an impact

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:54.650 align:middle line:84%
on the inhabitants
of a species that

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:59.820 align:middle line:84%
still has a problem within
their system and that society.

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:01.010 align:middle line:90%
What I want to say--

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:04.820 align:middle line:84%
wanted to say is that if
we deal with an open system

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:07.310 align:middle line:84%
scenario, which we
are doing right now,

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:11.240 align:middle line:84%
there are multiple planets
with multiple civilizations

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:17.960 align:middle line:84%
that are way more advanced,
socially speaking,

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:22.310 align:middle line:84%
compared to Earth, work
way better in the system,

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:30.230 align:middle line:84%
that the risk is there,
that this might have

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:32.510 align:middle line:90%
an impact on your own system.

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:35.840 align:middle line:84%
But I would also say that
wherever there's a risk,

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.330 align:middle line:84%
there's also potential,
a chance, which

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:39.470 align:middle line:90%
means if you have--

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and this is basically the
reason why the universe

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:46.640 align:middle line:84%
itself is opening up for
all these other species.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.040 align:middle line:84%
It becomes denser
and denser over time

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:52.850 align:middle line:84%
and integrates even more
experiences in itself.

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:56.010 align:middle line:84%
It's to reduce entropy,
as you call it.

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:56.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Entropy.

00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:57.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:00.500 align:middle line:84%
It's reducing
itself, its entropy,

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.310 align:middle line:90%
becoming denser and denser.

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:06.260 align:middle line:84%
So an open space-- an open
system scenario means you have

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.505 align:middle line:84%
more and more best
practices around--

00:31:08.505 --> 00:31:09.305 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:09.305 --> 00:31:09.800 align:middle line:90%
>> You know?

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>> You get stronger
in the right way.

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>> 100%.

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Building a wall might
sound like security,

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:21.380 align:middle line:84%
but it only means deprivation
of your own species.

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:22.610 align:middle line:90%
I would say that.

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:27.320 align:middle line:84%
That's why-- and I think the
people right now in charge

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:30.200 align:middle line:84%
are smart enough
to understand that,

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.280 align:middle line:84%
besides a lot of
other reasons why

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:37.580 align:middle line:84%
dealing with this open
scenario situation is good,

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:41.690 align:middle line:84%
including economic reasons
because the money that

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:43.610 align:middle line:84%
could be made on
a singular planet

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:48.570 align:middle line:84%
is nothing in comparison
to an open universe.

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So when do you project
the date, the year,

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:57.530 align:middle line:84%
that the whole Earth will be
told and know that there are

00:31:57.530 --> 00:32:01.760 align:middle line:84%
Tall Whites, and Nordics,
and Greys, and Teals,

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:07.130 align:middle line:84%
and Reptilians, and the
whole, whole zoo out there?

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>> It's happening
right now, right now.

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>> But not publicly the way you
and I have described that we

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:16.140 align:middle line:90%
would like to see it happen.

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say that
we are, right now--

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:23.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everyone can see
that, that we are in a phase

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:29.210 align:middle line:84%
of restructuring and
re-understanding life as it is,

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:30.080 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.940 align:middle line:90%
>> By 2030?

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:34.630 align:middle line:90%
By 2026?

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:36.490 align:middle line:90%
2024?

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's an interesting
question because all I am

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:42.490 align:middle line:84%
seeing is that it's happening
right now, right here.

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:45.730 align:middle line:84%
I would say that the
statistics already

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:48.520 align:middle line:84%
show that the main
population of this planet

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:51.430 align:middle line:84%
is OK with the existence
of non-terrestrial life.

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:57.400 align:middle line:84%
There are documentaries being
shown on certain big mainstream

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.570 align:middle line:90%
streaming platforms.

00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:01.840 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's not the big headline
at "The New York Times,"

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.000 align:middle line:84%
"The Washington
Post," "The Guardian,"

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.640 align:middle line:84%
and that's when it will be real,
when all of the media have all

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.050 align:middle line:90%
the same big headlines--

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:12.320 align:middle line:90%
"We're not alone."

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.270 align:middle line:90%
"We have proof."

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And that-- at least I--
it's been suggested to me

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:19.270 align:middle line:84%
that this year, that
the Webb telescope,

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:23.710 align:middle line:84%
it's already under discussion,
and it's which planet are they

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:25.820 align:middle line:84%
going to aim that
they already know

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:29.650 align:middle line:84%
has a lot of
artificial structures?

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And it will be breaking
news on the TRAPPIST planet.

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:39.420 align:middle line:84%
We have now confirmed
artificial structures.

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:42.420 align:middle line:84%
We are not alone
in the universe.

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And that is the humble way in
which it will be introduced.

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So I won't make any
assumption about when this

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:54.810 align:middle line:84%
topic is going to be a major
headline in the mainstream

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:59.610 align:middle line:84%
or if it even will be a major
headline in the newspapers.

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:02.220 align:middle line:84%
At the moment,
what's happening is

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:08.340 align:middle line:84%
that certain target groups are
being taught and being informed

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:10.650 align:middle line:90%
about certain realities.

00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:14.130 align:middle line:84%
We clearly have an
audience that, I mean,

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:19.080 align:middle line:84%
know very much about
this, what's happening.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And the specific information
is going to this target group,

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:26.940 align:middle line:84%
while the mainstream
is receiving

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:32.040 align:middle line:84%
different, other, more
subtle information right

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.090 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:39.810 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, we're all waiting
for this very first moment

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:43.560 align:middle line:84%
where we have the first
official open contact scenario.

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And it says, we're not
alone in this universe,

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:48.100 align:middle line:90%
and here's why.

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.679 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you, Tim, for being
with me on another special,

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:55.603 align:middle line:90%
special "Truth Hunter."

00:34:55.603 --> 00:34:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for
having me, Linda.

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:59.080 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:02.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Coming up on the
next "Truth Hunter."

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Through compressed
frequencies,

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:07.870 align:middle line:84%
you can have a direct
face-to-face interaction with

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:11.650 align:middle line:84%
a consciousness life form
that is on a different plane

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:12.640 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>> And what do you see?

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Good question.

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:18.940 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
the whole universe,

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Being 6, except for one
species that remains bad.

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:26.506 align:middle line:90%
>> Which ones are they?

00:35:26.506 --> 00:35:31.180 align:middle line:84%
What would be the one question
that you've heard Being 6 say

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:32.515 align:middle line:90%
and agonize over?

00:35:32.515 --> 00:35:34.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Infinity.

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:37.000 align:middle line:90%
