00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.230 align:middle line:10%
>> As my interviews and
discussions with so many people

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.220 align:middle line:10%
in the human abductions evolved,
a parallel track entered

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.630 align:middle line:10%
my work.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.570 align:middle line:10%
On that track came
military voices

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.410 align:middle line:10%
and a few retired whistleblowers
from government intelligence

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.970 align:middle line:10%
agencies who wanted me to
know the alien presence

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.810 align:middle line:10%
is real and very complicated.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.290 align:middle line:84%
The first time someone in a
serious government capacity

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.460 align:middle line:84%
talked to me about one of
the alien presences on Earth,

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.940 align:middle line:84%
was a Washington
DC military source.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.730 align:middle line:84%
He claimed first
hand interaction

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.750 align:middle line:84%
with at least one type of
non-human like this one.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.830 align:middle line:10%
He agreed to talk with me off
the record about the Grey Type

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.770 align:middle line:10%
that he knew as EBENs--

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.930 align:middle line:10%
all caps-- a government acronym
standing for Extraterrestrial

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.390 align:middle line:10%
Biological Entities.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.450 align:middle line:84%
The military source told
me that this drawing

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.620 align:middle line:84%
was quote "almost like a
photograph of an EBEN."

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.390 align:middle line:90%
close quote.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.640 align:middle line:84%
The only difference
is the EBENs' skin

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.970 align:middle line:90%
color is cement sidewalk gray.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.570 align:middle line:84%
I have also been told that
among the variety of grey skin

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.830 align:middle line:84%
non-humans, some have been
observed to change colors

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.960 align:middle line:84%
to cream, brown, or pale
green, depending upon feeding

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.620 align:middle line:90%
schedules.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.640 align:middle line:84%
The EBEN eyes are
not sharply slanted,

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.570 align:middle line:84%
but are all almond shaped
with dark brown irises.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.970 align:middle line:84%
I asked if the EBENs
have vertical pupils

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.710 align:middle line:84%
like a snake underneath
their brown eyes surfaces,

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.590 align:middle line:84%
as some human abductees have
described from encounters

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.360 align:middle line:90%
with Grey Types.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.300 align:middle line:84%
The government
man seemed unsure,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.110 align:middle line:84%
but stressed that the EBENs
have pear shaped heads, not

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.710 align:middle line:84%
triangular with pointed
chins like some other Grey

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Types that are not friendly to
humans, as the EBENs allegedly

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.300 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.460 align:middle line:84%
I also understood that
the EBENs, Greys, tall,

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.480 align:middle line:84%
pale humanoids, and
reptilian humanoids,

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.210 align:middle line:84%
all make biological
androids programmed

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.340 align:middle line:84%
for various functions
by their ET makers.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.640 align:middle line:10%
He said that the original
source of the EBENs

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.710 align:middle line:10%
is a desert planet orbiting
the binary suns Zeta Reticuli

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.210 align:middle line:10%
1 and 2, about 39
light years from Earth.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.650 align:middle line:10%
The EBEN planet skies are
described as bright to dim,

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.930 align:middle line:10%
but never dark.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.400 align:middle line:84%
This pastel drawing was done
by a Colorado male abductee.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.960 align:middle line:84%
In late November 1985, he and
his wife in their moving car

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.550 align:middle line:84%
were lifted up by a beam of
Cerulean blue green light

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.910 align:middle line:84%
from a highway near
Longmont, Colorado.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.630 align:middle line:84%
The whole case, with many
photos and illustrations,

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.860 align:middle line:84%
is in my first book
"An Alien Harvest."

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.280 align:middle line:84%
My military source
told me the EBENs

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.370 align:middle line:84%
are supposed to be friendly and
do not abduct people he said.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.780 align:middle line:84%
But he had to admit to me
that if this illustration

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.190 align:middle line:84%
by the husband was almost like
a photograph of an EBEN, then

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:51.310 align:middle line:84%
it meant the EBEN did
abduct the husband and wife.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.210 align:middle line:84%
The couple in their
car were carried

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.860 align:middle line:84%
from the Longmont, Colorado,
highway to a forest

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.160 align:middle line:84%
where an egg-shaped craft
was on the ground, supported

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.350 align:middle line:90%
by angled struts.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.250 align:middle line:84%
The Washington military source
knew about my Home Box Office

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.640 align:middle line:84%
TV project that took me
to Kirtland Air Force Base

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.050 align:middle line:84%
on April 9, 1983, where I
was shown an alleged briefing

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.690 align:middle line:84%
paper for an unnamed
US president that

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.400 align:middle line:84%
said quote "these
extraterrestrial biological

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.390 align:middle line:84%
entities manipulated DNA in
already-evolving primates

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.770 align:middle line:84%
to create Homo
sapien" close quote.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.270 align:middle line:84%
My military source
said that was true.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.480 align:middle line:84%
But he stressed that no one
in the American government

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.550 align:middle line:84%
with access to that knowledge
ever wanted to be alive if,

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.740 align:middle line:84%
or when, such an announcement
were broadcast to the world

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.750 align:middle line:84%
that humans are someone else's
experimental androids and ET

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.575 align:middle line:90%
human hybrids.

00:04:56.575 --> 00:04:59.290 align:middle line:90%


00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.370 align:middle line:10%
He told me that he had talked
firsthand with a US Air Force

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.300 align:middle line:10%
captain who received telepathic
communication from one

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.250 align:middle line:10%
non-human at a crash site in
the Roswell region in 1949,

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:10%
not the 1947 July crashes.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Walking around that 1949 site,
the Air Force captain clearly

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.370 align:middle line:84%
received mind-to-mind
telepathic communication

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.420 align:middle line:84%
from an EBEN that looked like
a dead body amid the debris.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:34.250 align:middle line:84%
The captain said inside his
head, he could hear crying,

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.660 align:middle line:84%
and felt pain coming from
the EBEN body on the ground.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.480 align:middle line:84%
Realizing there was a live
creature communicating

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.440 align:middle line:84%
telepathically to the
captain, higher authorities

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.510 align:middle line:84%
officially assigned the captain
to live with the entity called

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.260 align:middle line:84%
EBE 1 at the Los Alamos
laboratory in New Mexico

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:02.360 align:middle line:84%
until EBE 1 died of unknown
causes on June 18, 1952.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.510 align:middle line:84%
That Air Force captain
who lived with EBE 1

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.010 align:middle line:84%
said the ET told him
that reincarnation,

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:15.290 align:middle line:84%
the recycling of souls, is
the machinery of the universe.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.260 align:middle line:84%
The captain also said that
one of the most important

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.310 align:middle line:84%
telepathic transmissions
that he ever received

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.300 align:middle line:90%
was quote "We made you.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.000 align:middle line:84%
We put you here on Earth,
but you have to live it"

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.090 align:middle line:90%
close quote.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.100 align:middle line:84%
When I asked my
Washington source

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.780 align:middle line:84%
what he thought that
meant, he told me,

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.100 align:middle line:84%
quote "Linda the
key to everything

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:46.610 align:middle line:84%
is ET creation of human
ET hybrid body container

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.970 align:middle line:84%
in which alien life force and
consciousness can be placed."

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.740 align:middle line:84%
But he did not understand
the big agenda.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.780 align:middle line:84%
Abductee Linda
Porter told me when

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.030 align:middle line:84%
the praying mantis and
the EBEN-type beings

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.630 align:middle line:84%
were showing her the light tube
cloning resurrection technology

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.250 align:middle line:84%
that she understood it was
vital to keep some soul

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.090 align:middle line:84%
entities in human body
containers for specific lengths

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:12.800 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.330 align:middle line:10%
But it does not explain
why Homo sapien sapien must

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:22.280 align:middle line:10%
be used to make hybrid body
containers to perpetuate

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.460 align:middle line:10%
alien life force.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.300 align:middle line:10%
This is my third book "Glimpses
of Other Realities Volume 2

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:34.040 align:middle line:10%
High Strangeness" that was
first released in 1998.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.100 align:middle line:10%
Not long after the publication,
one night in Philadelphia,

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.340 align:middle line:10%
where I was living, I
answered my ringing phone.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.650 align:middle line:84%
The deep male voice
on the other end

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.740 align:middle line:84%
spoke without
introducing himself.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.770 align:middle line:84%
He said, quote, "I
thought you should

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.710 align:middle line:84%
know that your new book
has stirred up a hornet's

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.290 align:middle line:90%
nest at MJ-12 in Washington.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:58.480 align:middle line:90%
Congratulations."

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.260 align:middle line:90%
And then the deep voice hung up.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.280 align:middle line:84%
Since the early 1980s,
after the TV broadcast

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.430 align:middle line:84%
of my documentary
"A Strange Harvest,"

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.650 align:middle line:84%
I have received
valuable insights

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.600 align:middle line:84%
from two different
government agency

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.680 align:middle line:84%
men willing to hear my questions
about the alien presence

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.570 align:middle line:84%
on Earth and why that alien
presence seems so focused

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:27.610 align:middle line:84%
on genetic harvests
from humans and animals.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:31.090 align:middle line:84%
One man was retired
in Washington DC.

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:34.720 align:middle line:84%
The other continued
assignments in the Southwest.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Both said they had done work for
the highly secret MJ-12 group.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.970 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:46.200 align:middle line:10%
They both emphasized the
grey skinned EBEN types with

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:51.270 align:middle line:10%
the pear shaped heads and almond
shaped dark brown eyes are

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:55.980 align:middle line:10%
different from the smaller,
thinner greys with triangular

00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.030 align:middle line:10%
faces and large
black slanted eyes.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:06.930 align:middle line:84%
The men thought that the
EBENs were, are, our allies.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:11.910 align:middle line:84%
But they did not trust the
pointed chin greys quote

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.790 align:middle line:90%
"who lie to us" close quote.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.700 align:middle line:90%
That was a warning.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:21.150 align:middle line:84%
The whistleblower explanations
of prime intelligences

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:25.830 align:middle line:84%
that make biological androids
and hybrids help explain

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:29.670 align:middle line:84%
the great confusion
since the 1960s

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.590 align:middle line:84%
when human abductees
have described

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:35.010 align:middle line:84%
so many different
types of beings ranging

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:39.060 align:middle line:84%
from insects to tall, pale
humanoids that have blonde

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.260 align:middle line:84%
or black or red hair, while
other alien beings are

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.890 align:middle line:84%
described as standing
up, humanoid, alligators,

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:51.780 align:middle line:84%
or lizards, referred
to as reptoids.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Government insiders say the
various types of hybrids

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:59.220 align:middle line:84%
and androids are designed
for various planetary

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:03.180 align:middle line:84%
tasks on our planet and
throughout the solar system,

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:07.890 align:middle line:84%
and even beyond the Milky
Way to other galaxies.

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Both men have
periodically given me

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:14.310 align:middle line:84%
information over the years,
which I have no way to prove.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:18.720 align:middle line:84%
But I offer, now, in the
context of other military and

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:24.210 align:middle line:84%
intelligent voices who know
about Earth's alien presence.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:27.030 align:middle line:10%
To honor their
request for anonymity,

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:30.720 align:middle line:10%
I combine their
information into one voice

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.720 align:middle line:10%
that I call Sherman
in my third book

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:40.710 align:middle line:10%
"Glimpses of Other Realities
Volume 2 High Strangeness."

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:45.060 align:middle line:10%
Sherman said it was true
that MJ-12 was established

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:48.480 align:middle line:10%
by one of President Harry
Truman's Executive Orders

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.000 align:middle line:10%
in 1947.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.770 align:middle line:10%
MJ-12's charter, he said, was
to study the UFO phenomenon,

00:10:55.770 --> 00:11:00.840 align:middle line:10%
to oversee retrievals of
crashed disks and alien bodies,

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:05.280 align:middle line:10%
to back engineer
extraterrestrial technology,

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.385 align:middle line:10%
and to study captured
alien beings.

00:11:08.385 --> 00:11:10.920 align:middle line:90%


00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.070 align:middle line:84%
MJ-12, he said,
was also directed

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.380 align:middle line:84%
to keep the public
and the media ignorant

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:20.610 align:middle line:84%
of the extraterrestrial
presence at all costs,

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:23.820 align:middle line:84%
to prevent public panic,
and to keep the alien's

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.510 align:middle line:84%
advanced technologies
hidden from Cold War enemies

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:31.680 align:middle line:84%
in the interests of
national security.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Sherman said that
in the 1990s MJ-12

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.700 align:middle line:84%
had changed to a different
letter number code that

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:43.050 align:middle line:90%
began E, as in Edward, 2.

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:45.180 align:middle line:84%
I asked Sherman if
he had personally

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:50.640 align:middle line:84%
seen non-human technology
in his work for MJ-12.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.060 align:middle line:84%
He said he had held
an EBEN device called

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.850 align:middle line:84%
The Yellow Book that
was a technology

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.400 align:middle line:90%
like the modern iPad.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.670 align:middle line:90%
Words on its screen glow yellow.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And three dimensional
images can rise up

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.680 align:middle line:84%
like the Princess Leia hologram
communicator in Star Wars.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Sherman said those
three dimensional images

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.500 align:middle line:84%
in The Yellow Book come
from the EBENs' ability

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:22.970 align:middle line:84%
to quote "capture time and
play it back" close quote.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And he emphasized for me,
I'm not talking about videos.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:29.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm not talking about film.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking
about photographs.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about,
literally, capturing time

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.610 align:middle line:90%
and playing it back.

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:41.790 align:middle line:84%
The EBENs, he said,
access and manipulate time

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:47.940 align:middle line:84%
streams and even have most of
Earth's planetary evolution

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:52.470 align:middle line:84%
preserved in a Yellow
Book technology.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:56.460 align:middle line:84%
Sherman thought that the
EBENs monitor the consequences

00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:00.990 align:middle line:84%
of their genetic manipulations
on earth over very long time

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:05.550 align:middle line:84%
scales, for whatever the
big, big agenda of the EBENs

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:10.140 align:middle line:90%
is on this earth laboratory.

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Sherman said that
he had been told

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:16.500 align:middle line:84%
that the EBENs experimented
genetically in Bhutan, Tibet,

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.760 align:middle line:90%
and Nepal.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And then transplanted some of
those altered human ET hybrids

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.620 align:middle line:84%
to what we call the
Yucatan and Guatemala

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.410 align:middle line:90%
region of Central America.

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Sherman said the EBENs used
DNA harvested and manipulated

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:37.350 align:middle line:84%
from Bhutan for another EBEN
genetic experiment far away

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:41.160 align:middle line:84%
to the other side of the
world from the Himalayas.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Then in 850 AD, Sherman
said the EBENs beamed up

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.790 align:middle line:84%
most of the Mayan
ET human hybrids

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:56.340 align:middle line:84%
and transported them to another
planet for unknown reasons.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.120 align:middle line:84%
I asked Sherman,
"Then is it true

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.660 align:middle line:84%
that the EBENs and maybe
other extraterrestrial groups

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:07.950 align:middle line:84%
such as the Anunnaki
did manipulate DNA

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:12.000 align:middle line:84%
an already-evolving primates
to create Homo sapien

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.320 align:middle line:84%
as I was shown in
that briefing paper

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.120 align:middle line:84%
at Kirtland Air Force
Base on April 9, 1983?"

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.030 align:middle line:90%
But it's a difficult subject.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:23.460 align:middle line:84%
The EBENs have been here
since at least the time

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:24.920 align:middle line:90%
of the dinosaurs.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And according to
a report I read,

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.850 align:middle line:84%
EBENs collected one of
each species of dinosaur

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.190 align:middle line:84%
and placed them either
in one big planetary zoo

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.470 align:middle line:90%
or on a different planet.

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And that was at least 68
million or more years ago.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.290 align:middle line:84%
So I guess they have
experimented with life forms

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:41.580 align:middle line:90%
here ever since.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And I said well what
about the animal mutilations?

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>> The animal mutilations
are performed by the aliens.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.570 align:middle line:84%
We allowed them to conduct
experiments using animals, not

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:53.340 align:middle line:90%
just cattle.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
are aware or not,

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:59.370 align:middle line:84%
but there are a lot of moose and
caribou found mysteriously dead

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.500 align:middle line:90%
in the Arctic and Alaska.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.470 align:middle line:84%
We think it was part of
the EBEN experimentation,

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:06.610 align:middle line:84%
but we couldn't figure
out what happened.

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:09.295 align:middle line:84%
The EBENs wanted to
conduct experiments,

00:15:09.295 --> 00:15:10.920 align:middle line:84%
so our government
thought it was better

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.100 align:middle line:84%
to agree to animals
instead of humans.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.490 align:middle line:84%
To complicate matters, in
order to cover up the animal

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:21.030 align:middle line:84%
mutilations, our government
launched a military program

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:24.520 align:middle line:84%
to test certain biological
drugs on animals.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.480 align:middle line:84%
This was to cover up the
alien mutilation program.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>> I asked do the EBENs
themselves enter pastures

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:35.550 align:middle line:84%
and cut the tissues from
animals and mutilations?

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>> After we had more
communications with the EBENs,

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.340 align:middle line:84%
they explained to us, you
have to understand that

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:45.390 align:middle line:84%
for an advanced civilization,
you have robots and androids

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.520 align:middle line:90%
to do these things.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And Sherman said MJ-12 began
to understand that the EBEN

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:56.010 align:middle line:90%
androids could be anything.

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:58.440 align:middle line:84%
>> The androids can be
configured any way the EBENs

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.665 align:middle line:84%
want for whatever mission
the EBENs want carried out.

00:16:01.665 --> 00:16:04.710 align:middle line:84%
The EBENs are controlling
a big part of the operation

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:08.830 align:middle line:84%
concerning Earth and we can't
control everything they do.

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:10.860 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell
you that the EBENs

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.450 align:middle line:90%
are big environmentalists.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:13.780 align:middle line:90%
Huge.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:17.790 align:middle line:84%
They would make the Sierra
Club look like Brownie Scouts.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:19.800 align:middle line:84%
They were so worried
about our nuclear tests

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:23.220 align:middle line:84%
and nuclear materials being
exploited and contaminating,

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.800 align:middle line:84%
not only the Earth, but
damaging other dimensions

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.870 align:middle line:90%
of this universe.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And I said, do
you mean Sherman,

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:34.800 align:middle line:84%
that our atomic bombs impacted
other lifeforms or even other

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.010 align:middle line:90%
dimensions?

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:36.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:38.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the
things that EBENs

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:40.500 align:middle line:84%
were very vocal
about how they wanted

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.070 align:middle line:84%
above-ground atomic
tests stopped.

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:45.330 align:middle line:90%
And boy, were they stopped.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well from your point of view,
are EBENs the only non-humans

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:53.880 align:middle line:84%
that have experimented
genetically on this planet?

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>> All I know is it that the
EBENs started an experiment,

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.940 align:middle line:84%
but they could not keep
out other space travelers.

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.530 align:middle line:84%
Word got out that this planet
was a strange place to visit

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:05.250 align:middle line:84%
and that different
experiments were not

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:07.740 align:middle line:90%
going the way the EBENs wanted.

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.720 align:middle line:84%
Part of the EBENs
problem might be

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.880 align:middle line:84%
because there are bad guys
doing experiments, too,

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.640 align:middle line:90%
that might harm us.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.250 align:middle line:84%
That really confuses matters
when it comes to telling who

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:19.530 align:middle line:84%
wants to help humans
and who doesn't.

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And I said, well,
in abduction reports,

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.410 align:middle line:84%
people describe creatures
that look like praying mantis

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:26.369 align:middle line:90%
insects.

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:28.020 align:middle line:90%
What are those?

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>> As far as I've heard, they
could be very advanced androids

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.600 align:middle line:84%
which can oversee long-term
projects that last

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.570 align:middle line:84%
for thousands, maybe
even millions, of years.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:39.990 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not certain who
they work with or for.

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I asked what is the
relationship between

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:46.360 align:middle line:84%
the pointed chin
Greys and the EBENs.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.730 align:middle line:90%
And Sherman said--

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>> They were
enemies at one time.

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:52.030 align:middle line:84%
They were supposed to
live without war today,

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:55.770 align:middle line:84%
but the EBENs have no
control over the Greys.

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:59.010 align:middle line:84%
The Greys do their thing
and the EBENs do theirs.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Well is there a pecking
order among the alien types?

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:05.430 align:middle line:84%
>> To the best of our knowledge,
no cooperation exists between

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:07.460 align:middle line:90%
the different alien groups.

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think there was a
war about 6,000 years ago

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:13.170 align:middle line:84%
between the EBENs and the
Blondes over territorial rights

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:15.480 align:middle line:90%
to a planet somewhere.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that
EBEN and the Blonde war

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:23.040 align:middle line:84%
was here on Earth or at
the Zeta Reticuli or what.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>> So, I said both groups?

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:28.080 align:middle line:84%
The EBENs and the
blonde humanoids

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.750 align:middle line:84%
are making android creatures
to do work for them

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:33.120 align:middle line:90%
on different planets?

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what I understand.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Androids come in many
different types--

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:41.270 align:middle line:84%
insects, reptilians,
Greys, humanoid, blondes,

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.340 align:middle line:90%
men in black, and others.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.410 align:middle line:84%
All have an advanced
implanted brain

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:48.950 align:middle line:84%
that can operate on its
own or by remote control.

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Ironically, we think some of
these genetically engineered

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:53.990 align:middle line:84%
creatures have a
higher intelligence

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:55.820 align:middle line:90%
than their creators.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.790 align:middle line:84%
The EBENs and the
Blonde humanoids

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:02.690 align:middle line:84%
know how to mix and match
genomes and DNA easily.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:04.320 align:middle line:84%
They can make
robots and androids

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.500 align:middle line:84%
that can be anything
they want them to be.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Remember the aliens millions
of years advanced beyond us.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Sherman said the EBENs even
make blonde looking containers

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:21.170 align:middle line:84%
that the EBENs control, while
the Blondes make EBEN looking

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:25.250 align:middle line:84%
container bodies that
the Blondes control.

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Think of a
multilayered chess game

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:31.760 align:middle line:84%
in which you need technology to
tell you who the players really

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:36.910 align:middle line:84%
are beneath their
body camouflage.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, the EBENs
genetic experimentation

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:46.330 align:middle line:84%
in Tibet, does that connect
somehow to the Dalai Lama?

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:49.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking about reincarnation
through different beings

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.700 align:middle line:90%
in different cycles of life.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:55.990 align:middle line:84%
Would that concept relate to
an EBEN supposedly telling

00:19:55.990 --> 00:20:00.760 align:middle line:84%
an Air Force captain in
1949 that recycling of souls

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:05.120 align:middle line:84%
is the machinery
of this universe?

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And to my surprise
Sherman said--

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.370 align:middle line:84%
There are only so
many souls that

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:12.110 align:middle line:90%
can just continuously recycle.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Through life form
bodies that are containers?

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:17.180 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Sherman, if there
are more container bodies than

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:23.300 align:middle line:90%
souls, what happens?

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:27.449 align:middle line:84%
But souls are
interconnected in some way.

00:20:27.449 --> 00:20:29.740 align:middle line:84%
I think they told us because
the EBENs have been around

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.840 align:middle line:84%
so long they've
learned that there

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.820 align:middle line:84%
are only so many souls
in the universe, which

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.650 align:middle line:90%
must be recycled.

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:39.100 align:middle line:84%
That implies a multiverse
of many universes.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:42.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Sherman, if there is a
finite number of souls in this

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:45.745 align:middle line:84%
universe, and the
EBENs know that,

00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:49.240 align:middle line:84%
why are we living on a planet
in which there is a steady

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.690 align:middle line:84%
exponential increase in
the number of bodies?

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Does that imply that not
all bodies can have souls?

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess you
have a point there.

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And I said, well, and if not
all body containers have souls

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:07.440 align:middle line:84%
would the EBENs and Blonde
humanoids have some stake

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.510 align:middle line:90%
invested in souls?

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:15.610 align:middle line:84%
Like souls could be the coin
of the realm, so to speak.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:17.860 align:middle line:90%
>> That's possible, I guess.

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.050 align:middle line:84%
I never thought of
it that way before.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:23.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And I said, well, some
abductee researchers,

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:28.000 align:middle line:84%
such as Dr. Leo Sprinkle, who
is the Wyoming psychologist,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.080 align:middle line:84%
and Harvard University
psychiatrist Dr. John Mack,

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.220 align:middle line:84%
they reported what appears
to be the same EBENs,

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:40.150 align:middle line:84%
or maybe other Grey Types,
involved from human life

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:41.650 align:middle line:90%
to human life.

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:46.930 align:middle line:84%
The same alien being comes up in
past life regressions at births

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:48.490 align:middle line:90%
and at deaths.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:53.666 align:middle line:84%
All I do know is that the soul,
when the body container dies,

00:21:53.666 --> 00:21:57.370 align:middle line:84%
the soul keeps some thoughts or
something from that life that

00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:59.071 align:middle line:90%
was just lived.

00:21:59.071 --> 00:22:01.440 align:middle line:84%
It said in The Yellow
Book that the EBENs

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.600 align:middle line:84%
are concerned about human
souls if our particular species

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.120 align:middle line:90%
continued on this course.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.540 align:middle line:84%
They are afraid we would
damage our container bodies

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.500 align:middle line:90%
and that could damage the souls.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:15.130 align:middle line:84%
I realized the containers
are the human bodies and that

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:18.640 align:middle line:84%
was why they were so concerned
what we have been doing--

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.812 align:middle line:90%
the wars and so forth.

00:22:20.812 --> 00:22:22.270 align:middle line:84%
They are afraid
that the souls will

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:24.230 align:middle line:90%
be damaged by our containers.

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:27.490 align:middle line:84%
One of the MJ-12 guys who had
seen more of The Yellow Book

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:30.250 align:middle line:90%
talked to me about an analogy.

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:32.860 align:middle line:84%
He said that when you put
something in a container,

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.540 align:middle line:84%
and you pour it
out, there's always

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:35.980 align:middle line:90%
some residue that remains.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.080 align:middle line:90%
Something remains in that soul.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.780 align:middle line:84%
So when you pass the soul
on in different containers,

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.240 align:middle line:84%
it picks up the residues of
all the different containers

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.240 align:middle line:90%
it has been in.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And a little of which
remains and stays throughout.

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:50.650 align:middle line:84%
I guess there was an
eternity, there's no end.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:54.360 align:middle line:84%
I asked him does the soul wear
out after so many recycles?

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.600 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:57.400 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.500 align:middle line:90%
The soul's never wear out.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:03.120 align:middle line:84%
The Supreme Being makes
sure that doesn't happen.

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:08.250 align:middle line:10%
>> While reviewing these pages,
of glimpses of other realities,

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:10.740 align:middle line:10%
a research colleague and
attorney Michael Pill

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:15.480 align:middle line:10%
of Shutesbury, Massachusetts,
wrote to me quote "The notion

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.800 align:middle line:10%
of the soul picking up residues
may explain why we have

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.770 align:middle line:10%
memories of past lives."

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:26.860 align:middle line:84%
It may also explain why after
spending thousands of years,

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.700 align:middle line:84%
and who knows how many
wretched lifetimes,

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.250 align:middle line:84%
trying to work out
the karma from one

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:36.780 align:middle line:84%
or more evil incarnations,
one can still

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:41.010 align:middle line:84%
feel the enticing
charm of the dark side.

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Those seven deadly sins
are like predators.

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.630 align:middle line:84%
They've got you before you
realize they are even there.

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:50.420 align:middle line:90%


00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:55.820 align:middle line:84%
The EBENs say that everything
that occurs in our time span

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.590 align:middle line:90%
has occurred before.

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:59.780 align:middle line:84%
I guess it means we're
right in the middle

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:01.700 align:middle line:90%
of a huge big circle.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.740 align:middle line:90%
And it goes round and round.

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And the way I see this is that
Earth was created and one day.

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Five billion years from now,
the sun is going to expand.

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And earth will be
engulfed and destroyed.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And everything goes
back into a Big Bang.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And then everything
starts over again.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:28.910 align:middle line:84%
I ask, well, when The Yellow
Book talked about the Supreme

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Being that created the
universe, did it say anything

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:37.040 align:middle line:84%
about parallel dimensions
or parallel timelines

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.150 align:middle line:90%
or anything else like that?

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:42.660 align:middle line:90%
And Sherman said, no, nothing.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:46.880 align:middle line:84%
The aliens talked about the
vastness of the universe,

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.990 align:middle line:84%
that there are life
forms all over, Linda.

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:55.100 align:middle line:84%
It talks about a Supreme
Being creating the souls

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:59.240 align:middle line:84%
and creating the containers
and distributing the souls

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.670 align:middle line:90%
to the containers.

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:05.180 align:middle line:84%
To the EBENs, it's
just basic facts.

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:11.330 align:middle line:84%
I asked Sherman, if the EBENs
made us and put us here,

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:13.820 align:middle line:90%
there has to be a reason.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Are we a garden growing
containers for souls

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:21.350 align:middle line:90%
to be harvested for some reason?

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And Sherman answered it's
another good question.

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:29.210 align:middle line:84%
All I can tell you is that
when I ask one elderly man

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:33.950 align:middle line:84%
with MJ-12 about souls,
and why the EBENs made us,

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:39.980 align:middle line:84%
he said you don't
want to know that.

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:44.900 align:middle line:84%
Sherman also told me that our
universe is one of billions.

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Like grains of sand on an
island, but the island,

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:54.170 align:middle line:84%
he said, is surrounded
by a cold dark sea.

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked what
is in the cold dark sea?

00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:04.280 align:middle line:84%
He used the elderly MJ-12
man's same answer about souls,

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.720 align:middle line:90%
you don't want to know that.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Sherman, some abductees also
say that the main reason

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:16.910 align:middle line:84%
for the animal mutilations
and human abductions

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:21.020 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the creation
of a hybrid species.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.210 align:middle line:84%
But no one knows
whether the hybrids

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:27.650 align:middle line:84%
are supposed to replace the
current Homo sapien container

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:28.910 align:middle line:90%
model.

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:32.780 align:middle line:84%
There is a sense that whatever
the non-humans are up to, it

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:35.120 align:middle line:84%
has something to
do with survival--

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.830 align:middle line:90%
there's and ours.

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:40.010 align:middle line:90%
Sherman said, maybe.

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:43.310 align:middle line:84%
All I know is that
the EBENs are supposed

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:46.670 align:middle line:84%
to have manipulated
DNA in primates

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:49.740 align:middle line:90%
long before humans were created.

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:53.510 align:middle line:84%
So there must have been a series
of experiments like Neanderthal

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:55.160 align:middle line:90%
before Cro-Magnon.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.260 align:middle line:90%
And Neanderthal's gone.

00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:02.030 align:middle line:84%
So who knows what's on
the agenda for humans.

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:05.000 align:middle line:84%
You can read more
about my discussions

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.870 align:middle line:84%
with Sherman in my book
"Glimpses of Other Realities

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:11.250 align:middle line:90%
Volume 2 High Strangeness."

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Centuries of
genetic manipulation

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:18.690 align:middle line:84%
by other intelligences was
reinforced for me in 1999

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:22.770 align:middle line:84%
by a retired Defense
Intelligence Agency analyst.

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:25.950 align:middle line:84%
He said his job had
been to monitor quote

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:30.540 align:middle line:84%
"the geopolitical territorial
conflicts of three competing

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:35.160 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial factions
or species" closed quote.

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:40.140 align:middle line:84%
The DIA analyst said alien
presences have based themselves

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.920 align:middle line:84%
in various parts of Earth,
and our solar system.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And at least one type has
been terraforming this planet

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.690 align:middle line:84%
and genetically
manipulating earth life

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:56.022 align:middle line:90%
for some 270 million years.

00:27:56.022 --> 00:27:58.770 align:middle line:90%


00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:03.030 align:middle line:84%
As Sherman had told me
earlier, the DIA analyst

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:06.840 align:middle line:84%
