00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>> RAF Bentwaters Woodbridge
Investigation has been hard

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.980 align:middle line:84%
to pin down to one version of
events because no one involved

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.460 align:middle line:84%
seems to have the same memory,
even if standing right next

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.120 align:middle line:84%
to each other, as Staff Sergeant
Jim Penniston and Airman First

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Class John Burroughs were
in Rendlesham Forest after

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.780 align:middle line:90%
midnight, December 26, 1980.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.360 align:middle line:90%
Each man has different memories.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Staff Sergeant Jim Penniston
was the Charlie flight security

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.080 align:middle line:84%
supervisor for flight operations
at RAF Bentwaters Woodbridge,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.550 align:middle line:90%
and investigated crash sites.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.900 align:middle line:84%
As he walked around this almost
nine-foot long, six-foot high

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.710 align:middle line:84%
black triangular
craft in awe, he

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.590 align:middle line:84%
thought that it looked
like solid glass

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.380 align:middle line:84%
with glowing circles
and other patterns

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.990 align:middle line:90%
moving in its glassy skin.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.040 align:middle line:84%
But Sergeant Penniston was also
confused, because he thought,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.770 align:middle line:84%
if it were some kind
of flying machine,

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.700 align:middle line:84%
it should be made
of metal, not glass.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.990 align:middle line:84%
He sketched the black triangular
craft in his notebook and says,

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.090 align:middle line:84%
he also took many photographs
of the triangle from all sides.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Those photographs had
never surfaced publicly.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.940 align:middle line:10%
But a captain Mike
Verano was supposed

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.200 align:middle line:10%
to have gathered canisters
of film, photos, documents,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.280 align:middle line:10%
and Colonel Charles
Halt's audiotape

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.190 align:middle line:10%
that he recorded on
December 28, 1980

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.100 align:middle line:10%
when he and a team
of military personnel

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.400 align:middle line:10%
investigated beams and
lights in Rendlesham Forest.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.800 align:middle line:10%
Those canisters of
evidence were allegedly

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.050 align:middle line:10%
flown to the Third Air Force
in Ramstein, Germany, where

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.720 align:middle line:10%
General Charles
A. Gabriel served

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.410 align:middle line:10%
until June 1982 as
commander-in-chief,

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.570 align:middle line:10%
United States Air
Force in Europe

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.280 align:middle line:10%
and commander of Allied
Air Forces, Central Europe.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.110 align:middle line:10%
The assumption is that he saw
everything in the canisters

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.770 align:middle line:10%
but kept the policy
of denial and cover-up

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.790 align:middle line:10%
in place, without ever talking
about the Rendlesham Forest

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.480 align:middle line:10%
mystery on the record.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.280 align:middle line:84%
General Gabriel died
in September 2003.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.940 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant Penniston says that
he also dragged his fingers

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.800 align:middle line:84%
along the smooth, warm-to-touch
black glassy surface

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.800 align:middle line:84%
until he felt raised
symbols spanning

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.210 align:middle line:84%
about three feet of the craft
near one of its corners.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.330 align:middle line:84%
As soon as his fingers
touched the symbols,

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.270 align:middle line:84%
he received a
telepathic download

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.910 align:middle line:84%
of 0's and 1's, binary code,
that filled his mind's eye

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.630 align:middle line:84%
and would not leave until
back at his Ipswich home,

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.260 align:middle line:84%
where he wrote the binary
code down in his notebook.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And according to
Sergeant Penniston,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.930 align:middle line:84%
he never showed the
numbers in his notebook

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.390 align:middle line:84%
to anyone, not at the time and
not even to John Burroughs.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.280 align:middle line:84%
John doesn't remember seeing Jim
or the black triangular craft

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.400 align:middle line:84%
or the camera or hearing
anything from Sergeant

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.180 align:middle line:84%
Penniston about receiving
a download of 0's and 1's

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.430 align:middle line:84%
after touching the symbols
and writing them down

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.780 align:middle line:90%
in a notebook.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.530 align:middle line:84%
In fact, none of us
knew about or had

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.830 align:middle line:84%
seen binary code in Jim
Penniston's notebook

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.020 align:middle line:84%
until October 2, 2010, when
John, Jim, and I were working

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.510 align:middle line:84%
with the "Ancient
Aliens" series produced

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.170 align:middle line:84%
by Prometheus Entertainment
for the History Channel.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.750 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day,
when interviews were done

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.730 align:middle line:84%
and the crew was
about to wrap up,

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.220 align:middle line:84%
Jim asked John if
he had ever showed

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.880 align:middle line:84%
him the 0's and
1's in his notebook

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.030 align:middle line:84%
that Jim then pulled
out of a briefcase.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.320 align:middle line:10%
John and I looked at the several
pages of 0's and 1's, and John

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.340 align:middle line:10%
seemed genuinely shocked, saying
he had never seen the notebook

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.200 align:middle line:10%
numbers before.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.760 align:middle line:10%
And that's when Jim Penniston
said that for 30 years

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.980 align:middle line:10%
he had not shown or discussed
the binary code with anyone.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.080 align:middle line:84%
The "Ancient Aliens"
producers and I

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.200 align:middle line:84%
agreed that we would each
investigate the binary code

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.520 align:middle line:84%
pages to see if they
could be translated.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.270 align:middle line:10%
I worked with American retired
astronomer and telescope maker

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.140 align:middle line:10%
Michael Reed, PhD, who
had constructed telescopes

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.680 align:middle line:10%
at the University of
Arizona using standard ASCII

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.580 align:middle line:10%
7-bit and 8-bit code where
combinations of seven

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.750 align:middle line:10%
and eight groups of 0's and 1's
can be translated to numbers,

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.170 align:middle line:10%
letters, and pronunciation.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.970 align:middle line:10%
For example, on the top line
of this ASCII code chart,

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:18.965 align:middle line:10%
the number 0 equals 0, 0,
1, 1, a space, 0, 0, 0, 0.

00:05:18.965 --> 00:05:22.550 align:middle line:10%
And to the far right,
the lower case letter

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:31.160 align:middle line:10%
m equals 0, 1, 1, 0,
space, 1, 1, 0, 1.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.460 align:middle line:10%
Working each page at
a time and marking off

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.370 align:middle line:10%
the string of numbers
in ASCII code,

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.460 align:middle line:10%
words emerged on the
right side, which

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.730 align:middle line:10%
put together look like this--

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:48.950 align:middle line:10%
exploration of humanity,
possibly the numbers 3,

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:55.980 align:middle line:10%
3, 3, or 6, 6, 6, and then
the number 8, 1, 0, 0.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Continuing the
binary code, there

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.610 align:middle line:84%
is a latitude and
longitude, followed

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.940 align:middle line:90%
by the word continuous.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:11.330 align:middle line:10%
The latitude and longitude
shown here is 52, space,

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:22.430 align:middle line:10%
0942532 north latitude, and
1, space, 3131269 longitude.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Because Penniston's string of
0's and 1's in his notebook

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.240 align:middle line:84%
had no designation for
where decimal points should

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.560 align:middle line:84%
be in any of the latitudes
and longitudes given,

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.600 align:middle line:84%
this latitude and longitude
is only one interpretation,

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.430 align:middle line:90%
and more about that in a minute.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.690 align:middle line:84%
After the word
continuous are the words

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.590 align:middle line:90%
for planetary advance.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:54.280 align:middle line:10%
Then comes fourth coordinate,
continuous question mark,

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:59.880 align:middle line:10%
all caps CEPR, question
mark, and the word before.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:05.850 align:middle line:10%
The last letter E of the word
before are the final 0, 1, 0,

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:12.840 align:middle line:10%
0, space, 0, 1, 0, 1 that
Staff Sergeant Penniston wrote

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.540 align:middle line:10%
on this page of his notebook--

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:21.780 align:middle line:10%
exploration of humanity,
8,100, latitude, longitude,

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:26.040 align:middle line:10%
question mark, continuous
for planetary advance,

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:31.410 align:middle line:10%
fourth coordinate, continuous,
question mark, and the word

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.150 align:middle line:10%
before.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.030 align:middle line:10%
Since there were no
decimal designators

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:40.320 align:middle line:10%
in any of the stream of 0's and
1's, the latitude and longitude

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:45.000 align:middle line:10%
could be any number of 24
possible geographic options

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.230 align:middle line:10%
on earth.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.210 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Reed picked
one that he thought

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:51.420 align:middle line:10%
was logical, town
center, Woodbridge.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:57.000 align:middle line:10%
The idea was that if the black
triangle were an unmanned drone

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.760 align:middle line:10%
with some kind of
mission on earth,

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.670 align:middle line:10%
it would have to constantly
be sending its location

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.460 align:middle line:10%
and receiving instructions
from its maker.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.330 align:middle line:84%
The Woodbridge, England town
hall latitude and longitude

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.730 align:middle line:84%
is close to one
of the binary code

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.200 align:middle line:90%
latitude, longitude options.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:18.120 align:middle line:84%
Another interpretation by the
"Ancient Aliens" TV production,

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.180 align:middle line:84%
using a different and arbitrary
placement of the decimal point,

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.170 align:middle line:84%
ended up further west from
Woodbridge in the Atlantic

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:29.340 align:middle line:84%
Ocean off the coast of Ireland,
where old maps like this one

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:37.380 align:middle line:84%
from 1570 labeled an island as
Brasil, spelled B-R-A-S-I-L,

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:42.030 align:middle line:84%
also known as Hy-Brasil,
highlighted by a yellow circle

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.500 align:middle line:90%
next to it.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.500 align:middle line:10%
The last documented
sighting of Hy-Brasil

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:53.700 align:middle line:10%
was in 1872 when author TJ
Westropp and several companions

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:59.580 align:middle line:10%
literally saw the island
appear and then vanish.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:03.750 align:middle line:84%
This was Mr. Westropp's third
view of the Irish island.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.990 align:middle line:84%
But on this trip, he had brought
his mother and some friends

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:11.380 align:middle line:84%
to verify its existence
when, for reasons unknown,

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:15.630 align:middle line:84%
the small island disappeared
before their eyes.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:18.150 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant Penniston
also deliberately

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:22.470 align:middle line:84%
held back from the public
other pages of binary code

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:25.980 align:middle line:90%
in his notebook, until 2011.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And then he released these
other geographic locations

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:33.390 align:middle line:84%
that he said were also encoded
in his telepathic binary

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:34.410 align:middle line:90%
download.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:38.730 align:middle line:10%
They included Caracol,
Belize, Sedona, Arizona,

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:43.170 align:middle line:10%
the Great Pyramid in Giza,
Egypt, the Nazca Lines in Peru,

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:47.460 align:middle line:10%
Taishan Qu in China, the
portal at the temple of Apollo

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.180 align:middle line:10%
in Naxos, Greece, and
these strange words,

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.970 align:middle line:10%
eyes of your eyes.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:58.950 align:middle line:10%
And then that word origin
with a latitude and longitude

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.530 align:middle line:10%
which could be
Hy-Brasil or the town

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:07.770 align:middle line:10%
center of Woodbridge, England,
or 22 other locations on earth.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.530 align:middle line:10%
The origin year 8100--

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:15.420 align:middle line:10%
does that mean year 8100?

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.090 align:middle line:84%
From the 21st
century, that is not

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.670 align:middle line:84%
40,000 years in
the future, which

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.640 align:middle line:84%
is a time frame that
Jim Penniston thought

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.230 align:middle line:84%
might be true to that black
triangle in the forest.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:32.820 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps the number
8,100 in the alien world

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.970 align:middle line:84%
of other dimensions and
point-to-point travel

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.470 align:middle line:90%
has a different context.

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:41.380 align:middle line:90%
What does this all mean?

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Penniston told us that
a few weeks after his

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.760 align:middle line:84%
and John's December 26, 1980
light encounters in Rendlesham

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Forest, that he was ordered
to do a sodium pentothal

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:58.180 align:middle line:84%
hypnosis by US and UK
intelligence agents.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:02.500 align:middle line:84%
The agents seemed to already
know about lights transmitting

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.240 align:middle line:90%
binary code.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And they told Penniston
they knew that he was not

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.920 align:middle line:90%
telling them everything.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.050 align:middle line:84%
After that hypnosis,
Penniston worried

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.810 align:middle line:84%
that the drug-induced
hypnosis session

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:20.370 align:middle line:84%
had manipulated his mind or
they tried to erase his memory.

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to remember
what happened more clearly.

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:27.930 align:middle line:84%
14 years later, Jim
Penniston contacted

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:32.190 align:middle line:84%
doctor and hypnotherapist
Sharon Grossman in Illinois

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.410 align:middle line:84%
to see if he could
find out more.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:37.650 align:middle line:84%
Staff Sergeant Jim
Penniston's interrogators

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:40.470 align:middle line:84%
at RAF Bentwaters
Woodbridge already

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:44.370 align:middle line:84%
seemed to have prior knowledge
about glowing lights, craft,

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.770 align:middle line:90%
symbols, and binary code.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Jim's hypnosis
session to find out

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:54.660 align:middle line:84%
what they got from him in
that pentothal hypnosis

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:59.910 align:middle line:84%
was on September 10, 1994
with Sharon Grossman.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:02.550 align:middle line:84%
In these next excerpts,
even though Jim

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:06.360 align:middle line:84%
insists he had not told anyone
about touching the raised

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.960 align:middle line:84%
symbols on the craft or
getting binary transmission

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:14.400 align:middle line:84%
into his mind, the American and
the British intelligence agents

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.170 align:middle line:84%
already knew about
the symbols and wanted

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.280 align:middle line:90%
Jim to tell them more.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Jim Penniston, quote, "I see
the craft, the lights dissipate.

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:29.670 align:middle line:84%
They, the intelligence
agents, they

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:33.870 align:middle line:84%
want to know what
symbols I'm seeing.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:39.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to tell
them, but I tell them.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.730 align:middle line:84%
They want to know
what I did next.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:46.800 align:middle line:84%
I said, I felt the symbols,
because they were raised.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.340 align:middle line:84%
I tell them about the
lights, white light.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:53.010 align:middle line:84%
They already know
about the lights.

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:57.870 align:middle line:84%
They're asking me if
I see binary code.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:01.150 align:middle line:90%
I do see the binary code.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.850 align:middle line:90%
They are slowing me down."

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:07.370 align:middle line:10%
The hypnotherapist asks,
"What's happening now.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.050 align:middle line:10%
I understand.

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:11.840 align:middle line:10%
What do you understand
about the code?

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.790 align:middle line:10%
I'm the interpreter.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:17.810 align:middle line:10%
They need interpreters--
the lights.

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:21.590 align:middle line:10%
The lights-- so what
is the code saying?

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:25.670 align:middle line:10%
You can't read these codes
unless you have an interpreter.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.130 align:middle line:84%
I understand what's
going on now.

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:31.020 align:middle line:90%
The symbols, what do they mean?

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:34.100 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it's information
being exchanged.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.520 align:middle line:84%
That machine, the
black triangular craft,

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.650 align:middle line:90%
that's for interpreters.

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:42.620 align:middle line:90%
There are lots of interpreters.

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.900 align:middle line:90%
You are an interpreter?

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.130 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:48.710 align:middle line:84%
Can you interpret
that code for me?

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:49.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.220 align:middle line:90%
We'll do that now.

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:56.270 align:middle line:90%
Explain, mission, purpose.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.100 align:middle line:90%
And the mission is?

00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.480 align:middle line:90%
Contact.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.970 align:middle line:90%
Do they say contact with what?

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:03.570 align:middle line:90%
Us.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:04.930 align:middle line:90%
Purpose?

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:06.510 align:middle line:90%
Research.

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:07.860 align:middle line:90%
For?

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.684 align:middle line:90%
To help them.

00:14:09.684 --> 00:14:12.580 align:middle line:90%
To help them with what?

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.400 align:middle line:90%
Themselves.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.790 align:middle line:90%
They are time travelers.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.680 align:middle line:90%
They are us.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.870 align:middle line:90%
They are us from?

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.440 align:middle line:90%
The future.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.020 align:middle line:90%
How far is the future?

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:29.570 align:middle line:90%
A long time, very long time."

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:32.840 align:middle line:84%
Penniston thinks 40,000
years in the future.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.330 align:middle line:90%
"What do they need from here?

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.625 align:middle line:84%
They need something
from all interpreters.

00:14:38.625 --> 00:14:41.180 align:middle line:90%
Well, what do they need?

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:44.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure, but it has to do
with chromosomes or something

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:46.520 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.960 align:middle line:90%
And how do they get that?

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.670 align:middle line:90%
They take it.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:52.570 align:middle line:10%
From where?

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:55.760 align:middle line:10%
From the other people's bodies.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.330 align:middle line:10%
Where did they take it from you?

00:14:58.330 --> 00:14:59.470 align:middle line:10%
Didn't.

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:01.810 align:middle line:10%
But you were an interpreter?

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:04.090 align:middle line:10%
We only interrupted.

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:07.930 align:middle line:10%
They, the time travelers,
were interrupted.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:09.910 align:middle line:10%
They are having problems.

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:13.690 align:middle line:10%
The programs-- I understand
what they are saying,

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:16.630 align:middle line:10%
but they weren't
supposed to be there.

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:19.090 align:middle line:90%
They are having problems.

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:22.990 align:middle line:90%
The odds are against them.

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:27.040 align:middle line:84%
You weren't supposed to
understand the program?

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.740 align:middle line:84%
No, by touching these
things, the raised symbols

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:35.170 align:middle line:84%
on the craft, I activated these
symbols, the 0's and the 1's.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:38.830 align:middle line:84%
You touch the symbols and
you set off a program?

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:43.480 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the craft was
repairing itself.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:49.420 align:middle line:84%
All they wanted was a place to
stay while it repaired itself.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And by touching the symbols, you
disrupted the repair program?

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:57.090 align:middle line:90%
I activated a binary code.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:59.550 align:middle line:84%
The two government
men want to know why.

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:02.820 align:middle line:84%
They asked me if I ever
had any other encounters

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:06.190 align:middle line:84%
with them, the lights and
the time travelers before.

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:07.410 align:middle line:90%
I haven't.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:10.620 align:middle line:84%
Are they using us something
like breeding stock?

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:14.310 align:middle line:10%
No, like band-aids.

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:16.740 align:middle line:90%
Do they ever take fetuses?

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.260 align:middle line:90%
If it is tasked, they do.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.990 align:middle line:84%
There are different
ships for tasking.

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:24.720 align:middle line:10%
The government agents
know about this.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.710 align:middle line:84%
That's why they want to
contain the situation.

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:32.720 align:middle line:84%
They see you as
requiring damage control?

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.200 align:middle line:84%
They see me and John
Burroughs and they're

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:41.170 align:middle line:84%
worried about Colonel Halt.
They know all about us.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:43.240 align:middle line:10%
Does the government
believe what you

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.540 align:middle line:10%
are saying about them
coming from the future?

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:48.160 align:middle line:10%
Oh, yes.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.680 align:middle line:10%
This time, they,
the time travelers,

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.300 align:middle line:10%
were having problems.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.610 align:middle line:10%
But they got their machine off.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.550 align:middle line:10%
They have to be out
in space to travel.

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:00.960 align:middle line:10%
They need speed to travel.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.630 align:middle line:10%
To travel through time?

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:06.810 align:middle line:10%
To go backwards, they
can't go forward.

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:09.540 align:middle line:10%
They can't go into their future?

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.089 align:middle line:10%
They go to their past,
it's impossible to go

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:12.970 align:middle line:10%
into the future.

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:15.250 align:middle line:90%
It takes too much energy.

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:18.300 align:middle line:84%
How far into the
past can they go?

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:22.680 align:middle line:84%
These ships can go
40,000 or 50,000 years.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.810 align:middle line:84%
They can't go back
much further, they

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:26.990 align:middle line:90%
might not be able to get back.

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, why do they
come back so far?

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't
affect the timeline.

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:36.420 align:middle line:84%
The farther it is, the
better, the least effect

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.820 align:middle line:90%
it has on changing the future.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:42.690 align:middle line:84%
They can't control it,
it's too cumbersome.

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:46.870 align:middle line:84%
What are the intelligence
agents going to do with you?

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:49.810 align:middle line:84%
They tell me when I was at
the East Gate with John,

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:52.600 align:middle line:84%
they have five different
stories to tell.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.270 align:middle line:84%
It's important to
scramble dates, that

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:58.930 align:middle line:84%
confuses and undermines the
consistency of eyewitness

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:03.250 align:middle line:84%
testimonies, so no credibility
with the public and the media.

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:05.950 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
give me a warning.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:09.370 align:middle line:84%
They tell me that I
will hurt the world.

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:13.510 align:middle line:84%
It will breach national security
and can destroy the system,

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:17.110 align:middle line:84%
cause wars, chaos
in the streets.

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:20.320 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's so
important to keep it quiet.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.900 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't
make any difference

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:28.150 align:middle line:84%
if I talk about this story
because it's too unbelievable,"

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:29.560 align:middle line:90%
closed quote.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.050 align:middle line:84%
When we were in
England, December 2010,

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:35.050 align:middle line:84%
for the 30th anniversary
TV production

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:38.560 align:middle line:84%
with "Ancient Aliens,"
John became increasingly

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.690 align:middle line:84%
certain that he
and Jim Penniston

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:44.100 align:middle line:84%
must have been further to
the south in the forest

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.870 align:middle line:84%
across from the finger
of trees that juts

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:50.560 align:middle line:84%
between the big field and
the smaller Capel Green,

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.200 align:middle line:84%
where the white arrow
ends, in Rendlesham Forest

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.440 align:middle line:84%
next to Capel Green
is where we explored.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And Jim Penniston began to
recall the traumatic night

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:01.605 align:middle line:90%
long ago.

00:19:01.605 --> 00:19:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>>This is the area.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:06.316 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I got it.

00:19:06.316 --> 00:19:08.581 align:middle line:90%
This is recall.

00:19:08.581 --> 00:19:10.345 align:middle line:84%
It almost broke
our neck down, we

00:19:10.345 --> 00:19:12.290 align:middle line:90%
didn't know the fence was there.

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:14.410 align:middle line:90%
That was the problem.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:16.432 align:middle line:84%
We thought, we'd just
cross from up here,

00:19:16.432 --> 00:19:17.890 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a
sudden we weren't

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:20.088 align:middle line:90%
expecting the second fence.

00:19:20.088 --> 00:19:21.970 align:middle line:90%
That's what happened.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:25.480 align:middle line:84%
>>And so this house right
here on the other side

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:31.000 align:middle line:84%
of this finger of trees is
the one that Halt said glowed.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.350 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, that did glow.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.630 align:middle line:84%
But the actual house that
we're talking with barnyards

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:36.450 align:middle line:84%
is right down here
in front of us.

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.542 align:middle line:90%
>>And now, OK, so.

00:19:39.542 --> 00:19:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>>You can't see it from here.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.870 align:middle line:90%


00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>>Do you think that you
guys ran out into that field

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:51.510 align:middle line:84%
and that finger is
where the water is?

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, and you and I
were wet because we're

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.660 align:middle line:84%
running this way
across it, we're

00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.940 align:middle line:84%
pursuing the light
at that point.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this is it,
I'm OK with it.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Landing site is
in here somewhere.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:04.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:15.256 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:17.248 align:middle line:90%
This is really puzzling.

00:20:17.248 --> 00:20:25.216 align:middle line:90%


00:20:25.216 --> 00:20:29.220 align:middle line:84%
We came up here,
hit the ground here.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:31.050 align:middle line:90%
And here is this berming area.

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:37.798 align:middle line:90%


00:20:37.798 --> 00:20:41.180 align:middle line:90%
This--yeah.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.600 align:middle line:90%
We're close.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.400 align:middle line:84%
I can get it pinpointed
at the exact spot.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.190 align:middle line:90%


00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>>So somewhere back
in there is the spot

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:53.100 align:middle line:84%
where you touched the
craft and the symbols.

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, we came in
on logging route 10.

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:58.750 align:middle line:90%
Probably didn't go as far.

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:00.780 align:middle line:90%
The trees were different then.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>>And now the issue is, what
was the angle that you ran out

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:06.186 align:middle line:90%
into the field?

00:21:06.186 --> 00:21:08.336 align:middle line:84%
>>Back there, I was
hoping [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:08.336 --> 00:21:09.308 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:21:09.308 --> 00:21:12.224 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, I
can't determine that.

00:21:12.224 --> 00:21:14.168 align:middle line:90%
I can't determine that.

00:21:14.168 --> 00:21:19.028 align:middle line:90%


00:21:19.028 --> 00:21:21.460 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE], that's another one.

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:22.260 align:middle line:90%
They're all over.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, but boy does this feels
like that [INAUDIBLE] photo.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:34.060 align:middle line:90%


00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.750 align:middle line:84%
Jim and John remembered
getting wet and cold,

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:39.730 align:middle line:84%
but neither can remember
where that happened

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:42.670 align:middle line:84%
until we explored
this finger of trees

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.920 align:middle line:90%
and found this marshy water.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:49.010 align:middle line:84%
The water was about 300 feet
east of the Rendlesham Forest

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:51.940 align:middle line:84%
site next to Capel
Green that Jim and John

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:55.450 align:middle line:84%
felt was where they had
their close encounter.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:58.150 align:middle line:84%
The water is in
the finger of trees

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.790 align:middle line:84%
that extends into the
farm field on the north

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:02.730 align:middle line:90%
end of Capel Green.

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And it would explain how
both men got wet around 4:00

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:11.655 align:middle line:84%
AM on December 28, 1980, as they
ran from the forest encounter

00:22:11.655 --> 00:22:17.110 align:middle line:84%
site out into Capel
Green chasing the lights.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:21.130 align:middle line:10%
After midnight on
December 26, 2010,

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:25.120 align:middle line:10%
the exact 30th anniversary of
the original first encounter

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:29.740 align:middle line:10%
with the mysterious lights and
beams, we stayed up all night

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.650 align:middle line:10%
and Jim and John walked
with the TriField meter

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:35.590 align:middle line:10%
through the big field down to
the line of Rendlesham Forest

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:37.900 align:middle line:10%
trees along Capel Green.

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.470 align:middle line:84%
At the red circle on this
map, the TriField meter

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:43.930 align:middle line:84%
pegged out on the
electric scale,

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:46.810 align:middle line:84%
indicating strong
electrostatic energy.

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:50.560 align:middle line:84%
The next night after
midnight on December 27,

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:54.710 align:middle line:84%
I was with John and British
engineer Winston Keech

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.610 align:middle line:84%
for a night watch
in Capel Green.

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is an
infrared video frame

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:05.110 align:middle line:84%
and the white image is the heat
given off by John and Winston.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:08.140 align:middle line:84%
I was running an
infrared video camera

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.600 align:middle line:84%
when the two men approached
the finger of trees

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.820 align:middle line:90%
with the TriField meter.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Just like the night
before, the needle

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:19.540 align:middle line:84%
pegged out on the electric
scale at about the same place

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:25.810 align:middle line:84%
that was only some 300 feet from
the Rendlesham Forest UFO site

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:28.760 align:middle line:90%
of the black glassy triangle.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.000 align:middle line:84%
While John and
Winston were exploring

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.870 align:middle line:84%
along the finger of trees,
they both thought that they

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:37.360 align:middle line:90%
saw small blue lights.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Here is one of Winston's
time-lapse camera frames

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:43.720 align:middle line:84%
that captured a
blue light moving

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:47.380 align:middle line:84%
through trees and
anomalous orange-red lights

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.570 align:middle line:90%
in front of the trees.

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:51.910 align:middle line:84%
In this photo, Jim
and John walked

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:55.660 align:middle line:84%
straight toward my camera from
the Rendlesham Forest site

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.450 align:middle line:90%
behind them on to Capel Green.

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:01.450 align:middle line:84%
The marshy finger of
trees is to the right.

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:05.500 align:middle line:84%
The Capel Green field also
seems to match John Burroughs'

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:10.720 align:middle line:84%
handwritten statement about the
December 26, 1989 night when

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.230 align:middle line:84%
John and Sergeant
Penniston walked out

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:18.100 align:middle line:84%
of Rendlesham Forest,
tripped on a wire fence,

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:21.700 align:middle line:84%
crossed over into a small field
that would have been Capel

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:26.860 align:middle line:84%
Green and went forward following
lights into trees where

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.510 align:middle line:90%
they got wet.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:32.230 align:middle line:84%
So between the end of
the straight white road

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:35.830 align:middle line:84%
and the edge of Capel
Green is the white circle

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:39.880 align:middle line:84%
where both John and
Jim now are convinced

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:43.750 align:middle line:84%
they encountered the lights
up close in Rendlesham Forest.

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:47.830 align:middle line:84%
Straight east is the red circle
where the TriField meter pegged

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:52.150 align:middle line:84%
on the electric scale after
midnight on both December

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:56.590 align:middle line:90%
26 and December 27, 2010.

00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Capel Green also has the space
needed for all the light-alls,

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.720 align:middle line:84%
trucks, and people that
Bentwaters Deputy Base

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Commander Charles Halt
organized on December 28, 1980.

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:14.500 align:middle line:10%
Remember that Airman
Lori Buoen and John

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:18.220 align:middle line:10%
Trementozzi on
December 27, 1980,

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.670 align:middle line:10%
after midnight, were
at the East Gate

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:24.800 align:middle line:10%
when they both heard
on their military radio

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.820 align:middle line:10%
the D-Flight Shift
Commander Bonnie Tamplin

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:31.240 align:middle line:10%
was crying out in fear
to Master Sergeant Robert

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.790 align:middle line:10%
Ball in Rendlesham Forest.

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:38.200 align:middle line:84%
The airman knew that all the
base colonels were notified,

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:42.730 align:middle line:84%
including Deputy Base Commander
Lieutenant Charles Halt.

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And John Burroughs learned
a light had entered

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Lieutenant Tamplin's vehicle,
causing her to panic so greatly

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:52.930 align:middle line:90%
that she was relieved of duty.

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:56.380 align:middle line:84%
We also were told that
lieutenant Tamplin never

00:25:56.380 --> 00:26:00.210 align:middle line:84%
did return to work at RAF
Bentwaters Woodbridge.

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:03.700 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Halt told me that one
beam came down to the ground

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.950 align:middle line:84%
only a few feet from
his shoes, and he

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:08.920 align:middle line:84%
was confused about whether
that was an act of aggression

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:09.970 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:12.760 align:middle line:84%
But Colonel Halt gave John
Burroughs and Sergeant Adrian

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:16.540 align:middle line:84%
Bustinza permission to go
closer toward the lights.

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant Bustinza
told John and me

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:22.660 align:middle line:84%
that he saw a red orange
area light surround John.

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly Sergeant
Bustinza was on the ground

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:26.890 align:middle line:84%
and John Burroughs
does not remember

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:29.680 align:middle line:84%
what happened, except
that later Bustinza told

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:34.000 align:middle line:84%
John, quote, "the light
forced me to the ground,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.260 align:middle line:84%
and I saw the red-orange light
come over you," closed quote.

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
second time in 72 hours

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:43.270 align:middle line:84%
that Airman First
Class John Burroughs

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:46.600 align:middle line:84%
was engulfed in bright
light and terahertz

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:50.850 align:middle line:84%
radiation from unidentified
aerial phenomena.

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Within a year of the December
1980 Rendlesham Forest light

00:26:54.880 --> 00:27:00.250 align:middle line:84%
encounters, John Burroughs,
only 21 years old, became ill

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:02.740 align:middle line:84%
and was diagnosed with
a heart murmur, which

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:06.730 align:middle line:84%
he did not have when he
joined the Air Force at age 18

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:08.650 align:middle line:90%
in 1978.

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:11.940 align:middle line:84%
30 years later, on that
anniversary TV production

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:15.880 align:middle line:84%
in Woodbridge, none of us,
including John Burroughs,

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:20.200 align:middle line:84%
expected that within a month of
returning to the United States,

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.720 align:middle line:84%
John Burroughs would
become very ill.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Throughout 2011 to
December 18, 2013,

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:29.710 align:middle line:84%
he was in and out of hospitals
with atrial fibrillation

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:31.510 align:middle line:90%
problems in his heart.

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:37.570 align:middle line:84%
By December 18, 2013, John had
to have life-saving surgery.

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And the information
that saved him

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:43.000 align:middle line:84%
came from a CIA
medical doctor who

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.430 align:middle line:84%
knew that the UFO-UAP phenomenon
emits terahertz frequencies

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:53.770 align:middle line:84%
that can manipulate human
minds and damage human tissues,

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:56.950 align:middle line:90%
including human hearts.
