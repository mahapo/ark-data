special is Tim, a
tactical advisor

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.270 align:middle line:10%
to covert German
analysts who are trying

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.120 align:middle line:10%
to understand the
missions and strategies

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.540 align:middle line:10%
of non-human intelligences
on our planet,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.360 align:middle line:10%
in this solar system and beyond.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Tim, welcome to this special
edition of "Truth Hunter."

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.510 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Thank you,
Linda, for having me.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: In terms of the Greys
having knowledge that you may

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.260 align:middle line:84%
have overheard in telepathy
or they have put it into you

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.510 align:middle line:84%
directly, have you gained any
information about the reptiles

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.830 align:middle line:90%
from the Greys--

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.870 align:middle line:84%
at least from the
Greys' point of view

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.530 align:middle line:84%
about what the Reptilians
specifically want

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.140 align:middle line:84%
and what the relationship
is between the Greys

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.400 align:middle line:90%
and the Reptilians?

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So first of all, I need
to say that reptile is only

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.500 align:middle line:84%
like a classification,
genetically,

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.700 align:middle line:90%
of a certain species.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.675 align:middle line:84%
So if we're talking
about reptiles,

00:01:20.675 --> 00:01:25.430 align:middle line:84%
there are many, many species
that fall into this group.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And for example, I had one
occasion where I accidentally

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.220 align:middle line:90%
ran into a reptile life form.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDA: Which type?

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.065 align:middle line:90%
Lizard or alligator or what?

00:01:37.065 --> 00:01:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So the story
is as follows.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.860 align:middle line:84%
There was a certain event
where people gathered

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.310 align:middle line:84%
and someone came
up to me and seemed

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.330 align:middle line:84%
to be quite of interest
of me and asked me

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.670 align:middle line:90%
if I'm as well a chameleon.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.146 align:middle line:84%
So-- I mean, I
was thinking about

00:01:57.146 --> 00:02:00.200 align:middle line:84%
in a philosophical way
about my standpoint

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.870 align:middle line:84%
on society and the way, maybe,
fitting into society and stuff,

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.060 align:middle line:90%
and I just said, yes sure.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.694 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDA: A chameleon blends in?

00:02:09.694 --> 00:02:11.149 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Like a metaphor in some way.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.130 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, that seemed
to be quite literal,

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.350 align:middle line:90%
what he was asking.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Because what I then learned
and this being started

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.210 align:middle line:90%
to talk to me about credits.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.390 align:middle line:90%
He said, oh, good.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.950 align:middle line:84%
I have gathered x amount
of credits already.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And I thought like, what
are you talking about?

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.660 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea where this
conversation is going,

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.460 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.240 align:middle line:84%
So I just said like,
I mean, like, yeah.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.110 align:middle line:90%
OK, cool.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.820 align:middle line:90%
Good for you and stuff.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
moment where I learned

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.830 align:middle line:84%
that the universe itself
has a currency that

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.480 align:middle line:84%
is called Galactic credit or
however you want to call it.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.920 align:middle line:90%
And it's based upon gold.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:02.144 align:middle line:84%
And this being seemed to be
part of a group of reptiles that

00:03:02.144 --> 00:03:08.990 align:middle line:84%
blended into society by
irradiating frequency

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.360 align:middle line:90%
so that they seemed human.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.985 align:middle line:90%
They seem to be in a human form.

00:03:12.985 --> 00:03:15.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: Was it involved
with your German group?

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Was that meeting involved
through the German group?

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: The specific subject or
person that we're talking about

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.165 align:middle line:90%
wasn't involved with that.

00:03:26.165 --> 00:03:31.340 align:middle line:84%
This specific group seems
to be on a kind of mission

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.110 align:middle line:84%
in order to gain as
many profit as possible.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDA: Profit?

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:38.810 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Profit.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Out of the situation that
Earth is facing right now.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.105 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: And it would be profit
in barter, profit in what?

00:03:47.105 --> 00:03:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So in this
particular case,

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.750 align:middle line:84%
it seems like the profit comes
from what he was referring

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.360 align:middle line:84%
to as credits, which seems to
be a currency that is being used

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.530 align:middle line:84%
in the interstellar relationship
to different other planets.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:10.430 align:middle line:84%
It's gold-based and this
particular reptile being

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.920 align:middle line:84%
and his group,
which I've not met,

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.240 align:middle line:84%
but he seemed to be looking
for members of his group,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.649 align:middle line:84%
and I caught his attention
and he came up to me

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:29.330 align:middle line:84%
and this being was able to
bring out a frequency that

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.560 align:middle line:90%
seems to be human.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.700 align:middle line:84%
So I was looking
at a human figure.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDA: Yeah.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.770 align:middle line:90%
They're called holoforms.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Oh good.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDA: They project holoforms.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.500 align:middle line:84%
It's like a
holographic technology.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.030 align:middle line:84%
It's highly refined, and it's my
understanding that a projected

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.970 align:middle line:84%
holoform over the
beings that use it,

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.980 align:middle line:84%
we would think that
it was a human,

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.330 align:middle line:90%
we could literally touch.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:56.540 align:middle line:84%
But that it's a light projected,
and it is a camouflage.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.140 align:middle line:84%
It can even be a
cactus in the desert.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.940 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: It-- yes.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: It could be
an ET projecting as--

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And this very specific
species was doing it

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.510 align:middle line:90%
by their psionic features.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.460 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't use a technology,
but they used their own very

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.700 align:middle line:90%
strong psionics in order to--

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.000 align:middle line:84%
exactly what the technology
would do, how did you call it?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.145 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDA: A holoform.

00:05:22.145 --> 00:05:23.310 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: A holoform.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.650 align:middle line:90%
So that's what they created.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.110 align:middle line:84%
They banded the
light in such a way

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.150 align:middle line:90%
that it seemed to be a human.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing
is, because we became--

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.960 align:middle line:84%
we met on certain occasions
three, four times or something

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.240 align:middle line:84%
and had just a
private conversation

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.430 align:middle line:84%
about how this species
receives and perceives life

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.050 align:middle line:90%
and it was just curious--

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.530 align:middle line:84%
so it wasn't in the
project, something outside.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing is that this

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.850 align:middle line:84%
being needed to go back
after certain times

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:01.730 align:middle line:84%
because it could not sustain
this kind of holographic form

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:02.540 align:middle line:90%
for too long.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDA: That's right.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing is, why is that?

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.240 align:middle line:84%
It is because at that
time, the planet Earth

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.550 align:middle line:84%
is in such a strong
field of 3D consciousness

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:22.310 align:middle line:84%
or used to be in that form
that performing something that

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.550 align:middle line:84%
could be considered
magic, so to speak,

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.845 align:middle line:90%
isn't sustainable for too long.

00:06:27.845 --> 00:06:31.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: But was
he, in his holoform,

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.370 align:middle line:84%
speaking to you the
way I'm speaking to you

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:35.400 align:middle line:90%
or was it telepath?

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.200 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: No, no.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.000 align:middle line:90%
In German.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And I found that
very interesting,

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.830 align:middle line:84%
and I picked up on that
and I learned some of that.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Is that this being was able to
alter frequencies around him so

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:56.450 align:middle line:84%
that a conversation could
be done acoustically

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.550 align:middle line:84%
but everyone else in the room
could not pick up on it, which

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:01.675 align:middle line:90%
I found really interesting.

00:07:01.675 --> 00:07:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: Which would mean
controlling the minds.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.850 align:middle line:84%
Because if you can control
the language center, which

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:12.980 align:middle line:84%
I understand is truly a fact
that we're dealing with beings,

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.920 align:middle line:84%
they communicate directly
with the language center.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.520 align:middle line:84%
That's why language doesn't
matter anywhere on the Earth.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.960 align:middle line:84%
People are hearing
voices in their language.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:22.760 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: And that's
how they do it.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.330 align:middle line:84%
So if they were
in a cocktail room

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.990 align:middle line:84%
and they were controlling
all of the language centers

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.160 align:middle line:84%
around them, they could
literally blot out 99%

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.700 align:middle line:90%
and only be heard by one or two.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.010 align:middle line:84%
So in this particular
situation, this

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.340 align:middle line:84%
reptile being was
speaking verbally,

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:49.670 align:middle line:84%
but using psionic waves
and kind of create a field

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:54.800 align:middle line:84%
around the acoustics
that contradicts

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.360 align:middle line:90%
the acoustic information.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.830 align:middle line:84%
So everyone around who's not
perceiving that direct beam

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.070 align:middle line:84%
of vocalized
acoustic information

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:07.640 align:middle line:84%
would only hear some
blurrish something.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.320 align:middle line:84%
Like, excuse me,
what did you say?

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And I found that
interesting, because he

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:18.290 align:middle line:84%
was directly insulting someone
who's closely close by,

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.000 align:middle line:90%
and I thought, oh, my goodness.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.360 align:middle line:90%
That was pretty rude.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And the other guy was
like, huh, excuse me.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.520 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: If gold would be
the currency among the ETs,

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:33.110 align:middle line:84%
is gold a barter system
throughout this entire Milky

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:34.825 align:middle line:84%
Way galaxy and
maybe the universe?

00:08:34.825 --> 00:08:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Some planets have
arranged or set up a currency

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.380 align:middle line:90%
in order to--

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:47.720 align:middle line:84%
exchangement of things
into commerce, so to speak.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:52.970 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't seem to be like
a standard currency that's

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.320 align:middle line:90%
accepted everywhere.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:09:01.040 align:middle line:84%
What I assume what was happening
is that this group of reptiles

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.620 align:middle line:84%
is coming to this
planet in order

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.640 align:middle line:84%
to steal resources
from this planet,

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.240 align:middle line:84%
because it's so easy to
do, because they understand

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.110 align:middle line:84%
that there is an installation
which this group seems

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:18.530 align:middle line:90%
to not have put up onto Earth.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:21.830 align:middle line:84%
But they benefit from it
because people on Earth

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:27.290 align:middle line:84%
are so easy victims because they
do not understand how psionics

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:31.220 align:middle line:84%
work, they do not have
any defensive mechanism

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.010 align:middle line:84%
against psychic control
and so on and so forth.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:35.810 align:middle line:90%
So it's--

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: And we have
never been told the truth

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.120 align:middle line:84%
that other intelligences
are coming and going

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.660 align:middle line:84%
on our planet, which then makes
the whole human population

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:49.250 align:middle line:84%
vulnerable because we don't
have even a context in which

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:53.870 align:middle line:84%
to describe to a neighbor,
there's an ET here from Sirius.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:55.620 align:middle line:90%
We don't have that ability.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.420 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.720 align:middle line:84%
So if I understand the
current situation correctly,

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.610 align:middle line:84%
then I mean, there are forces on
this planet-- human forces that

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:08.780 align:middle line:84%
try to prevent those
situations just

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:13.790 align:middle line:84%
in the way that any
national security

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:20.430 align:middle line:84%
group tries to prevent stealth
and whatever, you name it.

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:25.260 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean that there
are still incidents, probably,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:30.972 align:middle line:84%
around the Earth where some
ET groups take advantage

00:10:30.972 --> 00:10:32.430 align:middle line:84%
of the situation
that we're having.

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:33.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDA: Of our ignorance.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, in a
respectful way, humans

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.030 align:middle line:84%
are ignorant because we
have never been taught

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.990 align:middle line:90%
and told the truth.

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:41.220 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.720 align:middle line:90%
So look at it.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.190 align:middle line:84%
If you have, for example, a
Native American group that,

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:52.590 align:middle line:84%
maybe, collects a lot
of gold or whatever

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:55.450 align:middle line:84%
and then someone comes
to them and thinks,

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.680 align:middle line:84%
oh, my goodness, that's
precious metal, we want that.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And then they give them
fake glass stones which

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:05.610 align:middle line:84%
still look fancy, then it's
pretty easy, and I mean,

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:09.150 align:middle line:84%
this literally happened
in Earth history.

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Then it's easy to
take the gold and give

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:17.400 align:middle line:84%
something that might be useless
to someone who doesn't know.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: But could this
relate to this concept

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.800 align:middle line:84%
that you have introduced
of installation?

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.515 align:middle line:84%
Installation by
reptiles that want to--

00:11:29.515 --> 00:11:30.315 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:34.825 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: --superimpose over
us as humanity on Earth--

00:11:34.825 --> 00:11:35.625 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:11:35.625 --> 00:11:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: --not to help us
evolve but to restrict us,

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.490 align:middle line:84%
because there are aspects
of reptilian civilization,

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:45.900 align:middle line:90%
they want Earth.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.290 align:middle line:10%
And they want Earth now
without humans on it.

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:52.530 align:middle line:90%
They want Earth for themselves.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Is that part of
the cross-section

00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:00.360 align:middle line:84%
of what you are talking about
that this character that you

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.100 align:middle line:84%
dealt with, could
have been trying

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:07.860 align:middle line:84%
to deal with energy systems
that are meant to curtail us?

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And if that's active, Tim, if
you look at the world condition

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.510 align:middle line:84%
today and everything
that we are up against,

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:19.320 align:middle line:84%
struggling to
survive, would that

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:23.760 align:middle line:84%
mean that the installation
is getting what it wants?

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:31.590 align:middle line:84%
So I want to make clear that
this particular species seem

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.500 align:middle line:84%
to be not responsible
for the installation.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:39.870 align:middle line:84%
They take their
advantages over humanity

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:44.480 align:middle line:84%
like for many,
many years in a way

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:49.790 align:middle line:84%
that they know how to move
around reality and to--

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:51.590 align:middle line:84%
they have a higher
consciousness,

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:57.230 align:middle line:84%
and for them it's like dealing
with a baby or something.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.815 align:middle line:84%
With a baby race, so they take
certain advantages of that.

00:13:00.815 --> 00:13:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: There have been
abduction cases where

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.630 align:middle line:84%
there have been a reptile
and a Grey next to each other

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:08.750 align:middle line:90%
while the human is on a bed.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And we're actually seen
the reptile do this

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.980 align:middle line:90%
to the Grey in a violent way.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's always
left the impression

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:24.220 align:middle line:84%
that the Greys and the Reptiles
will be found sometimes

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.770 align:middle line:84%
working together but they
don't like each other.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And then throughout
Western Europe,

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.230 align:middle line:84%
you have all of
those stone statues

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:38.560 align:middle line:84%
and the paintings of a blonde
with a sword plunging it down

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.100 align:middle line:84%
into the throat of
a snake or a dragon.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:46.240 align:middle line:84%
So all three-- the Blondes
versus the Reptiles

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.430 align:middle line:84%
versus the Greys,
it always seems

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:51.340 align:middle line:84%
to be that they are
in conflict exactly

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.000 align:middle line:90%
as that man told me in 1999.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: That's why
I wondered if you

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.770 align:middle line:90%
had that impression as well.

00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: The Greys sell these
little fabricated bodies,

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:06.320 align:middle line:84%
which makes all
these cases pretty

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.810 align:middle line:90%
hard to put into context.

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: Oh, they're
selling their own AI self

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.935 align:middle line:90%
to all of the different beings?

00:14:16.935 --> 00:14:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: You can have one.

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:20.590 align:middle line:84%
If you get in contact
with the Greys,

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:23.560 align:middle line:84%
it's possible that
even an individual

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.010 align:middle line:84%
can have one of these
little fiber printed bodies.

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:30.910 align:middle line:84%
So that doesn't mean
that the Greys themselves

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:33.790 align:middle line:84%
are involved in some
of these activities,

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:39.100 align:middle line:84%
it just means they are selling
their little fabricated

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.885 align:middle line:84%
bodies to another species
so that they can use it.

00:14:42.885 --> 00:14:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: So the Reptile was
just pissed off at his robot.

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So the interesting
thing about the Greys

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.250 align:middle line:84%
is they, as a
warrior-type species,

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:54.550 align:middle line:84%
they have this
interesting thought

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:59.740 align:middle line:84%
to collect as many warrior-type
species as possible

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and to create a network
under all these types

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:12.970 align:middle line:84%
of warrior-type species,
including human warriors,

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:15.020 align:middle line:90%
meaning military or something.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:16.840 align:middle line:84%
That is what the
Greys want to do.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Because in the end after level
6 consciousness, what they want

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:28.270 align:middle line:84%
is to have the biggest
collective warrior-type species

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:32.472 align:middle line:84%
in order to prevent
certain neuro characters,

00:15:32.472 --> 00:15:34.180 align:middle line:84%
self-destructive
aspects of the universe.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:34.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDA: The bad ones.

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:35.800 align:middle line:90%
The bad ones that are--

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:36.650 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: The bad ones.

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:42.430 align:middle line:84%
They want to collect every other
warrior-type species that is OK

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:47.230 align:middle line:84%
in order to fight for the
good, so to speak, and then

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:52.030 align:middle line:84%
use this force against
the one bad species.

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And through that, they
assume that they then

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.790 align:middle line:84%
can proceed with a
unified collective species

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.680 align:middle line:84%
because they solved
that problem.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: In your downloading
or interaction with the Greys,

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:09.580 align:middle line:84%
have you ever gotten an image of
the Nordics or the Tall Whites?

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: No.

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:13.330 align:middle line:84%
What I can say is and
what I can confirm

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:17.620 align:middle line:84%
that there is a specific
reptilian race which

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.650 align:middle line:90%
we refer to as Zorgons.

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And from that, I
would say, I can

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.755 align:middle line:84%
confirm what you said
about competing species.

00:16:26.755 --> 00:16:30.280 align:middle line:84%
You said the Greys and a
certain reptile species

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.660 align:middle line:90%
are in conflict.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.650 align:middle line:84%
From that viewpoint, I
would say that's the case.

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: And the
Zorgon looks like what?

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.135 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Dragon-type,
I would say--

00:16:40.135 --> 00:16:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDA: With a long tail.

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Do they have a long tail?

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.970 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's relative, but yes.

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:47.170 align:middle line:90%
And they have a snout.

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:50.410 align:middle line:84%
So these are beings
that also have

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:53.800 align:middle line:84%
cues to have done
time modification

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:59.050 align:middle line:84%
and seem to be trying to slow
down the evolution of Earth.

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:04.790 align:middle line:84%
But again, I'm very careful
with those accusations,

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:07.300 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, because
that's not my expertise

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:11.448 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not trying to
find exit strategies.

00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: Why do you
think that you're

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:19.750 align:middle line:84%
in a German organization
that is trying to understand

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:24.609 align:middle line:84%
the presence and motives and
goals of extraterrestrials

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:26.700 align:middle line:90%
on the planet?

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And that you've had most of
your experiences with Greys

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:35.920 align:middle line:84%
of varying types-- artificial
and robots and organic.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:36.720 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.590 align:middle line:90%
And Being 6.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: And that you have
learned about reptilians

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:44.460 align:middle line:84%
because the Greys have
a variety of experiences

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.675 align:middle line:90%
with them and relationships.

00:17:45.675 --> 00:17:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:48.930 align:middle line:10%
>>LINDA: But then
if you move over

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:53.690 align:middle line:10%
into the world that I have
been trying to navigate,

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:57.990 align:middle line:10%
and I'm in the United
States not Germany,

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:06.090 align:middle line:10%
and that the Blondes, the Tall
Whites, those humanoid species,

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:11.880 align:middle line:10%
they seem to be critical to the
American definition of moving

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.120 align:middle line:10%
out into space with help.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And that the help that we are
getting and have been getting

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:21.210 align:middle line:84%
since at least
1972, if not before,

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:26.190 align:middle line:84%
are always defined as
the 8 to 9-foot tall All

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Whites or the 6, 7,
maybe 8-foot tall Nordics

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.800 align:middle line:90%
with the blue eyes.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:39.260 align:middle line:84%
The Nordic type, you see
that in Western Europe.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.900 align:middle line:84%
That would be this
Saint Michael plunging

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:45.980 align:middle line:84%
the sword down into the mouth
of a dragon or of a snake.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Not much about the
Tall Whites anywhere.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:56.880 align:middle line:84%
But in Europe, you would say,
the Reptiles, the Blondes,

00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:02.910 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps, implied in the
nomes of history are the Greys.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:07.210 align:middle line:84%
In Europe, but not in
other parts of the planet.

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:08.670 align:middle line:90%
What do you think that means?

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:13.545 align:middle line:84%
Why would there be geopolitical
territory for three competing

00:19:13.545 --> 00:19:19.200 align:middle line:84%
ET groups and maybe only
one singular one, let's say,

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.700 align:middle line:90%
in South America?

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:21.825 align:middle line:90%
What is going on?

00:19:21.825 --> 00:19:25.560 align:middle line:10%
>>TIM: What I understand is
that different ET species have

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:31.200 align:middle line:10%
placed different sample groups
or different genetic humans,

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.520 align:middle line:10%
genetically manipulated
original humans,

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.620 align:middle line:10%
on different places
on the Earth.

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And not all of them were
Greys, not all of them

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:44.280 align:middle line:90%
were reptiles, whatever.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:50.400 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about a
number of at least 15 species,

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.540 align:middle line:84%
probably more than have
placed different sample groups

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.690 align:middle line:84%
on different territories
on the Earth.

00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:59.670 align:middle line:84%
What then seemed
to have happened

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:03.150 align:middle line:84%
is that some of
the sample groups

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:08.490 align:middle line:84%
that developed very
peacefully, very harmonically,

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:14.670 align:middle line:84%
that these were
invaded or conquered

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:18.210 align:middle line:84%
by those sample groups
that have a higher

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:20.415 align:middle line:90%
tendency towards aggression.

00:20:20.415 --> 00:20:21.395 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDA: Oh, yeah.

00:20:21.395 --> 00:20:22.195 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:20:22.195 --> 00:20:25.930 align:middle line:84%
So some of these sample
groups have gone underground,

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:29.430 align:middle line:84%
some of these sample
groups were re-collected

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:31.530 align:middle line:84%
and some just
disappeared and we don't

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:32.940 align:middle line:90%
know what happened to them.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Some might be extinct as well
from inner human conflict,

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:38.370 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:41.900 align:middle line:10%
I've seen documents--
not that I'm--

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.700 align:middle line:10%
have communicated
with the species

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.860 align:middle line:10%
and I don't have too many
informations on that,

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:52.020 align:middle line:10%
but there seem to, for example,
be a very specific sample

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:55.900 align:middle line:10%
group placed in the
continent of India,

00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:03.360 align:middle line:10%
which is the original sample
group that all the Germans

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.710 align:middle line:10%
today originated from.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:10.050 align:middle line:10%
So there seems to be a
sample group in India that

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:16.290 align:middle line:10%
was the original Germans
that have been placed there

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:19.370 align:middle line:10%
from many, many
thousands of years ago.

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And as Germany is a
Indo-Germanic tribe that went

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:30.450 align:middle line:84%
from India, was forcefully
pushed away from India,

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.930 align:middle line:84%
went through Russia, and then
ended up in the German forests

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:39.420 align:middle line:90%
and all the way became--

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDA: And they were Aryans?

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:42.360 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.070 align:middle line:90%
That's what I wanted to say.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.255 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: Blonde hair,
white skin, blue eyes.

00:21:46.255 --> 00:21:47.055 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:21:47.055 --> 00:21:49.410 align:middle line:10%
>>LINDA: So what--
the assumption

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:55.200 align:middle line:10%
is that they were a DNA
genetic manipulation by Nordics

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.385 align:middle line:10%
to create the German.

00:21:56.385 --> 00:22:00.060 align:middle line:10%
>>TIM: At least this is a
assumption that comes from

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:05.850 align:middle line:10%
different documents that I've
seen where some of the 1940

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:08.910 align:middle line:10%
Germans were--

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:11.490 align:middle line:10%
some groups of them
were interested

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:15.990 align:middle line:10%
in order to re-purify
the genetic line in order

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:21.400 align:middle line:10%
to become what was in India
some thousands of years ago.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.750 align:middle line:84%
So that is the
missing link why--

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:27.000 align:middle line:84%
at least as I
understand, why there

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.460 align:middle line:84%
was these kind of genetic
experiments and discussions

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:36.285 align:middle line:90%
around the 1940s in Europe.

00:22:36.285 --> 00:22:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: And it raises
this really strange

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:43.320 align:middle line:90%
almost irony or paradox.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:50.430 align:middle line:84%
India has been associated
with very peaceful people.

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And if there was a genetic
manipulation in India

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:59.040 align:middle line:84%
by the Nordics to create
a species that would be,

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.170 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, closer to
them, they are known

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:04.780 align:middle line:90%
to be very quick to fight.

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Then the irony would
be that Being 6

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:18.680 align:middle line:84%
says that everything is
evolving to get rid of conflict.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:25.000 align:middle line:84%
But the Nordics would have
gone into a pacified, peaceful

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:32.270 align:middle line:84%
culture to create a
more aggressive German,

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:35.450 align:middle line:84%
takes them and puts
them in Germany,

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:40.610 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately, we end up
with World War II centered

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:46.430 align:middle line:84%
around a German who says that
he is working with Aldebaran,

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:49.700 align:middle line:84%
blonde, blue-eyed
extraterrestrials that

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:53.810 align:middle line:84%
will take over the planet
and replace the Hebrews.

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:58.290 align:middle line:84%
If the goal is to
be peaceful, why

00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:07.070 align:middle line:84%
would beings then choose to
make a more aggressive hybrid?

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:09.380 align:middle line:84%
Because in the end,
it was the hybrids

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:11.825 align:middle line:90%
that have caused the wars.

00:24:11.825 --> 00:24:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So I would say that the
genetic profile of beings that

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:21.020 align:middle line:84%
show a high tendency
towards aggression

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:25.400 align:middle line:84%
is always a threat
to those species that

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.920 align:middle line:90%
do not show aggression at all.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:32.120 align:middle line:84%
So that seemed to be the
case in Earth history

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:37.040 align:middle line:84%
that there were many
very harmonious tribes

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:42.050 align:middle line:84%
all over the world flourishing
and developing very peaceful,

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:46.820 align:middle line:84%
but also some sample
groups were placed

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:51.200 align:middle line:84%
on Earth that seemed to
show a very high tendency

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.190 align:middle line:90%
towards aggression.

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And if-- I mean, just
if an outside force

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.220 align:middle line:84%
wanted to slow down
evolution on a planet,

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:08.600 align:middle line:84%
then putting a tribe
onto a planet that

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:13.160 align:middle line:84%
shows very high tendencies
towards war or something

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.710 align:middle line:84%
would be something to bring the
whole system out of balance.

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: We have a
complicated history.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And I wish-- whether
it was Nordics,

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:24.980 align:middle line:84%
whether it was
Reptiles, whether it

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:29.540 align:middle line:84%
was Greys, Tall Whites,
that we would have a council

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:34.700 align:middle line:84%
meeting in which all humans
could be told some kind of,

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:39.305 align:middle line:84%
here is the true consistent
history of Earth.

00:25:39.305 --> 00:25:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it seems
to be very likely

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:46.760 align:middle line:84%
that all these species that
you have just mentioned

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:52.170 align:middle line:84%
did something
somehow at some time.

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think that complicated
Earth history a lot

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:59.570 align:middle line:84%
and the situation
that this planet has

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:03.770 align:middle line:84%
so many destabilized
qualities probably

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:06.980 align:middle line:84%
results from these
different influences.

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:07.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: What do you personally
see when you look forward

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:13.310 align:middle line:90%
10, 20, 30 years?

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I personally
see a tendency

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:22.010 align:middle line:84%
right now where people have
intellectualized and understood

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:26.120 align:middle line:84%
that we are all aspects of the
same being and the same life

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.200 align:middle line:90%
force.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And that we need to collaborate
on a growing trust basis

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:38.150 align:middle line:84%
in order to make
our lives better.

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:43.160 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, I see that there
are some aspects of our life

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:46.940 align:middle line:84%
that just want to fight,
and how ignorant would it

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:54.290 align:middle line:84%
be from our perspective
as tolerant beings to say,

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:55.190 align:middle line:90%
you shouldn't fight.

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:56.370 align:middle line:90%
It's not allowed.

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:57.780 align:middle line:90%
This is not the way it works.

00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:01.820 align:middle line:84%
So Being 6 suggested that
warrior-types species

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:04.520 align:middle line:84%
must fight because
that is their thing.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.930 align:middle line:90%
That is what they do.

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:10.550 align:middle line:84%
But it does not
include any other being

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:14.705 align:middle line:84%
and any other aspect of the
universe to necessarily suffer.

00:27:14.705 --> 00:27:16.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDA: But that's the problem.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:20.780 align:middle line:84%
As soon as there is an
attack and violence and then

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:25.340 align:middle line:84%
you are hurting those that
did not want any violence,

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:29.150 align:middle line:84%
you automatically are
inciting more violence

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:32.630 align:middle line:84%
from those that did not
want anything but peace.

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And that is a paradox that
needs to be solved at some time.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.720 align:middle line:10%
And the approach, for
example, the Greys doing--

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:48.770 align:middle line:10%
and the approach which I
see from human military

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:54.050 align:middle line:10%
and administration, is that
protection and defensive

00:27:54.050 --> 00:28:00.380 align:middle line:10%
mechanisms seem to be something
that potentially could work.

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, there are
a lot of species

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:08.370 align:middle line:84%
that show no aggression, no
invasive behavior at all,

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:12.890 align:middle line:84%
but they have very, very strong
defensive mechanisms developed.

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And it seems-- so to me,
the question is not to--

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:21.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not to stop fighting
because I think that needs

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.580 align:middle line:90%
to be resolved naturally.

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: If we were taught
to take that energy of what

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:33.650 align:middle line:84%
we wanted something and it was
tied to just never give up,

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:39.230 align:middle line:84%
going for something that
might be achievable but never

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:41.870 align:middle line:84%
with violence,
what kind of planet

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:45.650 align:middle line:84%
would we be on if all
children were taught that?

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:50.275 align:middle line:84%
Never give up, but
never choose violence.

00:28:50.275 --> 00:28:51.300 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.450 align:middle line:84%
I would be super happy
about the universe that

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:55.380 align:middle line:90%
stops fighting at all.

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDA: I know.

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: I would love to see that.

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:01.800 align:middle line:84%
The higher in experiences
we go, the less

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.990 align:middle line:90%
the tendency to fight at all.

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And we have different
versions, different timelines

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:14.310 align:middle line:84%
of how soon the universe
will stop competing

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:19.080 align:middle line:84%
and how soon the
universe will create

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:23.970 align:middle line:84%
a constructive and creative
pattern at all time

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:24.780 align:middle line:90%
and everywhere.

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think every
one of us, observing

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.430 align:middle line:84%
aspect of the same being,
but essentially, we

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:34.450 align:middle line:90%
are just one life form.

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:39.750 align:middle line:84%
This is just one baby
universe being born right now

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:41.730 align:middle line:84%
in that moment, and
we're just observing

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:45.150 align:middle line:84%
that it's quasi,
the transition stage

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:48.910 align:middle line:84%
to the next born
universe, so to speak.

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:52.110 align:middle line:84%
So I think every one of
us has a responsibility,

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:58.620 align:middle line:84%
and every one of us can just say
one sentence at a time per day

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:02.310 align:middle line:84%
and just say what
he/she/it wants

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:05.190 align:middle line:90%
in respect to their lives.

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And the universe, it's a
super simple thing to do,

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:11.610 align:middle line:90%
but it works.

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:14.545 align:middle line:90%
The universe you know--

00:30:14.545 --> 00:30:15.345 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDA: Listens.

00:30:15.345 --> 00:30:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Listens, right.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:18.600 align:middle line:90%
And it changes everything.

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Just say, I want my life to be
peaceful, or all shift happily

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:28.400 align:middle line:84%
now, or whatever you
want to contribute to,

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:33.030 align:middle line:84%
and the universe
picks up on that 100%.

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: And it is 13.8 billion
light years and counting.

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you divided that by
four, and you had four epics,

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:46.720 align:middle line:84%
and we're in the
fourth epic, it means

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:52.580 align:middle line:84%
that there have been beings,
consciousness, at least 10

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:58.380 align:middle line:84%
billion years old before
this end of the universe

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.090 align:middle line:90%
was even born.

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Then the idea that there
are advanced beings

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:10.450 align:middle line:84%
that can move without even
craft, it's not astonishing.

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:12.940 align:middle line:90%
It's just inevitable.

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And we have to catch up
to the reality of being

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:21.610 align:middle line:84%
in a 13.8-billion year universe
when we're at the new end.

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:22.540 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And potentially catch
up to the reality

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:30.250 align:middle line:84%
that you do not need
technologies in order

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:32.090 align:middle line:90%
to do all these fancy things.

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:37.270 align:middle line:84%
So if you're thinking
about relocating yourself,

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:41.170 align:middle line:84%
that is something that
can as well be done.

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:43.630 align:middle line:84%
When your consciousness
and your experience level

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:47.740 align:middle line:84%
is high enough, then all these
probabilities and possibilities

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:51.950 align:middle line:84%
are there waiting
for us to explore.

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: Tim, I really
want to thank you

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:57.850 align:middle line:84%
for being with me on this
"Truth Hunter" special.

00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:00.940 align:middle line:84%
It has been an
extraordinary journey,

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:05.140 align:middle line:84%
and I hope we're going to help
take a lot of people with us

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:07.750 align:middle line:84%
to places they've
never been before,

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:11.035 align:middle line:84%
but where our whole planet
is inevitably going.

>> Coming up on the
next "Truth Hunter."

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:19.940 align:middle line:10%
>>TIM: We have so many
contradictory facts to history,

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:23.660 align:middle line:10%
and they still seem to be true.

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:26.030 align:middle line:90%
All of them at the same time.

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:30.780 align:middle line:10%
Being 6, they don't
see any history at all,

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:33.680 align:middle line:10%
they see like outside of time.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:38.480 align:middle line:84%
We are the observers and it's
a self-remembering process

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.975 align:middle line:84%
to know that we
are the observers.

00:32:40.975 --> 00:32:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA: What gives
you hope that we are

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.700 align:middle line:90%
headed in a loving direction?

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.470 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: 100%, we are.
