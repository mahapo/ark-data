00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Since December 1980, the
mystery about what happened

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.910 align:middle line:10%
in Rendlesham Forest, near
NATO's largest air base

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.150 align:middle line:10%
at the time, RAF
Bentwaters Woodbridge,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.070 align:middle line:10%
has grown in complexity and
national security importance.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.720 align:middle line:10%
One key fact I learned from
Colonel Charles Halt himself.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.270 align:middle line:84%
He was Deputy Base
Commander at the large NATO

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.250 align:middle line:84%
base when the lights and beams
showed up over a 72-hour period

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.860 align:middle line:84%
from midnight December
26 to sun up December 28.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Over those three
nights the number

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.610 align:middle line:84%
of military eyewitnesses of the
unidentified aerial phenomena

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.150 align:middle line:84%
was some 30 people,
including the first night

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.670 align:middle line:84%
drama of missing time and a
black, glassy, triangular craft

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.970 align:middle line:84%
that emerged out of a
blast of white light

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.360 align:middle line:84%
in front of Staff Sergeant
Jim Penniston and Airman First

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.460 align:middle line:90%
Class John Burroughs.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.210 align:middle line:84%
The Colonel sat down privately
with John Burroughs and me

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.760 align:middle line:84%
at a May 2010
National Press Club

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.540 align:middle line:90%
conference in Washington DC.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.970 align:middle line:84%
John and I were there to do
a joint presentation that

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.340 align:middle line:84%
included some new hypnosis
that John did in October 2008

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.170 align:middle line:90%
that I had videotaped.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.860 align:middle line:84%
You will see segments
in this "Truth Hunter."

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.740 align:middle line:84%
During our private
conversation Colonel Halt

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.930 align:middle line:84%
asserted that the US National
Security Agency, the NSA,

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.220 align:middle line:84%
took over the Rendlesham Forest
investigation within 24 hours

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.270 align:middle line:84%
after Burroughs, Penniston,
and Airman Ed Cabansag first

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.740 align:middle line:84%
investigated strange, colorful
lights in Rendlesham Forest

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.039 align:middle line:90%
after midnight on December 26.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.980 align:middle line:84%
The three men ended
up with missing time

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.230 align:middle line:90%
and confused memories.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Even Central Security Control
confirmed that for 45 minutes

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.330 align:middle line:84%
there was nothing
but static when CSC

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.240 align:middle line:90%
tried to reach them on radios.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Oddly, the one night
we know the least about

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.320 align:middle line:84%
is the middle night
of December 27,

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.730 align:middle line:84%
because no one who had military
authority will talk about it.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Yet that is the night that
Airman Lori Buoen and John

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Trementozzi heard their D-flight
Shift Commander, Lieutenant

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Bonnie Tamplin,
yelling and crying

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.840 align:middle line:84%
on the military radio for help
from Master Sergeant Robert

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.310 align:middle line:90%
Ball.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.360 align:middle line:84%
The Airman also knew the Deputy
Base Commander, Lieutenant

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.440 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Charles Halt, was
alerted about Lieutenant

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.150 align:middle line:90%
Tamplin's emotional breakdown.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.320 align:middle line:84%
I'll have another eyewitness
later on in this "Truth Hunter"

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.700 align:middle line:84%
series that says
Colonel Halt was even

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.970 align:middle line:84%
at the Rendlesham forest site
that night of December 27.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.300 align:middle line:84%
But to date neither
Halt, nor Tamplin,

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.900 align:middle line:84%
nor Ball have ever talked
on the record about what

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.340 align:middle line:84%
happened in Rendlesham Forest
the night of December 27th,

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.980 align:middle line:90%
1980.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.840 align:middle line:84%
While something serious
was happening in the forest

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.710 align:middle line:84%
to make the D-flight Shift
Commander scream publicly

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.210 align:middle line:84%
over the military radio, Airman
First Class John Burroughs

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.790 align:middle line:84%
suddenly woke up in
the same early morning

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.580 align:middle line:84%
hours of December 27 in a
state of extreme agitation.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.210 align:middle line:84%
He told me, quote, "I
had a strong feeling

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.010 align:middle line:90%
that the lights were back."

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.480 align:middle line:90%
Close quote.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Even if he was off duty,
he felt an urgent need

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.360 align:middle line:90%
to see the lights again.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.170 align:middle line:84%
He knew nothing about Lieutenant
Tamplin, Sergeant Ball, Colonel

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Hall, Lori Buoen,
or John Trementozzi,

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.290 align:middle line:84%
but he was so tense
about getting back

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.240 align:middle line:84%
to the strange lights that John
Burroughs got an early morning

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.880 align:middle line:84%
ride from where he was
staying in Ipswich back

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.410 align:middle line:84%
to the RAF Bentwaters Desk
Sergeant, named O'Brien.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.040 align:middle line:10%
John asked what was happening
in Rendlesham Forest

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.680 align:middle line:10%
and O'Brien told him that
D-flight Shift Commander

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.530 align:middle line:10%
Lieutenant Bonnie Tamplin
had been relieved of her duty

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.550 align:middle line:10%
because a light entered
her vehicle in the forest.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.600 align:middle line:84%
The light scared Lieutenant
Tamplin to panic and crying

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.390 align:middle line:90%
during her radio communications.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.210 align:middle line:10%
The assumption is that
Lieutenant Tamplin

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.500 align:middle line:10%
had gone in to Rendlesham Forest
with D-flight Master Sergeant

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.830 align:middle line:10%
Robert Ball to investigate Lori
Buoen's fiery sphere report.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And when John Burroughs learned
about the D-flight Shift

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Commander encountering
a light in her vehicle

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.360 align:middle line:84%
that terrified her,
he was even more

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.610 align:middle line:84%
determined to get back
to Rendlesham Forest

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.340 align:middle line:84%
that night of December 27 to
28, even though his C-flight

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.930 align:middle line:90%
was off duty.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.640 align:middle line:84%
We'll hear more
about what happened

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.260 align:middle line:90%
to John in a few minutes.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.930 align:middle line:84%
But first, more drama unfolded
in the forest that afternoon

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.410 align:middle line:84%
of December 27th
beginning at 4:00 PM,

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.160 align:middle line:84%
when Staff Sergeant Monroe
Nevels, a disaster preparedness

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.290 align:middle line:84%
technician at RAF Bentwaters,
had a surprise visit.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Knocking on his door was
Lieutenant Bruce England,

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.740 align:middle line:84%
the Shift Commander
for Bravo flight.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Both Sergeant Nevels
and Lieutenant England

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.040 align:middle line:84%
had served in the Marines before
re-enlisting in the US Air

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.210 align:middle line:90%
Force.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.000 align:middle line:10%
Lieutenant England
told Sergeant Nevels

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.060 align:middle line:10%
he was there on
top secret orders

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.120 align:middle line:10%
by the RAF Bentwaters Base
Commander Colonel Ted Conrad.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Lieutenant England told me
that one of the airmen had been

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.430 align:middle line:90%
taken aboard the spacecraft.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And he was talking about
what had happened at least two

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:16.840 align:middle line:90%
nights earlier.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about that?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, he just basically
went through and told me about

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.970 align:middle line:10%
talking to Jim Penniston and
John Burroughs were involved.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.010 align:middle line:10%
I do remember the
names were mentioned.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And he said even at to
point that someone had been

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.920 align:middle line:90%
abducted into the aircraft.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the
reason Colonel Conrad

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.020 align:middle line:84%
had asked for me to come
get you is because he felt

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.340 align:middle line:84%
that if he wanted an
honest answer from anybody

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.480 align:middle line:90%
then you would give it to him.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.140 align:middle line:90%
So it's my orders.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.950 align:middle line:84%
They are down at the
Woodbridge officer's club

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.710 align:middle line:84%
and they are having
a party down there.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.757 align:middle line:84%
And when we get through
with our investigation,

00:06:56.757 --> 00:06:57.840 align:middle line:90%
he will be waiting for us.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And we have to go back
and make a report to him.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Sergeant Nevels says
Lieutenant England took him

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.590 align:middle line:84%
to a triangular depression
in the forest soil.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.360 align:middle line:84%
That must have been the site
where Staff Sergeant Jim

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.320 align:middle line:84%
Penniston and Airman First
Class John Burroughs encountered

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.940 align:middle line:84%
the bright, white light and
the black, triangular craft

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.240 align:middle line:84%
the night before after
midnight on December 26.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.380 align:middle line:84%
This photograph was taken by
Master Sergeant Ray Gulyas

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.170 align:middle line:90%
after sun up on December 26.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And was reprinted by UK
researcher and author

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Georgina Bruni in her book
published in 2000 entitled,

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.450 align:middle line:90%
"You Can't Tell The People."

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:43.780 align:middle line:84%
That title came from a
conversation Georgina

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.770 align:middle line:84%
had with then UK Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher,

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.740 align:middle line:84%
who said about the
RAF Bentwaters mystery

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:55.750 align:middle line:84%
quote, "UFOs, you must
get your facts right.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.960 align:middle line:90%
And you can't tell the people."

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.640 align:middle line:90%
Close quote.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.490 align:middle line:84%
In the center of the
photograph is Constable Brian

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Creswell of the Suffolk
police examining

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.400 align:middle line:84%
a triangle of
depressions in the soil

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.790 align:middle line:84%
each marked by a stick
and orange circle.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:15.580 align:middle line:84%
On the right is
Captain Mike Verano,

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.470 align:middle line:90%
the Day Shift Commander.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:21.450 align:middle line:84%
The far right stick is next
to Captain Verano's leg.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:25.170 align:middle line:84%
The top of the photo is
east, toward the Orford Ness

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.230 align:middle line:90%
lighthouse.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can't
see a lighthouse.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:35.130 align:middle line:10%
You can't see anything through
the thick Rendlesham trees.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:39.929 align:middle line:10%
That fact reinforces how phony
the so-called Orford lighthouse

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:43.230 align:middle line:10%
explanation was that
counter-intelligence

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:47.580 align:middle line:10%
used to try to keep the
public and the media away.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Each of the three indentations
in the forest soil

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.670 align:middle line:84%
were the shape of a triangle
pressed about two inches

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.520 align:middle line:84%
into the ground, as
in this photo of one

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.570 align:middle line:84%
on the morning of December 26th,
photographed by Master Sergeant

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.460 align:middle line:90%
Ray Gulyas.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.960 align:middle line:84%
The three depressions
formed a triangular pattern

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.680 align:middle line:84%
that was measured by a local
forester as 8.2 feet apart

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.780 align:middle line:90%
at its longest length.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Staff Sergeant Penniston
called it nine feet.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.680 align:middle line:84%
There were also fresh
scorch marks on the trees

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.860 align:middle line:90%
where branches were broken off.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.490 align:middle line:84%
But how did something
so large move so rapidly

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.800 align:middle line:84%
through the thick
Rendlesham forest?

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.770 align:middle line:84%
As Lieutenant England
showed Staff Sergeant Nevels

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:35.670 align:middle line:84%
around the site, the two
men also saw a bright light

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.050 align:middle line:90%
in the trees.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant Nevels looked through
the night vision goggles

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.410 align:middle line:84%
and said there was a bright
light with a dark center that

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:48.450 align:middle line:84%
reminded him of a human eye and
pupil that blinked on and off.

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:52.140 align:middle line:84%
He and Lieutenant England
left the forest around 8:00 PM

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:57.570 align:middle line:84%
December 27, 1980, and reported
to base commander Colonel Ted

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Conrad at the Woodbridge
officer's Christmas party.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant Nevels
told Colonel Conrad

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:08.130 align:middle line:84%
that the situation merited
more investigation.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Also at the Christmas party
was deputy base commander,

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Lieutenant Colonel Charles
Halt. Colonel Conrad

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.730 align:middle line:84%
turned further
investigation over to him.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.280 align:middle line:84%
So Colonel Halt,
Lieutenant Bruce England,

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Staff Sergeant Monroe Nevels,
Staff Sergeant Adrian Bustinza,

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:29.100 align:middle line:84%
and several security police were
organized into a search party

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.220 align:middle line:84%
with pickup trucks
and light-alls.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant Nevels also took
his AN/PDR 27F geiger counter

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:41.520 align:middle line:84%
that measures both beta
and gamma radiation.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.330 align:middle line:84%
He used the geiger counter
on the tripod depressions

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.630 align:middle line:84%
and burn marks that he
found at the same height

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:52.590 align:middle line:84%
on trees that grew around
the tripod depressions.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant Nevels did not
get any beta readings,

00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:01.050 align:middle line:84%
but he did see an average of
seven milliroentgens of gamma

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:02.520 align:middle line:90%
radiation.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.540 align:middle line:84%
An hour exposure of seven
milliroentgens of gamma

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.410 align:middle line:84%
is equivalent to about one
third of a chest x-ray.

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:14.340 align:middle line:84%
Further, each of the three
indentations in the ground

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.940 align:middle line:84%
had an angle shape that
was somewhat triangular,

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.340 align:middle line:84%
pressed two inches
into the ground.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Behind the scenes
the UK Ministry

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:28.170 align:middle line:84%
of Defens's DI 55
intelligence division

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:30.630 align:middle line:84%
was investigating
the radioactivity

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:34.200 align:middle line:84%
of the triangular depressions
in Rendlesham Forest.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Halt is the voice
on this brief excerpt

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.810 align:middle line:90%
from his 18-minute audio tape.

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:44.050 align:middle line:10%
>> We are getting an indication
of a heat source coming out

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:48.365 align:middle line:10%
of that, some form of energy,
broken branches on the ground.

00:11:48.365 --> 00:11:49.900 align:middle line:10%
>> What is it?

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.780 align:middle line:10%
>> We don't know, sir.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:52.930 align:middle line:10%
Small, red lights.

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:58.606 align:middle line:10%
Keep the starlight scope on
it, weird, coming this way.

00:11:58.606 --> 00:11:59.430 align:middle line:10%
No doubt about it.

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:01.810 align:middle line:90%
This is weird.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.190 align:middle line:90%
Looks like a eye winking at you.

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:06.242 align:middle line:10%
When you put the
starlight scope on it,

00:12:06.242 --> 00:12:09.572 align:middle line:10%
it's like a pupil
of an eye winking.

00:12:09.572 --> 00:12:15.550 align:middle line:84%
We've got strange objects moving
away from us, a beam coming out

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:16.730 align:middle line:90%
of the ground.

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:19.090 align:middle line:90%
This is unreal.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>> The objects stopped
overhead and sent down a beam.

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:25.160 align:middle line:84%
The best way I can
describe it is a laser beam

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.870 align:middle line:84%
because the light did not
radiate out like a light would

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:29.600 align:middle line:90%
do but came straight down.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.720 align:middle line:90%
It fell on our feet.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.500 align:middle line:90%
And we were quite concerned.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.830 align:middle line:84%
The light was a very
bright white light,

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.950 align:middle line:84%
probably 15, 20
inches in diameter

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:40.850 align:middle line:90%
when it hit the ground.

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:43.660 align:middle line:84%
It was right in front of us,
less than 10 feet or 15 feet

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:44.620 align:middle line:90%
away.

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.720 align:middle line:90%
>> What happened at that moment?

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.360 align:middle line:90%
>> We stood there in awe.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.570 align:middle line:90%
Is it a signal?

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:50.620 align:middle line:90%
Is it a warning?

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.630 align:middle line:90%
Is it a method of communication?

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:53.932 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:12:53.932 --> 00:12:55.140 align:middle line:90%
And we just stood there for--

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- 5, 10
seconds, maybe 15 seconds,

00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:59.530 align:middle line:90%
and it was gone.

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:02.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it disappeared as
suddenly as it appeared.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.050 align:middle line:90%
It was so shocking that-- wow.

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.810 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, we were
continuously having problems

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:10.040 align:middle line:84%
with out radios on
all three frequencies

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.970 align:middle line:84%
we were on, picking up radio
signals from the weapons

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.760 align:middle line:84%
storage area, and they were
indicating that the objects

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.140 align:middle line:90%
were over there.

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:21.610 align:middle line:84%
There were multiple objects in
the sky at that time, at least

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.980 align:middle line:90%
four if not five or more.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:25.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Were they all white?

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:27.230 align:middle line:90%
They changed color.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And they changed shape
from round to elliptical.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Colors?

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Gosh, red, blue,
green I think.

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.890 align:middle line:84%
When the thing went overhead
and the lights approached us,

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:37.870 align:middle line:84%
stopped overhead and
it sent a beam down.

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:40.556 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my God, we all
went into shock almost.

00:13:40.556 --> 00:13:41.930 align:middle line:84%
How am I ever
gonna explain this?

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:43.720 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's gonna believe this.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.840 align:middle line:84%
This is a kiss of
death for my career.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Staff Sergeant Monroe
Nevels was with Colonel Halt

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:54.020 align:middle line:10%
in the forest when the beams
came down so close to them

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.860 align:middle line:10%
on December 28 after midnight.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>> What we saw was so
fast, and it disappeared.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.290 align:middle line:84%
We were in awe about where
did it go, what did it do.

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And Monroe, did you see those
thin beams of light come down?

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I did.

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Those beams, when
it came down, they

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:16.000 align:middle line:84%
looked like a very
faint laser beam.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.830 align:middle line:90%
They were pencil thin.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:20.320 align:middle line:84%
We could see it
against the black sky.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.420 align:middle line:84%
When we looked out and saw
those pencil-thin beams,

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.420 align:middle line:84%
I told Colonel Halt
that I believed

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:29.230 align:middle line:84%
that something is trying
to tap into what we've got.

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:31.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what is it that
they're trying to find out?

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.210 align:middle line:84%
Because it's obvious they'd
been shot down to the ground

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and had to be doing something--
taking photos, penetrating

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.960 align:middle line:84%
or trying to generate
some heat to the ground

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.240 align:middle line:90%
or whatever the situation was.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.570 align:middle line:84%
The lights would disappear
and be gone in a blink.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:49.180 align:middle line:84%
You could blink your eye and
look up and they'd be gone.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And Bentwaters would announce
on their radios back to us,

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:54.650 align:middle line:90%
we see it, sir.

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:55.450 align:middle line:90%
We see it.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:56.380 align:middle line:90%
It's over us.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And then when it
disappeared from their side,

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.900 align:middle line:84%
we immediately was able
to say, here it is.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:05.260 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it was like it
was instantaneous from there

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.910 align:middle line:90%
to where we were.

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>> That same night
around 4:00 AM,

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:14.810 align:middle line:84%
John Burroughs was given
permission by Colonel Halt

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:19.280 align:middle line:84%
to go into the forest with
Staff Sergeant Adrian Bustinza.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Here now is another
brief excerpt

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:26.150 align:middle line:84%
from John Burroughs' 1988
hypnosis, in which he joins

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Lieutenant Colonel
Charles Halt's

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:32.360 align:middle line:84%
investigation in Rendlesham
Forest after midnight

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.100 align:middle line:90%
December 28.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.350 align:middle line:84%
With Lieutenant Colonel
Halt are several men,

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:40.130 align:middle line:84%
including Airman First Class
Chris Arnold and Airman

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.680 align:middle line:90%
Bartholomew, who are mentioned.

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:46.610 align:middle line:84%
This is John's second
encounter with the lights,

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:49.476 align:middle line:84%
and he begins listening
to Colonel Halt.

00:15:49.476 --> 00:15:52.086 align:middle line:84%
>> I go to Colonel
Halt. It's back again!

00:15:52.086 --> 00:15:54.078 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe it.

00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:57.570 align:middle line:84%
He acted like he
wasn't surprised.

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:59.740 align:middle line:90%
He was real calm.

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.113 align:middle line:84%
But the other
people were scared.

00:16:02.113 --> 00:16:05.071 align:middle line:90%
They were, it's weird.

00:16:05.071 --> 00:16:10.001 align:middle line:84%
They were very surprised
and very, very upset.

00:16:10.001 --> 00:16:12.959 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Halt and I
were standing there.

00:16:12.959 --> 00:16:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Arnold and I were
standing there.

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And he was good friends with
Colonel Halt. What happened,

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.858 align:middle line:90%
Colonel?

00:16:19.858 --> 00:16:22.840 align:middle line:90%
Weird things.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.822 align:middle line:90%
He goes, weird things.

00:16:25.822 --> 00:16:35.762 align:middle line:84%
He goes, we had things
hover on top of--

00:16:35.762 --> 00:16:42.223 align:middle line:84%
they were making contact
with their minds.

00:16:42.223 --> 00:16:45.702 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at him, what
are you talking about?

00:16:45.702 --> 00:16:47.640 align:middle line:90%
He said, little blue lights.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.181 align:middle line:84%
The craft is still
hovering up there.

00:16:49.181 --> 00:16:51.680 align:middle line:84%
He goes, they're coming
from their craft.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.723 align:middle line:84%
They've been out
there for hours.

00:16:53.723 --> 00:16:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And I go, well, I
want to go get closer.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.633 align:middle line:90%
And he says, OK.

00:16:58.633 --> 00:17:00.106 align:middle line:90%
He goes, you can come with me.

00:17:00.106 --> 00:17:03.543 align:middle line:84%
But Chris, I want you and
Bartholomew to stay here.

00:17:03.543 --> 00:17:05.998 align:middle line:90%
Take the light off of the truck.

00:17:05.998 --> 00:17:10.908 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, John, I
want you to go out there,

00:17:10.908 --> 00:17:14.345 align:middle line:84%
because I think you
can bring us closer.

00:17:14.345 --> 00:17:15.327 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:17:15.327 --> 00:17:16.309 align:middle line:90%
>> Who told you that?

00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:21.057 align:middle line:84%
>> Colonel Halt. I think you
can bring this ship and these

00:17:21.057 --> 00:17:22.045 align:middle line:90%
things closer.

00:17:22.045 --> 00:17:25.009 align:middle line:90%
They want you to do it.

00:17:25.009 --> 00:17:25.997 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like--

00:17:25.997 --> 00:17:27.479 align:middle line:90%
>> Who wanted you to do it?

00:17:27.479 --> 00:17:28.467 align:middle line:90%
Colonel Halt?

00:17:28.467 --> 00:17:29.771 align:middle line:90%
>> Colonel Halt said they did.

00:17:29.771 --> 00:17:30.937 align:middle line:90%
That's all he said was that.

00:17:30.937 --> 00:17:35.877 align:middle line:84%
>> Does he appear to have some
knowledge or some understanding

00:17:35.877 --> 00:17:37.750 align:middle line:90%
that you don't understand?

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:39.625 align:middle line:84%
>> I didn't understand
what was going on.

00:17:39.625 --> 00:17:40.425 align:middle line:90%
I was--

00:17:40.425 --> 00:17:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>> He seemed to know
something that you didn't?

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:47.975 align:middle line:84%
>> He seemed to be very at
peace of mind and very calm.

00:17:47.975 --> 00:17:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And like he--
something-- he goes,

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:55.930 align:middle line:84%
this is the most bizarre,
weirdest experience.

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:58.580 align:middle line:90%
People will never believe it.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know why they thought
you could bring it closer?

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:01.980 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:02.910 align:middle line:90%
I didn't understand.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.458 align:middle line:84%
And that was something that
I never understood, either.

00:18:05.458 --> 00:18:08.944 align:middle line:84%
They wanted me there, and they
wanted me there in stages.

00:18:08.944 --> 00:18:11.426 align:middle line:84%
Like you can stay in
this area for a while.

00:18:11.426 --> 00:18:13.426 align:middle line:84%
They weren't surprised
that I was there, either.

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:14.797 align:middle line:90%
They were not surprised.

00:18:14.797 --> 00:18:17.005 align:middle line:84%
The people that saw me come
out there were surprised,

00:18:17.005 --> 00:18:20.900 align:middle line:84%
but Colonel Halt
was not surprised.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.270 align:middle line:90%
And they kept me in stages.

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:25.590 align:middle line:84%
They kept me waiting, like
wait in here, wait in there.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:26.540 align:middle line:90%
And now it's OK.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.594 align:middle line:90%
>> What happened then?

00:18:28.594 --> 00:18:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, then he put his
arm around me, and he said,

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.040 align:middle line:90%
let's go.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.130 align:middle line:90%
And then there was some--

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:36.000 align:middle line:90%


00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.770 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden there was
this short buck sergeant,

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:42.610 align:middle line:90%
and he was Mexican.

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:44.010 align:middle line:90%
And he was there.

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:44.810 align:middle line:90%
He appeared.

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:47.274 align:middle line:84%
He appeared coming up,
like coming towards me.

00:18:47.274 --> 00:18:48.732 align:middle line:84%
Like he wasn't with
the main group.

00:18:48.732 --> 00:18:51.162 align:middle line:90%
He was like coming up toward me.

00:18:51.162 --> 00:18:53.106 align:middle line:90%
And he says, let's go.

00:18:53.106 --> 00:18:56.508 align:middle line:84%
Three of us walked
towards the craft.

00:18:56.508 --> 00:18:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And Colonel Halt goes, I've
got all this on tape recording.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:01.860 align:middle line:90%
And he shows me a tape recorder.

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And he has a radio with
him, too-- his radio.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.301 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, and I'm
recording all this

00:19:06.301 --> 00:19:08.950 align:middle line:90%
through the wing command post.

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:11.080 align:middle line:84%
He goes, I'm going to
keep all this stuff,

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:14.926 align:middle line:84%
because it's gonna
be worth something.

00:19:14.926 --> 00:19:16.384 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, let's go.

00:19:16.384 --> 00:19:19.786 align:middle line:90%
So we started walking.

00:19:19.786 --> 00:19:23.188 align:middle line:84%
And the light was there,
and it was in the distance.

00:19:23.188 --> 00:19:27.562 align:middle line:90%
And we walked really farther.

00:19:27.562 --> 00:19:29.800 align:middle line:90%
And then, there it was!

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.214 align:middle line:90%
Three blue lights.

00:19:31.214 --> 00:19:32.600 align:middle line:90%
He goes, there they are!

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, there they are!

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:35.575 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, that's
what we had before.

00:19:35.575 --> 00:19:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, John,
he goes, you're

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:40.755 align:middle line:84%
never gonna believe
this, but a group of us,

00:19:40.755 --> 00:19:41.838 align:middle line:90%
they made contact with us.

00:19:41.838 --> 00:19:43.330 align:middle line:90%
They were on top of us.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:44.770 align:middle line:90%
It was like they spoke to us.

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:45.270 align:middle line:90%
I go, they?

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:46.070 align:middle line:90%
What's they?

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:47.626 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, these lights.

00:19:47.626 --> 00:19:49.000 align:middle line:84%
I go, you mean
you saw something?

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.220 align:middle line:90%
He goes, these lights.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.705 align:middle line:84%
He goes, there
were lights there,

00:19:51.705 --> 00:19:54.180 align:middle line:90%
and they were speaking to us.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:54.994 align:middle line:90%
They were over us.

00:19:54.994 --> 00:19:56.160 align:middle line:90%
They were flying in the sky.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.150 align:middle line:90%
They were hovering over us.

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:58.649 align:middle line:84%
They were doing all
kinds of things.

00:19:58.649 --> 00:20:01.605 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, John, hold it right
there where you can see those

00:20:01.605 --> 00:20:02.595 align:middle line:90%
blue lights.

00:20:02.595 --> 00:20:08.535 align:middle line:84%
Now I want you to look
at one of those lights

00:20:08.535 --> 00:20:12.564 align:middle line:84%
and ask the question
that comes to your mind.

00:20:12.564 --> 00:20:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And that light will
talk back to you.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.537 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what it says.

00:20:16.537 --> 00:20:19.531 align:middle line:90%


00:20:19.531 --> 00:20:21.028 align:middle line:90%
>> Come to me.

00:20:21.028 --> 00:20:26.517 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, now what did you do?

00:20:26.517 --> 00:20:29.012 align:middle line:90%
>> They started moving.

00:20:29.012 --> 00:20:32.094 align:middle line:90%
And we all froze.

00:20:32.094 --> 00:20:36.804 align:middle line:90%
And they were up and down.

00:20:36.804 --> 00:20:37.900 align:middle line:90%
>> You mean the lights?

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:39.620 align:middle line:90%
They split up.

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:40.420 align:middle line:90%
They split up.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.086 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, now ask them
what they represent.

00:20:42.086 --> 00:20:46.351 align:middle line:84%
Ask that light what
it's representing.

00:20:46.351 --> 00:20:47.345 align:middle line:90%
>> The craft.

00:20:47.345 --> 00:20:48.145 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:20:48.145 --> 00:20:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, is there any life
form in or with that craft?

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>> That was the life form.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>> The light is the life form.

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:03.880 align:middle line:84%
John felt the lights themselves
were intelligent entities.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.830 align:middle line:84%
That could also
explain what happened

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:09.400 align:middle line:84%
when Airman John Burroughs
and Sergeant Adrian Bustinza

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.970 align:middle line:84%
were running next to each other
toward the red and white lights

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.710 align:middle line:90%
in the farmer's field.

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:18.400 align:middle line:84%
That's when Adrian fell to
the ground on John's right.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And John only remembers getting
close to red-orange lights,

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:25.210 align:middle line:84%
and he does not
remember anything else.

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Later, Adrian told
Burroughs, quote,

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:30.520 align:middle line:84%
"The light forced
me to the ground,

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:35.230 align:middle line:84%
and I saw the red-orange light
come over you," close quote.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:38.560 align:middle line:84%
Was John Burroughs
abducted twice,

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:43.180 align:middle line:84%
after midnight on December
26 and again on December 28

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:45.710 align:middle line:90%
by these peculiar lights?

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:48.250 align:middle line:84%
John is still haunted
by what happened

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.610 align:middle line:84%
to him in Rendlesham
Forest December 26

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:54.310 align:middle line:90%
and December 28, 1980.

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:58.180 align:middle line:84%
He is especially troubled by the
fact that he cannot consciously

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:01.930 align:middle line:84%
remember what happened when he
was close to the lights both

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:03.070 align:middle line:90%
nights.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:07.180 align:middle line:84%
John still has strange
dreams, cannot sleep well,

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:11.080 align:middle line:84%
and feels like something in
his mind wants to come out.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.810 align:middle line:84%
In 2008, John
Burroughs contacted me

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:16.960 align:middle line:84%
about his anxieties
and said he wondered

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.140 align:middle line:84%
if I could find a qualified
hypnotherapist who

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:24.500 align:middle line:84%
could try to penetrate
the block on his memory.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Phoenix clinical
hypnotherapist Melinda Vail

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:31.700 align:middle line:84%
works with post-traumatic
shock cases with young people

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.500 align:middle line:90%
and agreed to help.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.110 align:middle line:84%
I hoped that John could
break through to full memory.

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Here are brief highlights from
the October 2008 hypnosis.

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:45.620 align:middle line:84%
John is drawn to
mysterious lights

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.950 align:middle line:84%
that seem to be
communicating telepathically

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and that had what looked
like a blinking eye

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:56.150 align:middle line:84%
reminiscent of what Sergeant
Monroe Nevels and Colonel

00:22:56.150 --> 00:23:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Halt also described
seeing in the forest.

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:03.020 align:middle line:10%
>> And you're
outside, aren't you?

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.051 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoa!

00:23:04.051 --> 00:23:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>> It's all right, sweetheart.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:06.101 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:23:06.101 --> 00:23:06.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh!

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.040 align:middle line:90%
There was like 20 of them.

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.200 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, it's all right.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.370 align:middle line:90%
It's all right.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:11.310 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about them.

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:12.110 align:middle line:90%
I've got you.

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>> They just were there.

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:14.130 align:middle line:90%
>> I've got you.

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>> As soon-- oh!

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>> I've got you.

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:16.928 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about them.

00:23:16.928 --> 00:23:17.728 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, now--

00:23:17.728 --> 00:23:21.790 align:middle line:90%


00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:22.590 align:middle line:90%
>> It's all right.

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:22.770 align:middle line:90%
It's all right.

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:23.220 align:middle line:90%
I've got you.

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:24.020 align:middle line:90%
I've got you.

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:25.630 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about them.

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:26.700 align:middle line:90%
>> They're just there.

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:27.597 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, what are they?

00:23:27.597 --> 00:23:28.680 align:middle line:90%
>> I never-- I don't know.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.030 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:29.430 align:middle line:90%
What do they--

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:31.920 align:middle line:84%
>> The milky surface is there,
and then they're there behind

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:32.130 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:33.600 align:middle line:90%
What do they look like?

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.196 align:middle line:90%
>> Little specks of blue lights.

00:23:35.196 --> 00:23:36.432 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:36.432 --> 00:23:37.440 align:middle line:90%
What do they mean?

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.912 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:23:38.912 --> 00:23:40.577 align:middle line:90%
Oh, God.

00:23:40.577 --> 00:23:42.410 align:middle line:90%
It won't let me.

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>> It won't let
you go back there?

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:49.675 align:middle line:84%
>> Every time-- every
time I go, it gets strong.

00:23:49.675 --> 00:23:51.130 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And it wants to
pull me towards it.

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, sweetheart.

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And when I think,
it comes towards me,

00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:59.873 align:middle line:90%
and then it pulls me towards it.

00:23:59.873 --> 00:24:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh!

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:02.660 align:middle line:90%
It's wrong.

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.154 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:24:05.154 --> 00:24:07.490 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:10.336 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:24:10.336 --> 00:24:12.520 align:middle line:90%
I have to tell you.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.320 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:14.120 align:middle line:90%
>> It's all right.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.425 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, they're coming at me.

00:24:15.425 --> 00:24:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the lights
that are coming at you?

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Little ones.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Little ones.

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:21.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:23.960 align:middle line:84%
What does it feel like
when they come at you?

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.220 align:middle line:90%
>> It just startles me.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>> [BREATHING HEAVILY] Oh, God.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>> You're all right.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:31.310 align:middle line:90%
I've got you.

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:36.240 align:middle line:90%


00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.770 align:middle line:90%
What else do you see there?

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Just a huge--

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:42.940 align:middle line:84%
now it's getting
bigger and bigger--

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:49.310 align:middle line:84%
like milky white object or
substance that just keeps

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:53.170 align:middle line:90%
going up, down, wider, smaller.

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:56.044 align:middle line:84%
Then there's a eye or
something behind it.

00:24:56.044 --> 00:24:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's interfering
with your ability to go back

00:24:58.210 --> 00:24:59.010 align:middle line:90%
in time?

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Every-- every time
you ask me to go back,

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:08.025 align:middle line:84%
the smaller objects or the thing
appear, and it gets stronger.

00:25:08.025 --> 00:25:10.700 align:middle line:90%


00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a hole between it,
like the hole's opening up.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:15.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:20.160 align:middle line:90%


00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.724 align:middle line:90%
Do you see anything in the hole?

00:25:22.724 --> 00:25:26.012 align:middle line:90%
>> [MOANING] No.

00:25:26.012 --> 00:25:26.812 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:25:26.812 --> 00:25:29.600 align:middle line:90%


00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>> What does the
hole mean to you?

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Whatever happened to John
Burroughs on December 26

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:42.500 align:middle line:84%
and 28, an unidentified aerial
craft hovered stationary over

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:47.210 align:middle line:84%
this hot row of stored nuclear
weapons at the RAF Bentwaters

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:51.290 align:middle line:84%
weapons storage area,
also known as the WSA.

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:54.590 align:middle line:10%
Those nuke bunkers were
watched around the clock

00:25:54.590 --> 00:26:00.170 align:middle line:10%
by security from the WSA
alarm station watch tower.

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:03.650 align:middle line:10%
The Delta flight security
chief in the Bentwaters tower

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:08.810 align:middle line:10%
the night of December 27 to
28 was Sergeant Rick Bobo.

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:11.390 align:middle line:10%
The tower was 50
feet above the ground

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:14.750 align:middle line:10%
to give a clear 360-degree view.

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:20.240 align:middle line:10%
Sergeant Bobo's priority was to
report any threat to the WSA.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:24.830 align:middle line:84%
That night, he watched a
large, reddish blue light

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:29.630 align:middle line:84%
in the sky that hovered
stationary for nearly two hours

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:33.950 align:middle line:84%
and also periodically emitted
smaller white lights that

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:37.610 align:middle line:84%
sped rapidly down into
Rendlesham Forest.

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:40.910 align:middle line:84%
At least twice, Sergeant
Bobo phoned central security

00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:42.010 align:middle line:90%
control.

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And in each call, he was told
the situation was under control

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:51.200 align:middle line:84%
because there was an
investigation in the forest.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.120 align:middle line:90%
That was Colonel Halt's group.

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Rick Bobo returned
from the Air Force

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:58.640 align:middle line:84%
to work in the Indiana
Department of Transportation,

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.380 align:middle line:84%
the state in which he
was born and raised.

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:05.310 align:middle line:84%
I talked with Rick in a recorded
phone interview for radio

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:09.500 align:middle line:84%
about what he saw and heard
during his D flight security

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.440 align:middle line:84%
shift in the
Bentwaters WSA tower

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:17.750 align:middle line:84%
after midnight on
December 28, 1980.

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:20.990 align:middle line:10%
>> It looked really big,
and there was red and blue.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:23.720 align:middle line:10%
And I did see something
come down from it

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.850 align:middle line:10%
and went down into the woods.

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:29.120 align:middle line:10%
>> And how long were you able
to see that reddish blue large

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.410 align:middle line:10%
light?

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, goodness-- it
was there a long time.

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:36.680 align:middle line:90%
It just sat there.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.550 align:middle line:90%
It didn't go anywhere.

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.645 align:middle line:90%
It just sat in one spot.

00:27:41.645 --> 00:27:43.520 align:middle line:84%
I think you could have
put a cross-hair on it

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.770 align:middle line:90%
and it never would have moved.

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:45.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Never wavered.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:52.910 align:middle line:10%
>> So Sergeant Rick Bobo up in
the WSA watchtower remembers

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:57.170 align:middle line:10%
hearing John Burrough's voice on
the radio when Colonel Halt was

00:27:57.170 --> 00:28:01.220 align:middle line:10%
in the forest with all the men
and equipment and insists no

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:05.960 align:middle line:10%
beams came down into
the Bentwaters WSA.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:10.660 align:middle line:10%
But he did see with his own
eyes small, white lights

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:13.220 align:middle line:10%
leave the large, glowing
red and blue object

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:18.020 align:middle line:10%
in the sky and head straight
down for Rendlesham Forest.

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:22.430 align:middle line:10%
Finally, after 30 years,
retired Colonel Charles Halt,

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:25.970 align:middle line:10%
the former RAF Bentwaters
deputy base commander,

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:32.020 align:middle line:10%
went on the record in a June 25,
2009 press release to state--

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:34.630 align:middle line:10%
>> I wish to make it perfectly
clear that UFOs I saw were

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:37.970 align:middle line:10%
structured machines moving under
intelligent control and were

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:40.730 align:middle line:10%
operating beyond the realm of
anything I've ever seen before

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:41.990 align:middle line:10%
or since.

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:44.060 align:middle line:10%
I believe the objects
I saw at close quarters

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:47.420 align:middle line:10%
were extraterrestrial in
origin, and that the security

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.870 align:middle line:10%
services of both the
United States and England

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:51.590 align:middle line:10%
were and have been
complicit in trying

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:53.540 align:middle line:10%
to subvert the significance
of what occurred

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:56.060 align:middle line:10%
at Rendlesham by use of
well-practiced methods

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:58.610 align:middle line:10%
of disinformation.

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Right from the beginning,
John Burroughs and Jim Peniston

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:06.290 align:middle line:84%
saw what they could not
explain, and something happened

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:09.350 align:middle line:84%
to their minds,
either in the forest,

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:13.400 align:middle line:84%
in military interrogations
later on, or both.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:17.510 align:middle line:84%
The results have been
blank or confused memories.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:20.870 align:middle line:84%
The two men were right next
to each other in the forest,

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:24.770 align:middle line:84%
but they do not remember
the same details.

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:28.460 align:middle line:84%
In the next "Truth Hunter,"
Staff Sergeant James Peniston

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:32.300 align:middle line:84%
will tell us more about the
symbols on the black triangle

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:35.180 align:middle line:84%
in Rendlesham Forest
that he touched

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:39.020 align:middle line:84%
and the 0s and 1s
suddenly entered his mind

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.810 align:middle line:84%
and would not leave
until he wrote them down

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:43.910 align:middle line:90%
in his notebook.

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:46.220 align:middle line:90%
