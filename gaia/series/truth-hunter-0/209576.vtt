>> With me today on this
"Truth Hunter" special is Tim,

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.240 align:middle line:10%
a tactical advisor to
covert German analysts,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.110 align:middle line:10%
who are trying to understand
the missions and strategies

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.560 align:middle line:10%
of non-human intelligences
on our planet,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.350 align:middle line:10%
in this solar
system, and beyond.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.333 align:middle line:84%
Tim, welcome to this special
edition of "Truth Hunter."

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you, Linda
for having me.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, something that
has always, I would say,

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.410 align:middle line:84%
almost bothered me are--
whether you're dealing with

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.810 align:middle line:84%
an abductee, whether you're
dealing with somebody who is

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.700 align:middle line:84%
coming from science, military,
they talk as if they have some

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.930 align:middle line:84%
kind of evidence that there are
beings in this universe that

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.450 align:middle line:90%
are truly other dimensional.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, some people
call them ultra dimensionals.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And I don't fully understand
what an ultra dimensional is

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.060 align:middle line:84%
or why it would be
in this universe

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.940 align:middle line:84%
or how it would interact
in a matter universe.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:23.740 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.070 align:middle line:84%
So what we know
is that there are

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.480 align:middle line:84%
several worlds beyond
this world that we're

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.260 align:middle line:90%
inhabiting right now.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.090 align:middle line:84%
So there are
realities and spaces

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.930 align:middle line:84%
that can be inhabited by
lifeforms just in the way,

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.590 align:middle line:84%
for example, the ocean
itself is inhabited,

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.910 align:middle line:84%
and the whole aquatic world
where beings are living in.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.850 align:middle line:84%
One example for a
multidimensional being would be

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.810 align:middle line:84%
something that you have
showed me in your book,

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.080 align:middle line:84%
which is a
greyish-skinned being--

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Involved in those tubes
in the transfer of souls.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.740 align:middle line:84%
So they are not to be
confused with the Greys.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.780 align:middle line:84%
So there are several
different species

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.970 align:middle line:84%
that all have
greyish skin color.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.440 align:middle line:84%
But these beings, for example,
and I've talked about that,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.700 align:middle line:84%
they live inside of light, which
is another dimension of light.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Basically, physically
seen a dimension

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.610 align:middle line:84%
as a unit which measures
your position within space.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you-- for example, if
we have multiple dimensions

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.280 align:middle line:84%
as an information,
we can triangulate

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.460 align:middle line:84%
where in the world, in
the measurable space

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.710 align:middle line:90%
we inhabit you are right in.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.470 align:middle line:84%
So these beings, for
example, and this

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.050 align:middle line:84%
is another dimension
to the world,

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.710 align:middle line:84%
they live inside
of the light, which

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.780 align:middle line:84%
basically human beings
and all other beings I

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.460 align:middle line:84%
can think of on this world, they
only see the surface of light.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.980 align:middle line:84%
We do see three
dimensions, which

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.290 align:middle line:84%
means there seems
to be some depth,

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.520 align:middle line:84%
but we all only see
the surface of light

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.240 align:middle line:84%
and we do not see that
there is another dimension

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.440 align:middle line:90%
inside of light.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And those beings,
just as we would like,

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.230 align:middle line:84%
look upon the surface
of water and would not

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.130 align:middle line:84%
expect that there
are 1,000 meter deep

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.650 align:middle line:84%
underwater world where fish
and other creatures are living.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.360 align:middle line:84%
We cannot see that this light
that we are seeing has another

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.630 align:middle line:90%
dimension to it.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.640 align:middle line:84%
So that would be an example
of a multidimensional being.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I understand the metaphor
of the ocean being like another

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.290 align:middle line:84%
dimension on this planet in
which there is life and we live

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.390 align:middle line:84%
on the land, which would
be like, let's say,

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.130 align:middle line:90%
another dimension.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying that there
are other intelligences that

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.040 align:middle line:84%
are inhabiting what
part of the light?

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Is it that we're seeing
only a frequency?

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And if we saw the whole
frequency of light,

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.930 align:middle line:84%
we would see beings in some
relationship to photons?

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, so first of all, it's
a comparison, which means,

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.279 align:middle line:84%
of course, the aquatic world
is not another dimension.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.400 align:middle line:90%
>> But it's a metaphor.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a metaphor.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.000 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So what you are
talking about is only

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.840 align:middle line:90%
the particle part of light.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.600 align:middle line:84%
So as light can occur either
as a particle or as a field--

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Wave.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.870 align:middle line:90%
>> A wave pattern, right.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.700 align:middle line:84%
So the human eye is only
capable of perceiving particles,

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.000 align:middle line:84%
at least if we're talking
about this kind of dimension.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we can
measure waves by the way

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.100 align:middle line:84%
light behaves in a room,
like it's getting reflected,

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.720 align:middle line:84%
we can measure it, et cetera,
but normally what we see

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.780 align:middle line:84%
is only the surface,
the particles

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.180 align:middle line:84%
that make up for this table
to be seen as a table.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.930 align:middle line:84%
But if you're
physically correct,

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.000 align:middle line:84%
then there also is a
field within light that

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.790 align:middle line:84%
can be used as a dimension to
be lived in, and those beings,

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.520 align:middle line:84%
just as fish living
in the ocean,

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.930 align:middle line:84%
these beings have chosen
to live inside of light.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>> And what are they like?

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.250 align:middle line:84%
>> If we're talking about
this particular species,

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:36.430 align:middle line:84%
which is a greyish-looking type,
they tend to show themselves

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.720 align:middle line:84%
with some kind of
robe, so to speak.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.760 align:middle line:84%
They are engaged in creating
exit strategies for souls.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.570 align:middle line:84%
So look, death, for
example, is something

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.960 align:middle line:84%
that the universe has come
up for for a being in order

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.580 align:middle line:84%
to transist from one experience
to another experience.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.290 align:middle line:84%
But it also means some kind of
stress, some kind of experience

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.690 align:middle line:84%
that can be bad
and traumatizing,

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.850 align:middle line:84%
which is something
the universe actually

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.290 align:middle line:90%
doesn't want for itself.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:13.600 align:middle line:84%
What they are doing is
creating logical fields

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.480 align:middle line:84%
that make the
transition from death

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.070 align:middle line:84%
from one point to another
point more accessible, more

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.360 align:middle line:90%
acceptable.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, like the tunnel at the
moment of death transiting from

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.060 align:middle line:84%
the outer world to another
dimension and being described

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.810 align:middle line:84%
as a tunnel that you
come out in light.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Because there is no tunnel.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.240 align:middle line:84%
There is no tunnel in
reality, but someone

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:45.840 align:middle line:84%
has to create a thought, a logic
that appears to be a tunnel,

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.600 align:middle line:84%
and that is something
that they do.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>> How would beings that look
like they are 3D matter end up

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:05.060 align:middle line:84%
having work inside of light that
would be as the praying mantis

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.940 align:middle line:84%
says in my book to
the human abductee?

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:15.580 align:middle line:84%
You are going to be
translated into the light.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.850 align:middle line:10%
And today, when I
think about that

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.690 align:middle line:10%
in The Nag Hammadi, the
ancient, ancient text,

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.790 align:middle line:10%
there are two pages
on the thought

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:31.300 align:middle line:10%
that dwells in the light.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.190 align:middle line:10%
Are they one in the same
that you are describing?

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:34.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Maybe.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.090 align:middle line:10%
I don't know that,
but you're absolutely

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.220 align:middle line:10%
correct that they are beings.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Their only interest
is in order to create

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:50.510 align:middle line:84%
certain transitions between one
situation to another situation.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And we know that the soul
has a certain soul plan.

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:01.870 align:middle line:84%
So every soul has something
to learn while it is alive,

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:06.130 align:middle line:84%
while it is embodied
in some body

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:12.130 align:middle line:84%
or incarnated and some body,
and some of these periods

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.370 align:middle line:84%
could be through any
incident, accident,

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.650 align:middle line:90%
whatever, could be interrupted.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And that would cause potentially
trauma to the consciousness

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:31.660 align:middle line:84%
unit but the observer, but also
a fulfillment of the soul plan

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:37.410 align:middle line:84%
that has been arranged for one
of those for the particular

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:38.210 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.909 align:middle line:84%
>> And that would explain
the abductee saying,

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:45.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand what they
mean that my soul must be

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:49.510 align:middle line:84%
in this container for a certain
amount of time and that they

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:56.230 align:middle line:84%
are in fact bringing me to see,
here is my body in a tube and I

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.350 align:middle line:84%
will be allowed to die
in the matter world,

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:03.730 align:middle line:84%
but my soul will continue in
the exact same body container

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:06.620 align:middle line:84%
for whatever is the
mysterious length of time.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.470 align:middle line:90%
100%.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:12.760 align:middle line:84%
So one of the examples that
could be brought up here

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.850 align:middle line:84%
on a major scale, which
influenced heavily

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:19.930 align:middle line:84%
human society is things
that happen on Mars.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.870 align:middle line:10%
So if you're thinking
about the planet Mars,

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.920 align:middle line:10%
it's said to be that there
has been some incident that

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:31.180 align:middle line:10%
destroyed a lot of the surface
and all the inhabitants

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.550 align:middle line:10%
of this planet died.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:39.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Hydrogen bombs according
to PhD Nuclear Physicist John

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.670 align:middle line:10%
Brandenburg wrote a
book Death on Mars,

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:46.540 align:middle line:10%
said that the amount of xenon
129 that Viking measured

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:53.050 align:middle line:10%
on Mars was 2.5 times the amount
of xenon 129 on Earth after

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.900 align:middle line:10%
Hiroshima and Nagasaki
in World War II.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And that is an example,
a perfect example,

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:05.770 align:middle line:84%
for souls that suddenly
came into a situation

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:09.310 align:middle line:84%
where the life plan, their
soul plan has been interrupted.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And then you have an immersive
amount of soul information

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:21.290 align:middle line:84%
that needs to complete and
continue their soul mission, so

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:22.090 align:middle line:90%
to speak?

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I never thought about that
an instant flash from the atomic

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.650 align:middle line:90%
bombs in Nagasaki and Hiroshima.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:32.560 align:middle line:84%
What would have
happened to the souls?

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>> And how do they proceed?

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Because they have still, so
to speak, time on their clock.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.700 align:middle line:84%
One thing, and to
our understanding,

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:50.830 align:middle line:84%
that caused a lot of trouble
in the sociocultural background

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:55.540 align:middle line:84%
of this planet is that a
lot of these free souls

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:59.810 align:middle line:84%
were reintegrated into
this planet right here.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:04.000 align:middle line:84%
So some of these beings
that were heavily

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.770 align:middle line:84%
affected by what
happened on Mars

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:11.580 align:middle line:84%
needed to continue
their soul mission

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:15.390 align:middle line:84%
on some other relevant
place, and some of them

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:19.800 align:middle line:84%
have been integrated into
Earth society, reincarnated.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.630 align:middle line:84%
They might not even
be aware of that,

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:24.720 align:middle line:84%
because there is a process
of amnesia going on, that

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.590 align:middle line:84%
means they do not remember
their own existence

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:33.120 align:middle line:84%
on a different planet, but it
also brought a lot of problems,

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:37.290 align:middle line:84%
because the species
on Mars were,

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:43.330 align:middle line:84%
as it's been said in the ancient
philosophies, a more warrior

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:44.130 align:middle line:90%
type species.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>> The Anunnaki.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I've heard that
before, but I don't know--

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And they have the
big heads this way,

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:56.350 align:middle line:84%
and they are the ones who
did battle in the deserts

00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:00.730 align:middle line:84%
of Mesopotamia and the residue
that they left with their bombs

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:05.950 align:middle line:84%
were and are the trinitite the
glassy silica in many parts

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:06.910 align:middle line:90%
of the Middle East.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So as much as I understand
is that Mars, at that time,

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:18.710 align:middle line:84%
had several dominant
species living there,

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:23.020 align:middle line:84%
which is insectoid
species, a reptile species,

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.970 align:middle line:90%
and a human species.

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And all three of them were
very aggressive, which

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:33.900 align:middle line:84%
caused this catastrophe we
had, which occurred to Mars.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And those beings, especially
those human beings, the soul,

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:44.370 align:middle line:84%
in some way, remembers,
on a very subtle level,

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:48.490 align:middle line:84%
the social background
from before.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:53.670 align:middle line:84%
So if a soul like on Mars has
experienced a very dominant

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:59.430 align:middle line:84%
warlike species, they have
a very dominant tendency

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:03.760 align:middle line:84%
towards aggression when
they reincarnate maybe

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.560 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Repeating history.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Repeating history.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:07.680 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:12.600 align:middle line:84%
>> How do the grey ones,
the grey skin ones,

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:17.520 align:middle line:84%
that seem to have a job
of keeping the entity soul

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.850 align:middle line:84%
and the container type of body
together for a certain length

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:27.470 align:middle line:84%
of time, would they have a
very specific relationship with

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:30.410 align:middle line:84%
another dimensional
intelligence?

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And is that why we would think
that the recycling of souls

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:41.180 align:middle line:84%
is always going into heaven
and out of heaven or into hell

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.380 align:middle line:90%
and out of hell?

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>> But heaven is a
social construct.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a beneficial and
working construct,

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:54.950 align:middle line:84%
because it helps the
soul to be in a place

00:13:54.950 --> 00:14:00.140 align:middle line:84%
where it feels comfortable
and logical to reincarnate

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.560 align:middle line:90%
into something else.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.630 align:middle line:84%
So if someone dies, for
example, and he suddenly

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:08.810 align:middle line:84%
sees his own grandma
welcoming him

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:18.170 align:middle line:84%
in heaven and maybe even Jesus
standing there and taking the--

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:22.130 align:middle line:84%
hugging someone or something,
that is something that is

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:28.160 align:middle line:84%
might be placed there because
of certain social or religious

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.630 align:middle line:90%
belief systems.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>> But Tim, which came first?

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.270 align:middle line:84%
If this is a fundamental
cycle of this universe,

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:38.780 align:middle line:84%
it didn't start with
the creation of Earth.

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Earth would be an
echo and reflect what

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:43.790 align:middle line:90%
is going on in the macrocosm.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:48.050 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that there would
be a recycling of souls

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and that there would be those
that had a responsibility

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:55.370 align:middle line:84%
to keep certain matter and soul
together for a length of time,

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:59.210 align:middle line:84%
they would far precede any
religious box on Earth.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:00.870 align:middle line:90%
100%.

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:04.370 align:middle line:84%
So the question what came
first is pretty impossible

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:09.320 align:middle line:84%
to answer in a universe that
has no end and no beginning.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:14.120 align:middle line:84%
But if we're seeing this from
a linear perspective of time,

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:18.830 align:middle line:84%
meaning inside of
time, then death

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.950 align:middle line:84%
has always been an aspect
of the universe, which

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.230 align:middle line:90%
means pure nonexistence.

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:27.320 align:middle line:84%
It's been used in
order to ensure

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:34.070 align:middle line:84%
that a universe, a observer,
a consciousness unit, someone

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:38.490 align:middle line:84%
that comes to a dead
end, so to speak,

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:42.950 align:middle line:84%
has an opportunity to go from
that place to another place

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:46.880 align:middle line:84%
in order to start anew
and to build from that.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:52.400 align:middle line:84%
But, I mean, it's
been fairly misused,

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:57.200 align:middle line:84%
at least in this
society on this planet,

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:05.400 align:middle line:84%
but different other beings
have other a mechanism

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.500 align:middle line:90%
to deal with death.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Like what?

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm thinking of one reptilian
race that, for example,

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:17.160 align:middle line:84%
is spiritually so
evolved that they can,

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.420 align:middle line:84%
through their own
mind concentration,

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:26.310 align:middle line:84%
release themselves into a new
incarnation on the same planet.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:30.540 align:middle line:84%
So once they die,
they have big caves

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:35.310 align:middle line:84%
full of eggs where they
put their minds into it

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:39.060 align:middle line:84%
through training and
psionics and concentration.

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And from that point, they
develop as a new body.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're saying that they
would choose in one physical

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:50.110 align:middle line:84%
form that's going to die,
they would pick out an egg.

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Do you mean like sperm and
egg humanoid or larger,

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:55.950 align:middle line:90%
would it be?

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Larger, but
probably of size--

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Like some kind of an egg?

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:00.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>> And then they are mentally
and soul energy projecting

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:09.490 align:middle line:90%
the life that they're choosing.

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:11.910 align:middle line:84%
It's going out, and
they're now putting it

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:17.819 align:middle line:84%
into another egg that will
then be identical to that

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:19.420 align:middle line:90%
which has died?

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.569 align:middle line:84%
>> I wouldn't say
it's identical.

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:22.589 align:middle line:90%
Might be.

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:24.599 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:29.040 align:middle line:84%
But it's certainly a free
body that can be accessed.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:33.250 align:middle line:84%
So awareness doesn't stop
if you lose your body.

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:36.990 align:middle line:84%
It only-- the body
provides a certain amount

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:40.530 align:middle line:84%
of tools where we can
perceive the universe

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:43.870 align:middle line:84%
and information in a certain
linear and logical way.

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:47.400 align:middle line:84%
But once the body dies,
that doesn't mean that--

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.890 align:middle line:84%
because there are a lot
of examples on this planet

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:54.750 align:middle line:84%
as well that awareness after
death can still continue.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:59.220 align:middle line:84%
But normally, there are
some natural mechanisms

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:06.000 align:middle line:84%
that, the soul once they die,
is being referred to in some way

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.680 align:middle line:84%
and reincarnated
into something else.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:12.000 align:middle line:84%
But if you train, like
yogis, for example,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.600 align:middle line:90%
do for thousands of years.

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.420 align:middle line:84%
If you train yourself
enough and you

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:21.810 align:middle line:84%
know where you need to bring
your own perception into,

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:27.630 align:middle line:84%
then this species has used
that mechanism in order

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:31.170 align:middle line:84%
to bring themselves
into an egg again.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:35.790 align:middle line:84%
That is a natural phenomena or
a capability through training.

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:37.860 align:middle line:84%
But if you see, for
example, the Greys.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.890 align:middle line:84%
The Greys have this
artificial network

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:45.510 align:middle line:84%
going on where they extract
the information of one body,

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:48.870 align:middle line:84%
put it digitally
into the system,

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:52.740 align:middle line:84%
and get it released into
another vessel or an avatar

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.840 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you want to name it.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:19:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Along that line, 1992
I believe was the year,

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:08.360 align:middle line:84%
and he was a very bright young
scientist out of college.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:13.400 align:middle line:90%
He had a death event.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And in the period of time
that somehow his consciousness

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:29.920 align:middle line:84%
retains something, he was
shown that he was exiting here.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:34.270 align:middle line:90%
He was moving into another--

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:36.340 align:middle line:84%
to him, it was like
he left and went

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:40.380 align:middle line:84%
into another universe
except where there

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.530 align:middle line:84%
was a black sky
here and white stars

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:50.250 align:middle line:84%
at night, where he ended up was
a white sky with black dots.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:52.890 align:middle line:84%
He found himself
going rapidly down

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.140 align:middle line:84%
to what he perceived
to be a planet

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.960 align:middle line:84%
and tried to describe
the colors saying

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.280 align:middle line:90%
they were beyond vibrant.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And then the next thing that
he knows, he's being born.

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And he said, all
I can tell you is

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.150 align:middle line:84%
that it seems, from
my point of view,

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:18.090 align:middle line:84%
that we're in a
universe that is working

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.460 align:middle line:84%
in tandem with another
universe, and they

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:25.740 align:middle line:84%
are exactly the opposite, and
that where I grew and died

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:29.040 align:middle line:84%
in this universe, I
traveled into another

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.260 align:middle line:90%
in which I was reborn.

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And I will die in that
one and come back.

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was the first
time that I've ever

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.960 align:middle line:84%
heard anybody in the
abduction syndrome

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:45.360 align:middle line:84%
ever be exposed to the idea of
parallel identical universes

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.500 align:middle line:84%
in which there would be a
cycle of life and death.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.430 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever heard that before?

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:58.920 align:middle line:84%
So we're going deeper into the
model of sequential harmonics,

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:02.350 align:middle line:84%
which means there are
levels of consciousness,

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:08.130 align:middle line:84%
there are spaces that
contain certain species

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:10.260 align:middle line:84%
with a certain level
of consciousness.

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And I can explain this
model a little further,

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:19.050 align:middle line:84%
but if you think about level
three consciousness, which

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:25.390 align:middle line:84%
is self awareness, you have
a level six consciousness,

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:33.660 align:middle line:84%
which is the inverted state of
the universe, which means it's

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:35.550 align:middle line:90%
the realm of non-existence.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:38.970 align:middle line:84%
So what you're describing,
for example, it

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.100 align:middle line:84%
might not be a
physical place, but it

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.160 align:middle line:84%
might be perceived
as something physical

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.290 align:middle line:84%
because it's the
inversion of existence,

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:50.140 align:middle line:90%
which happens at level six.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you explain the
whole level one through seven

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:59.620 align:middle line:84%
of frequencies that I
think another word would be

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:03.200 align:middle line:84%
dimensions, frequencies
and dimensions.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And if it's different,
explain that whole step up.

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:13.420 align:middle line:84%
So there is a difference between
dimensions and frequencies.

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Because dimension,
as I said earlier,

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.910 align:middle line:84%
is a measuring unit
for space, which

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:22.630 align:middle line:84%
means the more dimensions
you have, the more exact

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:27.430 align:middle line:84%
you can triangulate a position
within a certain space.

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:30.830 align:middle line:84%
A frequency doesn't
necessarily need a space.

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:34.150 align:middle line:84%
So in a perfect and
very easy to comprehend

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:39.340 align:middle line:84%
example of that would be a dream
state of mind, which means when

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:43.270 align:middle line:84%
you are awake and aware
of your surroundings,

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:48.070 align:middle line:84%
I can easily utilize all
the dimensions in order

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:49.600 align:middle line:90%
to measure where you are.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.300 align:middle line:84%
For example, right now
you are sitting here.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:56.710 align:middle line:84%
But when you are sleeping,
none of us could--

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:59.980 align:middle line:84%
your awareness goes
somewhere, because you

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:02.110 align:middle line:90%
are in a state of awareness.

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:04.960 align:middle line:84%
That means you are
alive, you are there,

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.430 align:middle line:84%
you are the universe, you
are creating something,

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:10.210 align:middle line:84%
but it's not possible
from the outside world

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:12.020 align:middle line:90%
to say where you are.

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And that means you are in
some frequency that does not

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:19.570 align:middle line:90%
necessarily contain space.

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:22.120 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing
is that every one of us

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.960 align:middle line:84%
goes through a level
three consciousness, which

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.120 align:middle line:90%
is I awareness and--

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.890 align:middle line:90%
>> I have a body.

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:31.310 align:middle line:90%
I can touch the table.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>> 100%.

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And everyone went
to a certain phase,

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:39.940 align:middle line:84%
which is level six in
which there is nothing.

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.240 align:middle line:84%
When you sleep and before
you enter a dream state,

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:49.650 align:middle line:84%
there is a short amount
of nothingness, right.

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:52.020 align:middle line:84%
But we are still aware
of that nothingness.

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:55.140 align:middle line:84%
We all know that there is
something that brought us

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.110 align:middle line:84%
from that frequency
to another frequency,

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:01.920 align:middle line:84%
and this is a realm
of non-existence,

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.660 align:middle line:84%
which is the antithesis
to existence,

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.000 align:middle line:90%
and this is level six.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And through level
six consciousness,

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:12.480 align:middle line:84%
we can integrate ourselves
in any other level three

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.790 align:middle line:84%
consciousness
place in the world.

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And Being 6 is a being
consciousness from level six.

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:19.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a so-called
mindset being, which

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:27.450 align:middle line:84%
means it's a place of
existence that only comes

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:31.020 align:middle line:84%
into existence if you
and me and everyone else

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:35.120 align:middle line:90%
consciously decides for it.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Only then we can find this
existence, because being six

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:42.140 align:middle line:90%
is a place.

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:48.315 align:middle line:84%
If you want to think in terms
of space, which it's not a--

00:24:48.315 --> 00:24:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>> It's nonexistence.

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Nonexistence.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:55.880 align:middle line:84%
But it contains every
one that willing fully

00:24:55.880 --> 00:25:00.310 align:middle line:90%
contributes to a harmonious--

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:01.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Selfless.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Not even selfless, because
individuality is still a thing

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.650 align:middle line:84%
there, so we can all
be whatever we want,

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:12.460 align:middle line:84%
but we have to agree that we
make this everything our home,

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:15.940 align:middle line:84%
for me, for you, and
for everyone watching.

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.430 align:middle line:90%
So that is Being 6.

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>> If we get to level six
and it is nothingness,

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.540 align:middle line:90%
then why is there a level seven?

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Our level seven
is a unification.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:32.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a phase in where
anything gets unified.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:35.290 align:middle line:84%
So it begins with a level
one consciousness, which

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:37.150 align:middle line:90%
is, for example, this cup.

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:42.730 align:middle line:84%
This cup is a living being, even
though it cannot be measured

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:45.260 align:middle line:90%
where it starts with ends.

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:48.070 align:middle line:84%
So if I break this
cup, do I now have two

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.180 align:middle line:90%
or do I have the same or not?

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:52.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is a level
one consciousness

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:56.350 align:middle line:84%
being that only an
object, we would call it,

00:25:56.350 --> 00:26:01.810 align:middle line:84%
which only has an awareness
of certain information

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:04.480 align:middle line:90%
that we would objectify.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:09.340 align:middle line:84%
A level two consciousness
would be any lifeform that

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:13.870 align:middle line:84%
is capable and
able to move freely

00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:17.170 align:middle line:90%
but still has no self-awareness.

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Blood cells, sperm,
all these things

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.690 align:middle line:90%
are level two consciousness.

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:24.700 align:middle line:84%
A level three
consciousness being

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:29.450 align:middle line:84%
is a being that looks in the
mirror and says, that's me.

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:32.410 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing
is that being together

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:36.910 align:middle line:84%
with all these beings helps
other beings to ascend.

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:38.120 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about that.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.020 align:middle line:84%
So if you, for example,
take an elephant

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:46.210 align:middle line:84%
in the jungle of India,
it will attack a mirror

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:49.570 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
have self-awareness.

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:50.780 align:middle line:90%
It would attack it.

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:58.780 align:middle line:84%
But if you take an elephant that
is in relationship with humans

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:04.390 align:middle line:84%
and, for example, in the zoo
or in a circus or whatever,

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:08.080 align:middle line:84%
they would understand
that it's looking

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.060 align:middle line:90%
at themselves in the mirror.

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:13.070 align:middle line:84%
So this is level
three consciousness,

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:16.940 align:middle line:84%
and you can see that a
species can have individuals

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:19.700 align:middle line:90%
with different levels of that.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:24.440 align:middle line:84%
Once a certain amount of people
have reached a certain level

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:28.145 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, that
applies for the whole group

00:27:28.145 --> 00:27:31.160 align:middle line:90%
and the whole species as well.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.080 align:middle line:84%
Our pets, for
example, if you think

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:36.350 align:middle line:84%
about dogs compared to
a wolf or something,

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:39.320 align:middle line:90%
a dog certainly if you say--

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>> They know English
or German or--

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:43.650 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:46.610 align:middle line:90%
And that helps the soul.

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:48.870 align:middle line:84%
One thing that
Being 6 said to me,

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:50.690 align:middle line:84%
and I found that
super hilarious,

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:55.430 align:middle line:84%
is a dog that, for example,
lives together with a human

00:27:55.430 --> 00:28:00.290 align:middle line:84%
and is not capable to open his
own food tin, but the human,

00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:05.330 align:middle line:84%
and he observes that it's able
to open the food tin, that

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:10.100 align:middle line:84%
would make the dog have a
desire to become a human.

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:14.000 align:middle line:84%
So when the dog dies,
it's very certain

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.840 align:middle line:84%
that this dog will
reincarnate into a human form,

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.580 align:middle line:84%
because that is what he
felt is very inspiring.

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:24.260 align:middle line:84%
It's very motivational to
opening your own food tin.

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And it leads really to the
issue of powerbrokers on any

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.540 align:middle line:90%
planet.

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:34.530 align:middle line:84%
If the reincarnated
cycles of the souls

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:40.230 align:middle line:84%
at any one of these seven
levels is always ongoing, then

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:44.250 align:middle line:84%
who would be
running Earth today?

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:48.300 align:middle line:84%
Who, in this power broker
structure in which I and others

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:52.290 align:middle line:84%
have been told that if the
very top of the controllers

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:55.770 align:middle line:84%
of the powerbrokers and
with the powerbrokers,

00:28:55.770 --> 00:29:00.150 align:middle line:84%
are non humans,
powerful non humans.

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:04.290 align:middle line:84%
So if Earth, maybe for
centuries, maybe for millennia,

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:07.950 align:middle line:84%
maybe for millions of
years, has literally

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:11.820 align:middle line:84%
had at the top of a
pyramidal power structure,

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:19.130 align:middle line:84%
always non humans working
through with the frequencies

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:25.310 align:middle line:84%
of humans, human form,
what do you personally

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:28.680 align:middle line:84%
think of everything
you've been exposed to?

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:32.160 align:middle line:84%
If you were describing what
the true pyramidal structure

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:36.930 align:middle line:84%
of power on Earth is right
now, how would you describe it?

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Then I would say there is
no pyramidal structure at all,

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:46.590 align:middle line:84%
because it's overlaying
frequencies that all have

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:50.790 align:middle line:84%
their own multitude of
life forms that all affect

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:56.340 align:middle line:84%
the system equally, even though
there are species that are way

00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:01.710 align:middle line:84%
more developed than other
species and might have a bigger

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:05.880 align:middle line:84%
picture, but they are still
not the number one race.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:09.870 align:middle line:84%
I honestly, through all
that I've experienced

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:12.390 align:middle line:84%
and through all that
I've communicated to,

00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:17.520 align:middle line:84%
there is no supreme
being and God.

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:21.270 align:middle line:84%
I think it's good that
we don't have that,

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:27.150 align:middle line:84%
so there's no being that has all
powers concentrated on itself.

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:30.030 align:middle line:84%
Even though there
are some species that

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:36.210 align:middle line:84%
are trying to become that one
being, but in the end on level

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:40.470 align:middle line:84%
seven, we will see when we
have a unified field again

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:46.060 align:middle line:84%
that we still have this
one point of existence,

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.470 align:middle line:90%
which is unified.

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And in a unified field, no one
is superior or below anything.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So it is a paradox, because
what you're describing are

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:03.930 align:middle line:84%
seven levels, at which
the seventh level,

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:10.950 align:middle line:84%
it's all a singular point of
view and yet if reincarnative

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:15.780 align:middle line:84%
recycling is the machinery of
this cosmos and all cosmoses,

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:23.290 align:middle line:84%
seven wouldn't want to come
back and be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:25.420 align:middle line:90%
So what happens to the sevens?

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a decision on
some of those levels where

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:32.920 align:middle line:84%
your observational
standpoint is.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.790 align:middle line:84%
So while people when they are in
a consciousness level of three

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:38.860 align:middle line:84%
do not even realize
that there might

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:42.130 align:middle line:84%
be different other
frequencies, they might not

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:46.030 align:middle line:84%
be able to take a conscious
decision about where they want

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:49.720 align:middle line:84%
to integrate into, and
that is, for example,

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:52.540 align:middle line:84%
where those beings that
we are just talking about

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:56.360 align:middle line:84%
kick into and say, from
your soul's perspective,

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:59.560 align:middle line:84%
you might make sense here
and there and so forth.

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:03.580 align:middle line:84%
They want a consciousness
unit to come to a place

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:06.670 align:middle line:84%
where they understand that
they are free in order

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:11.080 align:middle line:84%
to reincarnate whether
they want to or even create

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:14.310 align:middle line:84%
their own home the
way they want to.

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:18.170 align:middle line:84%
The only struggle
that appears is

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:23.120 align:middle line:84%
when a observer
feels disintegrated

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.840 align:middle line:84%
from another observer and
starts competing, that's

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:31.070 align:middle line:84%
something where the paradox,
what you were speaking about,

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:32.370 align:middle line:90%
is kicking in.

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:36.710 align:middle line:84%
So that means even though we
are all this one living life

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:39.980 align:middle line:84%
form, this air, this life
form, me as this life form,

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.260 align:middle line:84%
you as this life form, even
this cup and this table

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:43.400 align:middle line:90%
is this life form.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:48.350 align:middle line:84%
If one of these things
think that it should compete

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:51.290 align:middle line:84%
over something else,
then you have a paradox,

00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:52.670 align:middle line:90%
and that needs to be solved.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is, for
many, many species,

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.130 align:middle line:90%
a heavy reason to live.

00:32:58.130 --> 00:33:01.490 align:middle line:84%
>> We know we've got six and
seven, but what about five?

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:03.230 align:middle line:90%
What happens on the fifth level?

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:04.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.890 align:middle line:84%
So a fifth level
of consciousness

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:12.290 align:middle line:84%
is even more loose and shows
a lot more opportunities

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:13.820 align:middle line:90%
compared to level four.

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Level four, basically,
is something

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.730 align:middle line:84%
that we can experience
right now right here.

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:23.270 align:middle line:84%
It contains bodies,
matter, everything

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:25.550 align:middle line:84%
that we know of a
level three world,

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:28.190 align:middle line:90%
but in a more loose form.

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:32.870 align:middle line:84%
So things like telepathy,
telekinesis, these

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:35.990 align:middle line:84%
are things that occur on
level four consciousness,

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:42.740 align:middle line:84%
and we integrate them into a
more or less dense level three

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:43.880 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:48.690 align:middle line:84%
On level five, energy becomes
more and more important.

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:53.810 align:middle line:84%
So level five means that you
do not need to have a body.

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:57.860 align:middle line:84%
You can have a body, but
you are free to become

00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:58.980 align:middle line:90%
whatever you want.

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:02.900 align:middle line:84%
So this is basically
something that

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:12.139 align:middle line:84%
is far more energetical,
philosophical, and mostly far

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:16.730 align:middle line:84%
away from the hands-on
problems and paradoxes

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:19.880 align:middle line:84%
that we might have
in a 3D world.

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:23.630 align:middle line:84%
If we're thinking about
level five consciousness,

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:29.810 align:middle line:84%
we only have four beings,
four collective species

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:32.600 align:middle line:90%
that are still bad.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Every other species,
every other being,

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:42.050 align:middle line:84%
every other aspect of life
at level five consciousness

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:43.889 align:middle line:90%
is good.

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:45.110 align:middle line:90%
It's super good.

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:50.840 align:middle line:84%
So compare that,
it's like one or four

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:54.739 align:middle line:84%
grains of sand compared
to the whole beach,

00:34:54.739 --> 00:34:58.010 align:middle line:84%
whereas the whole beach
is super good and four--

00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:01.430 align:middle line:84%
species at level
four are competing

00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:07.700 align:middle line:84%
for that dominance within
an unsolved situation

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.530 align:middle line:90%
of competition.

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:13.970 align:middle line:84%
At level six, that
is being reduced

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:17.040 align:middle line:90%
to only one single being.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:21.870 align:middle line:84%
So we at level six, we have
the whole existence of infinity

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:25.830 align:middle line:84%
that is good,
benevolent, and nice,

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:30.960 align:middle line:84%
and only one singular
being that is bad.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Why is that one
even allowed in six?

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Because this is the probable
antithesis to good that still

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:43.620 align:middle line:90%
exists at level six.

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:48.030 align:middle line:84%
Because everything we
qualify as good needs

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:52.920 align:middle line:84%
to have antithesis in the
universe ontologically, which

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:54.070 align:middle line:90%
is bad.

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:58.180 align:middle line:84%
So through feeling and
through being good,

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:03.310 align:middle line:84%
there is always one aspect
that needs to be bad.

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>> But why?

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Remember the Fibonacci code
where we have one singular

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:12.250 align:middle line:84%
universe and then we
put an antithesis to it?

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And once that being,
that singular being,

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:19.020 align:middle line:84%
comes to this conclusion,
it will logically

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:25.080 align:middle line:84%
say that it's not necessary
to be bad and becomes good,

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:28.290 align:middle line:84%
and then everything in the
universe is solved again,

00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:31.110 align:middle line:84%
everything can be united,
everything we have

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:34.890 align:middle line:84%
is home again, and then we
have level seven consciousness.

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:37.710 align:middle line:84%
So at level seven
consciousness, we

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:41.160 align:middle line:84%
have a unified
reintegrated field

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.580 align:middle line:84%
of the whole universe
being benevolent

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:49.290 align:middle line:84%
and home and super
nice, which is heaven.

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you, Tim, so much for
joining me on another special

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:54.870 align:middle line:90%
"Truth Hunter."

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you, Linda
for having me.

00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:01.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Coming up on the
next "Truth Hunter."

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:05.950 align:middle line:84%
>> There are chemicals being
used but also frequencies

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:10.750 align:middle line:84%
in order to slow down the
process of evolution on this

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:11.560 align:middle line:90%
planet.

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:15.010 align:middle line:84%
Everything that can be
experienced on this planet

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:18.610 align:middle line:84%
is in some way or another
influenced by the installation.

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:20.840 align:middle line:84%
The question is, who
has installed it?

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:24.910 align:middle line:10%
And once it was in place,
it is mostly driving itself,

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:27.940 align:middle line:10%
because humanity,
without even knowing,

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:31.530 align:middle line:10%
is contributing to its function.

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:35.000 align:middle line:90%
