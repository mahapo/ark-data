00:00:05.434 --> 00:00:09.880 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:25.730 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Communication and physical
contact with other beings has

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.020 align:middle line:10%
been ongoing for years,
according to many people

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.110 align:middle line:10%
affected by the UFO
abduction syndrome.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.990 align:middle line:10%
But the official social
and political attitude

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.640 align:middle line:10%
into the 21st century has
been that we humans are alone

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.860 align:middle line:10%
in this huge universe.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.010 align:middle line:84%
NASA's search for
extraterrestrial intelligence,

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.460 align:middle line:84%
known as SETI, that listen
for certain frequencies

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.960 align:middle line:84%
in the cosmos had been the
only respectable public focus

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.200 align:middle line:84%
for questions about
extraterrestrial life

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.630 align:middle line:84%
until Congress canceled
funding in the fall of 1993.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.510 align:middle line:84%
Then SETI continued
on to this day

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.810 align:middle line:84%
in another program
that still searches.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Ironically, other intelligences
have been coming and going here

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.120 align:middle line:84%
on Earth with or without
SETI's knowledge,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.970 align:middle line:84%
according to government
whistleblowers

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.060 align:middle line:84%
and to people in the
human abduction syndrome.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Part of the alien
agenda is described

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.880 align:middle line:84%
by government whistleblowers
as the harvesting

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.830 align:middle line:84%
of genetic material to
create hybrids and clones.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.440 align:middle line:84%
If that's true,
that would explain

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.050 align:middle line:84%
the various descriptions
of alien beings

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.720 align:middle line:90%
in the abduction syndrome.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Are there are a variety
of biological species

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.690 align:middle line:84%
from somewhere else in the
universe coming and going

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.340 align:middle line:90%
on our planet?

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.950 align:middle line:90%
Abductees say there are.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Also, different dimensional
realities that are

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.440 align:middle line:90%
occupied by other intelligences.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And government whistleblowers
talk about an alien presence

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.100 align:middle line:84%
on Earth that has
been coexisting

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.120 align:middle line:84%
with surface life from
extensive underground bases

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.400 align:middle line:90%
all over this planet.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Even human abductees are not
certain about the true nature

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.750 align:middle line:84%
of the alien intelligences
involved in their lives.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.360 align:middle line:84%
But after my own three
decades of interviews

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.750 align:middle line:84%
and having seen hundreds
of drawings of other beings

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.200 align:middle line:84%
by abductees, various
types of beings

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.760 align:middle line:84%
break down into a few
repeating categories.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.990 align:middle line:84%
On this "Truth
Hunter," I would like

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.260 align:middle line:84%
to share an emerging
taxonomy of alien presences

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.340 align:middle line:84%
that seem to be interacting
with Earth today

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.040 align:middle line:84%
and have allegedly
interacted in the past,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.620 align:middle line:84%
perhaps as long as 270 million
years ago, according to one US

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.660 align:middle line:90%
government whistleblower.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.560 align:middle line:84%
Taxonomy is the science
of naming, describing,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.230 align:middle line:90%
and classifying organisms.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.530 align:middle line:84%
The taxonomy I'm going
to talk about today

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.240 align:middle line:84%
is not familiar to the majority
of people on this planet yet.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.450 align:middle line:84%
But I think the "Truth
Hunter" audiences

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.180 align:middle line:84%
are people who do not
believe humans are alone

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.110 align:middle line:84%
in this vast universe, no
matter what policies of denial

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.320 align:middle line:84%
governments have used to
keep the public and the media

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.460 align:middle line:90%
ignorant on purpose.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:10%
Why have there been
decades of secrecy

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.140 align:middle line:10%
about such a fundamentally
important fact that we humans

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.480 align:middle line:10%
are not alone in this universe?

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.590 align:middle line:10%
I think at least one reason is
that during World War II, Prime

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.070 align:middle line:10%
Minister Winston Churchill,
American General Dwight

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.180 align:middle line:10%
Eisenhower, and US
President Harry S. Truman,

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.540 align:middle line:10%
they were afraid of
public panic if they

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.810 align:middle line:10%
told the truth about
what they were learning

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.890 align:middle line:10%
and called celestial
craft and beings.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.330 align:middle line:84%
This letter is an excerpt to
the UK'S Ministry of Defense

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.230 align:middle line:84%
in London, dated
October 4th, 1999.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.810 align:middle line:84%
It was about a British
scientist father

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.780 align:middle line:84%
who worked as a security guard
for Prime Minister Winston

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.080 align:middle line:90%
Churchill.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.820 align:middle line:84%
The Sun reported to the MOD
that his father overheard

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Churchill tell then
General Eisenhower

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.649 align:middle line:84%
about a silver metallic disk
that shocked an RAF pilot

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:23.480 align:middle line:90%
with its aerial maneuvers.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.820 align:middle line:84%
The silver disk was
described as rapidly

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.930 align:middle line:84%
flying in loops around and
around the length of the RAF

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.710 align:middle line:84%
jet fighter itself
moving fast in the sky.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Prime Minister
Churchill was heard

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.990 align:middle line:84%
to say to General
Eisenhower that, quote,

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.350 align:middle line:84%
the incident should be
immediately classified

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.380 align:middle line:84%
for at least 50
years, close quote.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.110 align:middle line:90%
That was around 1944.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.030 align:middle line:10%
Today, we appear to be close
to the huge paradigm shift

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.630 align:middle line:10%
that the universe has
lots of intelligent life.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.420 align:middle line:10%
I say that because
as a TV producer

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.730 align:middle line:10%
and investigative
reporter, I have

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.920 align:middle line:10%
been trying to
leverage open truths

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.970 align:middle line:10%
about non-human interactions
with Earth humans and animals

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.870 align:middle line:10%
since I produced a TV
documentary entitled "A Strange

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.440 align:middle line:10%
Harvest."

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.590 align:middle line:10%
That was about the worldwide,
bloodless, trackless

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.680 align:middle line:10%
mutilations of large
and small animals

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.630 align:middle line:10%
that was first broadcast on
May 25th, 1980, under then

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.920 align:middle line:10%
CBS affiliate KMGH-TV Channel
7 in Denver, Colorado.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was awarded
a regional Emmy.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Channel 7 is where I was
Director of Special Projects.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.100 align:middle line:84%
My TV producer, writer,
director, editor career

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.790 align:middle line:84%
had begun a decade before
after graduating in 1968

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.300 align:middle line:84%
from Stanford University
in Palo Alto, California,

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.880 align:middle line:84%
with a master's degree
in communication.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.580 align:middle line:84%
At Stanford University
in Palo Alto,

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.920 align:middle line:84%
I made a documentary film for
the Stanford Medical Center.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And my master's thesis
was a picture calculus

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.930 align:middle line:84%
about the first efforts
to use computers

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.810 align:middle line:84%
to analyze atomic
particle bombardment

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.810 align:middle line:84%
images at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator.

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.590 align:middle line:10%
After that, I produced
science and medical programs

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.660 align:middle line:10%
for the ABC affiliate
in Boston at WCBB.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.070 align:middle line:10%
There I was an honored producer
in the station's Peabody Award

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.470 align:middle line:10%
for broadcasting excellence.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.160 align:middle line:10%
My journalism beat has always
been science, environment,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.500 align:middle line:10%
and medicine.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.850 align:middle line:10%
And it was in that
context that I

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.440 align:middle line:10%
began investigating
all the cattle, horses,

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.130 align:middle line:10%
and other animal
mutilations in Colorado,

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.830 align:middle line:10%
the surrounding
region, and the world.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.490 align:middle line:84%
That's when I was first told
by sheriffs and ranchers

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:49.690 align:middle line:84%
that the perpetrators were
creatures from outer space.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.670 align:middle line:84%
I had been trying ever
since to understand who

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:59.360 align:middle line:84%
and how have non-humans been
harvesting Earth life and why.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.560 align:middle line:84%
In this "Truth
Hunter," I am going

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.140 align:middle line:84%
to present illustrations
and information

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.190 align:middle line:84%
from human abductees, government
and military whistleblowers,

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.800 align:middle line:84%
and alleged
government documents,

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.820 align:middle line:84%
even if we do not have the
official announcement yet

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.540 align:middle line:84%
that confirms the alien
presences and their very

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.460 align:middle line:90%
complex agendas.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.600 align:middle line:10%
In 1994, my second book,
"Glimpses of Other Realities;

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.120 align:middle line:10%
Volume I, Facts
and Eyewitnesses"

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:32.220 align:middle line:10%
was published with a 50-page
taxonomy of non-human entities

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.970 align:middle line:10%
and updated in a
2015 new edition.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.700 align:middle line:10%
The taxonomy that I
compiled from dozens

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.510 align:middle line:10%
of color and black and
white illustrations

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.240 align:middle line:10%
shared with me by people in
the human abduction syndrome.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.210 align:middle line:84%
I grouped together different
types of alien beings

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:51.210 align:middle line:84%
by shape and color but
with little understanding

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.790 align:middle line:84%
about the relationship of
the beings to each other.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Here are some images
from that taxonomy.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:04.230 align:middle line:10%
Houston, Texas, May 1973,
then teenager Cindy Tindle

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:06.450 align:middle line:10%
and her mother Judy
Doraty were abducted

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.850 align:middle line:10%
near a pasture
outside Houston, where

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:13.350 align:middle line:10%
a calf was being lifted up in a
pale yellow beam that soon took

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:15.750 align:middle line:10%
the mother and daughter too.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:19.600 align:middle line:10%
Onboard, they watched
snake-eyed grey creatures,

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.090 align:middle line:10%
an insect entity, and another
being with large black eyes,

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:27.260 align:middle line:10%
who seemed more gentle and kind.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.990 align:middle line:10%
Than non-human entities
all worked in a lab

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:33.190 align:middle line:10%
excising tissues from
the beamed up calf.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.780 align:middle line:84%
The non-humans also
examined Cindy and Judy,

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:41.070 align:middle line:84%
including swabbing tissue
from inside Cindy's mouth,

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:43.080 align:middle line:90%
apparently collecting DNA.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Cindy also sketched this
mushroom-headed being

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:48.690 align:middle line:84%
that had narrow,
Oriental looking eyes

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.970 align:middle line:90%
with vertical pupils.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:55.020 align:middle line:10%
This non-human also worked with
tubes in a round laboratory

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.840 align:middle line:10%
room during the
abduction with her mother

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.600 align:middle line:10%
and the calf from
the Houston pasture.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.210 align:middle line:90%
Memphis, Tennessee, 1980s.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Adult male encountered
this tall, red haired

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.580 align:middle line:90%
being during an abduction.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Similar red haired
types have been

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.580 align:middle line:84%
described by abductees in
Nevada, Southern California,

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.790 align:middle line:90%
and the Andes Mountains of Peru.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.520 align:middle line:90%
New Jersey, 1987.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.830 align:middle line:84%
Adult female worked
with a sketch artist

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:27.000 align:middle line:84%
to depict the male and the
left, about 7-feet tall, that

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.910 align:middle line:84%
was working with the
blonde female humanoid.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:34.290 align:middle line:84%
The blonde female humanoid
had a, quote, pearlescent,

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:38.370 align:middle line:84%
translucent complexion,
close quote.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.860 align:middle line:84%
The New Jersey female
abductee thought

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.310 align:middle line:84%
that the male's eyes
were more golden

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:47.430 align:middle line:84%
and the female's, a
pale crystal blue.

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.460 align:middle line:10%
But the abductee compared
both of their eyes

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.210 align:middle line:10%
to a cat's, in which there
are vertical dark pupils

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:56.340 align:middle line:10%
and no white showing.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.920 align:middle line:10%
The female abductee
stressed that when she first

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.370 align:middle line:10%
saw the tall male
humanoid, his eyes

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:09.270 align:middle line:10%
were solid black, quote, he
took something off like shields

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:13.730 align:middle line:10%
and there were cat eyes
underneath, close quote.

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:17.600 align:middle line:10%
In the lower right corner
are two overlapping triangles

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.590 align:middle line:10%
that the New Jersey abductee
said the tall beings wore

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:24.950 align:middle line:10%
on their leotard
jumpsuits, which signified,

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:29.270 align:middle line:10%
quote, the merging of
two worlds, close quote.

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:32.090 align:middle line:10%
She did not know
which worlds or why.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.490 align:middle line:10%
That same New Jersey
female also sketched

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:38.090 align:middle line:10%
this tall, beak
nosed humanoid male

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:41.840 align:middle line:10%
that worked with a cat eyed
tall blond and dark haired

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.370 align:middle line:10%
beings during an abduction
experience in 1987.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.640 align:middle line:10%
That's when she and
her family and two cars

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.670 align:middle line:10%
were all lifted from the
Pennsylvania Turnpike

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:55.400 align:middle line:10%
to a large aerial craft.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Here's another blonde type
encountered in Springfield,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.040 align:middle line:90%
Missouri, in March 1982.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.360 align:middle line:84%
The adult female was abducted
by 6-foot tall, blond haired,

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.300 align:middle line:84%
male humanoids in
brown jumpsuits

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:13.010 align:middle line:84%
that had a winged insignia
on the upper left chest.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Other abductees have
described snakes

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:19.850 align:middle line:84%
with wings in the insignias
of some blond beings.

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Southern California,
1990, adult female

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.560 align:middle line:84%
drew these three non-humans
after an abduction experience.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.060 align:middle line:84%
She said the non-humans had
light, brownish-yellow skin.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.740 align:middle line:10%
The being on the right
also had a triangle

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.920 align:middle line:10%
inside a circle on
his upper right chest.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.790 align:middle line:84%
That symbol has been
seen by many abductees,

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:43.880 align:middle line:84%
including Jean Robinson
of Springfield, Missouri.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.820 align:middle line:84%
She drew this circle around
an equilateral triangle

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.880 align:middle line:84%
that she remembered on the
left breast of her abductor's

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.830 align:middle line:90%
bodysuit.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:55.280 align:middle line:10%
What is the significance of the
triangle and the circle symbol

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.030 align:middle line:10%
seen in so many encounters
with the various grey skinned

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:01.680 align:middle line:10%
and light brown or
yellowish-brown types

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.140 align:middle line:10%
of beings?

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Why are there different sizes,
skin colors, head shapes,

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:10.700 align:middle line:84%
and eyes among the
grey skinned entities?

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.850 align:middle line:84%
Why are there different
looking blond types,

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:16.190 align:middle line:90%
some tall, some shorter.

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Why do some tall blond
types wear insignias

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:21.890 align:middle line:84%
of overlapping
triangles in a circle

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:24.020 align:middle line:84%
while shorter
blondes have a bird

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.890 align:middle line:84%
or snake inside a round
insignia on their uniforms?

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Why do some humans report
seeing standing up lizards

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:34.940 align:middle line:84%
while others say it looked
like a standing up crocodile

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.680 align:middle line:90%
with scales all over the body?

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.790 align:middle line:10%
Always confusing to me
has been the question,

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:44.660 align:middle line:10%
what are the relationships
between various entities?

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at a few
more illustrations

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.830 align:middle line:84%
from my original
taxonomy so that I

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:52.310 align:middle line:84%
can show why I think
the menagerie of so

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:55.700 align:middle line:84%
many different kinds over
the decades and centuries

00:12:55.700 --> 00:13:01.970 align:middle line:84%
probably are the product of
only 2 or 3 prime intelligences.

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:04.580 align:middle line:84%
I define a prime
intelligence as one

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:08.060 align:middle line:84%
of the top dogs
behind the scenes that

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:12.860 align:middle line:84%
produces cloned and hybridized
lifeforms for a wide range

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.660 align:middle line:90%
of work assignments.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, the
clones and hybrids

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:22.740 align:middle line:84%
would be androids, organic
artificial intelligence,

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.610 align:middle line:90%
or more simply, smart robots.

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.460 align:middle line:90%
Mount Vernon, Missouri, 1990.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:32.360 align:middle line:10%
Pale grey entity with large,
slanted black eyes with

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.990 align:middle line:10%
a triangle on his blue uniform
surrounding what looks like

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:38.980 align:middle line:10%
a crescent moon emitting energy.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:43.280 align:middle line:10%
This was drawn by Paula Watson,
who had repeated abductions

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:48.710 align:middle line:10%
from 1983 onward after she and
her husband Ron watched small,

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:53.900 align:middle line:10%
grey skinned non-humans float a
black cow from a nearby pasture

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:58.130 align:middle line:10%
into a strange craft that was
guarded by what they called

00:13:58.130 --> 00:13:59.540 align:middle line:10%
a lizard guy.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.940 align:middle line:90%
His hands had only four fingers.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Central Georgia in
1950s, adult male

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:84%
painted this daytime encounter
at his central Georgia farm.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.900 align:middle line:84%
He told me, quote,
these little guys

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.780 align:middle line:84%
seemed to float
down out of the sky.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:18.890 align:middle line:84%
They seemed to be able to appear
and disappear, close quote.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:21.500 align:middle line:90%
New Jersey, 1987.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Adult male painted these small
beings he saw in his house

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.880 align:middle line:84%
during a time of numerous
close encounter experiences

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.530 align:middle line:90%
from age 8 onward.

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Quote, they've used me like
a sperm bank, close quote.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.590 align:middle line:84%
He had abductions since his
early 20s, in which sperm

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:42.290 align:middle line:90%
was collected by the non-humans.

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:44.810 align:middle line:90%
New Jersey, 1987.

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:49.520 align:middle line:10%
Adult male painted these small
beings that he saw in his house

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.550 align:middle line:10%
during a time of numerous
close encounter experiences

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.650 align:middle line:10%
from age 8 onward.

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Quote, they've used
me like a sperm bank,

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.430 align:middle line:84%
sounding like the
other man, close quote.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.520 align:middle line:84%
He had abductions since his
early 20s in which sperm

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.100 align:middle line:90%
was collected by the non-humans.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Longmont, Colorado,
November 1980.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Tall, white skinned,
bald headed humanoid

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.370 align:middle line:84%
wearing a long blue cape
with a high blue collar

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:19.610 align:middle line:84%
was sketched by an adult
male under hypnosis

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:24.890 align:middle line:84%
under a joint abduction with
his wife in late November 1980.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:30.200 align:middle line:84%
Likely, the 1987 New Jersey
family members in two cars

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.670 align:middle line:84%
somehow were taken by an
extraterrestrial craft

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:39.110 align:middle line:84%
using invisibility technology
from the Pennsylvania Turnpike.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And the Colorado
husband and wife

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:46.190 align:middle line:84%
were also picked up in their
car from a Longmont highway.

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:48.320 align:middle line:84%
The husband, a
commercial artist,

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.860 align:middle line:84%
also sketched another
smaller being.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:56.540 align:middle line:84%
The husband said, this entity's
skin was actually the color

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.790 align:middle line:90%
of the grey sketch paper.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:02.000 align:middle line:84%
But under hypnosis, he
figured that he picked out

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.300 align:middle line:84%
the contrasting flesh
color to sketch with.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:09.710 align:middle line:84%
The husband was confused by
the layered yellow-gold collar,

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:12.830 align:middle line:84%
a detail that seemed so
out of place on what he

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:14.840 align:middle line:90%
said was an extraterrestrial.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Why would it need
a layered collar?

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:20.150 align:middle line:84%
But other people over
the past several decades

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:24.290 align:middle line:84%
have also seen and
sketched robes and collars

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.510 align:middle line:90%
on some of their ET handlers.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:29.630 align:middle line:84%
The Longmont husband also
sketched with charcoal

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:33.020 align:middle line:84%
a wider scene of this
yellow-colored entity that

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:37.100 align:middle line:84%
shows arched windows around
the craft's perimeter, which

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.250 align:middle line:84%
are drawn by other
abductees in other cases.

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And under hypnosis, the husband
called the being, quote,

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:49.670 align:middle line:84%
the creep because it examined
me and took my mind out

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:51.410 align:middle line:90%
and added something.

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:54.840 align:middle line:84%
There's more to life,
more to the world,

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.710 align:middle line:84%
there's more to everything
than anybody knows.

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:00.950 align:middle line:84%
There are more than three
dimensions everywhere.

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:02.780 align:middle line:90%
It all works together.

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.060 align:middle line:90%
Everything co-exists.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:09.770 align:middle line:84%
There are different dimensions
we cannot go into, close quote.

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:12.950 align:middle line:90%
Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, 1992.

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:16.339 align:middle line:84%
Adult male with several
abduction experiences

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:20.300 align:middle line:84%
sketched another collared-being
that he encountered.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:25.369 align:middle line:84%
And he said, quote, it had a
flattened nose with odd ridges

00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:27.920 align:middle line:90%
and eyes like a cat's.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:32.750 align:middle line:84%
I've seen a machine hooked
up to me to collect sperm.

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:35.750 align:middle line:90%
Bakersfield, California, 1990.

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Adult female sketched
yet another purple cape

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.930 align:middle line:84%
with a high collar on a
being that she thought

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.490 align:middle line:90%
was at least 7-feet tall.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:47.330 align:middle line:84%
He had a larger cranium
than most human heads

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:50.840 align:middle line:84%
along with a very
big and long nose.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:55.130 align:middle line:84%
His large, slanted eyes had
huge vertical black pupils

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.740 align:middle line:90%
surrounded by gold irises.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:01.730 align:middle line:84%
She said, quote, he was
in charge of everything,

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:06.590 align:middle line:84%
over everyone else, close
quote, including the small grey

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:07.910 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:12.710 align:middle line:84%
She had the distinct impression
that the tall being genetically

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:17.000 align:middle line:84%
made the small grey robots to
do work for the taller beings.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And the taller
beings, then, would

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:20.750 align:middle line:90%
be the prime intelligence.

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.720 align:middle line:10%
A side note about
big, curved noses

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:27.680 align:middle line:10%
from the famous case of Betty
and Barney Hill's abduction

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.050 align:middle line:10%
in the White Mountains of
New Hampshire on September

19th to 20th, 1961.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:36.440 align:middle line:90%
Afterward, Betty had dreams.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.180 align:middle line:90%
And she wrote them down.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And they were included
in the appendix

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:46.510 align:middle line:84%
of the 1966 John Fuller book,
The Interrupted Journey.

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:50.820 align:middle line:10%
Betty Hill wrote,
quote, their alien noses

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:55.110 align:middle line:10%
were larger and longer than
the average sized human nose.

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:58.140 align:middle line:10%
Although, I have seen
people with noses

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:02.820 align:middle line:10%
like the ones on the ETs,
Betty said, like Jimmy Durante,

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.160 align:middle line:10%
close quote.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.450 align:middle line:10%
Durante was the
famous 20th century

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:11.400 align:middle line:10%
singer nicknamed "The Schnoz"
for his large beak nose.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.460 align:middle line:10%
Jacksonville, Florida, 1964.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.650 align:middle line:10%
Another prominent
cranium was sketched

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:21.210 align:middle line:10%
by an adult male encountered
in an abduction at age 4.

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:25.470 align:middle line:10%
He said the being, quote, was
about 5-feet tall, no ears,

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:29.340 align:middle line:10%
small mouth, tight fitting
clothes, color of jumpsuit

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:33.630 align:middle line:10%
was royal blue with magenta
colors, and very long

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:35.790 align:middle line:10%
fingers, close quote.

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:39.630 align:middle line:84%
New Hope, Pennsylvania,
September 1985.

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:44.130 align:middle line:84%
New York City adult male drew
this being and craft at night

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.500 align:middle line:90%
after an encounter in New Hope.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Quote, female entity about
5.5-feet tall, very thin,

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:56.580 align:middle line:84%
with pure white skin was
standing about 30 yards away.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:58.830 align:middle line:84%
He said that he drew
it with yellow because

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.960 align:middle line:90%
of the reflection at night.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Her body seemed to glow in
a translucent colored light

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.800 align:middle line:90%
consisting of blues and reds.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Her eyes transfixed me and
I felt as though my mind was

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.730 align:middle line:90%
being looked through.

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:18.210 align:middle line:84%
I was under the absolute
control of this entity, who

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:21.600 align:middle line:84%
was accompanied by these
little three creatures

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:26.460 align:middle line:84%
in blue coat uniforms with what
looked like odd black netting

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.860 align:middle line:90%
over their faces, close quote.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.800 align:middle line:90%
Missouri, October 1976.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Adult male sketched
this non-human

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:36.690 align:middle line:84%
after he was abducted
with his wife

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:38.970 align:middle line:90%
and their 1-year-old daughter.

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Quote, I had no control
over my thoughts.

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:46.380 align:middle line:84%
The being took
everything from my mind,

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.920 align:middle line:84%
but I knew nothing
about him, close quote.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.950 align:middle line:90%
Central Georgia, 1950s.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Praying mantis encountered in
full daylight consciousness

00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:00.420 align:middle line:84%
at noon time by the young male
at his family's Georgia farm

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:03.360 align:middle line:90%
when he was only 8 years old.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.560 align:middle line:84%
He associated the praying
mantis with small grey beings,

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.950 align:middle line:84%
which he thought at the time
were something like androids

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:14.910 align:middle line:84%
programmed to do work for
the praying mantis types.

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:20.100 align:middle line:84%
The same 8-year-old also saw a
little grey entity behind two

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:24.090 align:middle line:84%
glowing faced praying mantis
creatures at the Central

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:27.580 align:middle line:90%
Georgia farm in the 1950s.

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.790 align:middle line:90%
Covina, California, 1963.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.790 align:middle line:84%
17-Year-old female
teenage abductee

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:35.980 align:middle line:84%
taken by and large
praying mantis

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:40.450 align:middle line:84%
to a room that was filled with
sparkly yellow-white light.

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Quote, I remember the
praying mantis entity

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:48.050 align:middle line:84%
slowly coming around the
corner and facing me.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:50.710 align:middle line:84%
He stood very still
and simply waited

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:54.370 align:middle line:84%
as if he knew how frightening
he appeared to me.

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:59.170 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, he began to talk to
me in my mind telepathically.

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:02.170 align:middle line:84%
He seemed to possess a
great deal of dignity.

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And he gave the impression
of being quite old.

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:10.210 align:middle line:84%
He walked me to this room that
was filled with dense light.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:13.030 align:middle line:84%
The memory ends with
me about to enter

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:18.790 align:middle line:84%
that room and the thought in my
head translated into the light

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:22.530 align:middle line:84%
has to do with what
happened, close quite.

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:27.460 align:middle line:84%
The experience involved a
soul transfer, she thought,

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:31.690 align:middle line:84%
from her human body under the
supervision of a grey being who

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:36.160 align:middle line:84%
apparently worked with or
for this praying mantis.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:40.330 align:middle line:84%
The California teenager received
a telepathic explanation from

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:44.320 align:middle line:84%
the praying mantis and the grey
being that it was vital that

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:49.300 align:middle line:84%
her soul spirit entity
continue Earth life in the same

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:54.190 align:middle line:84%
container body in which
she was born in 1946.

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Cloning her was
necessary, the being

00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:01.330 align:middle line:84%
said, because her heart had been
damaged by rheumatoid fever.

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:06.010 align:middle line:84%
So a new healthier
clone version of her

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:10.510 align:middle line:84%
had been created in which she
would continue her Earth life.

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:14.830 align:middle line:10%
She was left with the impression
that soul recycling in specific

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:18.850 align:middle line:10%
body containers was very
important to the praying mantis

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:21.130 align:middle line:10%
and the grey beings.

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:23.890 align:middle line:10%
Springfield, Missouri, 1980s.

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:26.550 align:middle line:10%
Female abductee Jean
Robinson encountered

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:30.280 align:middle line:10%
a 6-foot tall green,
scaly skinned humanoid

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.640 align:middle line:10%
with large yellow
irises that surrounded

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.980 align:middle line:10%
black vertical pupils.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Jean described the
chest as looking

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:42.820 align:middle line:84%
like large bones protruded from
under the scaly reptilian skin

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.970 align:middle line:84%
and gave the impression
of body armor.

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:48.670 align:middle line:90%
Springfield, Missouri, 1991.

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:51.880 align:middle line:84%
Another adult female from
Missouri was in bed sleeping

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:55.920 align:middle line:84%
when she began floating out
of her bedroom toward a light

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.090 align:middle line:90%
and through the wall.

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:01.300 align:middle line:84%
She saw a, quote,
repulsive looking entity

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:05.700 align:middle line:84%
with thin arms and an ugly
face like a giant grasshopper,

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:07.120 align:middle line:90%
close quote.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.840 align:middle line:84%
But instead of a grasshopper,
she worked with a sketch artist

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:15.040 align:middle line:84%
to draw a humanoid entity
with net-like scales

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.170 align:middle line:90%
all over its body.

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:19.960 align:middle line:84%
The sketch artist,
Lisa Dusenberry,

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.970 align:middle line:84%
attached these notes
to her illustration

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:25.030 align:middle line:90%
when she sent them to me.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Quote, the female abductee
felt the sensation

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.750 align:middle line:84%
of being pulled by a
force with fast movement

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:36.770 align:middle line:84%
to a reptilian humanoid
about 5-feet, 9-inches.

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:40.340 align:middle line:84%
It had a green body that
looked scaly and rough.

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:43.790 align:middle line:84%
She felt electricity
going through her hands.

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:48.050 align:middle line:84%
The reptoids had pea-green
eyes with yellow and black

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:51.890 align:middle line:84%
vertical pupils she
said were like a cat.

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Eyes slanted down
toward the outer face,

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:59.030 align:middle line:84%
no hair, small mouth,
thin arms, hands

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:04.070 align:middle line:84%
like a duck with tannish-brown
webbing, 3 or 4 long fingers

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:06.610 align:middle line:90%
with nails on the end.

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:10.780 align:middle line:84%
After hypnosis, she
felt like the reptilians

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:14.800 align:middle line:84%
need human beings to
make them stronger.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.530 align:middle line:90%
They're trying to get our genes.

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Threat of dying out,
inbreeding with us

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:24.730 align:middle line:84%
to see if the genes
we have can make them,

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:28.900 align:middle line:84%
the reptilian,
stronger, close quote.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Like so many other experiencers
of the non-human abduction

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.380 align:middle line:84%
syndrome, the Missouri
abductee did not

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.840 align:middle line:84%
understand what the
survival problem is

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:42.490 align:middle line:84%
or why Earth life should be
involved in an alien species

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:45.940 align:middle line:84%
regeneration,
especially reptilian.

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:49.200 align:middle line:84%
Springfield,
Missouri, July 1983.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.510 align:middle line:10%
Lizard guy on the left is
seen through binoculars

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:55.990 align:middle line:10%
by Ron and Paula Watson
of Mount Vernon, Missouri.

00:25:55.990 --> 00:26:00.160 align:middle line:10%
This is in a pasture, where
small grey beings floated a cow

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:05.020 align:middle line:10%
over the grass above ground into
the waiting craft next to what

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:08.280 align:middle line:10%
they called the lizard guy.

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:12.360 align:middle line:10%
The craft also seem to be
guarded by a hairy Sasquatch

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:16.110 align:middle line:10%
type creature on the far
right, possibly working

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:19.320 align:middle line:10%
with the lizard types as a
physical labor force made

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:24.060 align:middle line:10%
specifically to do work on
Earth are 8-foot tall, long

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.700 align:middle line:10%
haired, ape-like
creatures commonly known

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:29.580 align:middle line:10%
as Bigfoot or Sasquatch.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:33.840 align:middle line:10%
In the 1983 Missouri
cow abduction incident,

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.840 align:middle line:10%
the hairy creature
had large, round eyes

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.510 align:middle line:10%
with yellow vertical pupils.

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, a Montana rancher
in the mid-1970s

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.020 align:middle line:84%
near Great Falls,
Montana, he shot

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:49.320 align:middle line:84%
at an 8-foot tall
Sasquatch type that

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:53.550 align:middle line:84%
had long, reddish-brown hair
all over its humanoid body.

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:58.710 align:middle line:84%
The rancher shot with a
36-06 rifle and that creature

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:01.960 align:middle line:90%
disappeared in a flash of light.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.780 align:middle line:84%
I read it in a document
in the sheriff's offices

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:07.020 align:middle line:90%
with my own eyes.

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Other similar light flash
cases have provoked speculation

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:13.200 align:middle line:84%
that we humans are
being manipulated

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.430 align:middle line:84%
by an intelligence that has
sophisticated technology that

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:23.910 align:middle line:84%
can make us see anything that
it wants us humans to see.

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:25.980 align:middle line:84%
There are many
eyewitness testimonies

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:30.030 align:middle line:84%
by abductees about encountering
three-dimensional holographic

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:33.150 align:middle line:84%
projections that are
indistinguishable

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:37.050 align:middle line:84%
from the matter world, except
that the abductees have

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:42.420 align:middle line:84%
a gut sense of 3D holograms
not flesh or matter.

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:45.990 align:middle line:84%
All of this effort to understand
what our government knows

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:48.360 align:middle line:84%
about non-humans
interacting with our planet

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.510 align:middle line:84%
began when I was Director
of Special Projects

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:55.710 align:middle line:84%
at KMGH-TV, the CBS
station, then in Denver.

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:59.910 align:middle line:84%
Beginning in September 1979
and for the next 9 months

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:03.900 align:middle line:84%
until its first broadcast
on May 25th, 1980,

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:07.770 align:middle line:84%
I was producing the television
documentary, A Strange Harvest

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:10.620 align:middle line:84%
about the worldwide
animal mutilation mystery

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:14.160 align:middle line:84%
that had been publicly reported
since at least the middle

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.990 align:middle line:90%
of the 20th century.

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:18.360 align:middle line:84%
A Strange Harvest
led to my contract

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.900 align:middle line:84%
with Home Box
Office in March 1983

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:26.430 align:middle line:84%
to produce an hour special with
the working title, ETs, The UFO

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:27.870 align:middle line:90%
Factor.

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:30.870 align:middle line:84%
One of the first meetings I had
at the beginning of research

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and script development
for the HBO documentary

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.780 align:middle line:84%
was at Kirtland Air Force
Base in the Air Force

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:39.150 align:middle line:84%
Office of Special
Investigations,

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:42.150 align:middle line:90%
also known as AFOSI.

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:45.630 align:middle line:90%
The date was April 9, 1983.

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:49.140 align:middle line:84%
New York attorney Peter Gersten,
who worked with Citizens

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Against UFO Secrecy,
had organized my meeting

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:56.070 align:middle line:84%
with AFOSI Special
Agent Richard Doty

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:59.700 align:middle line:84%
to obtain names and addresses
about an alleged UFO

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:05.040 align:middle line:84%
incident at Ellsworth Air Force
Base, South Dakota, in 1978.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.920 align:middle line:84%
That's when an
armed security guard

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:13.320 align:middle line:84%
had his gun aimed at a
non-human outside a landed disk

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.520 align:middle line:90%
on or near that airbase.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.700 align:middle line:84%
The being emitted
a beam of light

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.800 align:middle line:84%
that evaporated
the gun right out

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.200 align:middle line:84%
of the security
guard's hand, according

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.630 align:middle line:90%
to military eyewitnesses.

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:28.170 align:middle line:84%
But instead of giving me names
and phone numbers for Ellsworth

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Air Force Base eyewitnesses
as attorney Gersten told me

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:36.030 align:middle line:84%
that Doty would, the
AFOSI agent handed me

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:38.700 align:middle line:84%
a document from a
desk drawer that looks

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.100 align:middle line:90%
something like this simulation.

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Quote, briefing paper for the
President of the United States

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:51.180 align:middle line:84%
of America on the subject of
unidentified aerial craft,

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:52.860 align:middle line:90%
close quote.

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:57.210 align:middle line:84%
The paper also referenced
unidentified aerial vehicles

00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:01.530 align:middle line:84%
and in some places,
unidentified aerial craft.

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:03.990 align:middle line:84%
The alleged presidential
briefing paper

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:07.680 align:middle line:84%
was about government
monitoring of an alien presence

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.690 align:middle line:90%
from at least World War II.

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And it included this
sentence, quote,

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:16.140 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial biological
entities manipulated

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:20.670 align:middle line:84%
DNA in already evolving
primates to create Homo sapien,

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:22.440 align:middle line:90%
close quote.

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.870 align:middle line:84%
According to current
Earth science,

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:27.000 align:middle line:84%
those involving
standing up primates

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.470 align:middle line:84%
began with the Australopithecus
Lucy, on the left,

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:33.570 align:middle line:90%
about 3 million years ago.

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:36.870 align:middle line:84%
The changed over time through
various primate models

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:39.660 align:middle line:84%
to Cro-Magnon Homo
sapien sapien,

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:44.100 align:middle line:84%
which is us modern
humans, on the right.

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:48.420 align:middle line:84%
We emerged about 35,000
to 40,000 years ago

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:51.000 align:middle line:90%
when Neanderthals went extinct.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.790 align:middle line:84%
On the right is a
Cro-Magnon Homo sapien

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:58.980 align:middle line:84%
sapien skull compared to Homo
neanderthalensis on the left.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.650 align:middle line:84%
In my long career
of investigations

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:05.100 align:middle line:84%
trying to learn the truth about
other intelligences interacting

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:08.650 align:middle line:84%
with Earth, I have been
told that, at least,

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:13.240 align:middle line:84%
the Eben civilization is a
telepathic and very advanced

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.850 align:middle line:84%
cosmic population
that is connected

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:20.650 align:middle line:84%
in a hive mind, the opposite
of humans that are like islands

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:21.850 align:middle line:90%
from each other.

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:24.010 align:middle line:84%
If the Ebens are
the most friendly

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:26.740 align:middle line:84%
to our human
government, then why

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:31.000 align:middle line:84%
do they allow harvesting of
sperm and egg, genetic material

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.810 align:middle line:84%
from Earth in order to
produce cloned biological body

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:36.550 align:middle line:90%
containers?

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:41.890 align:middle line:84%
Or are the Ebens the harvesters
themselves in this laboratory

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:43.630 align:middle line:90%
called Earth?

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Whichever alien type or types is
creating cloned or hybrid life

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:54.520 align:middle line:84%
forms from human genes,
what is the purpose?

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.570 align:middle line:84%
