00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.910 align:middle line:10%
>> In December of 2021, the US
Congress approved a permanent

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.190 align:middle line:10%
Pentagon office to study
UFO UAPs and their profound

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.470 align:middle line:10%
implications for humanity and
with me to discuss other life

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.820 align:middle line:10%
in this universe, why are
they here and what do we know,

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.490 align:middle line:10%
is Tim, a tactical advisor to
covert German analysts trying

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.810 align:middle line:10%
to understand the missions
and strategies of non-human

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.090 align:middle line:10%
intelligences on our planet, in
the solar system, and beyond.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And Tim, welcome to the special
edition of "Truth Hunter."

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Linda.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And what I would like to
have you help me understand

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.920 align:middle line:84%
so the audience can understand,
when you say tactical advisor

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.310 align:middle line:84%
in the covert
governance in Germany,

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.230 align:middle line:90%
what exactly does that mean?

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So a tactical
advisor is someone

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.480 align:middle line:84%
who's in the conventional field
and in the extra political

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.880 align:middle line:84%
field working on
certain situations.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.190 align:middle line:84%
So you can be given a mission
or a situation, a task,

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.340 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, where some
group on the planet

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.740 align:middle line:84%
and outside of the
planet, whoever,

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.890 align:middle line:84%
wants to have a
certain paper on it,

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.350 align:middle line:84%
a certain advice on
it, a certain analysis.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is true for
the conventional field,

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:51.770 align:middle line:84%
as well as for special missions
containing exotic content.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>> You might be one of the
perfect people to talk about

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.640 align:middle line:84%
something that happened to
me going back 39 years ago,

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.270 align:middle line:90%
to April of 1983.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And I had signed a contract
with Home Box Office

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.350 align:middle line:84%
to do an hour documentary
called, "UFOs, the ET Factor,"

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.780 align:middle line:84%
at a time where there was even
less information to anyone

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.410 align:middle line:84%
in the world about ETs as
being other civilizations.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And a meeting was set up for
me at Kirtland Air Force Base,

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.150 align:middle line:84%
and it was at the
Air Force Office

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.580 align:middle line:90%
of Special Investigations.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And I was presented by an AFOSI
analyst there a briefing paper.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And what the cover said
was, briefing paper

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.610 align:middle line:84%
for the President
of the United States

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.680 align:middle line:84%
of America on the subject of
unidentified aerial craft,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.150 align:middle line:90%
UACs.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And in the briefing,
it also used UAVs.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And it was a history of
the United States retrieval

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.270 align:middle line:90%
of crashed discs bodies.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And it came to a paragraph
that I have never forgotten.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And it said, "these
extraterrestrial biological

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.680 align:middle line:84%
entities manipulated DNA in
already evolving primates

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.590 align:middle line:90%
to create Homo sapiens."

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And the Latin was
used in the paper.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And at another
paragraph it said,

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.570 align:middle line:84%
"all questions and mysteries
about the evolution of Homo

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Sapiens on this planet
have been answered,

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.610 align:middle line:84%
and this project is
closed," quote, unquote.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And over 39 years, it
has been haunting to me,

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.940 align:middle line:84%
trying to get to the truth
and the facts behind those two

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.270 align:middle line:84%
sentences in a paper in a
United States Air Force base

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.860 align:middle line:90%
where it was presented.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>> The current information is
that at least 15 species have

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.590 align:middle line:84%
placed sample groups on
different spots on this planet.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So probably even
more, which means

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.620 align:middle line:84%
there are three or four
hands full of species,

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.520 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial
species, that certainly

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.740 align:middle line:84%
had an interest in order
to develop a human species.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:37.200 align:middle line:84%
Which is the reason why there
is such a obvious multitude

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.050 align:middle line:84%
of different styles of
human beings on this planet.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.880 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Because there's been
many more than one genetic

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.420 align:middle line:90%
manipulation?

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what he said
as well, the DIA retiree.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.310 align:middle line:84%
He said they all are
manipulating DNA.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, so we're talking about
a time that is pre 15,000 years

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.030 align:middle line:90%
of now.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.830 align:middle line:90%
So it's way back.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.330 align:middle line:84%
So the current information
is that at least 15, maybe

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:12.750 align:middle line:84%
even more, species have
done major placement

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.350 align:middle line:84%
of sample groups, of genetic
sample groups, on this planet.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.960 align:middle line:90%
On different spots on Earth.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.630 align:middle line:84%
For example, for the Germans,
what developed as Germans

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.060 align:middle line:84%
or what we would define
as Germans, way back,

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.610 align:middle line:90%
they originated in India.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.250 align:middle line:84%
So that was one of
the sample groups

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.900 align:middle line:90%
that had been placed there.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.270 align:middle line:84%
But all these species,
just like any other group

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.640 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, any
other consciousness

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.070 align:middle line:84%
unit in the universe, they all
have their own perspectives

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.870 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.480 align:middle line:90%
They all have their own agendas.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.840 align:middle line:84%
Some of which are
very benevolent.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are hesitant about
the development of humanity

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.030 align:middle line:90%
as a species.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Because humanity is
designed-- parts of humanity,

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.130 align:middle line:90%
not all strains--

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.330 align:middle line:84%
but some of them are
designed as warrior species.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>> You mean extraterrestrials
would manipulate DNA

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:24.880 align:middle line:84%
in an already existing human
species in order to refine it,

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.240 align:middle line:84%
or define it, into being
specifically a warrior?

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>> From the perspective of
ET life and this history,

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.840 align:middle line:84%
not including different other
aspects of the universe,

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.600 align:middle line:84%
which might have a different
perspective on that,

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.590 align:middle line:90%
you are right.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:48.960 align:middle line:84%
There are different species that
had an interest in developing

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.190 align:middle line:90%
an ape race into a human race.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Because basically,
a human is an ape--

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.420 align:middle line:84%
humans are ape races, which is
the reason why certain behavior

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.830 align:middle line:84%
patterns that they show comes
from that evolutionary line

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:05.760 align:middle line:90%
of being apes.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:12.770 align:middle line:84%
>> But would that manipulation
to create very specific human

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:17.690 align:middle line:84%
types, whether it's for
war or for something else,

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:24.380 align:middle line:84%
doesn't that imply that we are
essentially like humanoid AI

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:29.390 align:middle line:84%
created by advanced
civilizations to provide them

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.910 align:middle line:90%
some kind of service?

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:39.870 align:middle line:84%
That they aren't interested in
us evolving as a free creation?

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So a low number of species
might have had that thought,

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:48.120 align:middle line:84%
yes, but some other
species don't.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.790 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you have
a garden at home and you

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.680 align:middle line:90%
are planting a seed.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And you look at the
beauty of the plant that

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.480 align:middle line:84%
is evolving from that seed,
and you take care of it.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.210 align:middle line:90%
There's a certain joy to it.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And some species, and a lot
of species, enjoy doing that.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.670 align:middle line:84%
So not all of these
manipulative species

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.880 align:middle line:90%
have had bad intentions.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Some, however, a very
low number of them,

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:23.310 align:middle line:84%
had an interest in bringing
the evolutionary potential

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:25.770 align:middle line:84%
of the species, which
is in general, very

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:27.780 align:middle line:90%
high on this planet.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.180 align:middle line:84%
We might talk about that
later because it's important,

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.539 align:middle line:84%
but they might have had an
interest in bringing that

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:35.470 align:middle line:90%
down as much as possible.

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.350 align:middle line:84%
So if you're talking
about bad and good,

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.030 align:middle line:84%
at this stage of
the universe, we

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:43.080 align:middle line:90%
have 95 to 5 ratio good and bad.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:48.930 align:middle line:84%
Which means 95% of all
level three consciousness

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.990 align:middle line:84%
beings out there
in the universe are

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:57.570 align:middle line:84%
basically good and benevolent,
neutral, socially acceptable,

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:01.620 align:middle line:84%
a lot of them don't even
the possibility of war

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.590 align:middle line:84%
because it totally
makes no sense to them.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Because they see each other as
a species that evolves together,

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.650 align:middle line:84%
needs to do cooperative
work, et cetera.

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:16.320 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make sense
to be self-destructive.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:22.590 align:middle line:84%
But the human race is
indeed one of those races

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.310 align:middle line:84%
who carry the potential
of being warrior like.

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I understand that you have
been face to face with what are

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.120 align:middle line:90%
called the Grey types.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think that you
said that you have

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.640 align:middle line:90%
been with them maybe 100 times.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.270 align:middle line:84%
We still, as a planet, have
been denied even the truth

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.190 align:middle line:84%
that this is real
and they exist.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So maybe I'll use that in
order to bring understanding

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:53.040 align:middle line:84%
to some of the motivations
for genetic modification.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Because indeed,
the Greys are one

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.020 align:middle line:84%
of those species who have
done genetic modification

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.860 align:middle line:90%
on human beings.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:09.810 align:middle line:84%
They have a very unique
agenda and a desire, a stock,

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:12.510 align:middle line:90%
so to speak, in the human race.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Other species have
other agendas.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:19.020 align:middle line:84%
It might as well be the joy
of developing something,

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.690 align:middle line:84%
it might well be
something in order

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:24.270 align:middle line:84%
to bring forward
their own interest.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:27.390 align:middle line:84%
The Greys, from
their point of view,

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:32.340 align:middle line:84%
they have gone
through a development

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.220 align:middle line:84%
of their own species
where they got rid,

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:41.220 align:middle line:84%
for example, of their own
natural biological bodies.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Which means from
their perspective,

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.210 align:middle line:90%
had been a logical step.

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't have a
biological body that can die

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:57.340 align:middle line:84%
or all these disadvantages
that might come with that,

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:00.390 align:middle line:84%
that it brings advantage
to their species

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.100 align:middle line:90%
if they get rid of that body.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:06.510 align:middle line:84%
But that is not quite how
the universe want things

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.640 align:middle line:90%
to be proceeding naturally.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>> But that is a
heavy duty sentence.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:16.510 align:middle line:84%
That a species could decide
to get rid of their bodies.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.240 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically, we have a
triad of three things.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:29.640 align:middle line:84%
So at first, there is a
body, an object or whatever.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.510 align:middle line:90%
A form, so to speak.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Then, we have an awareness,
which is consciousness.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And the third in this triad,
in this very triad model,

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.880 align:middle line:84%
is a soul container, which
contains all the experiences

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.950 align:middle line:84%
that every one of us
has made over some time.

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:55.260 align:middle line:84%
The universe itself would like
to see that we evolve naturally

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.060 align:middle line:90%
with all these three aspects.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you know what
the universe wants?

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it brings
certain problems,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.340 align:middle line:84%
the evolution that
the Greys have done.

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, getting rid of
their biological body

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:14.050 align:middle line:84%
has brought certain, you could
call it spiritual disadvantages

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:14.850 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're getting rid
of that, for example, getting

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:24.930 align:middle line:84%
rid of pairing, which means
it's a natural connection

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:26.530 align:middle line:90%
to the other.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Which means you might
get rid of emotions--

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:34.410 align:middle line:84%
>> You're talking about body
container containing a soul,

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.530 align:middle line:84%
and that the soul has
some quantum relationship

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:41.700 align:middle line:84%
to the universe in terms of
everything that the container

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:46.930 align:middle line:84%
has experienced goes into the
soul that tracks and keeps

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:47.730 align:middle line:90%
the information.

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:49.020 align:middle line:90%
>> 100%.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>> And that suddenly, there is
a civilization, ancient Greys,

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:59.730 align:middle line:84%
that decide that they don't want
to deal with the organic phase.

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:05.720 align:middle line:84%
How does the organic body of
the Grey look at each other

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.310 align:middle line:84%
and say, we're going
to get rid of this?

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:12.720 align:middle line:90%
And the soul does what?

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:16.530 align:middle line:84%
This is a very, very
difficult concept.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.540 align:middle line:90%
And I've run into it before.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And you may be one of
the few people who might

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.110 align:middle line:90%
be able to help us understand.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>> What does that mean,
discarding the organic body

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.080 align:middle line:84%
and then continuing
to evolve, how?

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So the fundamental thought
of getting rid of a biological

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:43.080 align:middle line:84%
body means that you might
see some disadvantages

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:48.480 align:middle line:84%
in the biological body and
some advantages for a more

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.500 align:middle line:90%
artificial body.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the Greys
thought and saw themselves.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:14:00.300 align:middle line:84%
They saw that a biological
body has certain disadvantages,

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.360 align:middle line:84%
and it would be
more sophisticated,

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.050 align:middle line:84%
easily to continue with
the artificial body.

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:10.530 align:middle line:84%
So what they did,
and this is something

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.360 align:middle line:90%
the Greys especially have.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.720 align:middle line:84%
It's their-- I don't want
to say their signature--

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:23.490 align:middle line:84%
but what they do and what they
specialized on is extracting

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.860 align:middle line:84%
the soul, which means
the soul container,

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.520 align:middle line:90%
which is a geometric--

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:30.750 align:middle line:90%
geometry, excuse me.

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:35.280 align:middle line:84%
It's geometry code, which
can be extracted from a body

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.700 align:middle line:84%
and being placed into something
else because it's information.

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>> You're talking about a
mathematical relationship

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:46.920 align:middle line:84%
between what the soul
takes in as information

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.300 align:middle line:84%
and the universe, that there is
a kind of mathematical language

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.800 align:middle line:90%
in this entire cosmos.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>> In terms of information,
it's information.

00:14:55.060 --> 00:15:01.300 align:middle line:84%
So the basic understanding of a
soul container is information.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.430 align:middle line:84%
It's just information that
can be extracted from one body

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:07.140 align:middle line:90%
and being replaced.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:10.540 align:middle line:84%
So the Greys have for
their own evolution,

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:15.270 align:middle line:84%
they have set some kind of
network all over the universe.

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Which is some-- you could
compare it to the internet,

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.160 align:middle line:84%
for example, where
you can upload

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.300 align:middle line:84%
the information that
your soul vessel contains

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:32.850 align:middle line:84%
and bring it into their system,
and then reverse and bring it

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.760 align:middle line:90%
into a different, other body.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And through that
procedure, you get

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:45.940 align:middle line:84%
rid of the loss of information,
that natural biological death

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:46.740 align:middle line:90%
brings.

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.200 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a constantly
evolving species.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And they have, through
their manipulation

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:55.960 align:middle line:84%
of their own genetics, it
means that it can evolve very,

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.290 align:middle line:84%
very quickly compared
to a natural evolution

00:15:58.290 --> 00:15:59.580 align:middle line:90%
of a biological being.

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's why there's
government people I've talked

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:08.520 align:middle line:84%
to say that there is one
progenitor Grey race, very old.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:12.930 align:middle line:84%
7, 8 feet tall, very
thin, large heads.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And the government people
who have talked to me

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:18.780 align:middle line:84%
say they're the only ones
that are really truly organic

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.980 align:middle line:90%
or can choose.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Are all of the other Greys,
whether the chins come

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:30.610 align:middle line:84%
to a point or like a pair,
or large heads, or high,

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:34.870 align:middle line:84%
are all of those
artificial intelligence?

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>> No, we're not even
talking about one species.

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:42.160 align:middle line:84%
So there's a huge number of
beings outside in the universe

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.850 align:middle line:84%
that have grey skin, but
that doesn't mean they're all

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:46.790 align:middle line:90%
the same.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:51.370 align:middle line:84%
So what we are talking
about are Grey beings

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:53.530 align:middle line:90%
that are about this high.

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And they-- I wouldn't say they
are artificial because that

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.200 align:middle line:84%
would mean that their
consciousness is AI as well,

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.860 align:middle line:90%
but that isn't the case.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.290 align:middle line:84%
They have a biological
consciousness,

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:08.920 align:middle line:84%
but they use artificially
created bodies

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:12.460 align:middle line:84%
that are contained--
that contain fibers.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:18.940 align:middle line:84%
So they have special material,
special fibers that they 3D

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.990 align:middle line:84%
print, so to speak, in order
to create a vessel that

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:28.119 align:middle line:84%
has all the features they need
to accomplish certain missions

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:28.960 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I would love for you to take
us through the first time that

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:39.130 align:middle line:84%
you were with one of the Greys,
but what was the environment?

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.940 align:middle line:84%
I would like to know what
it would feel like to be

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.950 align:middle line:90%
with one of these beings.

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so the first contact
ever was I was fairly young.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.860 align:middle line:84%
Because I already had
certain cases which

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:59.400 align:middle line:84%
I was working on that
involved the fact

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:04.570 align:middle line:84%
that life outside of
this planet exists.

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:11.260 align:middle line:84%
I was prepared and asked
if I wanted to participate

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.210 align:middle line:90%
in a direct contact.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And were you briefed and
shown photographs, videotapes,

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.810 align:middle line:90%
something to prepare you?

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I was thrown
into the cold water,

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:26.980 align:middle line:84%
which means I basically had only
few sentences of what's going

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.070 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Which is basically something I
wouldn't recommend because it's

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:37.960 align:middle line:84%
a huge factor for your own
perception of reality meeting

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:42.070 align:middle line:84%
a different being,
especially the Greys.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:46.670 align:middle line:84%
So if you are asking me what it
feels like to meet with them,

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:51.070 align:middle line:84%
it's certainly not the way it is
when we two, for example, meet

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:51.920 align:middle line:90%
right here.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:55.180 align:middle line:84%
So it feels common or
usual, or whatever,

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:57.070 align:middle line:90%
or friendly or something.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:19:01.450 align:middle line:84%
The situation was
that in this facility,

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:07.240 align:middle line:84%
there are silverish,
greyish, metallic boxes all

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:11.770 align:middle line:84%
over the place where you
have these kind of meetings.

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you go into the
container first by yourself?

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And then does the Grey come,
or was the Grey in there?

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:21.320 align:middle line:90%
How did this occur?

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So the first time ever was
I go inside of the container

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.110 align:middle line:90%
on one side, left door.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:30.100 align:middle line:90%
I enter it.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.770 align:middle line:84%
There's the desk,
I just sit down.

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:41.050 align:middle line:84%
The container is-- the lights,
it's fuzzy, diffused light.

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:44.050 align:middle line:84%
So I was always
wondering why that is.

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And I assume, but I don't
know, it's for your own brain

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:53.800 align:middle line:84%
to not be capturing
too many information

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:54.940 align:middle line:90%
that it's not used to.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Because brains like
information they know.

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.300 align:middle line:84%
But coming to a
new situation might

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.530 align:middle line:90%
confuse the brain in some ways.

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:04.330 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that.

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:06.430 align:middle line:84%
It's just an assumption
that I made over the years

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:12.190 align:middle line:84%
because it's always in a
not fully bright light,

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:15.400 align:middle line:90%
but it's a diffused light.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.240 align:middle line:90%
Just the way--

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Like this?

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, it might also because
somebody has said that to me

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:26.710 align:middle line:84%
that there are some species that
are very allergic and sensitive

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:27.520 align:middle line:90%
to light.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Which I don't think the
Greys are because they

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:32.380 align:middle line:90%
have artificial pupils.

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:36.880 align:middle line:84%
This almond formed,
greyish dark eyes.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>> It's technology.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Technology, you
could say that.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And they're seeing,
probably, an infrared

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:45.250 align:middle line:84%
and a bunch of frequencies
that we don't see.

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so the spectrum of
information that they can

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:59.320 align:middle line:84%
perceive and use is way
bigger than any of the natural

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.350 align:middle line:84%
occurring features
of a human eye,

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:04.520 align:middle line:90%
or any other eye on this planet.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And so you're
sitting at the desk?

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:07.255 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sitting at the desk.

00:21:07.255 --> 00:21:08.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm just waiting.

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:16.540 align:middle line:84%
There's a second opening at
the back part of the container.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:23.770 align:middle line:84%
I assume that this Grey
being came from that.

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:25.960 align:middle line:84%
It might as well
have been inside

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.980 align:middle line:84%
of the container, which was the
case in several other meetings,

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:32.770 align:middle line:84%
that the Grey is already
inside of the container.

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:39.190 align:middle line:10%
The very moment you feel the
presence of this Grey being,

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:42.490 align:middle line:10%
it's different
than anything else

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:46.850 align:middle line:10%
that you have ever
experienced on this planet.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:47.650 align:middle line:10%
>> How?

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:51.820 align:middle line:10%
>> They irradiate a
certain frequency.

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.380 align:middle line:10%
Every one of us does.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:57.040 align:middle line:10%
But while we are
in an environment

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:02.140 align:middle line:10%
where this resonance or
this frequency is mild--

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.680 align:middle line:10%
you might be in a place where
someone with a strong presence

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.240 align:middle line:10%
comes in and you
feel that presence,

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.570 align:middle line:10%
but it's not overly shocking.

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And you can also feel
a friendly frequency,

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.050 align:middle line:90%
just as we do right now.

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:21.280 align:middle line:84%
But in the moment this
greyish, this Grey

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:28.210 align:middle line:84%
being enters the room, it's
a strong, crisp, frequency

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:31.510 align:middle line:84%
that your body reacts
to very heavily.

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And did it feel
like it was dangerous?

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:39.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it feels
like it's hardly--

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:42.770 align:middle line:84%
one is hardly able
to withstand--

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:43.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Sustain.

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>> --sustain that situation.

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>> So what happens?

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Nothing at all.

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:51.190 align:middle line:84%
Not in the first
meeting because it

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:55.940 align:middle line:84%
was meant to become
aware of the feelings.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.510 align:middle line:84%
A lot of meetings,
in the first place,

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.820 align:middle line:84%
were just to get used
to that intense feeling

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:05.500 align:middle line:84%
because it brings
you to a moment where

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.750 align:middle line:90%
it confuses your brain.

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Because the brain is still
checking, is this real,

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:16.480 align:middle line:84%
is this alive, can
it hurt me at all.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.600 align:middle line:90%
This is number one.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:22.660 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is this
unbelievable strong, irritating

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.520 align:middle line:90%
frequency in the room.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:31.510 align:middle line:84%
It's like the whole room is
vibing through that frequency.

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:36.980 align:middle line:84%
You feel like every
aspect of reality

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:44.100 align:middle line:84%
that you have is being brought
into confusion and chaos

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:44.900 align:middle line:90%
in a way.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:48.890 align:middle line:84%
>> What happened when you
actually got communication?

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's a kind of tablet
that contains two displays,

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:59.660 align:middle line:84%
one on the bottom
and one at the top,

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:05.420 align:middle line:84%
where you have different signs
and different languages that

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.220 align:middle line:90%
can be translated.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Like an iPad?

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:09.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Like an iPad.

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:14.180 align:middle line:84%
But I assume, but I don't know,
that this is technology that

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:16.850 align:middle line:90%
comes directly from the Greys.

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Because the Greys are capable of
understanding human languages.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Not to a degree
where I would say

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:27.440 align:middle line:84%
that they have a
perfect knowledge, which

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.260 align:middle line:90%
I find pretty funny at times.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:34.490 align:middle line:84%
Because it's just the way
someone learns a new language

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:36.560 align:middle line:84%
and they have
certain assumptions

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.640 align:middle line:84%
from their own
cultural background.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>> But going all the way back
to the whole issue of that

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:45.170 align:middle line:84%
briefing paper at
Kirtland Air Force Base,

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:50.360 align:middle line:84%
if the Greys are the ones who
manipulated DNA and already

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.420 align:middle line:84%
evolving primates to create
Homo sapiens sapiens,

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:57.540 align:middle line:84%
why wouldn't they know
everything about us,

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:01.280 align:middle line:84%
including they may have
even seeded languages?

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.370 align:middle line:84%
I've been told that
Sanskrit is truly

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:08.870 align:middle line:84%
an extraterrestrial
language on this planet.

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:10.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, it is.

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>> But back to--

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:12.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Back to--

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>> --where you are now with a
being and you get telepathic

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:17.250 align:middle line:90%
communication.

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:18.930 align:middle line:90%
So what was that like?

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So the interpretation of
information that comes through

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.390 align:middle line:84%
psionic waves, which
is a wavelength,

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:31.130 align:middle line:84%
is very heavily influenced
by the cultural background

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:34.020 align:middle line:84%
of the recipient
or the receiver.

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:38.400 align:middle line:84%
Which means someone who
receives a certain message over,

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:44.000 align:middle line:84%
especially with humanity being
ascending psionic race, which

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.920 align:middle line:90%
means they have not all--

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.560 align:middle line:84%
that they do have
their capabilities,

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:51.170 align:middle line:90%
but it's not very well trained.

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:53.600 align:middle line:10%
So the use of
psionic telepathy is

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:59.660 align:middle line:10%
something that increases the
amount of information that

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.070 align:middle line:10%
occurs inside of the room.

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:02.970 align:middle line:90%
So it's more stressful.

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:06.710 align:middle line:84%
So the first, beginning,
the most of those meetings

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:10.250 align:middle line:84%
were just being in the
room getting used to it,

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:13.430 align:middle line:84%
then it was over
technology, and then

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:15.780 align:middle line:90%
you have telepathic information.

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:17.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you have this
technology that

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:23.540 align:middle line:84%
has the Grey language on
top and the German language

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:27.520 align:middle line:84%
at the bottom, whatever
technology they use,

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:31.390 align:middle line:84%
they can access this
tablet and the writing

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:34.090 align:middle line:84%
appears at the top
of this display.

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And it gets
simultaneously translated

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:39.580 align:middle line:84%
into German, probably
into English as well,

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:40.900 align:middle line:90%
or any other language.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.350 align:middle line:90%
You name it.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:44.570 align:middle line:84%
But there are
moments where there

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:48.740 align:middle line:84%
are some very important
questions that

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:53.880 align:middle line:84%
want to be explored and
need to be explored.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.660 align:middle line:84%
For example, their
intentions, the agenda.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.120 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you want?

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.530 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you want?

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>> What answer did you get back?

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot.

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Like where a tablet,
a technology,

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:12.320 align:middle line:84%
and a translation through
language might not be enough.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Because there are some
aspects to their culture,

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.730 align:middle line:84%
which might not
apply to a human--

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:22.310 align:middle line:90%
to humanity and human culture.

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:23.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Give an example.

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:24.920 align:middle line:90%
What happened with you?

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.120 align:middle line:90%
What happened with you?

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:32.950 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so one of the most
important questions was,

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:34.300 align:middle line:90%
why are you here?

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:36.280 align:middle line:90%
Are you a friend?

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:37.750 align:middle line:90%
What's your agenda?

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And one of those things
was, what's your credo?

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:43.970 align:middle line:90%
What's your motto?

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:45.770 align:middle line:90%
What's, so a--

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you live by?

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:48.290 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you live by, right.

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:51.620 align:middle line:84%
So that is something that comes
from the understanding how

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.970 align:middle line:90%
humanity understand themselves.

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:55.910 align:middle line:84%
They like to name
things, like this

00:27:55.910 --> 00:28:01.730 align:middle line:84%
is, I don't know, it's a marker,
something, this is a pen.

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And not all species have
this tendency to name things.

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:12.030 align:middle line:84%
So that is something where a
gap in communication occurs.

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:15.140 align:middle line:84%
So asking the Greys,
what is your credo,

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:16.880 align:middle line:90%
what do you live by?

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:21.140 align:middle line:84%
You certainly have
three words appearing

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.900 align:middle line:90%
on the top of this display.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.400 align:middle line:90%
And they don't make sense.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.220 align:middle line:84%
That translation don't
make sense at all.

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.770 align:middle line:90%
>> What were those three words?

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>> They could be translated
as protect, serve, synthesize.

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you ever get an answer
to why the three words?

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>> I did.

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:52.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was super important
because the credo defines

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:57.690 align:middle line:84%
the ambitions and agenda
of a species, at least

00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:59.400 align:middle line:90%
from the standpoint of humans.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.800 align:middle line:90%
>> First word was protect.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:01.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Protect.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:02.703 align:middle line:90%
>> The second word, serve.

00:29:02.703 --> 00:29:03.503 align:middle line:90%
>> Serve.

00:29:03.503 --> 00:29:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>> And the third?

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Synthesize.

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Were they saying that
synthesize represents the fact

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:15.050 align:middle line:84%
that they manipulate
DNA all the time?

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:18.440 align:middle line:84%
That they are synthesizing
life everywhere?

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.970 align:middle line:90%
Is that synthesize?

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Synthesizing in a chemical
context means removing

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:29.840 align:middle line:84%
a substrate from their
environmental context and bring

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.610 align:middle line:90%
it into another one.

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:34.730 align:middle line:84%
That makes only sense
if you understand

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:36.410 align:middle line:90%
what the Greys are doing.

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And what they are doing,
what they later told me,

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:44.840 align:middle line:84%
they are preserving
the tonal dynamic

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:48.630 align:middle line:90%
of the evolution of people--

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:51.210 align:middle line:84%
species, humans,
whatever you name it.

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And what do you
think that means really?

00:29:53.790 --> 00:30:01.410 align:middle line:84%
>> The universe itself is a
living singular life form that

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:08.340 align:middle line:84%
needs experiences and different
viewpoints in order to have

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:13.530 align:middle line:84%
diversity, and in order to
perceive learning and upgrading

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:15.220 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:21.770 align:middle line:84%
What the Greys are doing
is protecting and guiding

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:29.060 align:middle line:84%
all these beings that are
on a path of self-learning,

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:32.420 align:middle line:90%
of evolution, and so on.

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Because they heavily
depend on the experiences

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:40.940 align:middle line:84%
of every other cell, so
to speak, in the universe.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:43.040 align:middle line:90%
They extract that knowledge.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:50.660 align:middle line:10%
What they are masters in
is to extract consciousness

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:56.120 align:middle line:10%
from the body itself
and finding solutions

00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:01.730 align:middle line:10%
how to bring that consciousness
into another context

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:05.960 align:middle line:10%
where the soul is learning
something new that it needs

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:09.590 align:middle line:10%
to acquire to be on its
tonal dynamic, which means

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:12.320 align:middle line:10%
to be on its evolutionary path.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you, Tim, for taking
me into a completely different

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:20.570 align:middle line:84%
relationship, I guess,
with our universe.

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:22.770 align:middle line:90%
I have truly enjoyed this.

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:24.050 align:middle line:90%
I am provoked.

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you so
much for being in this special

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:28.700 align:middle line:90%
"Truth Hunter."

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Linda.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:34.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Coming up on the
next "Truth Hunter."

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>> The human species is a
so-called ascending psionic

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:38.660 align:middle line:90%
species.

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>> But we're on a planet.

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:42.890 align:middle line:84%
We're just talking
about psionic.

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:46.620 align:middle line:84%
It's verboten, it's
not acceptable.

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:50.630 align:middle line:90%
We humans must grow up.

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>> The only thing you need to
do is focus as much mind power

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:59.830 align:middle line:84%
as possible onto the field,
and let it create itself.

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:03.000 align:middle line:90%
