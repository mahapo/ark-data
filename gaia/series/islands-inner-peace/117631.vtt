00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:45.045 align:middle line:84%
>>I invite you to get fully
connected to your body,

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:49.616 align:middle line:90%
to your soul, and to your mind.

00:00:55.656 --> 00:01:00.694 align:middle line:84%
You know, we move
around, so busy,

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:06.533 align:middle line:84%
that we spend more time outside
of ourselves than inside.

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:14.908 align:middle line:90%
So let's go in together.

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:23.317 align:middle line:84%
Visualize a serene
setting, whether it

00:01:23.317 --> 00:01:35.062 align:middle line:84%
be water, grass, flowers,
butterflies-- something bigger

00:01:35.062 --> 00:01:37.631 align:middle line:90%
and more amazing than us.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:48.041 align:middle line:84%
And I want to ask you
to engage your mind,

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:52.446 align:middle line:84%
surrendering to your greatness
and accepting your value.

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:01.922 align:middle line:84%
I want you to refrain
from allowing your mind

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:11.932 align:middle line:84%
to ask the why, the how,
the when, the where.

00:02:11.932 --> 00:02:15.602 align:middle line:84%
You don't need any of
those answers right now.

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:20.140 align:middle line:84%
You just need to know
that it's the perfect time

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.042 align:middle line:90%
to set your champion free.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:45.499 align:middle line:84%
Take a deep breath with me,
allowing all of other thoughts

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:46.400 align:middle line:90%
to melt away.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:06.186 align:middle line:90%
I am designed for greatness.

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:10.223 align:middle line:90%
My light is meant to shine.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:20.033 align:middle line:90%
And my job is to let it shine.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:36.817 align:middle line:84%
I am worthy of healthy,
whole, and complete love.

00:03:40.987 --> 00:03:47.494 align:middle line:84%
No one can design
my destiny but me.

00:03:54.501 --> 00:04:04.010 align:middle line:84%
I will get to my goals with
a "no matter what" mindset.

00:04:08.115 --> 00:04:14.421 align:middle line:84%
I move forward with
the understanding

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:21.293 align:middle line:84%
that quitters never win,
and winners never quit.

00:04:21.293 --> 00:04:25.699 align:middle line:84%
And I have been
designed as a winner.

00:04:36.308 --> 00:04:42.549 align:middle line:84%
You have everything
you need within you

00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:46.553 align:middle line:84%
to experience the life that
you want to experience.

00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:58.498 align:middle line:84%
Bliss, joy, peace of mind,
and crazy amazing love

00:04:58.498 --> 00:05:00.367 align:middle line:90%
are all yours.

00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:03.470 align:middle line:90%
It's all available to you.

00:05:10.377 --> 00:05:16.249 align:middle line:84%
This world would not be the
same if you weren't here.

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:24.724 align:middle line:84%
And your life belongs to you,
but it also belongs to us.

00:05:24.724 --> 00:05:30.530 align:middle line:90%
When you win, we win.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.967 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
a breakthrough,

00:05:33.967 --> 00:05:37.537 align:middle line:84%
we celebrate that
breakthrough with you.

00:05:37.537 --> 00:05:46.413 align:middle line:84%
As you continue to set your
champion free, I say thank you.

00:05:46.413 --> 00:05:49.182 align:middle line:90%
You prayed the prayer.

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:52.152 align:middle line:90%
You did the work.

00:05:52.152 --> 00:05:53.053 align:middle line:90%
You said yes.

00:05:55.755 --> 00:05:57.557 align:middle line:90%
Set your champion free.

00:06:11.972 --> 00:06:15.008 align:middle line:90%
