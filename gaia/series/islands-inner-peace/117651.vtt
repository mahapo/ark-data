00:00:56.123 --> 00:00:59.326 align:middle line:90%
>>Look forward to transition.

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:04.965 align:middle line:84%
It's the first time you will
experience unconditional love.

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.176 align:middle line:84%
It will be all peace and love
and though the nightmares

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:20.280 align:middle line:84%
and the turmoil you went
through in your life

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.515 align:middle line:90%
will be like nothing.

00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:35.762 align:middle line:84%
When you make your
transition, you

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:37.698 align:middle line:90%
are asked two things basically.

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:50.877 align:middle line:84%
How much love you have been
able to give and receive?

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:53.045 align:middle line:84%
And how much service
you have rendered.

00:02:04.758 --> 00:02:08.627 align:middle line:84%
And you will know
every consequence

00:02:08.627 --> 00:02:12.699 align:middle line:84%
of every deed, every
thought, and every word

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.134 align:middle line:90%
you have ever uttered.

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:24.578 align:middle line:84%
And that is,
symbolically speaking,

00:02:24.578 --> 00:02:28.849 align:middle line:84%
going through Hell when you
see how many chances you

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:29.583 align:middle line:90%
have missed.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.732 align:middle line:84%
But you will also see how
a nice act of kindness

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:50.237 align:middle line:84%
has touched hundreds of lives
that you're totally unaware of.

00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:07.254 align:middle line:84%
So concentrate on love
while you're still around,

00:03:07.254 --> 00:03:12.092 align:middle line:84%
and teach your children
early unconditional love.

00:03:21.802 --> 00:03:27.040 align:middle line:84%
So remember, concentrate
on love and look forward

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.175 align:middle line:90%
to the transition.

00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:40.787 align:middle line:84%
It's the most
beautiful experience

00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:41.755 align:middle line:90%
you can ever imagine.

00:04:07.214 --> 00:04:10.250 align:middle line:90%
