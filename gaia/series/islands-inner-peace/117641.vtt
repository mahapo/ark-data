Observe your breath
as it goes in and out.

You, my friend, are
not your thoughts.

00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:28.622 align:middle line:84%
You are the thinker
of the thoughts.

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:34.795 align:middle line:90%
The thoughts come from you.

00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:38.198 align:middle line:90%
So where are you?

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:44.705 align:middle line:84%
You are in the stillness, the
silence, between your thoughts.

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:54.047 align:middle line:84%
That stillness, that
silence, is you.

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:10.764 align:middle line:84%
And that you is the window
to the infinite mind.

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:26.413 align:middle line:84%
The mystery we call God
is whispering to you

00:02:26.413 --> 00:02:30.183 align:middle line:84%
in the silent space
between your thoughts.

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:48.502 align:middle line:84%
It is for this reason that the
great wisdom traditions say, be

00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:53.140 align:middle line:90%
still and know that I am God.

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:17.898 align:middle line:84%
Between every in breath
and every out breath

00:03:17.898 --> 00:03:18.665 align:middle line:90%
is the stillness.

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:34.281 align:middle line:84%
Between every thought
that arises and every

00:03:34.281 --> 00:03:41.954 align:middle line:84%
thought that subsides
is the stillness.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:59.239 align:middle line:84%
Watch the stillness between your
breath, between your thought.

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:02.542 align:middle line:90%
Just observe.

00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:12.552 align:middle line:84%
And then watch the
one who's watching.

00:04:12.552 --> 00:04:16.822 align:middle line:84%
As you listen to me
now, turn your attention

00:04:16.822 --> 00:04:17.923 align:middle line:90%
to the one who's listening.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.402 align:middle line:84%
You have found the secret
to that part of you

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:31.571 align:middle line:90%
that transcends space and time.

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:42.415 align:middle line:84%
You have found the secret
to that part of you that is

00:04:42.415 --> 00:04:57.631 align:middle line:84%
mortal, that part of you
that fire cannot burn,

00:04:57.631 --> 00:05:09.142 align:middle line:84%
water cannot wet, wind cannot
dry, weapons cannot shatter,

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:16.049 align:middle line:84%
that part of you
which is beyond fear,

00:05:16.049 --> 00:05:24.257 align:middle line:84%
that part of you that is without
beginning, without ending,

00:05:24.257 --> 00:05:29.196 align:middle line:84%
that part of you which
is the divine in you.

00:05:34.968 --> 00:05:41.908 align:middle line:84%
You have found the secret
to that part of you

00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:47.147 align:middle line:84%
that will continue to evolve
as the universe evolves.

00:05:55.822 --> 00:05:59.759 align:middle line:90%
Now relax into your body.

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:04.931 align:middle line:84%
And remember, anytime the
stresses and the worries

00:06:04.931 --> 00:06:13.240 align:middle line:84%
overwhelm you, come back into
the sacred space of your heart.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.609 align:middle line:90%
You are in the stillness.

00:06:15.609 --> 00:06:19.045 align:middle line:84%
You're in the silence
between your thoughts.

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:23.984 align:middle line:90%
Return to your stillness.

00:06:26.486 --> 00:06:31.258 align:middle line:84%
That stillness, that
silence, is you.

00:06:31.258 --> 00:06:34.894 align:middle line:90%
