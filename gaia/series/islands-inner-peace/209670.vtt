>> In times of the
greatest adversity,

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.790 align:middle line:84%
the greatest challenge,
the greatest fear,

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:51.012 align:middle line:84%
the greatest horror, it's
possible to find the greatest

00:00:51.012 --> 00:00:52.220 align:middle line:90%
human being you've ever been.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:59.990 align:middle line:90%


00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.930 align:middle line:84%
It comes when we call
for it, because it's

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:06.785 align:middle line:90%
part of who we are.

00:01:06.785 --> 00:01:10.180 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.949 align:middle line:84%
And when we're willing
to call for it,

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:18.830 align:middle line:84%
it matches the mountain
that's in front of us.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:19.630 align:middle line:90%
Every time.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.020 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.220 align:middle line:90%
In my life, I've known courage.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.110 align:middle line:90%
I've known it was there.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.625 align:middle line:90%
And I've known when it's gone.

00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:36.970 align:middle line:90%


00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.200 align:middle line:84%
It's gone when we
feel discouraged.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.880 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.210 align:middle line:84%
It's gone when we don't
know the way through,

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:53.670 align:middle line:84%
when we feel like retreating,
when sadness, or grief,

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:02.690 align:middle line:84%
or overwhelm, or fear seems
to loom larger than anything

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.295 align:middle line:90%
in the whole wide world.

00:02:04.295 --> 00:02:07.040 align:middle line:90%


00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:16.180 align:middle line:84%
But our heart can hold all of
that and still exhibit courage.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Because courage
comes from the heart.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Courage is the most bold
and powerful expression

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.210 align:middle line:90%
of the heart.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:35.950 align:middle line:90%


00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.570 align:middle line:84%
Courage is the
heart at its finest,

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.905 align:middle line:84%
leading us into realms of being
that we didn't know existed.

00:02:44.905 --> 00:02:48.220 align:middle line:90%


00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.550 align:middle line:84%
We all have it and
we all express it,

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:00.300 align:middle line:84%
because it's who we are and
it's who you are right now.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:07.975 align:middle line:84%
In the face of anything, just
call for it and it'll be there.

00:03:07.975 --> 00:03:17.720 align:middle line:90%


00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.710 align:middle line:90%
It happened to me.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.780 align:middle line:84%
I was in New York and
my son was deathly ill.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.010 align:middle line:90%
He was almost gone.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.320 align:middle line:90%
His breathing was labored.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.350 align:middle line:90%
His heartbeat was sketchy.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.180 align:middle line:90%


00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.070 align:middle line:84%
There were doctors around him,
but all of them were interns.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.320 align:middle line:90%
No one seemed to be in charge.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.330 align:middle line:84%
He was getting
weaker and weaker.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.040 align:middle line:90%
His liver collapsed.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.000 align:middle line:90%
And then his lungs.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And I looked in his eyes,
and he looked at me,

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.265 align:middle line:84%
asking me with those eyes to
stop what was happening to him.

00:04:02.265 --> 00:04:05.990 align:middle line:90%


00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.390 align:middle line:90%
The fear was still there.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.850 align:middle line:90%
My heart was pounding.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.100 align:middle line:90%
My hands were sweaty.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.490 align:middle line:90%
It was still chaotic.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.630 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know who to
talk to or what to say,

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.810 align:middle line:84%
but I felt a kind of power
that was beyond anything

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.220 align:middle line:90%
I've ever known.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:35.270 align:middle line:84%
The will of a mother to have
her son live became who I was.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.460 align:middle line:90%


00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.555 align:middle line:84%
The strength in my body was
like that of a super woman.

00:04:43.555 --> 00:04:50.510 align:middle line:90%


00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.230 align:middle line:84%
I felt a divine energy
flood through my fingers

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:55.340 align:middle line:90%
as I touched his hand.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.080 align:middle line:90%


00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And through my eyes,
as I looked into his,

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.295 align:middle line:90%
I put my head on his heart.

00:05:08.295 --> 00:05:11.420 align:middle line:90%


00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.560 align:middle line:90%
I could hear it.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.910 align:middle line:90%
It was still beating.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.040 align:middle line:90%


00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.065 align:middle line:84%
And I pulled for
that to recover.

00:05:19.065 --> 00:05:39.690 align:middle line:90%


00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.140 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the courage
I exhibited in the crisis

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:49.330 align:middle line:84%
with my son, I know he fought
with every cell of his body

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.130 align:middle line:84%
to make it across
the line to life.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.930 align:middle line:90%


00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.120 align:middle line:84%
I know there were medical people
who did miraculous things.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.550 align:middle line:84%
But I also know that the
courage that came from my heart

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.470 align:middle line:84%
had an intensity and a power
that I had never known before.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.190 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.770 align:middle line:84%
When I look back on that time,
I realize that courage is always

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.765 align:middle line:90%
there, waiting to be used.

00:06:22.765 --> 00:06:28.000 align:middle line:90%


00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.360 align:middle line:84%
When we're afraid, courage
embraces that fear.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.680 align:middle line:84%
It holds that fear
in a container that's

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:45.000 align:middle line:84%
greater and deeper
and more powerful,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.020 align:middle line:84%
because it puts
its arms around it

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.450 align:middle line:90%
and lifts it up as an offering.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:56.220 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:02.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that no
matter what happens to me

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.790 align:middle line:84%
and no matter what
happens to you,

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:10.290 align:middle line:84%
if you're willing to call
on your heart to bring you

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:14.280 align:middle line:84%
the courage that you
need to get through it,

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.730 align:middle line:90%
it will always be there.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.170 align:middle line:90%
But it's infinite.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.110 align:middle line:90%
It's eternal.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:26.650 align:middle line:90%
And its strength is unbounded.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is greater
than the courage

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:38.150 align:middle line:84%
to live life, the
courage to save life,

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.940 align:middle line:84%
the courage to
contribute to life,

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.950 align:middle line:84%

make a difference.

you find the courage

that you need no matter how
difficult, no matter how

Know that you can
never be crushed.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.590 align:middle line:90%
You can never be brutalized.

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:18.745 align:middle line:84%
Cruelty can never really touch
the heart of who you are.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:26.170 align:middle line:84%
You have the courage
to meet that adversity

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:29.640 align:middle line:90%
and pull yourself through.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:36.000 align:middle line:84%

filled with kindness, that's
filled with strength, that's

that is made of courage.
