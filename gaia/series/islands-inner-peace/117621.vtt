00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:46.580 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm going to ask you to listen
really carefully to something

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.849 align:middle line:90%
I have learned over many years.

00:00:53.654 --> 00:00:58.959 align:middle line:84%
You seem to focus on the
specific problem within you.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:04.698 align:middle line:84%
You seem to treat
it as a weakness.

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:16.476 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask you to release
these weaknesses that you

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:20.881 align:middle line:90%
seem to focus on periodically.

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:26.652 align:middle line:84%
They're not important
and they're not real.

00:01:26.652 --> 00:01:29.389 align:middle line:90%
They are false.

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:32.759 align:middle line:84%
They are the expression
of false concepts

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.729 align:middle line:84%
that have been
placed in your mind.

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And as you release them, you
can feel yourself replacing

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.344 align:middle line:84%
those perceived weaknesses
with a greater power

00:01:50.344 --> 00:01:54.948 align:middle line:84%
because you recognize
that they are false.

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:58.919 align:middle line:84%
This is a much
more aware universe

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:02.155 align:middle line:84%
and it calls for the
talent and ability

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:84%
that you've obviously
demonstrated in so many areas.

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:14.968 align:middle line:84%
And by releasing
these false concepts

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:20.707 align:middle line:84%
that damage the image that you
have yourself, you're healed.

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:29.850 align:middle line:84%
There are no scars because
they were all just illusions,

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:30.350 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:36.923 align:middle line:90%
And you've let them go.

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:38.025 align:middle line:90%
You don't give them power.

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:46.433 align:middle line:84%
You give all the power to the
talent and the consciousness

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:47.334 align:middle line:90%
that you possess.

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:58.111 align:middle line:84%
The image that is filling your
mind is one of genuine power,

00:02:58.111 --> 00:02:59.980 align:middle line:90%
of beauty and of love.

00:03:03.884 --> 00:03:09.256 align:middle line:84%
And the second you let
those false weaknesses go,

00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:10.257 align:middle line:90%
you felt illuminated.

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:17.130 align:middle line:84%
A beautiful power
filled every molecule

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.034 align:middle line:84%
of your consciousness
and this new power

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:26.139 align:middle line:84%
is reflected now in
everything you do.

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:31.778 align:middle line:84%
It's reflected in your smile, in
your handshake, in your caring

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:34.614 align:middle line:90%
and touching the others.

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:37.451 align:middle line:84%
You leave everyone with the
impression of greater good.

00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:44.691 align:middle line:84%
The next time you
see someone who

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:48.995 align:middle line:84%
seems to be paying
attention to what you know

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:55.769 align:middle line:84%
is a false concept,
share with them

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.775 align:middle line:84%
how you released the illusions
that had held you back,

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:03.210 align:middle line:84%
that had damaged
your self-esteem.

00:04:05.846 --> 00:04:10.083 align:middle line:84%
Let them know when you
released that there

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:14.221 align:middle line:84%
were no scars because
they were just illusions.

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:24.097 align:middle line:84%
And the beauty that is
expressed through you

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:26.600 align:middle line:84%
touches everyone and
everything you do.

00:04:30.804 --> 00:04:33.473 align:middle line:90%
Just see the beauty.

00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:34.608 align:middle line:90%
That's all there is.

00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:41.781 align:middle line:84%
Everything else is
just an illusion.

00:04:44.985 --> 00:04:46.987 align:middle line:90%

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:54.094 align:middle line:84%
I want to suggest
that you make up

00:04:54.094 --> 00:05:00.100 align:middle line:84%
your mind that every
minute of every day

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.738 align:middle line:84%
is wisely invested so that
you will continue to grow.

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:19.085 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is the greatest
power in all of creation

00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:24.291 align:middle line:84%
and your mind is ever seeking
greater expression, greater

00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:25.192 align:middle line:90%
expansion.

00:05:25.192 --> 00:05:26.593 align:middle line:90%

00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:36.436 align:middle line:84%
And know that everything you
own at the time of your passing

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:39.739 align:middle line:90%
will belong to someone else.

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:44.678 align:middle line:84%
But everything you
are is yours forever.

00:05:47.247 --> 00:05:49.082 align:middle line:84%
You're developing
a strong desire

00:05:49.082 --> 00:05:52.052 align:middle line:84%
to share that beautiful
truth with everyone

00:05:52.052 --> 00:05:54.321 align:middle line:90%
you come in contact with.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:04.497 align:middle line:84%
Make certain you never
sell yourself short.

00:06:04.497 --> 00:06:09.002 align:middle line:84%
If you have the slightest
desire to do something,

00:06:09.002 --> 00:06:12.405 align:middle line:84%
you've been blessed with the
power and the ability to do it.

00:06:15.008 --> 00:06:17.811 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a moment and
give thanks for that.

00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:25.185 align:middle line:90%
Mother Father God, thank you.

00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:33.026 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for this
beautiful awareness

00:06:33.026 --> 00:06:36.763 align:middle line:84%
and this awesome power
that we are blessed with.
