>> As I look across my body,
your planet, your home,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:12.300 align:middle line:84%
I hear your voices, the
cries for help, the grief,

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:24.290 align:middle line:84%
and the sadness of loss,
the confusion, the ignoring.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.455 align:middle line:84%
I see people who

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.810 align:middle line:84%

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.705 align:middle line:90%

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:10.270 align:middle line:84%
I see old people who've lived
all their life in nature,

wondering what went wrong.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:32.960 align:middle line:84%
I see people in power,
turning their hearts cold,

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.505 align:middle line:90%
so they don't have to see.

00:02:34.505 --> 00:02:40.760 align:middle line:90%


00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:58.870 align:middle line:84%

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.610 align:middle line:84%
I see the constraints
you've placed

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:21.020 align:middle line:84%
around yourselves, the
compromises, the challenges.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:28.050 align:middle line:90%


00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And I see the
beautiful expressions

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:44.950 align:middle line:84%
of love, the people who create
small paradises in the hidden

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.590 align:middle line:90%
corners of my body.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.800 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.720 align:middle line:90%
I see it all.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.225 align:middle line:84%
And I know you,
every one of you.

00:04:02.225 --> 00:04:12.460 align:middle line:90%


00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.905 align:middle line:84%
And I want to share
a message with you.

00:04:14.905 --> 00:04:19.320 align:middle line:90%


00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Whoever you are, wherever you
are, whatever your viewpoint,

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:50.330 align:middle line:84%
you stand in this moment of
time before a great opportunity.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:56.120 align:middle line:90%


00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:05.225 align:middle line:84%
Every one of you knows in your
heart the language of love.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Every one of you knows in your
heart the language of beauty.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:47.180 align:middle line:10%
So I call you to
touch into that love

00:05:47.180 --> 00:06:00.080 align:middle line:10%
that you know, you
know it so well,

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:14.100 align:middle line:10%
and to take it as your role,
your work, your contribution

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.725 align:middle line:10%
to add to my beauty.

00:06:17.725 --> 00:06:22.950 align:middle line:90%


00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:28.350 align:middle line:84%
Because you are an
expression of me.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:39.750 align:middle line:90%


00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:47.670 align:middle line:10%
So whether it be in your
houses and your gardens,

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:58.410 align:middle line:10%
a little patch of land,
or your big company,

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:06.660 align:middle line:10%
you are charged with
the responsibility

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:16.680 align:middle line:10%
to create beauty from a
place of love in your heart.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:28.800 align:middle line:90%


00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.080 align:middle line:90%
So this it's simple.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.590 align:middle line:90%


00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:36.000 align:middle line:90%
It's step by step.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.120 align:middle line:90%


00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.145 align:middle line:90%
It's every day.

00:07:42.145 --> 00:07:47.420 align:middle line:90%


00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.560 align:middle line:90%
It's every moment.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:58.880 align:middle line:90%


00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.915 align:middle line:90%
Look around you.

00:07:59.915 --> 00:08:05.310 align:middle line:90%


00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:06.855 align:middle line:90%
Are you seeing beauty?

00:08:06.855 --> 00:08:10.470 align:middle line:90%


00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
you can clean up?

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:17.840 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.130 align:middle line:90%
Something you can grow?

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:22.530 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Is there something you
can give to someone else?

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:32.500 align:middle line:90%


00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.250 align:middle line:84%
Is there a little
moment of sharing?

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.559 align:middle line:90%
A tiny touch?

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:42.390 align:middle line:90%
An instant of beauty?

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:45.300 align:middle line:90%


00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.180 align:middle line:90%
That's all it takes.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.460 align:middle line:90%


00:08:49.460 --> 00:09:00.436 align:middle line:84%
One moment and another
and another and another.

00:09:00.436 --> 00:09:02.490 align:middle line:90%
You know how to do this.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.140 align:middle line:90%


00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:08.230 align:middle line:90%
You know so well.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:24.520 align:middle line:90%


00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.100 align:middle line:90%
Every single one of you.
