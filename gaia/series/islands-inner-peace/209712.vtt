>> Sometimes it feels as if
my soul is tightly rolled up.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.585 align:middle line:84%
Like a bud that hasn't
even started to open.

00:00:58.585 --> 00:01:03.610 align:middle line:90%


00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.799 align:middle line:90%
Its voice is hidden away.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.300 align:middle line:84%
I can't give it any
space to breathe.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.070 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm living in a world
of my own thoughts.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.055 align:middle line:84%
I have no capacity to listen
to the voice of my soul.

00:01:34.055 --> 00:01:37.120 align:middle line:90%


00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm too busy.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm too frenetic.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.120 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm too occupied.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.950 align:middle line:90%


00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:59.050 align:middle line:10%
And yet, within me,
often hidden deeply

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:05.810 align:middle line:10%
is always the
longing for my soul

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:28.440 align:middle line:10%
to unfold, to open, to
breathe, to have space, to be.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:41.100 align:middle line:90%


00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm imagining,
but you might be

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:53.750 align:middle line:84%
rather like me, and
that your soul also

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.100 align:middle line:90%
has that longing to unfold.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:09.010 align:middle line:90%


00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.300 align:middle line:90%
Like a flower opening.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:18.780 align:middle line:90%


00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Can you feel that
expression of yourself

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:30.270 align:middle line:84%
that you've been missing,
that sweetness that

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:42.470 align:middle line:84%
is so hidden inside you, that
wild beauty of your essence,

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:51.820 align:middle line:84%
your inner nature, your
truth, your innocence?

00:03:51.820 --> 00:04:07.630 align:middle line:90%


00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.090 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps, we can
help each other.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:19.469 align:middle line:84%
Together, we can allow
our souls to unfold.

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:29.390 align:middle line:90%


00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.220 align:middle line:90%
So let's create space.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.390 align:middle line:90%


00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:36.230 align:middle line:90%
Let's listen.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.080 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.565 align:middle line:90%
Let's quieten down.

00:04:42.565 --> 00:04:48.890 align:middle line:90%


00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.255 align:middle line:84%
Let's leave the busyness for
others for the time being.

00:04:53.255 --> 00:04:58.950 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:59.750 align:middle line:90%
Let's settle.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.080 align:middle line:90%


00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.370 align:middle line:90%
Let's tune in.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:22.350 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:34.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's find the spark, that
glimmer of the small voice

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.015 align:middle line:90%
of your soul, and my soul.

00:05:38.015 --> 00:05:52.030 align:middle line:90%


00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.650 align:middle line:90%
It's so longs to sing.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.250 align:middle line:90%


00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.810 align:middle line:90%
It's so longs to shine.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:05.270 align:middle line:90%


00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.055 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:06:08.055 --> 00:06:08.855 align:middle line:90%
Let it out.

00:06:08.855 --> 00:06:12.810 align:middle line:90%


00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.110 align:middle line:90%
Let it into the world.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.620 align:middle line:90%


00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not for
keeping hidden away.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.330 align:middle line:90%


00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:32.035 align:middle line:84%
It's like the smile that
lives within you all the time.

00:06:32.035 --> 00:06:38.600 align:middle line:90%


00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:45.700 align:middle line:84%
It's the joy that ripples
up, spreading through you.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.230 align:middle line:90%


00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.770 align:middle line:90%
So simple.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:51.655 align:middle line:90%
So natural.

00:06:51.655 --> 00:06:58.480 align:middle line:90%


00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:20.010 align:middle line:84%
It's the freedom, the
freedom to be who you are,

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:24.960 align:middle line:84%
in exactly the way that
feels right for you.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.784 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.784 --> 00:07:31.425 align:middle line:90%
Can you feel it?

00:07:31.425 --> 00:07:36.250 align:middle line:90%


00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Can you feel how your soul is
unfolding, breathing, opening,

00:07:55.220 --> 00:08:02.165 align:middle line:84%
looking around in this beautiful
space where it came to play?

00:08:02.165 --> 00:08:09.010 align:middle line:90%


00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Oh, there's so much to
do, to be, to experience.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:31.970 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:33.680 align:middle line:90%
There's no time to wait now.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:39.750 align:middle line:90%


00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.910 align:middle line:90%
Our souls are ready.
