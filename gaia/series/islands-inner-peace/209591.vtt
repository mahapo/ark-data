>> MARIANNE WILLIAMSON: What
holds us back in our lives is

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:13.105 align:middle line:90%
our fear.

And sometimes, when you
take a very close look,

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.380 align:middle line:84%
you find out that your
fears aren't exactly

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.730 align:middle line:90%
what you thought they were.

Our deepest fear is not
that we are inadequate.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.575 align:middle line:84%
Our deepest fear is that we
are powerful beyond measure.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.520 align:middle line:90%
It's our light.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.470 align:middle line:84%
Not our darkness that
most frightens us.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:17.900 align:middle line:84%
We ask ourselves, who am I to be

fabulous?

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.790 align:middle line:84%
But actually, who
are you not to be?

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.055 align:middle line:90%
You are a child of God.

Your playing small
doesn't serve the world.

There's nothing
enlightened about shrinking

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.460 align:middle line:84%
so that other people won't
feel insecure around you.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.660 align:middle line:84%
We are all meant to
shine as children do.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.740 align:middle line:84%
We were born to make manifest
the glory of God that

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.595 align:middle line:90%
is within us.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.110 align:middle line:90%
It's not just in some of us.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.430 align:middle line:90%
It's in all of us.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.290 align:middle line:90%


00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And as we let our
own light shine,

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.220 align:middle line:84%
we subconsciously
give other people

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.690 align:middle line:90%
permission to do the same.

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.110 align:middle line:84%
As we are liberated
from our own fear,

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.605 align:middle line:84%
our presence automatically
liberates others.

So it's holy work to
move past your own fear.

Dear God, I face
that which scares me.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.165 align:middle line:84%

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I place this situation
and all related circumstances

As I place it in
your hands, I ask

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:39.380 align:middle line:84%
that my thoughts be transformed
from fear to confidence,

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:49.020 align:middle line:84%
from fear to courage,
from fear to faith.

Dear God, remind my mind
that you have already

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:45.075 align:middle line:90%
handled this problem.

have me do, what would you
have me say and to whom that

my life might be a bridge from
the problem to the answer.
