>>Good morning, Grandfather.

I entered this life always
back and put skin on

00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:36.630 align:middle line:84%
to walk two-legged
on this creation.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.333 align:middle line:90%
And what a glorious time it was.

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:54.681 align:middle line:84%
It taught me about breath
and about sense and feeling

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:58.151 align:middle line:90%
and caring through my heart.

And you spoke to me
through the wind.

And you sang to me
through the birds.

00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And you brought
challenges for us

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.333 align:middle line:84%
so that I might listen

down this road.

of that curve in the road.

And I began to find a secret
in the spirit of myself.

with pain.

my fear loomed up
inside sometimes,

00:05:37.737 --> 00:05:40.140 align:middle line:90%
but something called me forth.

to hear the song of the Mother.

And her arms embraced me so.

But instead of walking, she
carried me right to the door.

I heard her song.

up, so I could soar.
