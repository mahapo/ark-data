00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>> I love satay.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.810 align:middle line:90%
Everybody loves satay.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.262 align:middle line:84%
This is a fantastic alternative
to peanut sauce-- a lot

00:00:18.262 --> 00:00:19.220 align:middle line:90%
of allergies out there.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.610 align:middle line:84%
This is just beautiful, and
especially on a Friday night,

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.560 align:middle line:84%
especially in Australia,
where we have takeaway night.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.360 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And what I've noticed
over the years

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.330 align:middle line:84%
is when I get a takeaway
meal, which I don't anymore,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.830 align:middle line:84%
it's in a container; it has
this oil slick on the top of it,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.860 align:middle line:84%
and it's full of MSG, and I
feel a little bit dehydrated,

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.740 align:middle line:84%
and I go straight into
a food coma afterwards.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.440 align:middle line:84%
So this recipe is for us to have
that gorgeous feeling of satay,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.180 align:middle line:84%
but it nourishes your
organs at the same time.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.790 align:middle line:90%
So what I'm going to do is--

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.185 align:middle line:90%
I've got my veggies ready--

00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:52.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make my
satay sauce first.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Now as you can see,
my blender is yellow.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.250 align:middle line:90%
And that is because of turmeric.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.150 align:middle line:90%
That's life.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.270 align:middle line:90%


00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.090 align:middle line:84%
So I need some almond butter
in my yellow blender--

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.910 align:middle line:90%
it's actually funny-- first.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.690 align:middle line:84%
So instead of using
peanuts, I'm using almonds.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.990 align:middle line:84%
So you get a very gorgeous,
rich, a very rich texture

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.950 align:middle line:90%
from this sauce.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.030 align:middle line:90%
It's lovely.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And the almond
butter really does

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.960 align:middle line:84%
mimic the flavor
of peanut butter,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.580 align:middle line:90%
actually, which is kind of cool.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.050 align:middle line:90%


00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.700 align:middle line:90%
Yum.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.600 align:middle line:84%
If anything it's
tastier, I think, anyway.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.910 align:middle line:84%
OK, to that I want
to add some ginger.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.510 align:middle line:90%
Look at the size of that.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.853 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] That's massive.

00:01:38.853 --> 00:01:40.020 align:middle line:90%
Just a little bit of ginger.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to wash this.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.690 align:middle line:90%
This is organic ginger.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.450 align:middle line:84%
We get this from
one of our suppliers

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.610 align:middle line:84%
who's a local
farmer here in Bali.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.100 align:middle line:84%
So I don't like to
take the skins off.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of nutrients,
as my mother has told me

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.230 align:middle line:84%
over the years,
stays in the skins--

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.850 align:middle line:90%
really interesting.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.647 align:middle line:84%
So Mum, you'd be proud I'm
not peeling the ginger.

00:01:59.647 --> 00:02:00.980 align:middle line:90%
So I'm just going to grate this.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.480 align:middle line:84%
These are fantastic--
I've said this

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.130 align:middle line:90%
before-- these microplanes.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:84%
They get a really
nice, even grate

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.630 align:middle line:90%
there, as you can see in there.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.670 align:middle line:90%


00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.540 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.340 align:middle line:90%
Yum.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.220 align:middle line:90%


00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.720 align:middle line:84%
I want quite a bit
of ginger, and it

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.490 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter if a big chunk
falls in there like that.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.823 align:middle line:84%
it just doesn't matter because
it's going to grind down.

00:02:27.823 --> 00:02:30.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm just helping my
Vitamix on the way

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.080 align:middle line:90%
here, take the pressure off.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.210 align:middle line:90%


00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to
add some heat to that.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.030 align:middle line:90%
You can add chili.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.238 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to add cayenne
pepper, something different.

00:02:40.238 --> 00:02:41.480 align:middle line:90%
It just gives that--

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.870 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.495 align:middle line:84%
There's something
about cayenne pepper.

00:02:43.495 --> 00:02:45.770 align:middle line:90%
It's not as mild as chili.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.117 align:middle line:84%
It has this heat, but
it's really yummy,

00:02:49.117 --> 00:02:49.950 align:middle line:90%
something different.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.575 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to put any chili
or cayenne pepper in it at all.

00:02:52.575 --> 00:02:55.565 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to put, like,
not even 1/4 teaspoon in,

00:02:55.565 --> 00:02:58.220 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just going
to taste it as I go.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.790 align:middle line:84%
I want some sesame seed
oil and some maple syrup,

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.020 align:middle line:84%
really important two ingredients
with this particular satay

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.410 align:middle line:90%
sauce.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.210 align:middle line:84%
It brings it home
to that sataying--

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.210 align:middle line:90%
sataying feeling.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.360 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] That's
actually funny.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.370 align:middle line:90%
And I need some soy as well.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And smelling once again,
and please do that at home.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.925 align:middle line:84%
I know your bottles are
all labeled and everything,

00:03:20.925 --> 00:03:22.310 align:middle line:84%
but it brings you
in the present,

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.810 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's
a beautiful place

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.910 align:middle line:90%
to be when you're cooking.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.380 align:middle line:84%
So a little bit of
soy, the savoriness

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.080 align:middle line:84%
of sesame seed
oil, which I love,

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.095 align:middle line:90%
and the sweetness of maple.

00:03:38.095 --> 00:03:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have
any maple, you're

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.900 align:middle line:84%
very welcome to use
honey or coconut sugar.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.615 align:middle line:84%
Or you could put dates in
there, if you like, just

00:03:45.615 --> 00:03:47.790 align:middle line:90%
to add that sweetness.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.292 align:middle line:90%
Now I need some water.

00:03:50.292 --> 00:03:52.500 align:middle line:84%
What is going to make this
a little bit more runnier,

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.010 align:middle line:84%
and that's important because the
almond butter is quite thick.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.930 align:middle line:90%
So just a little bit of that.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.950 align:middle line:84%
You can have this as runny
and as thick as you like--

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.330 align:middle line:90%
either, either-- it's up to you.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Salt and pepper, building
blocks of labor--

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.270 align:middle line:84%
easy with the salt because
the soy has salt in there.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.195 align:middle line:90%
Pepper, definitely.

00:04:10.195 --> 00:04:11.820 align:middle line:84%
I know there's cayenne
pepper in there,

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.070 align:middle line:84%
but you definitely want the
salt and pepper in there,

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.740 align:middle line:90%
just easy on the salt.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going
to whisk this up.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.500 align:middle line:90%
I what the ginger to grind down.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.833 align:middle line:90%
I want everything to grind down.

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:28.620 align:middle line:90%
I want a smooth, liquidy--

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.960 align:middle line:90%
is liquidy a word?--

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.050 align:middle line:90%
saucy texture.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.168 align:middle line:90%
So quite smooth the no chunks.

00:04:34.168 --> 00:04:36.210 align:middle line:84%
So starting on low and
then building your way up.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:49.550 align:middle line:90%


00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.140 align:middle line:90%
So that took me about--

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.940 align:middle line:90%
I don't know?

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.300 align:middle line:90%
10 seconds, maybe?

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.552 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, this is good.

00:04:58.552 --> 00:05:00.260 align:middle line:84%
It's actually quite
runny, which is good.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.160 align:middle line:90%


00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.080 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.030 align:middle line:90%
Mmm.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.238 align:middle line:84%
That is good, if anything, it
needs a little bit more soy.

00:05:10.238 --> 00:05:12.030 align:middle line:84%
I can definitely taste
the sesame seed oil.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.255 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's so good.

00:05:13.255 --> 00:05:17.270 align:middle line:84%
It's such a really wonderful
replacement to peanuts.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.360 align:middle line:84%
So many peanut
allergies out there.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.220 align:middle line:90%
This is the one.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.220 align:middle line:90%
OK, back on to low--

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to mix
that gently through,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.135 align:middle line:84%
the little bit of soy
that I popped in there.

00:05:25.135 --> 00:05:33.280 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.360 align:middle line:84%
OK, one more taste,
in with my finger.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yummy.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.820 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.020 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that's done.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.670 align:middle line:84%
To my right, I've got
my steamer already on.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.210 align:middle line:90%
Be really careful with steam.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.930 align:middle line:84%
It can be quite dangerous
if you're not careful.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.040 align:middle line:84%
So I would like
to use maybe this.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Now you could have a bamboo
steamer, which is awesome,

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.105 align:middle line:84%
and you can just take
that out like that.

00:06:02.105 --> 00:06:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And the bamboo
ones are the same.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.620 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have
to use your fingers

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.850 align:middle line:90%
or worry about getting burned.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:08.650 align:middle line:90%
So that's ready.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:09.450 align:middle line:90%
That's on the ball.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:10.482 align:middle line:90%
That's steaming nicely.

00:06:10.482 --> 00:06:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to
cut up our vegetables.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to use
basic vegetables here--

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.620 align:middle line:84%
some broccoli, some cauliflower,
just keep it simple.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And you can have it as small
or as chunky as you like.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.235 align:middle line:84%
I want this to steam
pretty quickly.

00:06:25.235 --> 00:06:27.610 align:middle line:84%
There's a few people in the
studio today that are hungry,

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.360 align:middle line:84%
so this will definitely
hit the spot.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.957 align:middle line:90%


00:06:33.957 --> 00:06:35.040 align:middle line:90%
I've got some cauliflower.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.780 align:middle line:90%
Look at how cute this is.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.990 align:middle line:90%
It's like-- [HUMMING] Sorry.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.860 align:middle line:90%


00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.280 align:middle line:90%
Very cute organic food.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:49.500 align:middle line:90%


00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.020 align:middle line:90%
So cutting them into florets.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:57.560 align:middle line:90%


00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.843 align:middle line:90%
Fabulous.

00:06:59.843 --> 00:07:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And my mushrooms, I just
want to quarter them.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.218 align:middle line:84%
I want them quite
chunky and meaty.

00:07:03.218 --> 00:07:07.520 align:middle line:90%


00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Now remember what I
said in the last recipe,

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.330 align:middle line:84%
in the [INAUDIBLE] tempeh, is
not to wash your mushrooms.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Fungis definitely absorb liquid,
and they wash away the flavor.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.573 align:middle line:90%


00:07:21.573 --> 00:07:23.240 align:middle line:84%
These have already
been pre-wiped-- just

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.560 align:middle line:84%
wiping them around with a
damp cloth or a dry cloth.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:33.000 align:middle line:90%


00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Just a little bit of carrot
and a little bit of zucchini.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.970 align:middle line:84%
OK, as you can see, I'm
cutting through the zucchini--

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:53.950 align:middle line:90%
it's off.

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.900 align:middle line:90%
Such is life.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.490 align:middle line:90%
And I get down to there.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:59.792 align:middle line:90%
Ah, such is life.

00:07:59.792 --> 00:08:01.750 align:middle line:84%
But I've got about that
much out of a zucchini.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.310 align:middle line:90%
It's still OK to use the rest.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:04.727 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
throw that away.

00:08:04.727 --> 00:08:10.210 align:middle line:90%


00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Actually, that's probably
all I really want.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.870 align:middle line:90%
So that's perfect.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:17.620 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've got my sprouts
last and my herbs.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.175 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to steam that.

00:08:21.175 --> 00:08:23.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to steam the
hard vegetables first.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:31.480 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.840 align:middle line:84%
So I want my carrots and
my broccoli and cauliflower

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.980 align:middle line:90%
in there first.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to keep
these watery, softer

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:40.045 align:middle line:90%
vegetables to last.

00:08:40.045 --> 00:08:47.830 align:middle line:90%


00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I want to do
with this particular situation

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.280 align:middle line:84%
that's happening here
is salt and pepper--

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:58.400 align:middle line:84%
very important, building
blocks of flavor.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.928 align:middle line:90%


00:09:00.928 --> 00:09:02.220 align:middle line:90%
OK, we're going to let that go.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.055 align:middle line:90%
Our sauce is ready.

00:09:03.055 --> 00:09:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, the next thing
we're going to need

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.150 align:middle line:90%
is some beautiful lemongrass.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.130 align:middle line:84%
I want to definitely put
this into the steamer,

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.233 align:middle line:90%
this lemongrass as well.

00:09:13.233 --> 00:09:14.400 align:middle line:90%
Now, I want the softer side.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.630 align:middle line:84%
With your lemon grass, we don't
normally eat this part of it.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.510 align:middle line:90%
We normally eat this part of it.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Inside here, as you can see,
right in here is quite soft.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:27.830 align:middle line:90%
That's what you're after.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:31.470 align:middle line:84%
There's real soft,
sweet, delicate bits,

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.720 align:middle line:84%
and they're quite
fragrant as well.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:39.240 align:middle line:84%
So just cutting your lemongrass
down like this really

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:43.510 align:middle line:84%
easily, kind of
like a vanilla pod,

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:50.720 align:middle line:84%
and you want that soft, fresh
situation in the center there.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Now with this, I would like
to say, I would keep that,

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:58.130 align:middle line:84%
and I would tie that
in a knot, putting that

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:01.920 align:middle line:90%
into a jug of boiling water.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:02.720 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.120 align:middle line:84%
You would probably put about
this much water in a jug

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.580 align:middle line:84%
and this and some ginger,
and just let it steep,

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:12.270 align:middle line:84%
and then you get a lovely,
fragrant, hot drink.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to put this in there.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.370 align:middle line:90%
That's going to steamed through.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.050 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yum.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.120 align:middle line:84%
That's actually
nearly, nearly ready--

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.410 align:middle line:90%
nearly, nearly ready.

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.930 align:middle line:84%
I think it's time to
put this stuff in.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:29.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's been on for
about maybe two minutes?

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's enough
for those vegetables.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to place that
on top, the watery ones.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't want things to be mush.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, when we go
out for a takeaway,

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.660 align:middle line:84%
or we get a takeaway
dish, we want

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.540 align:middle line:84%
it to be with a bit of
crispness in there, so not mush.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:49.280 align:middle line:84%
So another, maybe 1
minute and 1/2, 2 minutes.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And if you want mush,
you go right ahead.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.485 align:middle line:90%
It's just going to take longer.

00:10:55.485 --> 00:10:57.860 align:middle line:84%
This is coming in last, so
I'm going to turn this off now

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.600 align:middle line:84%
actually because there's a few
other components to this dish

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.850 align:middle line:90%
that's going to bring it home.

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:04.130 align:middle line:84%
I want some spring
onions, which I

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:07.196 align:middle line:84%
have some delightful
little isms here--

00:11:07.196 --> 00:11:10.070 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] isms, makes me laugh.

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:13.670 align:middle line:84%
I've got some coriander,
and I've got those sprouts

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.620 align:middle line:84%
that I want nice and
fresh. so I'm not

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.400 align:middle line:90%
putting them into the steamer.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:21.110 align:middle line:84%
These herbs is just what
brings flavor to a dish.

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.102 align:middle line:90%
[SINK GURGLING]

00:11:23.102 --> 00:11:26.930 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] My sink's talking.

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's just give
them a quick dry.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.280 align:middle line:90%
They're a bit wet.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:34.400 align:middle line:90%


00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.650 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:38.070 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm just going to cut--

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:39.310 align:middle line:90%
oh, that's a bit too much--

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:42.555 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to cut
the ends off that.

00:11:42.555 --> 00:11:43.355 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:11:43.355 --> 00:11:48.480 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Just running your
knife through--

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.090 align:middle line:84%
no rules here-- as chunky and
as fine as you want it to be.

00:11:54.090 --> 00:12:01.840 align:middle line:90%


00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.612 align:middle line:84%
This is where my
sprouts come into play.

00:12:04.612 --> 00:12:05.520 align:middle line:90%
Just mix it.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.510 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that smells so good.

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.380 align:middle line:84%
Salt and pepper, building blocks
of flavor, really important--

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:12.120 align:middle line:90%
really, really important--

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.000 align:middle line:90%


00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:15.840 align:middle line:90%
and some onion.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's OK to have
raw onion, and it's

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.975 align:middle line:84%
OK to put it in the
steamer as well.

00:12:21.975 --> 00:12:23.850 align:middle line:84%
In the recipe, it says
put it in the steamer.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:35.960 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.600 align:middle line:84%
Everything gets
really well steamed,

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:44.930 align:middle line:84%
so we're just going to add
this in to the steamer now,

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:50.520 align:middle line:84%
and it will just hit that
steam, get a little bit softer,

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.620 align:middle line:90%
not so sharp.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And then we're ready to plate
up, and our sauce is ready.

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.950 align:middle line:90%
All right, I'm excited.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:02.480 align:middle line:84%
This is the part I love with
food is making it look sexy.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.030 align:middle line:90%
That's the big thing.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:04.830 align:middle line:90%
People forget that.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:05.630 align:middle line:90%
We cook dinner.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.540 align:middle line:90%
We're in a rush.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.320 align:middle line:84%
But this is where
the fun begins.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.630 align:middle line:90%
That's all my bits on there.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.810 align:middle line:90%


00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:19.480 align:middle line:84%
You can definitely add some
chili into this if you want to.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.390 align:middle line:84%
It's just mixing
those flavors through.

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I can smell that lemon
grass coming through.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.200 align:middle line:90%
It's like a lemon grass facial.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.788 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] Oh, yum--

00:13:30.788 --> 00:13:32.205 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more
salt and pepper.

00:13:32.205 --> 00:13:37.410 align:middle line:90%


00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:38.780 align:middle line:90%
This is just beautiful.

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:49.516 align:middle line:90%


00:13:49.516 --> 00:13:53.377 align:middle line:84%
I've made a bit of a
mess here, but that's OK.

00:13:53.377 --> 00:13:54.460 align:middle line:90%
This is the goodness here.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.770 align:middle line:90%
Don't forget all that.

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:59.050 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm washing my hands.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:13:59.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm very excited.

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:02.800 align:middle line:90%
This is gorgeous.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Enough for two,
maybe for three--

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.600 align:middle line:84%
great salad for a barbecue,
great warm salad in winter.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to put my sauce
into something, maybe this.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:19.840 align:middle line:90%


00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:24.486 align:middle line:84%
It's OK, we'll just
leave it at that.

00:14:24.486 --> 00:14:28.132 align:middle line:84%
A few hemp seeds, if
you've got them, just

00:14:28.132 --> 00:14:29.090 align:middle line:90%
for that extra protein.

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:29.890 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to.

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:32.470 align:middle line:84%
I've just got them
in front of me.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:33.950 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:38.810 align:middle line:84%
That is satay vegetables
without peanut sauce--

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.038 align:middle line:90%
really tasty, really fragrant.

00:14:42.038 --> 00:14:43.580 align:middle line:84%
I can smell the
lemongrass from here.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:46.252 align:middle line:84%
I can smell the ginger
coming from this sauce.

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Just beautiful-- you're
going to love it.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.390 align:middle line:84%
What a great way
to have a takeaway

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:51.860 align:middle line:90%
without having the takeaway.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.070 align:middle line:84%
So we're putting in to our body
what nature requires from us

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:58.460 align:middle line:84%
instead of taking away from what
nature doesn't require from us.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.905 align:middle line:90%
So enjoy.

00:15:01.905 --> 00:15:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And that-- stop-- (SINGING)
la-la-lasagne, la-la-lasagne.

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:06.350 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:09.630 align:middle line:90%
Give me the words, God.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:10.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy.

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:11.670 align:middle line:90%
These are so good.

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:13.481 align:middle line:90%
One more.

00:15:13.481 --> 00:15:14.475 align:middle line:90%
Mmm.

00:15:14.475 --> 00:15:15.469 align:middle line:90%
One more.

00:15:15.469 --> 00:15:18.460 align:middle line:90%


00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Back away from
the sauce, people.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:20.870 align:middle line:90%
Yum.

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:23.570 align:middle line:90%


00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:25.970 align:middle line:90%
Want some?
