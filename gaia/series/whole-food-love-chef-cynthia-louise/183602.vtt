00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>> We've been cooking rice
for hundreds of years, fact.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And this whole
grain dilemma that's

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.850 align:middle line:84%
happening out there
at the moment,

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.990 align:middle line:90%
oh, that's another conversation.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.410 align:middle line:90%
But I source my rice direct.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And when I mean direct, I'm
in Bali so it's easy for me.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And the storage of rice here
doesn't-- it's not a long time.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.105 align:middle line:84%
So we have very
good quality rice.

00:00:34.105 --> 00:00:36.480 align:middle line:84%
One thing that I've noticed
out of the hundreds of people

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.300 align:middle line:84%
I've taught over the years
is how do you cook rice.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.880 align:middle line:90%
There's two ways, rice cooker--

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.840 align:middle line:90%
genius.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.760 align:middle line:90%
Put it on, walk away.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.810 align:middle line:90%
Love it.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And in your rice cooker,
you can cook quinoa as well.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.520 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Second way is with just
the traditional way,

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.160 align:middle line:84%
right, with a pot on the
fire with some water.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.280 align:middle line:90%
So this is what I'll show you.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.328 align:middle line:90%
So the easiest way to do this--

00:01:03.328 --> 00:01:04.650 align:middle line:90%
I'll put this here.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.290 align:middle line:84%
The easiest way to measure
out how much rice you

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.630 align:middle line:84%
want to how much
water you want is

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.430 align:middle line:84%
to always know
that 1 cup of rice

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.310 align:middle line:84%
is going to yield you enough
for about four people.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.780 align:middle line:90%
That's what we know, OK?

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.700 align:middle line:90%
So say I pop that in there.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.247 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:01:19.247 --> 00:01:21.330 align:middle line:84%
The next thing to know,
how much water do you use.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.663 align:middle line:90%
Now, you can measure your water.

00:01:22.663 --> 00:01:23.520 align:middle line:90%
So you used about--

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.770 align:middle line:84%
I use about 1 and 1/2 cups
of rice to 2 cups of water.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.700 align:middle line:84%
This is red rice so I use
a little bit more water

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.990 align:middle line:90%
because it's quite--

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.790 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.030 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.320 align:middle line:90%
It's nutty.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.180 align:middle line:84%
It's more-- it's
more rustic to it.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.290 align:middle line:84%
It's not like the white
variety, where it's quite soft

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.190 align:middle line:90%
and fluffs up.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.250 align:middle line:84%
This is really chewy,
and earthy, and nutty.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.600 align:middle line:90%
It's really gorgeous.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.953 align:middle line:84%
Very similar to
brown, but it's red.

00:01:47.953 --> 00:01:49.870 align:middle line:84%
There's so many different
varieties out there.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:50.400 align:middle line:90%
There's green.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.000 align:middle line:90%
There's purple.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.800 align:middle line:90%
There's red.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.910 align:middle line:90%
There's black.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.440 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
different varieties.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.440 align:middle line:90%
They're the ones I know.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.030 align:middle line:84%
I've seen orange
rice before too.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.480 align:middle line:90%
So the trick is--

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.280 align:middle line:90%
this is my trick.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.447 align:middle line:84%
This is what I was taught
in Papua New Guinea, where

00:02:01.447 --> 00:02:03.870 align:middle line:84%
I grew up with the
ladies cooking around me

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.440 align:middle line:90%
throughout the years.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.980 align:middle line:90%
OK, so I put water in there.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Give the pot a little
bit of a shake.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.243 align:middle line:84%
Make sure the rice is settled
down to the bottom of the pot.

00:02:15.243 --> 00:02:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I'm looking
for-- so I'm making sure

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.170 align:middle line:84%
that's an even layer of rice,
and the water is on top.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.570 align:middle line:84%
So my rice is here, and
now, my water is here.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.240 align:middle line:84%
I want to make sure that
the water comes just

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.510 align:middle line:90%
above my line on my finger.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's anyone's finger with
any line, and it's just above.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.170 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.400 align:middle line:90%
This is what I was taught.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.510 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to pop
my finger in there.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.090 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just touching the rice.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going all the
way down to the bottom.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm putting my finger just
to touch the rice, OK?

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.280 align:middle line:84%
So I need some more
water than that.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Make sure it's all
even, the rice.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to pop my finger in.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.180 align:middle line:90%
It's just above.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.260 align:middle line:90%
Can you see that?

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.060 align:middle line:90%
That is perfect.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.540 align:middle line:84%
So that's how much water
I need for that much rice.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.040 align:middle line:84%
So how much rice
should I put in?

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.870 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on
how much you want.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.410 align:middle line:84%
I just freestyled it
and poured that in, OK?

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.060 align:middle line:90%
And then I measured--

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.630 align:middle line:84%
I freestyled it,
poured the rice in.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And I just put the water
and measured it up to here.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.490 align:middle line:84%
So I don't need to
measure anything.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.673 align:middle line:90%
That's just a rule of thumb.

00:03:17.673 --> 00:03:20.090 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is, I'm going
to bring this up to a boil.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.287 align:middle line:90%
It works every time, by the way.

00:03:23.287 --> 00:03:24.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to leave
the lid on, and I'm

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.150 align:middle line:90%
going to bring it up to a boil.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.692 align:middle line:84%
And once it starts
boiling, I'm going

00:03:27.692 --> 00:03:29.300 align:middle line:84%
to let it boil
because it's red rice.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to let it boil
for a good 5 to 7 minutes.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to
turn it down to low,

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.810 align:middle line:90%
and I'm going to pop the lid on.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to let
it create a technique,

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.657 align:middle line:84%
a cooking technique called
the absorption method.

00:03:40.657 --> 00:03:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to have
wonderful, fluffy rice.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.750 align:middle line:84%
So I've cooked some prior
because it takes quite a while.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.470 align:middle line:90%
Now, red rice does take a while.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.270 align:middle line:84%
It's not like the white variety,
where it's really quick.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.070 align:middle line:90%
Remember that.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.780 align:middle line:90%
It does take a while.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.990 align:middle line:90%
So this has been cooking.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.190 align:middle line:90%
Now, I've done the same thing.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.330 align:middle line:84%
I've just freestyled the rice
in there, just poured it in.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.870 align:middle line:84%
I've measured it just above
that first crease of my finger,

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.730 align:middle line:90%
on my pointer finger.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.920 align:middle line:84%
I've brought it up to the
boil without the lid on,

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.720 align:middle line:84%
and I've let it boil
for about seven minutes.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And then I've turned
it down to a low heat,

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.850 align:middle line:84%
and popped the lid on,
and allowed it just

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.589 align:middle line:84%
to create that
absorption method.

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:21.050 align:middle line:84%
I've watched it just to
see where it's at, yeah?

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Every now and then,
I've poked over.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.675 align:middle line:90%
And I go, wow, that's good.

00:04:23.675 --> 00:04:25.310 align:middle line:90%
That's still happening.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.140 align:middle line:84%
It smells seriously
nutty and quite--

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.350 align:middle line:84%
it has quite a lot
of fragrance to it.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not like the white rice.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.090 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very different.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.170 align:middle line:90%
It fluffs up too.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.690 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.640 align:middle line:90%
I mean, look at that.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.630 align:middle line:90%
It's just beautiful.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's have a look at
it in its raw state

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.940 align:middle line:84%
so you get an idea of
how this is looking.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:57.670 align:middle line:90%


00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.100 align:middle line:90%
So look at that.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.040 align:middle line:90%
It's really, really rustic, eh?

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.825 align:middle line:90%
Like, really-- it's not like--

00:05:04.825 --> 00:05:06.075 align:middle line:90%
it's not even like brown rice.

00:05:06.075 --> 00:05:07.075 align:middle line:90%
It's really interesting.

00:05:07.075 --> 00:05:09.190 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of longer as well.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
sticky, mm, nutty.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.063 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's gorgeous.

00:05:14.063 --> 00:05:17.977 align:middle line:84%
It has a-- [SNIFFS] I can't
explain this fragrance.

00:05:17.977 --> 00:05:18.810 align:middle line:90%
It's just beautiful.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.140 align:middle line:84%
It has a slight
fragrant feeling to it,

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.110 align:middle line:84%
like almost a sweetness
in the air, where

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.120 align:middle line:90%
it's scented the studio out.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.460 align:middle line:90%
It's really gorgeous.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.260 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.010 align:middle line:90%
So we're ready to rock and roll.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.770 align:middle line:84%
You can get red rice from your
local supermarket these days.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.008 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it.

00:05:37.008 --> 00:05:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you're in
Bali, it's abundant.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.140 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.260 align:middle line:84%
All right, we're
going to need a bowl.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.502 align:middle line:84%
This rice salad
is very different.

00:05:47.502 --> 00:05:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to need a little
bowl to make the dressing.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.540 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to make
the dressing first, just

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.760 align:middle line:90%
to get that out of the way.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.560 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.240 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to need some
soy, some sesame seed oil.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.840 align:middle line:84%
A very different salad
dressing, this is beautiful.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this is copied
from my mate, Courtney,

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.980 align:middle line:84%
who's the daughter I never
had's mother, Heather.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.840 align:middle line:84%
She made a gorgeous
rice salad once.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And I just made
it my way, but it

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.290 align:middle line:90%
was a base of her rice salad.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.800 align:middle line:84%
So Heather, that rice salad
is, like, in my memory bank.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is passed
on now to the world,

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.420 align:middle line:84%
but with a little bit of
difference-- more high plant,

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.405 align:middle line:84%
different sources
that we've used here.

00:06:24.405 --> 00:06:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And a little bit of
apple cider vinegar.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.086 align:middle line:84%
All right, we're
going to need a whisk.

00:06:31.086 --> 00:06:32.152 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I love this kitchen.

00:06:32.152 --> 00:06:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Don't you feel good when
you're in the kitchen,

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.318 align:middle line:90%
having everything around you?

00:06:35.318 --> 00:06:36.590 align:middle line:90%
You can totally do that.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.940 align:middle line:84%
What you do is you take
the cupboards, right?

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.690 align:middle line:84%
You can take the doors
off the cupboards.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.960 align:middle line:90%
And then you've got it.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.320 align:middle line:84%
All right, so I need
some sesame seed oil.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.740 align:middle line:90%
Oh, sorry, some soy.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.000 align:middle line:90%
Some sesame seed oil.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.784 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.784 --> 00:06:58.190 align:middle line:90%
A splash of apple cider vinegar.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:58.990 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.490 align:middle line:84%
Just for that acidity,
just a splash.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.110 align:middle line:90%
Maple syrup for that sweetness.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.547 align:middle line:90%


00:07:09.547 --> 00:07:10.540 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And add a little bit
of pepper to that.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.930 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.310 align:middle line:90%
Let's give that a little stir.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.930 align:middle line:90%


00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.210 align:middle line:90%
Have a taste.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:25.740 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.050 align:middle line:90%
A bit more maple.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.730 align:middle line:90%


00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:31.530 align:middle line:90%
I love maple syrup.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:32.863 align:middle line:90%
It has that caramelizing flavor.

00:07:32.863 --> 00:07:34.770 align:middle line:84%
You can totally use
money if you want to.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.200 align:middle line:84%
That's no problem at all,
absolutely no problem,

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.020 align:middle line:90%
or coconut sugar.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.050 align:middle line:90%


00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.760 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's put these babies back.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, our rice is
coming to the boil,

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.277 align:middle line:84%
if you just want to
have a look at that.

00:07:47.277 --> 00:07:50.800 align:middle line:90%


00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.600 align:middle line:90%
It's just boiling nicely.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to let
that boil for 7 minutes.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.778 align:middle line:90%
All right, let's set that aside.

00:07:58.778 --> 00:07:59.695 align:middle line:90%
Let's get our veggies.

00:07:59.695 --> 00:08:03.370 align:middle line:90%


00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:08.648 align:middle line:90%
All righty, got some cucumber.

00:08:08.648 --> 00:08:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Got a half a cucumber,
which I'm going to use up.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:20.120 align:middle line:90%


00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:25.942 align:middle line:84%
Now, I just want this chopped
into long pieces first.

00:08:25.942 --> 00:08:28.025 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
turn that into small dice.

00:08:28.025 --> 00:08:30.720 align:middle line:90%


00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Cucumber, it just adds that
freshness to this salad.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:39.590 align:middle line:84%
All right, and turning
it to the side,

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:44.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm just smashing out
those little squares.

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Smashing out those
little squares--

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.910 align:middle line:84%
that's something
my son would say.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.618 align:middle line:90%
OK, straight into your bowl.

00:08:51.618 --> 00:08:54.905 align:middle line:90%


00:08:54.905 --> 00:08:55.780 align:middle line:90%
Same with the carrot.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:56.863 align:middle line:90%
Now, I washed this carrot.

00:08:56.863 --> 00:08:59.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to peel it.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:01.960 align:middle line:84%
That's they beauty of
organic food, yeah?

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:06.500 align:middle line:84%
It has all those
nutrients in there.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.602 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to cut
them long ways like this.

00:09:10.602 --> 00:09:13.690 align:middle line:84%
A sharp knife, that'll get
that glide right through.

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:15.942 align:middle line:90%
Blunt knife, you'll struggle.

00:09:15.942 --> 00:09:18.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, once again, same
thing as the cucumber.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:23.620 align:middle line:90%


00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.591 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:27.130 align:middle line:90%
All right, let's pop this here.

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:30.590 align:middle line:90%


00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:31.390 align:middle line:90%
Line them up.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:33.160 align:middle line:90%
Do what you can handle.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.870 align:middle line:90%
That's a bit too much, Cynthia.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.700 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes I get carried away.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:41.900 align:middle line:90%


00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:42.870 align:middle line:90%
Push that to the side.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:49.444 align:middle line:90%


00:09:49.444 --> 00:09:55.330 align:middle line:84%
All right, nice little
squares into the same bowl

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.304 align:middle line:90%
with the cucumber.

00:09:58.304 --> 00:10:02.510 align:middle line:90%
Now, I've got a capsicum.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:04.340 align:middle line:90%
I want to use this bit, yeah?

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.820 align:middle line:90%
Throw that bit away.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Keep those seeds for
planting or put them

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:15.300 align:middle line:84%
in the compost bin, either way,
back into where they came from.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.410 align:middle line:84%
All right, I'm just going to
take this out because I just--

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.400 align:middle line:90%
for aesthetic reasons.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.980 align:middle line:90%
I just don't want it there.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:25.760 align:middle line:90%
OK, all right.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:26.810 align:middle line:90%
Once again, long strips.

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:33.820 align:middle line:90%


00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.130 align:middle line:84%
It's almost a baton size,
bigger than a julienne.

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:42.695 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.695 --> 00:10:43.495 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:10:43.495 --> 00:11:00.205 align:middle line:90%


00:11:00.205 --> 00:11:01.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.790 align:middle line:90%
Into our bowl.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:08.625 align:middle line:90%


00:11:08.625 --> 00:11:12.080 align:middle line:90%
I want some spring onions.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.830 align:middle line:84%
These are just local
little spring onions.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:14.913 align:middle line:90%
Look at the base of these.

00:11:14.913 --> 00:11:17.040 align:middle line:90%
They're just beautiful.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.915 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to cut
those roots off just there.

00:11:20.915 --> 00:11:23.444 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to cut it in half.

00:11:23.444 --> 00:11:26.460 align:middle line:90%
Now we cut it in half again.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.420 align:middle line:84%
You're going to do
what you can handle.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to run
my knife through.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.270 align:middle line:90%


00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:35.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, just cutting these finely,
as fine as you can get them.

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:37.520 align:middle line:84%
No stress if you
can't get them fine.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:45.975 align:middle line:90%


00:11:45.975 --> 00:11:47.640 align:middle line:90%
All right, into here.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.440 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.600 align:middle line:90%


00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:57.590 align:middle line:84%
OK, now I want some parsley,
some flat leaf parsley actually

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:02.260 align:middle line:84%
and not the curly leaf variety,
just because I have it.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:03.060 align:middle line:90%
And it's nice.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:03.932 align:middle line:90%
It's refreshing.

00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:05.640 align:middle line:84%
All right, I'm going
to use these stalks.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
cut those off there.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.545 align:middle line:90%
Once again, the same deal--

00:12:10.545 --> 00:12:13.050 align:middle line:84%
just scrunching it up and
running my knife through.

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:22.690 align:middle line:90%


00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:24.795 align:middle line:84%
As fine as you can get it
but not too fine, yeah?

00:12:24.795 --> 00:12:25.670 align:middle line:90%
We don't want a mush.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:27.070 align:middle line:84%
We want a bit of
texture in this.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:35.910 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:39.120 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.163 align:middle line:90%
Into our bowl.

00:12:40.163 --> 00:12:43.410 align:middle line:90%


00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:46.140 align:middle line:90%
Now, bringing it in.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:50.190 align:middle line:84%
All right, salt and
peppering these vegetables,

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:51.350 align:middle line:90%
salt and peppering--

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:52.910 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:54.900 align:middle line:90%
Oh, hilarious.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:57.105 align:middle line:84%
We just want to pull
out these flavors here.

00:12:57.105 --> 00:13:00.360 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, look at that.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.410 align:middle line:90%
Yum, yum, yum.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.980 align:middle line:90%


00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this is beautiful,
truly beautiful.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.190 align:middle line:84%
OK, now it's time
to add our rice.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:16.410 align:middle line:90%


00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:21.240 align:middle line:84%
Perfectly cooked through
the finger method of--

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.900 align:middle line:84%
no, perfectly cooked through
the one finger crease

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.334 align:middle line:90%
method of glory.

00:13:28.334 --> 00:13:32.820 align:middle line:84%
All right, now, we
just want to toss this

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.460 align:middle line:84%
through those
veggies, just quickly,

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.690 align:middle line:90%
so it just incorporates.

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're going to drizzle
this dressing on just over it.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:48.963 align:middle line:90%


00:13:48.963 --> 00:13:50.880 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't feel like
there's a lot of dressing

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.130 align:middle line:90%
there, hey, for this quantity.

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:55.150 align:middle line:90%
But really, it's enough.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.170 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.150 align:middle line:90%


00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Just tossing it through,
getting that dressing,

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:02.585 align:middle line:90%
coating that rice.

00:14:02.585 --> 00:14:07.480 align:middle line:90%


00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.850 align:middle line:84%
All right, let's have a little
taste, see where we're at.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.590 align:middle line:90%


00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:17.010 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:22.250 align:middle line:84%
Mate, for that amount of
dressing with all this,

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.140 align:middle line:90%
ah, that's perfect, perfect.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I even wonder, when
I come up with these recipes,

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:29.700 align:middle line:90%
if it's enough.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And then I redo the recipe
or rehash the recipe,

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:36.497 align:middle line:90%
and I go, wow, it's enough.

00:14:36.497 --> 00:14:39.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:39.990 align:middle line:90%
Pop that aside.

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:44.051 align:middle line:84%
Let's get a lovely plate, just
clean off this board a bit.

00:14:44.051 --> 00:14:47.135 align:middle line:90%


00:14:47.135 --> 00:14:48.135 align:middle line:90%
A bit of a chef's clean.

00:14:48.135 --> 00:14:51.680 align:middle line:90%


00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.030 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:57.290 align:middle line:90%
Let's put a lovely plate here.

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.700 align:middle line:90%
We've got the crew upstairs.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:05.415 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be wanting
some food in a minute.

00:15:05.415 --> 00:15:07.290 align:middle line:84%
So we'll take this little
platter up to them.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:12.480 align:middle line:90%


00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.817 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:15:13.817 --> 00:15:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Next thing I want to add to this
is some sunflower seeds, just

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.062 align:middle line:90%
more plant, you know?

00:15:18.062 --> 00:15:21.040 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.485 align:middle line:84%
And I want to add some
pumpkin seeds as well, just

00:15:23.485 --> 00:15:24.850 align:middle line:90%
for that contrast in color.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:31.440 align:middle line:90%


00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.550 align:middle line:84%
There we go, a
beautiful red rice

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:38.830 align:middle line:84%
salad with a twist of difference
from Heather's original recipe

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:41.990 align:middle line:84%
to more a whole
foods version that

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:45.590 align:middle line:90%
is scrumptious, fulfilling.

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And the nuttiness of this
red rice is extraordinary.

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:50.940 align:middle line:90%
You are going to love it.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:51.740 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.330 align:middle line:84%
If you can't get
red rice, use brown.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:57.398 align:middle line:90%


00:15:57.398 --> 00:16:00.227 align:middle line:84%
If you can't get
brown rice, use white.

00:16:00.227 --> 00:16:01.060 align:middle line:90%
This is really good.

[LAUGHS]

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:03.690 align:middle line:90%
This is really good.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.360 align:middle line:90%
Genius.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Enough for a beautiful barbecue
with friends on a Sunday

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:20.015 align:middle line:84%
or just a part of a dinner, you
know, just one part of dinner.

00:16:20.015 --> 00:16:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're doing here.

I'm not trying to make
you into a vegetarian.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:29.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to turn you
into a gorilla, a plant eater.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.620 align:middle line:84%
What I'm trying to do is
facilitate some creativity

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:35.830 align:middle line:84%
with you so you can just amp
up some nutrients in your diet.

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is one way
to do it, just adding

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:41.664 align:middle line:90%
these dishes to your meals.

Voila!

Is it Viola or wall?

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:52.010 align:middle line:90%
Walla.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.320 align:middle line:90%
Is it walla?

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.120 align:middle line:90%

>> Voila.

00:16:56.674 --> 00:16:57.474 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.
