[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.395 --> 00:00:12.620 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.270 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a really
awesome sauce.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.510 align:middle line:90%
It's creamy.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.360 align:middle line:90%
It's luxurious.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Any time I've ever made
this-- and I swear to you,

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.050 align:middle line:84%
anytime I've ever made this,
everyone's like, what is that?

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.940 align:middle line:84%
How is that even possible
that sauce hasn't

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.813 align:middle line:90%
got cheese or cream in it?

00:00:27.813 --> 00:00:29.480 align:middle line:84%
First thing, I'm going
to wash my leeks.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.860 align:middle line:90%
These are baby leeks.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.500 align:middle line:84%
Some leeks in America,
New Zealand, and Australia

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.300 align:middle line:84%
are quite-- they're
about this round.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.190 align:middle line:84%
But these ones are
really sweet baby ones

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.410 align:middle line:84%
that I just got a hold of
from the farmer's market.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.520 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really
matter, either is fine.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.250 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to wash
these really, really well.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.835 align:middle line:90%
And how you wash leeks--

00:00:46.835 --> 00:00:48.270 align:middle line:90%
I'll just grab a knife actually.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.170 align:middle line:90%


00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.400 align:middle line:84%
How you wash leeks
is you cut down--

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.900 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people
take away the green.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.700 align:middle line:90%
We need the green.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.270 align:middle line:84%
The green's the flavor,
lots of flavor in the green.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Just going to cut down
in here, and we're just

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.355 align:middle line:84%
going to get the dirt that's
wrapped around each leaf,

00:01:08.355 --> 00:01:09.155 align:middle line:90%
really simply.

00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:14.648 align:middle line:90%


00:01:14.648 --> 00:01:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you don't
have to cut them,

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.030 align:middle line:84%
but I just like to get
in there just in case

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.738 align:middle line:84%
because there's nothing
worse than having

00:01:19.738 --> 00:01:23.270 align:middle line:84%
a creamy sauce with a bit of
grit when you're eating it.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.720 align:middle line:84%
So I've washed these really
well, as you can see,

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.580 align:middle line:84%
and just making sure I
haven't left anything

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.480 align:middle line:90%
in between the actual leaves.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.020 align:middle line:84%
OK, the whole leek, like I said,
from the top to the bottom.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.090 align:middle line:84%
If anything, I'm just going
to cut off just a little bit

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.770 align:middle line:90%
of that, and that's it.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:43.910 align:middle line:90%
That's all we do.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.000 align:middle line:84%
We don't throw away the
green, definitely not.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And just roughly run
your knife through.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.795 align:middle line:84%
Oh, they're a sweet, sweet
vegetable these leeks are.

00:01:55.795 --> 00:01:59.210 align:middle line:84%
They're just in between
that onion and that garlic.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, not as
strong, but quite sweet.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.960 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm going to need a pot.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.310 align:middle line:90%
Is that going to be big enough?

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.660 align:middle line:90%
Maybe not, actually.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Decent-sized pot-- pop these
in the pot just like that.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.250 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm going to add cashews.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.777 align:middle line:84%
This is where it
gets interesting.

00:02:19.777 --> 00:02:21.610 align:middle line:84%
The cashew's going to
act as that creaminess

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.350 align:middle line:90%
to this particular dish.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Really, really
simple, I'm just going

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.770 align:middle line:90%
to add my cashews to this pot.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.260 align:middle line:84%
The next thing I'm going to
do is put enough water in here

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.160 align:middle line:90%
to cover.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.960 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to go
straight onto the stove.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:84%
I want a high heat to
start off with just

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:45.010 align:middle line:84%
to get that boil happening,
just to quicken things on a bit.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to cook
that, lid off--

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.270 align:middle line:84%
just move my
utensils away a bit--

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.910 align:middle line:84%
lid off, cooking, bringing
it up to the boil.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.430 align:middle line:84%
As soon as it starts boiling,
we're going to turn it down

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.480 align:middle line:84%
and we're going
to let it simmer,

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.920 align:middle line:84%
then we're going to let
it rest, and then we're

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.580 align:middle line:90%
going to [? split ?] it.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.288 align:middle line:84%
So let's just give
this about 10 minutes.

00:02:59.288 --> 00:03:01.510 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this has
come up to the boil.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And a really,
really good tip here

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.480 align:middle line:84%
is to skim the
impurities off the top.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.170 align:middle line:90%
And the impurities are these--

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.810 align:middle line:84%
as you can see, there's these
little foamy, fluffy "isms,"

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.100 align:middle line:84%
I like to call it, [CHUCKLES]
ism, and just take them off.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.200 align:middle line:90%
And just chuck that in the sink.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Now the important
thing next is to allow

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.890 align:middle line:84%
this to rest for at least a
minute or two, preferably five.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite hot still,
so what I want to do

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.940 align:middle line:84%
is I want to blend
it into the Vitamix.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the important
things about blending

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.220 align:middle line:84%
hot food into a blender
is not creating a suction.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.130 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going to
put it all in here,

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.650 align:middle line:84%
put this on, and do this because
it's just going to explode.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.450 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.242 align:middle line:84%
So it's really important,
so take your time

00:03:44.242 --> 00:03:46.090 align:middle line:84%
with this if you're
not used to doing this.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.600 align:middle line:84%
So I've got my ladle
and my blender,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.250 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just very
simply adding this.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And the Vitamix can
handle hot heat.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.963 align:middle line:84%
It's actually an
amazing, amazing machine.

00:03:55.963 --> 00:03:58.130 align:middle line:84%
All right, I'm just going
to pop all that into here.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.470 align:middle line:84%
This makes the most creamiest
sauce ever, ever, ever, ever.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.630 align:middle line:84%
It smells beautiful,
absolutely beautiful.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.907 align:middle line:84%
This is the sauce that
I put on a dinner table

00:04:08.907 --> 00:04:10.990 align:middle line:84%
when people come over for
dinner with a whole pile

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.310 align:middle line:84%
of steamed veggies that are
just doused in olive oil

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.090 align:middle line:84%
and it's got salt and pepper all
over them and this sauce just

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.890 align:middle line:90%
on the side.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.089 align:middle line:84%
And people are like,
oh, what's that?

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And then they pour it on,
they're like, oh, my god,

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.590 align:middle line:90%
it's amazing.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.400 align:middle line:84%
OK, I want a garlic clove,
just a bit of extra flavor.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Once again, organic
garlic, clove and all.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Salt and pepper because
there's none in here.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.440 align:middle line:84%
Remember when we started
putting on the stove?

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.740 align:middle line:84%
So salt and pepper
brings out flavor.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.202 align:middle line:90%
100%, this is where it's at.

00:04:39.202 --> 00:04:41.160 align:middle line:84%
This is what's going to
really bring this sauce

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.990 align:middle line:90%
home, the salt and pepper.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.470 align:middle line:84%
It's just going to make
the flavors enhance.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Its like its own
flavor enhancer.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Oh, look at this
pepper, beautiful.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to add some extra
plants in here because I can.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.540 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.413 align:middle line:90%
It's totally fine.

00:04:59.413 --> 00:05:01.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to add a
little bit of parsley,

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.965 align:middle line:90%
not a lot, just a little bit.

00:05:02.965 --> 00:05:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to break it
up into pieces and pop that in.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.240 align:middle line:84%
All right, and now
we're going to blend.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.550 align:middle line:90%
All right, lid on tight.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.798 align:middle line:84%
This to the side,
really important.

00:05:12.798 --> 00:05:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Now if you don't have a Vitamix
and you have another blender,

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.730 align:middle line:84%
just check out the lid and check
out this little ism on top.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.230 align:middle line:90%
Just have it on the side, OK?

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.682 align:middle line:84%
Starting on low, and
then build your way up.

00:05:24.682 --> 00:05:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Now it's quite watery and
green, as you can see,

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.475 align:middle line:90%
but watch what happens.

00:05:28.475 --> 00:05:33.620 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.100 align:middle line:84%
OK, I've been
blending for a bit.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to turn that off.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.302 align:middle line:84%
It's very runny, like
super, super runny

00:05:40.302 --> 00:05:42.010 align:middle line:84%
because I haven't put
all of it in there,

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.120 align:middle line:84%
and I just want to show
you how runny that is.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.010 align:middle line:90%


00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.885 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:05:47.885 --> 00:05:49.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.483 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm just going to
use a slotted spoon just

00:05:52.483 --> 00:05:53.900 align:middle line:84%
to get the rest
of that out there.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.585 align:middle line:84%
This will really
thicken things up.

00:05:56.585 --> 00:05:57.900 align:middle line:90%
Oh, is that good.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:04.670 align:middle line:84%
It's so creamy and so
tasty, so refreshing.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.730 align:middle line:84%
People aren't going to
know it's not dairy.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Once again, Off, on Low,
and then all the way.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.430 align:middle line:90%
[BLENDING]

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.230 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:21.727 align:middle line:84%
All righty, let's have
a look, really creamy.

00:06:21.727 --> 00:06:22.810 align:middle line:90%
Look at the texture there.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.261 align:middle line:90%


00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:29.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, perfect.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.613 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to pop
it back into a pot.

00:06:31.613 --> 00:06:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And when dinner's ready, when
I've steamed all my veggies,

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.510 align:middle line:84%
I've got this lovely
sauce just to pour on top.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:37.560 align:middle line:90%
It freezes really well--

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.940 align:middle line:90%
I mentioned that before--

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.790 align:middle line:84%
really, really, really,
really, really well.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.720 align:middle line:84%
This poured over a family
meal of steamed potatoes,

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.960 align:middle line:84%
some beautiful broccoli,
and some zucchini--

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.840 align:middle line:90%


00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.430 align:middle line:84%
I tell you, they're
going to love it.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.915 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's like soup, actually.

00:06:56.915 --> 00:07:00.404 align:middle line:90%


00:07:00.404 --> 00:07:01.290 align:middle line:90%
Oh, god.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.100 align:middle line:90%
It's that good.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- how
can I explain it?

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:05.760 align:middle line:90%
Make it.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.324 align:middle line:84%
Make it and tune into me
and tell me what you think.

00:07:09.324 --> 00:07:11.490 align:middle line:90%
Write your comments below.

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:12.730 align:middle line:90%
It's that good.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:13.814 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:07:13.814 --> 00:07:14.614 align:middle line:90%


00:07:14.614 --> 00:07:15.540 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.340 align:middle line:90%
When this sets--

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.140 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.720 align:middle line:90%
I can't stop eating it.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.290 align:middle line:90%
When this sits in the fridge--

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:21.090 align:middle line:90%
no, sorry.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.798 align:middle line:84%
When this is in the
fridge and goes cold,

00:07:22.798 --> 00:07:25.675 align:middle line:84%
it gets quite thicker,
like it goes thicker,

00:07:25.675 --> 00:07:27.800 align:middle line:84%
and I just go to add a
little bit more liquid in it

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.180 align:middle line:90%
when I go to heat it up.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.910 align:middle line:90%
But, mate, I'm telling you--

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.370 align:middle line:90%
got to get all that out--

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.160 align:middle line:90%
this is like--

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.647 align:middle line:84%
I've got some family coming
over for dinner tonight.

00:07:38.647 --> 00:07:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And what I'll do is
I'll steam a whole bunch

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.265 align:middle line:84%
of baby potatoes and some
broccoli, and I'll have this.

00:07:44.265 --> 00:07:45.640 align:middle line:84%
I'll just heat it
up in this pot.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.980 align:middle line:84%
I'll just put that in the
fridge when it's cooled down.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.313 align:middle line:84%
And when they come over for
dinner, I'll just heat it up

00:07:50.313 --> 00:07:51.570 align:middle line:90%
and I'll stir that actually.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:52.370 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.070 align:middle line:84%
That's another thing
you're going to do.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.770 align:middle line:84%
When you're heating it up in the
pot on the stove, get a whisk

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.103 align:middle line:84%
and just stay with it because
the cashew nuts will stick

00:07:59.103 --> 00:08:00.450 align:middle line:90%
to the bottom of this pot.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.978 align:middle line:84%
So you want to be really
careful just to stay with it

00:08:02.978 --> 00:08:05.020 align:middle line:84%
and just slowly heat it
up and just kind of whisk

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.460 align:middle line:90%
like this on a really low heat.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.515 align:middle line:84%
And just get it hot
enough that it doesn't--

00:08:08.515 --> 00:08:09.640 align:middle line:90%
you know, it's not boiling.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.765 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to bring
it back up to the boil.

00:08:10.765 --> 00:08:13.320 align:middle line:84%
You just want to get it
quite hot before the boil.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.256 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.256 --> 00:08:19.384 align:middle line:90%
It's that good.

00:08:19.384 --> 00:08:21.270 align:middle line:90%
It's that good.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:22.900 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:23.700 align:middle line:90%
I mean, look at me.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:24.680 align:middle line:90%
I can't stop.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.210 align:middle line:90%
It's so beautiful.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.050 align:middle line:84%
So a big bowl of
steamed veggies--

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.900 align:middle line:90%
look at me, a big bowl.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini,
carrots, baby potatoes--

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.590 align:middle line:84%
toss them in olive oil with
some parsley, salt and pepper,

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.880 align:middle line:84%
and then just pour this on there
and just sit that on a table

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.610 align:middle line:90%
and sit back and watch them.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.280 align:middle line:84%
They'll go, oh,
why is that green?

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.080 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:45.690 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy this.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:47.440 align:middle line:84%
This is just going to
cool down, and we'll

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.220 align:middle line:84%
heat that up later when my
family come over for dinner.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.350 align:middle line:90%
And stop, and action.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:55.960 align:middle line:90%
Voila.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.620 align:middle line:90%
Is it "vo-la" or "wo-la?"

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:58.420 align:middle line:90%
Voila.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.525 align:middle line:90%
Is it "wo-la"?

00:08:59.525 --> 00:09:00.325 align:middle line:90%
>> Voila.

00:09:00.325 --> 00:09:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>> "Vo-la."

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:01.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Voila.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:03.902 align:middle line:90%
>> Voila, yeah.

00:09:03.902 --> 00:09:05.980 align:middle line:90%
[VOCALIZING]

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:10.050 align:middle line:90%


00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.160 align:middle line:90%
"Parmi-jama?"

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Parmigiana.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>> "Parmi-jana."

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Parmigiana.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:16.090 align:middle line:90%
>> --giana, parmigiana.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:16.890 align:middle line:90%
Stop it.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:17.240 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:17.490 align:middle line:90%
Enough.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:18.090 align:middle line:90%
Shh!

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:18.890 align:middle line:90%
Quiet!
