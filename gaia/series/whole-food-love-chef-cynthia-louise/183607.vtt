[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.291 --> 00:00:12.530 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I love the idea of making
my own broth or my own stock

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.040 align:middle line:84%
or my own vegetable stock
or anything like that.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is a great recipe
that I stumbled across somehow.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.820 align:middle line:84%
We just threw
everything into a pot,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.870 align:middle line:84%
actually, one day on a
Heal Thyself program.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And this particular
dish was really

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.340 align:middle line:84%
healing to a lot of the clients
that were in a juice fast

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.280 align:middle line:90%
or in a healing crisis.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.560 align:middle line:84%
So this dish was
just extraordinary,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.410 align:middle line:84%
and it made a lot of sense
to me after I made it.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.270 align:middle line:84%
When I was making it,
I was, like, yeah,

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.980 align:middle line:84%
I'll just make some
broth, you know?

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.630 align:middle line:84%
But then when I
made it and had it,

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.910 align:middle line:90%
it was it was so extraordinary.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.640 align:middle line:84%
The word was about
town about this broth,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.620 align:middle line:84%
and everybody was
coming in for broth.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.520 align:middle line:90%
Trust me.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.657 align:middle line:84%
The staff from where I work
were coming in for broth.

00:01:01.657 --> 00:01:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Everyone was talking
about this broth.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.823 align:middle line:84%
So what I've got
here in front of me--

00:01:04.823 --> 00:01:07.880 align:middle line:84%
and just have a look at
these accessible ingredients,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.680 align:middle line:90%
so accessible.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.400 align:middle line:90%
It's just ridiculous.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.870 align:middle line:84%
So there's no fuss or anything
in running to a faraway land

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.660 align:middle line:90%
to get some obscure ingredient.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's really interesting
how something so deliciously

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.445 align:middle line:84%
grounding and packed full
of minerals can be so easy.

00:01:25.445 --> 00:01:28.070 align:middle line:84%
So all you're going to do-- and
I'm not going to peel anything.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
peel these carrots.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.490 align:middle line:84%
I am going to peel the
onions, but that's it.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.520 align:middle line:84%
So what you're after
is some lovely carrots.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And you're just going
to chop them into chunks

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.930 align:middle line:90%
like this, about 2 centimeters.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to just put
everything into my pot.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've got a
10-liter pot here.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.250 align:middle line:90%
You could have a 5-liter pot.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.310 align:middle line:90%
It would be totally fine.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.520 align:middle line:90%
Just cut back on the veggies.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.320 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.580 align:middle line:90%
The quantities really are--

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.423 align:middle line:84%
I like to use three to four
small Carrots it's kind of my--

00:01:59.423 --> 00:02:00.590 align:middle line:90%
some carrots are really big.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.840 align:middle line:90%
Some carrots are really small.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.550 align:middle line:84%
But these ones, three
to four carrots.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.540 align:middle line:90%
This is so easy.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.640 align:middle line:90%
It's such a beautiful recipe.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And then I've got an
onion, and I'm just

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.730 align:middle line:84%
going to chop it into
chunks like this, just

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.980 align:middle line:84%
nice, big chunks
straight into the pot.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.780 align:middle line:90%
Easy, isn't it, so far?

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.460 align:middle line:90%
This is such a nourishing meal.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Just makes you
feel really, truly

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.710 align:middle line:90%
humped from the inside out.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.317 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:02:28.317 --> 00:02:29.150 align:middle line:90%
So nice, big chunks.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.710 align:middle line:90%


00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.840 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.890 align:middle line:84%
The corn I'm just going
to chop into chunks.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you're
chopping corn like this,

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.980 align:middle line:84%
just put it on the chopping
board, and just do this.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:40.910 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.870 align:middle line:84%
So keep your hand
away and just do that.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.040 align:middle line:90%
It's really easy.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.940 align:middle line:90%
So that's going to go in.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.840 align:middle line:90%
Simply and deliciously easy.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.670 align:middle line:84%
I've got some potatoes
just washed, unpeeled,

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.160 align:middle line:90%
into large pieces like that.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.530 align:middle line:90%
I remember making this.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, I remember
thinking nothing of it.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.700 align:middle line:90%
It was really quite funny.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And then it just became
the greatest thing

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.810 align:middle line:90%
that ever had existed.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:15.860 align:middle line:90%
It was Cynthia's broth.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.467 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to cut the
mushrooms in half like that.

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:21.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm just using button mushrooms.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.620 align:middle line:84%
I find them really good for
this dish, actually, just

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.870 align:middle line:90%
little button mushrooms.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.650 align:middle line:90%
Do all of those.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.680 align:middle line:84%
What else can I say
about this broth, Scott?

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.130 align:middle line:90%


00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.627 align:middle line:90%
Why does it taste so good?

00:03:40.627 --> 00:03:41.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking to Scott here.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.650 align:middle line:90%
Why does it taste so good?

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.330 align:middle line:84%
You were one of the
people that ran in.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.497 align:middle line:84%
>> I was fasting when I
came off and had this broth.

00:03:46.497 --> 00:03:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>> He was fasting, and
he came off fasting,

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:49.650 align:middle line:90%
and he had this broth.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And it was like the
best thing I've ever had.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And then Nick came
in, my other friend,

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.920 align:middle line:90%
and kept wanting to have broth.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.720 align:middle line:90%
Where's the broth?

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.940 align:middle line:90%
Is there any broth today?

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.230 align:middle line:90%
It was like this frenzy.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.450 align:middle line:90%
It was really crazy.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.820 align:middle line:90%
So large chunks of zucchini.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.868 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.868 --> 00:04:09.350 align:middle line:84%
What a beautiful
zucchini that is.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.590 align:middle line:84%
I've got some garlic
that I've just peeled.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to do that to it.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.269 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.430 align:middle line:84%
The broccoli stalk-- just
large chunks of that.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.930 align:middle line:90%


00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to leave
this broccoli to a bit last

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.170 align:middle line:84%
so it doesn't fall
apart so much.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.760 align:middle line:84%
I've got some celery and some
parsley, so a bit of parsley.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.290 align:middle line:84%
All I'm going to do is just tear
it up and put it in like that.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.850 align:middle line:90%
I've got some celery.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.680 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is celery in Bali.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.620 align:middle line:90%
Check this out.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.420 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.030 align:middle line:84%
It's really-- it's quite
strong and celery smell.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.830 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.360 align:middle line:90%
But this is how it comes.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
chop this up roughly.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.250 align:middle line:90%
Amazing, right?

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.920 align:middle line:84%
We're more used to celery
being big, chunky pieces.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put a bay leaf
in, a couple of bay leaves.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.970 align:middle line:84%
This is like mother nature's
stock that I'm creating here.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to put some leeks.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Leeks are just going to
add that sweetness to this.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.020 align:middle line:84%
It's really quite
delicious, actually,

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.560 align:middle line:90%
really, really delicious.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.860 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.295 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you've got leeks like
this that are long and skinny,

00:05:20.295 --> 00:05:22.420 align:middle line:84%
all you want to do is make
sure you've washed them.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.240 align:middle line:84%
These have been washed
really well in here.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.070 align:middle line:84%
You've seen that in the
other recipes that I've done.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to--

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:28.670 align:middle line:90%
take a look.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to chop
them up into large chunks,

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.040 align:middle line:90%
just like this.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.550 align:middle line:84%
All the way through
right to the end.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.430 align:middle line:90%
Every piece of the leek is used.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.475 align:middle line:90%
This is a real--

00:05:43.475 --> 00:05:45.270 align:middle line:84%
we should call it
the mineral broth.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.610 align:middle line:90%
It's packed full of minerals.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.560 align:middle line:90%
Into here.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And the next step we're going to
do is fill this up with water.

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:58.110 align:middle line:90%


00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.180 align:middle line:84%
So I'm putting my hand
in here, and I just

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.860 align:middle line:84%
want to show you how
much water I need.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.590 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.870 align:middle line:90%
Right up to there.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is a good 8
liters of water in here.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.340 align:middle line:90%
Straight onto the stove.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.460 align:middle line:84%
The next thing I'm going to
do is add salt and pepper.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.350 align:middle line:90%
How much, you wonder?

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.050 align:middle line:90%
Good question.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to add some
now, and then I'm

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:25.770 align:middle line:90%
going to mix it and taste it.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.248 align:middle line:84%
And if I can taste salty
water, that's what I want.

00:06:28.248 --> 00:06:29.790 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to give
that a good mix.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:34.190 align:middle line:90%


00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.983 align:middle line:84%
Mixing this through, and
then I want to taste.

00:06:38.983 --> 00:06:40.150 align:middle line:90%
If I can taste salty water--

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.233 align:middle line:84%
I can't, really, so I need
a little bit more salt.

00:06:42.233 --> 00:06:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is how you know
how much salt to put in.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.870 align:middle line:84%
When I gave this recipe out to
the people in the Heal Thyself

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.247 align:middle line:84%
program, they all
messaged me and and go,

00:06:52.247 --> 00:06:53.080 align:middle line:90%
how much salt, Chef?

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.360 align:middle line:90%
How much salt?

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And what's empowering about
this is that they all went back

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.850 align:middle line:84%
to their kitchens, especially my
friend Danny, and he made this.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And he started to understand
how salt really plays

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.660 align:middle line:90%
a big part in making food.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.460 align:middle line:90%
So he put it in.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.740 align:middle line:90%
He stirred it.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.570 align:middle line:84%
He tasted it, and it
had salty water in it.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.178 align:middle line:84%
And he was like, ah, that's
the amount of salt I need.

00:07:16.178 --> 00:07:17.470 align:middle line:90%
And that's what you need to do.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.270 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.610 align:middle line:90%
Straight onto the stove on high.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.560 align:middle line:84%
You're going to bring
this up to the boil.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.368 align:middle line:84%
It's going to bubble away
for about half an hour

00:07:26.368 --> 00:07:27.910 align:middle line:84%
on a slow boil, and
then you're going

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.360 align:middle line:84%
to turn it on down to a
simmer for about three hours.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.780 align:middle line:90%
And then we'll come back to it.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:35.650 align:middle line:90%
This is beautiful.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.280 align:middle line:84%
It's been cooking for
a couple of hours.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And you want it to cook for at
least 2, 2 and 1/2, 3 hours.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.430 align:middle line:90%
So which one?

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.290 align:middle line:90%
2, 2 and 1/2, or 3?

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Look, I like to cook
until it's completely--

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.207 align:middle line:90%
the carrots are completely soft.

00:07:49.207 --> 00:07:50.290 align:middle line:90%
To me, that's what I want.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.380 align:middle line:84%
So I always go on the carrots,
and the potatoes and everything

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.440 align:middle line:90%
catch up.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.390 align:middle line:90%
It's just beautiful.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:56.260 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:05.210 align:middle line:84%
It's just yummy, gorgeous
broth, all yummy and delicious.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:11.800 align:middle line:84%
A bowl of this, whether you're
in a healing crisis or not--

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.446 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
initially it was made for--

00:08:14.446 --> 00:08:16.390 align:middle line:84%
for those that were
really, really,

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:21.280 align:middle line:84%
really quite sick in a
program called Heal Thyself.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And this was just
one of those moments

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.910 align:middle line:84%
where we created
something quite special.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:29.000 align:middle line:90%
It's just beautiful.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.179 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy this, truly enjoy it.

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:33.677 align:middle line:90%
It makes my mouth water.

00:08:33.677 --> 00:08:35.260 align:middle line:84%
It's like a color
from the inside out.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.169 align:middle line:84%
You feel really nourished after
you have something like this,

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:40.600 align:middle line:90%
really supported.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.400 align:middle line:90%
I have no words to say this.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.487 align:middle line:90%
Nibble on the corn.

00:08:43.487 --> 00:08:45.070 align:middle line:84%
Allow the corn to
cool down, actually,

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.840 align:middle line:90%
before you nibble on it.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, know that this
is a beautiful mineral--

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.450 align:middle line:90%
high mineral content broth.

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:53.890 align:middle line:90%
That's something quite special.

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Use it as a stock
as well, totally.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.960 align:middle line:90%
Definitely use it as a stock.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.970 align:middle line:90%
But that's it.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:02.393 align:middle line:84%
That's how you make a really
beautiful vegetable broth.

00:09:02.393 --> 00:09:04.810 align:middle line:84%
It's something where I just
want to curl up and go to bed.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.690 align:middle line:90%


00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:08.680 align:middle line:90%
Can you smell that?

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.700 align:middle line:90%
Can you guys smell that?

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>> It's amazing.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.100 align:middle line:90%


00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:18.430 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is-- ah.

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:21.285 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:09:21.285 --> 00:09:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>> And stop and action.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.220 align:middle line:90%
Voila.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.200 align:middle line:90%
Is it voila or wala?

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.000 align:middle line:90%
Voila?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000 align:middle line:90%
Is it voila?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Voila.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.692 align:middle line:90%
>> Voila.

00:09:31.692 --> 00:09:32.492 align:middle line:90%
Voila.

00:09:32.492 --> 00:09:40.520 align:middle line:90%


00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.400 align:middle line:90%
Parmigiana?

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Parmigiana.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Parmigiana.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:44.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Parmigiana.

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:45.825 align:middle line:90%
>> Parmigiana.

00:09:45.825 --> 00:09:46.680 align:middle line:90%
Parmigiana.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.500 align:middle line:90%
Stop it right now.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.300 align:middle line:90%
Shh!

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.850 align:middle line:90%
Quiet.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:53.003 align:middle line:90%
