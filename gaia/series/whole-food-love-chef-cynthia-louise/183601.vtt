00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.357 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.357 --> 00:00:12.530 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the great things all
my family and friends love is

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.990 align:middle line:90%
potato bake.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's always done with cream
from the supermarket, some sort

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.567 align:middle line:84%
of cheddar cheese, chicken
stock, and some garlic

00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:24.150 align:middle line:84%
and onion, I think,
and some potatoes,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.490 align:middle line:84%
and you whack it in the
tray and da, da, da.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I've come up with a
really different alternative

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.705 align:middle line:84%
for the dairy free people
out there in the world

00:00:29.705 --> 00:00:31.830 align:middle line:84%
and the kids that want to
have potato bake as well.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.640 align:middle line:90%
This is extraordinary.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.880 align:middle line:84%
I even surprised myself
when I first made it.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.980 align:middle line:84%
I actually made it
back at my mom's house

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.510 align:middle line:90%
with my girlfriend Courtney.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And when we knew the
dish was extraordinary

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.710 align:middle line:84%
is when we couldn't
get enough of it.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.250 align:middle line:84%
So we kept eating it
and eating and eating it

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.600 align:middle line:90%
after it was finished.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.850 align:middle line:90%
True story.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.380 align:middle line:84%
OK, preheat your
oven first to 170.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.790 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that's on.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And then let's get
straight to our cream,

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.120 align:middle line:90%
cream part of this potato bake.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.910 align:middle line:84%
So in a blender, you're
going to add some cashews.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.050 align:middle line:90%


00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.480 align:middle line:90%
That's quite a few there.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.890 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm going to add some water.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.840 align:middle line:90%


00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And we're just going to blend
this until it's very creamy.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.550 align:middle line:84%
What I'm after in
this consistency

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.000 align:middle line:84%
is I don't want to feel
a sandiness of nuts

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.350 align:middle line:90%
between my fingers.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.280 align:middle line:90%
Really important.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.910 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.493 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to stop and start
the machine just to see where

00:01:31.493 --> 00:01:33.080 align:middle line:90%
we're at for that sandiness.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.880 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:41.565 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.565 --> 00:01:42.365 align:middle line:90%
OK, lovely.

00:01:42.365 --> 00:01:44.820 align:middle line:90%
All right, let's have a look.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.945 align:middle line:84%
This is what I'm after,
this really creamy texture.

00:01:48.945 --> 00:01:50.385 align:middle line:84%
Now it's not
seasoned or anything.

00:01:50.385 --> 00:01:52.010 align:middle line:84%
So there's no salt
and pepper in there.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.468 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
that in a minute.

00:01:53.468 --> 00:01:55.520 align:middle line:84%
The next point of this--
so that's my cream.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.620 align:middle line:90%
That's the alternative to dairy.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.350 align:middle line:90%
Very good fats in there.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Very, very, very,
very good fats.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.910 align:middle line:84%
OK, all right, next thing I
want to do is cut my potatoes.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.620 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm a family as well.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.790 align:middle line:90%
I've got people coming over.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:14.595 align:middle line:90%
I'm busy.

00:02:14.595 --> 00:02:16.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
be using a knife.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.390 align:middle line:90%
Takes too long.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.400 align:middle line:90%
These are great.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.600 align:middle line:84%
These food processes
are so great.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.450 align:middle line:84%
So you get the blade,
the cutting blade part

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.350 align:middle line:90%
of your food processor.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.240 align:middle line:84%
This one's a grader and a
cutter, so that goes that way.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.040 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.980 align:middle line:84%
It goes this way,
tricky business.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.950 align:middle line:90%
Great machines.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.530 align:middle line:84%
All right, I've
got some potatoes

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.460 align:middle line:84%
that I washed just before
we started filming.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.610 align:middle line:90%
So they're all done.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.200 align:middle line:90%
Quick recipe, yeah?

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.220 align:middle line:90%
Very quick.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.200 align:middle line:84%
I need a bowl, so I
can put all this into.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.780 align:middle line:90%


00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.500 align:middle line:84%
That's all I'm going to do is
run my potatoes through here.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Now if they don't fit
like this, all you do

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.349 align:middle line:90%
is just slice them in half.

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:06.140 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.085 align:middle line:90%
We want them nice slices.

00:03:09.085 --> 00:03:09.885 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:03:09.885 --> 00:03:12.390 align:middle line:90%


00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.350 align:middle line:90%
Keeping the skins on.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.550 align:middle line:90%


00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.650 align:middle line:90%
And one more.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.660 align:middle line:90%
How quick's this?

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.890 align:middle line:90%


00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.160 align:middle line:90%
It's the chef's cheat.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.273 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.273 --> 00:03:32.730 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, fabulous.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:33.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.880 align:middle line:90%
Straight into here.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.120 align:middle line:84%
All the same size,
oh, it makes me happy.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.541 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:41.541 --> 00:03:43.950 align:middle line:90%
Let's get this back on.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:44.750 align:middle line:90%
So that's done.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.990 align:middle line:84%
So now I need some
mushrooms and some capsicum,

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.330 align:middle line:90%
just for extra plant, you know?

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.320 align:middle line:84%
Just for extra
goodness in the world.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.290 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to do the
same thing actually

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.990 align:middle line:84%
with the mushrooms as I
did with the potatoes.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.132 align:middle line:84%
Then I'm going to
wash the machine.

00:04:03.132 --> 00:04:06.450 align:middle line:90%
Just put it straight through.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.530 align:middle line:90%
I got sliced mushrooms.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.330 align:middle line:90%
Just lost one.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:16.579 align:middle line:90%


00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's going
to go into here.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.235 align:middle line:84%
I love how this is
all the same size.

00:04:22.235 --> 00:04:27.100 align:middle line:84%
It just makes the cooking
process evenly cooked.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.746 align:middle line:90%
Fabulous.

00:04:28.746 --> 00:04:31.190 align:middle line:90%
Put that over there.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.325 align:middle line:90%
Get this out of the way.

00:04:32.325 --> 00:04:36.020 align:middle line:90%


00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.980 align:middle line:90%
All right, now to my capsicum.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.485 align:middle line:90%
The best way to save on--

00:04:41.485 --> 00:04:43.110 align:middle line:84%
the best way not to
waste a capsicum is

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.410 align:middle line:90%
do exactly what I just did.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And then you can just take out
all this situation like this.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.910 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.040 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.925 align:middle line:84%
Now I just want
julienne slices of this.

00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:04.120 align:middle line:90%


00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.630 align:middle line:90%
Nice, sharp knife, yeah?

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.850 align:middle line:90%
Just cutting through that.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And then just chop them
in half again and again.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.070 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.070 align:middle line:90%
Quickest potato bake in town.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.370 align:middle line:84%
Bits of garlic, just for that
flavor, about three cloves,

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.200 align:middle line:90%
I reckon, nice big ones.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.590 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I might
put four in there.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.390 align:middle line:90%
So just smash them.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.530 align:middle line:90%


00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:40.650 align:middle line:90%
You know what that does?

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.530 align:middle line:84%
This is easy to
get the skins off.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.030 align:middle line:84%
All it does is make it easy,
so I can just slice them up.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.480 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.070 align:middle line:84%
In the raw food program
I have, we use garlic.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.453 align:middle line:90%
And I do the same thing.

00:05:54.453 --> 00:05:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Smash it, but I throw
the whole thing in there

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.740 align:middle line:90%
because that's organic garlic.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.820 align:middle line:84%
They've been washed,
cleaned very well.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.013 align:middle line:84%
And the skin's holding
onto nutrients.

00:06:04.013 --> 00:06:05.430 align:middle line:84%
So throughout that
program, you'll

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:11.601 align:middle line:84%
see me popping in the whole
garlic, skins and all.

00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:14.580 align:middle line:84%
All right, so just running my
knife through, as you can see,

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:20.610 align:middle line:84%
just chopping that fairly fine,
not too fine and not too chunky

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:21.450 align:middle line:90%
just in between.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:30.874 align:middle line:90%


00:06:30.874 --> 00:06:32.370 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to pop
that into there.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.410 align:middle line:90%


00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:39.210 align:middle line:90%
Lovely bubbly.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.370 align:middle line:84%
All right, next thing
we're going to do

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.870 align:middle line:90%
is get our baking tray.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.120 align:middle line:90%
Any size baking tray you like.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.390 align:middle line:84%
I want something a little bit
deep instead of quite fat.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.030 align:middle line:90%
So I want this to be quite deep.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.740 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to use this one.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:59.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, so salt and pepper and
some lovely fresh ground

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.435 align:middle line:84%
pepper out of my
mortar and pestle.

00:07:02.435 --> 00:07:03.840 align:middle line:90%
Mortar and pestle, that's it.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:06.110 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:11.220 align:middle line:90%


00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.640 align:middle line:84%
All right, I've
got a bigger bowl

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.710 align:middle line:84%
because I've got
quite a lot here.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.140 align:middle line:84%
I love how all the potatoes
are all the same size.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.935 align:middle line:84%
OK, here comes my
wet mix of cream.

00:07:20.935 --> 00:07:26.270 align:middle line:90%


00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Get all that goodness
out of there.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.540 align:middle line:90%


00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:36.400 align:middle line:84%
All right, now I'm just going
to mix this with my hands,

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.430 align:middle line:84%
making sure that
garlic is spread out,

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.380 align:middle line:84%
making sure the potatoes
are all covered.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.187 align:middle line:84%
And they're not sitting, not
clumping together like this,

00:07:46.187 --> 00:07:48.270 align:middle line:84%
just making sure everything's
covered in this mix.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:57.150 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:middle line:90%
OK, now get this out of the way.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Let's pack our tin with
this beautiful mixture.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm just going
to press this down,

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:12.520 align:middle line:90%
so everything is even on one.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.020 align:middle line:84%
Every time I put something in,
I'm just going to dump it in.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to push it down,
making sure everything's even,

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.240 align:middle line:90%
there's no holes there.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.240 align:middle line:90%
Garlic coming through.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.815 align:middle line:84%
It's really beautiful,
really beautiful.

00:08:24.815 --> 00:08:32.250 align:middle line:90%


00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.039 align:middle line:84%
OK, now for this
beautiful liquid.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:36.841 align:middle line:90%
This is the gold right here.

00:08:36.841 --> 00:08:38.549 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to be
wasting any of this.

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:40.620 align:middle line:90%
This is the important part.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.755 align:middle line:90%
This is the cream.

00:08:42.755 --> 00:08:44.370 align:middle line:90%
God, I love this big bowl.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:47.232 align:middle line:90%


00:08:47.232 --> 00:08:50.880 align:middle line:84%
A bit awkward, but I'm going to
do it as gracefully as I can.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.430 align:middle line:90%


00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.650 align:middle line:90%
Family dinner tonight.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.325 align:middle line:84%
Whole family's
coming over tonight.

00:08:58.325 --> 00:09:02.385 align:middle line:90%
All right, now pushing it down.

00:09:02.385 --> 00:09:05.010 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing Heather taught me
with her potato bike actually.

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:09.460 align:middle line:84%
She said, make sure you push it
down, Cynthia, with your hands.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes, Heather.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.570 align:middle line:90%


00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:15.150 align:middle line:90%
OK, wash my hands.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And I want a bit
of color on there.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:21.030 align:middle line:84%
So you can use paprika or you
can use some cayenne pepper

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:25.660 align:middle line:84%
if you want that hot spiky,
the hot heat coming through.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:29.970 align:middle line:84%
I've got some fresh ground chili
that I did earlier actually.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to
get a little sieve.

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:34.500 align:middle line:84%
So I've just freshly
ground some dried chili.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.460 align:middle line:84%
You can use paprika, totally,
whatever, whatever you want.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:43.500 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to pop this
on top just for a bit of color.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And I do want a little bit
of heat coming through.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:47.990 align:middle line:90%
Is that lovely?

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:51.600 align:middle line:90%
Freshly ground chili, hey?

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.690 align:middle line:90%
It worked.

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Just give it a wee
shake to make sure

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.790 align:middle line:84%
that liquid's kind of getting
in amongst those potatoes.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:01.590 align:middle line:90%
Really important.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:05.580 align:middle line:84%
All right, so the foil is just
going to lock in the steam,

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.340 align:middle line:84%
so that the cream
doesn't dry out.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:12.420 align:middle line:90%
And the potatoes cook quicker.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.980 align:middle line:84%
So you're just going to
put this over the top.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And you want to be really quite
firm here trapping in that air.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.490 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
let in the air.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:30.560 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] You really want that
to act as a steaming technique.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to pop
this into the oven.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:36.350 align:middle line:84%
So nice and tight
around those edges.

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.850 align:middle line:90%


00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.540 align:middle line:90%
OK, all right.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.596 align:middle line:90%
Nice hot oven, straight in.

00:10:45.596 --> 00:10:47.300 align:middle line:84%
All right, the
kitchen is smelling

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:54.850 align:middle line:84%
of garlic and capsicum and
mushrooms of potato bake glory.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:56.840 align:middle line:84%
All right, this has
got to be ready by now.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.720 align:middle line:90%


00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.570 align:middle line:84%
Now when you take this
off, just be careful,

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.670 align:middle line:90%
yeah, because of the stain.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:09.590 align:middle line:84%
So you want to really just be
mindful of what you're doing.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:11.155 align:middle line:84%
Just pull it back
towards you and let

00:11:11.155 --> 00:11:13.245 align:middle line:90%
that steam just come up.

00:11:13.245 --> 00:11:14.120 align:middle line:90%
And there we have it.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.560 align:middle line:90%


00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.360 align:middle line:90%
It's good.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.140 align:middle line:90%
It's good.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, beautiful.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:26.480 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, perfect.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.060 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to
let this sit just

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:35.050 align:middle line:84%
let those flavors marry and
relax into the creamy sauce

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:36.082 align:middle line:90%
that it is.

00:11:36.082 --> 00:11:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to serve
it up tonight for dinner.

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:39.910 align:middle line:90%
It's really that simple.

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:41.770 align:middle line:84%
Let's have a little
bit of a look

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.500 align:middle line:84%
see at what this
looks like on a plate.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.480 align:middle line:90%
What an easy dish, hey?

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:52.180 align:middle line:84%
What a great way to
recreate one of those really

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.545 align:middle line:90%
classic, classic dishes.

00:11:53.545 --> 00:11:55.820 align:middle line:90%


00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:56.620 align:middle line:90%
Very creamy.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.410 align:middle line:90%


00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:00.970 align:middle line:90%
Very soft.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.000 align:middle line:90%
Very potatoey.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.500 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:07.450 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:08.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:16.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm just trying to be sensible,
but it's really yummy and hot.

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:17.610 align:middle line:90%
Mmm.

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.193 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you get
that salt and pepper

00:12:19.193 --> 00:12:21.630 align:middle line:84%
right in the beginning, yeah,
because that just brings out

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:22.430 align:middle line:90%
flavor.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:27.660 align:middle line:84%
This is-- you know what,
make it and comment below.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.672 align:middle line:84%
This is full, creamy
deliciousness.

00:12:30.672 --> 00:12:32.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't even-- it
doesn't even feel

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:33.870 align:middle line:90%
like there's no cream in it.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:36.180 align:middle line:90%
Like somebody wouldn't know.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.362 align:middle line:84%
All these good bits, see
all these good bits here?

00:12:39.362 --> 00:12:40.320 align:middle line:90%
You want to keep those.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.660 align:middle line:90%
All right, there we go.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.210 align:middle line:90%
Potato bake without dairy.

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:46.320 align:middle line:90%
Genius.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.710 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy this.

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:47.820 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm very excited
because it's finished,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.468 align:middle line:90%
and we can get to eat it now.

00:12:50.468 --> 00:12:53.018 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.018 --> 00:12:54.410 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:56.436 align:middle line:90%
That was quick.

00:12:56.436 --> 00:12:58.760 align:middle line:90%
La, la, la, la.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.850 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:03.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.630 align:middle line:90%
It's really good.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Give it a big hand to this
sweet potato, everybody.

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.111 align:middle line:90%
The star of the show.

00:13:12.111 --> 00:13:13.065 align:middle line:90%
Hallelujah.

00:13:13.065 --> 00:13:16.890 align:middle line:90%


00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:20.170 align:middle line:84%
You think this is
funny, you come do this.

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:22.603 align:middle line:90%
