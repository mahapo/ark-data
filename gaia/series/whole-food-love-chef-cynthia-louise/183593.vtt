00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.265 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's have a really quick,
fast-paced breakfast with oats

00:00:16.265 --> 00:00:17.390 align:middle line:90%
that we don't have to cook.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.400 align:middle line:90%
And let's use the whole oat.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I mean
about the whole oat is

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.230 align:middle line:84%
we know these as whole oats,
which they are because they're

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.900 align:middle line:90%
still pressed, crushed oats.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.700 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.507 align:middle line:90%
Oat groats.

00:00:31.507 --> 00:00:32.840 align:middle line:90%
So we're not going to use those.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.000 align:middle line:84%
We'll use those
in another recipe.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.700 align:middle line:84%
But we'll use the whole oat,
which is something different,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.500 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.810 align:middle line:84%
It's good to keep-- you've got
to mix it up a bit these days.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.990 align:middle line:90%
So this is the oak groat.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.970 align:middle line:90%
It looks like wheat.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.020 align:middle line:84%
So all they do is they get
these gorgeous little isms.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.980 align:middle line:90%
And they press them.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you'd
get those rolled--

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.620 align:middle line:90%
pressed oats, or steel cut oats.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.807 align:middle line:84%
So all I've done is I've
taken these oats, oat groats.

00:01:02.807 --> 00:01:04.599 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why they
call them oat groats.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:05.750 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of weird.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And I've just soaked
them overnight in water.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.218 align:middle line:84%
Really, really,
really, really simple.

00:01:11.218 --> 00:01:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm just going
to rinse them, just

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.690 align:middle line:90%
really quickly, not a big rinse.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.910 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be rinsed
thoroughly, just a quick--

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:19.710 align:middle line:90%
that's it.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.420 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.960 align:middle line:84%
It was my mum that told me
that when you soak grains,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.880 align:middle line:84%
especially oats
and wheat and that,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.860 align:middle line:84%
it's the liquid in
there that's really

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.930 align:middle line:90%
quite valuable in nutrition.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.730 align:middle line:90%
Mum knows.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.090 align:middle line:84%
So all I'm going to do,
soak those over night.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.778 align:middle line:90%
It's really simple.

00:01:39.778 --> 00:01:41.570 align:middle line:84%
All I'm going to do is
add them to my bowl.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.712 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.712 --> 00:01:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm just going
to add things to there,

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:47.930 align:middle line:90%
so some sunflower seeds.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.930 align:middle line:90%
You can add anything you like.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:58.010 align:middle line:84%
This breakfast makes you
chew big time, like, proper.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.170 align:middle line:84%
It slows you down,
which is awesome.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.370 align:middle line:84%
I developed this breakfast
for that reason--

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.580 align:middle line:84%
all those rushing
humans out there--

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.190 align:middle line:84%
because it really--
you've got to chew it.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.440 align:middle line:90%
It's really, really important.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.440 align:middle line:90%
You can put anything in.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to some psyllium
in there because I have it.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.060 align:middle line:90%
You can put hemp seeds in here.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.270 align:middle line:84%
You can put some
dried fruit in here.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.870 align:middle line:84%
I've just gotta
see what I've got.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.700 align:middle line:84%
This is what it's all about,
just see what you have.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.825 align:middle line:90%
I've got some goji berries.

00:02:23.825 --> 00:02:28.120 align:middle line:84%
A few of those will do just
for color, not too many.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.110 align:middle line:90%
What else do I have?

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I've got cranberries
at the back here.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.710 align:middle line:90%
Just a few, not too many.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.778 align:middle line:90%


00:02:36.778 --> 00:02:37.820 align:middle line:90%
I've got some hemp seeds.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.680 align:middle line:90%


00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.600 align:middle line:90%
It's like bird food.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.470 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.228 align:middle line:90%
Bloody good for you though.

00:02:47.228 --> 00:02:49.770 align:middle line:84%
All right, let me just check my
list, de, de, de, de, de, de,

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.300 align:middle line:84%
de, de, de, de,
de, da, da, da, da.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.100 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm going to
put some fruit in there.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's whatever
I've got left over

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.013 align:middle line:84%
from our smoothie situation
that we were doing.

00:03:01.013 --> 00:03:02.930 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to put some
strawberries in there

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:03.763 align:middle line:90%
because I have them.

00:03:03.763 --> 00:03:07.210 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.710 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
love this breakfast.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.255 align:middle line:84%
This gets you-- this
breakfast brings you

00:03:13.255 --> 00:03:15.130 align:middle line:84%
to the present moment
because, I'll tell you,

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.480 align:middle line:90%
it makes you chew.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.580 align:middle line:90%
You've got to chew it.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.180 align:middle line:84%
Really easy, really
simple breakfast to make.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.040 align:middle line:84%
I've actually put this
in a jar and taken

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.620 align:middle line:84%
it to work with me, which
is a good tip, actually.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.205 align:middle line:90%
You can do that.

00:03:28.205 --> 00:03:29.005 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:03:29.005 --> 00:03:32.170 align:middle line:90%


00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.490 align:middle line:90%
Maybe some-- I think that's it.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a bit of lemon
rind because we have it.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.820 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.080 align:middle line:84%
It's just because
it's in front of me.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.372 align:middle line:90%
I'm just adding to this recipe.

00:03:42.372 --> 00:03:46.080 align:middle line:90%


00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.090 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to add
some coconut water

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.560 align:middle line:90%
because I have it.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.300 align:middle line:90%
You can just totally add water.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.092 align:middle line:84%
Or you could add a but
milk if you want to.

00:03:54.092 --> 00:03:57.910 align:middle line:84%
If you want to keep it nut-free,
don't add the nut milk.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.140 align:middle line:90%
And now, I'm going to add some--

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.980 align:middle line:90%
a drizzle of honey.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.040 align:middle line:90%
Running that honey.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.310 align:middle line:90%


00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.140 align:middle line:84%
I love it in Indonesia
because we get--

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.300 align:middle line:84%
everything comes in
these glass bottles.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.100 align:middle line:90%
And it's awesome.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.180 align:middle line:90%
You get to recycle them.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.300 align:middle line:90%
It's so great.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:21.600 align:middle line:90%


00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.050 align:middle line:90%
Now, I want a pinch of salt--

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.560 align:middle line:84%
yes, salt. Salt in oats,
it brings out flavor.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.240 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to put
that around the side there.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.320 align:middle line:90%
I'll take that off there.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.270 align:middle line:90%
Can you see that?

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.230 align:middle line:90%
Really easy.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by this
makes you chew, it does.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.000 align:middle line:90%
It makes you chew.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.860 align:middle line:90%


00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.160 align:middle line:90%
They are soft.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.590 align:middle line:90%
You know, they're not hard.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.710 align:middle line:84%
But they-- but
they make you chew.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:57.520 align:middle line:90%


00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.440 align:middle line:90%
Which is good.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.030 align:middle line:90%
Chewing is good.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.260 align:middle line:90%
There's no teeth past here.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.800 align:middle line:90%


00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.780 align:middle line:84%
So during these ones, it helps
the stomach acids break down

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:14.170 align:middle line:84%
food, which is like one of those
inventions where they're-- see,

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm still chewing.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.460 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.470 align:middle line:84%
One of those inventions
where you got to get present,

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.270 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.070 align:middle line:84%
You just really
got to get present.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.880 align:middle line:84%
The flavor that's
coming out of here,

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.880 align:middle line:84%
it tastes like a
bunch of muesli.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Exactly the same
flavor as these ones.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.830 align:middle line:90%


00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.280 align:middle line:90%
Really different, though.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.260 align:middle line:84%
They have that--
they have that--

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.160 align:middle line:90%


00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.360 align:middle line:90%
what's the word?

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.210 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Guts to it, earthiness
to it, you know?

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.340 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.560 align:middle line:90%
Put this in a jar.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.308 align:middle line:84%
Screw it on, and
get off to work.

00:05:59.308 --> 00:06:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And if you're on the train--
look at me, still chewing.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.250 align:middle line:90%


00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.410 align:middle line:84%
If you're on a train
or a bus, just eat it.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And just chew away, and
then all of a sudden,

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.100 align:middle line:84%
you've eaten an
amazing breakfast.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And this really fills
you up, this breakfast.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.240 align:middle line:90%
And any fruit you like.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.490 align:middle line:84%
It's actually really nice with
the strawberries on there.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And the coconut
water is good too.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.160 align:middle line:90%
OK, voila.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.498 align:middle line:90%
Oat groats.
