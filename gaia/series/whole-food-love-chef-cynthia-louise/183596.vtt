00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>> What I love about living
in Indonesia is the flavor,

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.910 align:middle line:84%
smack in your face flavor
hits that you get from garlic,

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.100 align:middle line:84%
and ginger, and turmeric,
and things like that.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.750 align:middle line:90%
I love it so much, actually.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.710 align:middle line:90%
This is a great recipe.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.150 align:middle line:90%
It's my version of gado-gado.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.660 align:middle line:90%
It's easy.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.460 align:middle line:90%
It's simple.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.630 align:middle line:84%
The sauce is divine and
is to die for, and very,

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.454 align:middle line:90%
very, very simple.

00:00:31.454 --> 00:00:32.254 align:middle line:90%
Almond butter.

00:00:32.254 --> 00:00:35.240 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to put all my
sauce ingredients in here

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.600 align:middle line:84%
before I start on to the next
phase of this particular dish.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.040 align:middle line:84%
I do, on the other hand,
have my steamer boiling,

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.920 align:middle line:84%
ready to go for my
spuds and my veggies.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.160 align:middle line:90%
So that's just going.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Sesame seed oil and some soy.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.753 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to need some ginger.

00:00:51.753 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:90%
Just a little bit of ginger.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.090 align:middle line:90%
I've got some here, actually.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And some cayenne
pepper for that heat.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
put chili in this.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.910 align:middle line:90%
It's very different.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:58.993 align:middle line:90%
So a little bit of ginger.

00:00:58.993 --> 00:01:01.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to pop
it in just like that.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.660 align:middle line:90%
And I need some almond butter.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.740 align:middle line:84%
That's going to act
as my peanut sauce--

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.460 align:middle line:90%
as my peanut alternative, sorry.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.100 align:middle line:90%


00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.160 align:middle line:90%
Yum, this is beautiful.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.325 align:middle line:84%
I make my own almond butter
in one of the videos.

00:01:20.325 --> 00:01:21.810 align:middle line:84%
In another program
that I'm doing,

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.000 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you how
to make nut butters.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.140 align:middle line:90%
So that's there.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have to
put some soy in here,

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.872 align:middle line:90%
and some sesame seed oil.

00:01:34.872 --> 00:01:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Geez, I'm fumbling
my words today.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:45.700 align:middle line:90%


00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.500 align:middle line:90%
And some water.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.813 align:middle line:84%
I just want some water to
get this blade to go around.

00:01:49.813 --> 00:01:50.730 align:middle line:90%
I want it to be saucy.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't want it to be too thick.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.890 align:middle line:90%
So follow the recipe, yes?

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.145 align:middle line:90%


00:01:59.145 --> 00:02:04.292 align:middle line:84%
OK, on low, and then
building your way up.

[MACHINE ROARS]

00:02:08.684 --> 00:02:12.430 align:middle line:90%


00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.230 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.272 align:middle line:90%
Let's see where we're at.

00:02:14.272 --> 00:02:16.610 align:middle line:90%


00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.282 align:middle line:90%
Mmm, it's good.

00:02:19.282 --> 00:02:23.746 align:middle line:90%
[MACHINE ROARS]

00:02:23.746 --> 00:02:28.720 align:middle line:90%


00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.620 align:middle line:84%
I feel like it needs a
little bit more ginger.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.340 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't put so much
in there just then.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.010 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to cut a
couple of slices of this.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.970 align:middle line:90%
Pop that in there.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you like your
satay sauce sweet,

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.214 align:middle line:84%
by all means add some
maple syrup or some honey.

00:02:48.214 --> 00:02:52.430 align:middle line:90%
[MACHINE ROARS]

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.385 align:middle line:90%
Actually, I think I might.

00:02:54.385 --> 00:02:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Because we have a few people
here that like it sweet.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.970 align:middle line:90%
So just a touch of that.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:00.928 align:middle line:90%
Now, you don't have to.

00:03:00.928 --> 00:03:03.850 align:middle line:90%
This is totally up to you, yes?

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.120 align:middle line:90%
Ease and flow with cooking.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.430 align:middle line:90%
Just make it happen.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.070 align:middle line:90%
Very, very easy.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.734 align:middle line:84%
So back onto low,
and then up to high.

00:03:10.734 --> 00:03:14.430 align:middle line:90%
[MACHINE ROARS]

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.230 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.770 align:middle line:90%
And we're done.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.687 align:middle line:84%
And one more taste just
to see where we're at.

00:03:17.687 --> 00:03:20.270 align:middle line:90%


00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.490 align:middle line:90%
Lovely.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.802 align:middle line:84%
I made the sauce for my
girlfriend the other day.

00:03:23.802 --> 00:03:25.760 align:middle line:84%
She was having rice paper
rolls, and this sauce

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.380 align:middle line:84%
is just beautiful
as a dipping source.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.360 align:middle line:84%
Really stunning,
really full flavor.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.470 align:middle line:84%
The almond butter
acts as the peanuts.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.785 align:middle line:90%
It's just beautiful.

00:03:34.785 --> 00:03:37.635 align:middle line:90%


00:03:37.635 --> 00:03:41.030 align:middle line:90%
Oh, look, I'm surrounded by--

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.215 align:middle line:90%
I'm surrounded by people.

00:03:42.215 --> 00:03:44.550 align:middle line:90%


00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.350 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.750 align:middle line:90%


00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.070 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.670 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put
that aside, and we're

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.820 align:middle line:84%
going to get straight
onto these veggies.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I'm after
with these veggies

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.410 align:middle line:84%
is not big chunks of
it, because I want

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.570 align:middle line:90%
this to cook quite quickly.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.570 align:middle line:90%
So a couple of potatoes.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:06.620 align:middle line:90%
Just wash them carefully.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.720 align:middle line:84%
Organic, yes, definitely
with potatoes.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.170 align:middle line:90%
Really, really important.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.870 align:middle line:90%
It is definitely most--

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.580 align:middle line:84%
one of the most
dirty dozen out there

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.170 align:middle line:84%
with chemicals from the
fertilizers, pesticides,

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.970 align:middle line:90%
the whole bit.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.870 align:middle line:84%
So just be really
mindful about that.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.792 align:middle line:84%
If I wanted big-- if I
was to have big chunks,

00:04:22.792 --> 00:04:24.000 align:middle line:90%
it would take longer to cook.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.792 align:middle line:84%
So I want quite thin
chunks, because I want

00:04:25.792 --> 00:04:27.020 align:middle line:90%
this to cook really quickly.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.820 align:middle line:90%
We're hungry.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.240 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's here
today, so I need

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.407 align:middle line:90%
to get this cooking quickly.

00:04:30.407 --> 00:04:32.623 align:middle line:84%
So as you are at home,
you've just worked 12 hours,

00:04:32.623 --> 00:04:34.790 align:middle line:84%
and you've got home and you
want things to hurry up.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.510 align:middle line:84%
So kind of looking
like chips, and then

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:39.580 align:middle line:90%
cut them in half again.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.747 align:middle line:84%
So like that, and then that
will cook quite quickly.

00:04:41.747 --> 00:04:43.880 align:middle line:90%


00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Try and get them the same size,
people, not like the chef here.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.030 align:middle line:90%


00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.090 align:middle line:84%
You can cut these into
quarter-sized pieces

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.890 align:middle line:90%
if you want.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.220 align:middle line:84%
But like I said,
we've got people here.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.450 align:middle line:90%
People are hungry.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't have time to wait
for big chunks of potato

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.070 align:middle line:90%
to steam through.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.490 align:middle line:84%
So just running my knife
through all of this.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.520 align:middle line:90%
There's a big one there.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.450 align:middle line:90%
OK, straight into the steamer.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Just plonk them in
and just cook them

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.110 align:middle line:84%
till they're
actually cooked, yes?

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.910 align:middle line:90%
Not mush.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.950 align:middle line:84%
We want them to be
held together still.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.200 align:middle line:84%
So you want to be able to
put your fork through there

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.367 align:middle line:90%
and the fork can go through.

00:05:22.367 --> 00:05:23.700 align:middle line:90%
It's not raw.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.050 align:middle line:90%
But I'll show you in a minute.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.850 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:26.870 align:middle line:90%
Spuds are on.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.130 align:middle line:90%
Now, my eggs have been--

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.838 align:middle line:84%
I boiled them previously,
because I'm not

00:05:29.838 --> 00:05:31.910 align:middle line:84%
going to boil them in
front of you, clearly.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.993 align:middle line:84%
They take between-- well,
these are really little,

00:05:33.993 --> 00:05:36.050 align:middle line:84%
so these took 3 and
1/2 minutes, 4 minutes.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Cold water, bringing it up
to the boil and timing it.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.430 align:middle line:90%
That's all I did.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get the rest of
my veggies out of this fridge.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Now I've got some
wombok cabbage here,

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.767 align:middle line:84%
which is a Chinese cabbage,
Napa cabbage, whatever

00:05:52.767 --> 00:05:53.600 align:middle line:90%
you want to call it.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.308 align:middle line:84%
I mean, now whatever
you want to call it,

00:05:55.308 --> 00:05:59.210 align:middle line:84%
but different areas around the
world call it different names.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.530 align:middle line:90%
But I know it as wombok.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.230 align:middle line:90%
Americans know it as Napa.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.440 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to
get this like this.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.180 align:middle line:90%
These are beautiful leaves.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.970 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Now I just want to
run my knife through.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.100 align:middle line:84%
I have washed this before,
so it's all ready to go.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.753 align:middle line:90%
That's big chunks.

00:06:19.753 --> 00:06:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to run
it across there like that.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.770 align:middle line:90%


00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And push that to the
side in a little pile.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.370 align:middle line:90%
Now I've got my cori--

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.170 align:middle line:90%
broccoli.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.530 align:middle line:90%
Coriander.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.480 align:middle line:84%
Once again, I'm cutting them
up into pieces that will make--

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.070 align:middle line:90%
that will steam quicker.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.750 align:middle line:90%
I want this to--

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:47.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to wait.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:48.930 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that's ready.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.850 align:middle line:90%


00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.710 align:middle line:84%
So the harder vegetables
are going first,

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.810 align:middle line:90%
like this-- like the potato.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to layer on after that.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:09.122 align:middle line:84%
So just getting my little
baby organic cauliflower.

00:07:09.122 --> 00:07:10.080 align:middle line:90%
I need a smaller knife.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.454 align:middle line:90%


00:07:13.454 --> 00:07:16.530 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Cut them down if
they look too big.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:23.090 align:middle line:90%


00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.802 align:middle line:90%
Break them up.

00:07:24.802 --> 00:07:25.602 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:25.602 --> 00:07:29.950 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put this
cabbage back into here

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.410 align:middle line:90%
so it's out of my way.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:38.266 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to go on
last, because this is leafy.

00:07:38.266 --> 00:07:40.380 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.520 align:middle line:90%
This is leafy.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And I want these
ones to go in first.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:44.840 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:50.070 align:middle line:90%


00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can cut these
into sticks, like this.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.490 align:middle line:84%
Or you can just leave
them on an angle.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.160 align:middle line:90%
Whatever suits.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.400 align:middle line:90%
Now I've got a zucchini.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.858 align:middle line:84%
So I'll just use half of that
because it's quite a big one.

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:08.310 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.810 align:middle line:84%
This is not going to take long
to cook either, the zucchini.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:11.685 align:middle line:90%
So they're going to--

00:08:11.685 --> 00:08:13.000 align:middle line:90%
it's going to go in with this.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.470 align:middle line:90%
So I want it to be--

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:18.610 align:middle line:84%
I think I might have
half rounds on this one.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.826 align:middle line:90%


00:08:21.826 --> 00:08:22.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.495 align:middle line:90%
Softer veggies, harder veggies.

00:08:24.495 --> 00:08:27.070 align:middle line:90%


00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.260 align:middle line:84%
All right, let's just
check on these spuds.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.039 align:middle line:84%
Spuds-- Australian
term for potato.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:33.909 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:35.710 align:middle line:90%
My fork is just going in.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:37.070 align:middle line:90%
So they're not quite cooked.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I'm going
to add my harder veggies,

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:43.330 align:middle line:84%
like the carrots and the
broccoli and the cauliflower,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:44.830 align:middle line:90%
just on top.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:48.040 align:middle line:90%
Perfection.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.590 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to
let that steam for--

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.410 align:middle line:90%
I don't know-- maybe 2 minutes?

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:57.040 align:middle line:90%
And that will all just cook.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.020 align:middle line:90%


00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:00.820 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.487 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to
check these veggies.

00:09:02.487 --> 00:09:04.990 align:middle line:84%
It's been like about a
minute, a minute and a half.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And my fork is just touching
them, which is great.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.525 align:middle line:84%
And this is when
I'm going to put

00:09:08.525 --> 00:09:11.110 align:middle line:84%
the softer vegetables on there
so it comes right through.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:12.340 align:middle line:90%
That's awesome.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.130 align:middle line:84%
So harder ones on the bottom,
medium ones in the middle,

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:17.245 align:middle line:84%
and the softer,
watery ones on top.

00:09:17.245 --> 00:09:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And we're just going to let
that steam for a minute,

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:21.650 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll come back
to that in a minute.

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:22.910 align:middle line:90%
This is done.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.850 align:middle line:90%
I like this layering process.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.950 align:middle line:90%
It's awesome.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:30.350 align:middle line:90%
This is hot too, so be careful.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.312 align:middle line:90%
Got a little bit of a wee mess.

00:09:33.312 --> 00:09:35.372 align:middle line:90%
And let me just show you--

00:09:35.372 --> 00:09:36.700 align:middle line:90%
whew.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.760 align:middle line:84%
There goes the
facial, a free facial.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Let me just show you what
I mean by why this is done.

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.820 align:middle line:84%
So we did that layering
technique, yes?

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.080 align:middle line:84%
The hard vegetables on the
bottom and the soft ones

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:48.880 align:middle line:90%
on top.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.547 align:middle line:84%
Well, the soft ones
are definitely done,

00:09:50.547 --> 00:09:51.820 align:middle line:90%
as you can see.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Let's get down to
those hard ones.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:55.680 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.210 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.210 --> 00:09:59.010 align:middle line:90%
Falling apart.

00:09:59.010 --> 00:09:59.560 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:09:59.940 align:middle line:90%
That's what we want.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.107 align:middle line:90%
We don't it want to be mash.

00:10:01.107 --> 00:10:05.837 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.837 --> 00:10:07.920 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to make
one single serving here.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.753 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to do the
whole lot right now.

00:10:09.753 --> 00:10:13.260 align:middle line:90%


00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.560 align:middle line:90%
OK, perfect.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.330 align:middle line:90%
Very excited about this.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:17.130 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.120 align:middle line:90%
Let's pop this over there.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to add some
mung bean sprouts to this.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:28.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm definitely going to season
this with salt and pepper.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.365 align:middle line:84%
Yes, really important
to season this

00:10:30.365 --> 00:10:31.990 align:middle line:84%
with salt and pepper
and just give this

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:36.460 align:middle line:90%
a good just a mix through.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm really happy with this
way of steaming things,

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.120 align:middle line:84%
because things are cooked but
they're not falling apart.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.120 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean?

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.050 align:middle line:90%
They're not mush.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:45.740 align:middle line:90%
It's just al dente.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And this residual heat
will cook the rest of this

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.250 align:middle line:90%
as it's sitting and waiting.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:59.440 align:middle line:84%
I want some fresh coriander
through this, which is awesome.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.690 align:middle line:90%
I want a bit of chili as well.

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:02.190 align:middle line:84%
So I want that heat
to come through.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:05.112 align:middle line:84%
I know the heat is in
the sauce, but I just

00:11:05.112 --> 00:11:06.070 align:middle line:90%
want a little bit more.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:08.680 align:middle line:84%
I might use a green
one because they look--

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:13.190 align:middle line:84%
they're yelling out,
use me today, use me.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.835 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you can get a
hold of some Thai basil,

00:11:15.835 --> 00:11:17.410 align:middle line:90%
oh, that would be beautiful.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.510 align:middle line:84%
I can't get any-- a hold
of any at the moment,

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:23.956 align:middle line:84%
so we're just going to go
without, which is totally fine.

00:11:23.956 --> 00:11:29.496 align:middle line:84%
Now let's grab a plate
to serve this on.

00:11:29.496 --> 00:11:31.850 align:middle line:90%
Let's grab a nice, long plate.

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:33.050 align:middle line:90%
So give this a bit of a mix.

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:37.330 align:middle line:90%


00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:41.312 align:middle line:84%
Now what I want to do is
toss a little bit of sauce

00:11:41.312 --> 00:11:43.270 align:middle line:84%
throughout my veggies,
throughout my gado-gado.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.130 align:middle line:90%
Just a little bit.

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:49.370 align:middle line:84%
I want you to be able to see
the textures as I line this up

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:50.170 align:middle line:90%
on the platter.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:54.570 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.220 align:middle line:90%
How beautiful does this look?

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.750 align:middle line:90%
Smells just so good.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:01.210 align:middle line:90%


00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:02.660 align:middle line:84%
There's some of
that potato there.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.504 align:middle line:90%


00:12:05.504 --> 00:12:07.380 align:middle line:90%
More like two servings, chef.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.310 align:middle line:90%


00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:11.110 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:15.790 align:middle line:90%


00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Now for my eggs, cut
just into quarters.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And just kind of
arrange them evenly.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.800 align:middle line:90%
It's like art, yes?

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.940 align:middle line:90%
Cooking is like art.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.080 align:middle line:90%
It's got to look sexy.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.880 align:middle line:84%
It's going to taste
so good as well.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.480 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And just a few more of
this just to bring it home.

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:42.828 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you've got some
really large shredded coconut,

00:12:42.828 --> 00:12:44.370 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of nice
on there as well.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:46.970 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:49.380 align:middle line:84%
If you can get some fresh
coconut, that's even better.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.740 align:middle line:90%
Just a bit of coconut on there.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.910 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:56.685 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a few cashews,
something different.

00:12:56.685 --> 00:13:00.526 align:middle line:90%


00:13:00.526 --> 00:13:02.280 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And we would serve that with
a little bowl of extra sauce

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:16.650 align:middle line:84%
on the side, just
because we can.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:19.331 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
wrong with that.

00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:21.180 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.180 align:middle line:90%
Excuse my mess.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:29.600 align:middle line:84%
But that, my friends, is a
really clean way, divine way,

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.930 align:middle line:90%
of having a gado-gado.

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:33.860 align:middle line:90%
And I mean clean.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean no MSG, no
sauces that are going

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.900 align:middle line:90%
to compromise your health.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.080 align:middle line:90%
It's fresh.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:41.880 align:middle line:90%
It's tasty.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.463 align:middle line:84%
The vegetables are
cooked beautifully.

00:13:43.463 --> 00:13:44.460 align:middle line:90%
They're not into mush.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:47.090 align:middle line:84%
So that layering process,
the hard ones first.

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Instead of using three steamers,
we start with the hard ones

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:50.390 align:middle line:90%
first.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.560 align:middle line:84%
Then go to the middle
ones that are not

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.690 align:middle line:84%
as high water content
as the leafy spinach

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.810 align:middle line:84%
and the leafy cabbage
and the zucchini.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:00.352 align:middle line:84%
And then we just keep
checking them as we go.

00:14:00.352 --> 00:14:01.750 align:middle line:90%
Voila.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:02.550 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy this.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.400 align:middle line:90%
Have fun with this.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.200 align:middle line:90%
Comments below.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.030 align:middle line:84%
