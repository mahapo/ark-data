[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.416 --> 00:00:12.260 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Good morning, and
welcome to breakfast.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.430 align:middle line:84%
This is a fantastic breakfast
that is packed full of plants.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.000 align:middle line:90%
It's just extraordinary.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to call is the
Green Breakfast of Glory.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.400 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, we want to
cut up all our vegetables.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.705 align:middle line:84%
So I've got a really
nice zucchini here.

00:00:25.705 --> 00:00:26.580 align:middle line:90%
That's just gorgeous.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't want to cut
too fat, because I want

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.180 align:middle line:90%
this to cook really quickly.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.035 align:middle line:84%
So just what I've done is
I've cut it into fours,

00:00:34.035 --> 00:00:35.910 align:middle line:84%
as you can see, and I'm
just running my knife

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.500 align:middle line:90%
through like this.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.870 align:middle line:84%
It's a good way to get
those exact cuts here,

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.800 align:middle line:84%
by just cutting your zucchini
like that, and then like that.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.880 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've got some
mushrooms, and they're

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.755 align:middle line:84%
about the same thickness as
well as this which is good.

00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:52.630 align:middle line:90%
That's what you want.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.558 align:middle line:84%
You want it to be about
the same thickness.

00:00:54.558 --> 00:01:00.040 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.960 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.660 align:middle line:90%
I've got some leek here.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.120 align:middle line:84%
A little leak, it's
actually funny.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.990 align:middle line:84%
This is just a very
sweet, sweet flavor

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.360 align:middle line:84%
instead of using
onion or garlic,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.468 align:middle line:84%
especially in the
morning, not that there's

00:01:13.468 --> 00:01:14.510 align:middle line:90%
anything wrong with that.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.177 align:middle line:84%
We have used that
throughout the recipe,

00:01:16.177 --> 00:01:18.440 align:middle line:84%
but this is just a
sweet, sweet flavor that

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.380 align:middle line:90%
adds to this amazing breakfast.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.080 align:middle line:84%
It truly is a green
breakfast of glory.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.680 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just slicing
this up nice and thin.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Leeks add such a beautiful
flavor to things.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.750 align:middle line:84%
They're just incredible,
and they are really sweet,

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.040 align:middle line:84%
and I like to use the whole
leek from the green part

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.840 align:middle line:90%
to the bottom.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.423 align:middle line:84%
Now, if have quite
a large leek that's

00:01:38.423 --> 00:01:42.320 align:middle line:84%
about that fat about that long,
just cut it in half long ways,

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.060 align:middle line:84%
and then in quarter,
and then just use

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.140 align:middle line:84%
the quarter of that leek,
and then that's enough.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.090 align:middle line:84%
I've got some spinach here,
some beautiful fresh spinach.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.870 align:middle line:90%


00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Just chop that off roughly like
this, put that to the side.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.340 align:middle line:90%
What else do we have?

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.590 align:middle line:84%
We have some spring onions
which is just gorgeous.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.750 align:middle line:84%
This is going to add that
extra sweetness as well.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.280 align:middle line:90%
God, I love food.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.080 align:middle line:90%
I really love food.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.606 align:middle line:90%
It's just incredible.

00:02:13.606 --> 00:02:18.022 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.022 --> 00:02:19.730 align:middle line:84%
So these are really
little spring onions.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.800 align:middle line:84%
So you want about three
spring onions to this recipe,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.630 align:middle line:84%
and half a bunch of
baby spinach is awesome.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.455 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to
cut those roots off.

00:02:28.455 --> 00:02:30.770 align:middle line:90%
So that's done.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.060 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.860 align:middle line:90%
Now, we're ready.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.060 align:middle line:90%
We need our eggs.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.410 align:middle line:90%
Have a look over here.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.820 align:middle line:90%
This is really cool.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.780 align:middle line:84%
See how my eggs have
come to me today?

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.890 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:42.820 align:middle line:90%
It's just beautiful.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.970 align:middle line:84%
Instead of buying them in
the plastic or the cardboard,

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.000 align:middle line:90%
this is how we got them today.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.130 align:middle line:84%
My girlfriend, [? Marley, ?]
went and picked these up

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.713 align:middle line:84%
from the organic supplier today,
and this is how she got them.

00:02:50.713 --> 00:02:52.900 align:middle line:84%
She brought them back
in a bag full of paper.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.235 align:middle line:90%
It's extraordinary, isn't it?

00:02:54.235 --> 00:02:56.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm just surrounded by goodness.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.730 align:middle line:90%
OK, back to the recipe.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:58.750 align:middle line:90%
Let's turn this on.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.860 align:middle line:90%
Let's get our eggs ready.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.640 align:middle line:84%
So we'll just pop this on,
so our pan's ready to go.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Get that nice and
hot too, not too hot.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.120 align:middle line:84%
But just we want that
oil to go in there,

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and we want this to sizzle
a little bit, but not burn.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.255 align:middle line:90%
All right, I need my eggs.

00:03:13.255 --> 00:03:29.270 align:middle line:90%


00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And a little splash of water,
just about a tablespoon

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.820 align:middle line:84%
of water, just a
little bit more.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.325 align:middle line:84%
So I've got three
beautiful eggs.

00:03:39.325 --> 00:03:41.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, if these eggs were
really, really small,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.050 align:middle line:90%
I'd add another one.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.770 align:middle line:84%
Look at all these vegetables
compared to how much egg.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:48.850 align:middle line:90%
This is the classic--

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.810 align:middle line:90%
this is such a great dish.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm so excited
to show you this.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.420 align:middle line:84%
I've got some olive oil, just
going to I put that in there.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.696 align:middle line:90%
Let's cook.

00:04:02.696 --> 00:04:04.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.520 align:middle line:90%
Look at all this.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, a little bit of a sizzle.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.500 align:middle line:90%


00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.000 align:middle line:84%
That olive oil is
just going to make

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.650 align:middle line:90%
that really flavorsome as well.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.980 align:middle line:90%


00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:23.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, salt and pepper, for sure,
the building blocks of flavor.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.100 align:middle line:90%


00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Wooden spoon, and
we just want to--

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.040 align:middle line:84%
we just want to
cook this way down

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.120 align:middle line:90%
before we add that spinach.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.250 align:middle line:90%
Now, see how I'm moving the pan?

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.100 align:middle line:84%
What it does, so the heat
is directly under this pan,

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.950 align:middle line:84%
and when I move the pan, I
move the vegetables as well.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.020 align:middle line:90%


00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.820 align:middle line:90%
See that?

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.190 align:middle line:90%
It's a really good tip.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.080 align:middle line:84%
You can use a wooden
spoon as well,

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.780 align:middle line:84%
and you can definitely go
the flip, if you want to.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:15.760 align:middle line:90%


00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.760 align:middle line:84%
The flavors are really
starting to come through.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.650 align:middle line:84%
This is when you taste
what's on your spoon

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:29.780 align:middle line:84%
to see if you've got enough
pepper and salt. Mm, delicious.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.872 align:middle line:84%
The sweetness, ah, god, the
sweetness of those leeks,

00:05:33.872 --> 00:05:36.810 align:middle line:90%
they're just sublime.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And cutting that zucchini
up, remember this, make it

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.950 align:middle line:84%
the same size as the
mushrooms, and they're really

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.710 align:middle line:84%
watering vegetables, so
they cook really fast.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Imagine this for breakfast,
zucchini for breakfast.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.460 align:middle line:90%
It's that good.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, my spinach, big handful
of spinach, look at this.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.570 align:middle line:84%
It's just amazing how this
is just going to break down.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.990 align:middle line:90%


00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Just getting that heat,
just to wilt all this down,

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.630 align:middle line:90%
this is in a matter of minutes.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.598 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:06:10.598 --> 00:06:11.890 align:middle line:90%
You've seen how fast I've gone.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Probably the chopping that I'm
quick at, because I'm a chef,

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.410 align:middle line:84%
but this is just out of
my control, this cooking.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.300 align:middle line:84%
It's just cooking as
it is, and it's really

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.740 align:middle line:90%
literally taking minutes.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.980 align:middle line:90%


00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.900 align:middle line:84%
I want that spinach to
completely break down,

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.060 align:middle line:90%
which it is nicely.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.475 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're welcome to put chili
in there, if you want to, just

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.267 align:middle line:90%
for that little bit of heat.

00:06:36.267 --> 00:06:38.920 align:middle line:90%


00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:42.130 align:middle line:90%
Now, we're on.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.090 align:middle line:90%


00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to add just
a little bit more fat.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.350 align:middle line:84%
Fat makes flavor,
so a little bit more

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.420 align:middle line:84%
olive oil, just a little,
just a little tiny drizzle.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.860 align:middle line:84%
See, it's not a
lot, just a little.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.515 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful, and then, I'm
going to add my eggs.

00:07:02.515 --> 00:07:11.210 align:middle line:90%


00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.200 align:middle line:90%
Covering all that.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.920 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, if your eggs are small,
add more, add another egg.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.580 align:middle line:84%
OK, I want a lid on
this for a minute.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to turn
it down to low,

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.110 align:middle line:90%
and I'm just going to wait.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.230 align:middle line:84%
I reckon probably not
even a minute and a half,

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.410 align:middle line:90%
let's see what happens.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Because the steam will just
cook the surface of that.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.270 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom, this
is heat here coming

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.940 align:middle line:84%
from this flame which
is cooking the bottom,

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.397 align:middle line:84%
and now I'm just going to
cook the top by steaming that.

00:07:45.397 --> 00:07:47.230 align:middle line:84%
So any moisture that
comes up through there,

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:48.810 align:middle line:84%
especially for those
watery vegetables,

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.435 align:middle line:84%
is going to create
this steam, and it's

00:07:50.435 --> 00:07:53.230 align:middle line:90%
going to cook the top as well.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:54.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.847 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to clean up.

00:07:55.847 --> 00:07:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Let's have a look
where we're at here.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:58.910 align:middle line:90%
It's been about 10 seconds.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.910 align:middle line:84%
I just walked away and
wiped down my bench.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:03.490 align:middle line:90%


00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.580 align:middle line:84%
The main thing is I don't want
the bottom to cook and burn.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.660 align:middle line:84%
I want the bottom to
cook, but I don't want

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:08.952 align:middle line:90%
it to burn, so just be mindful.

00:08:08.952 --> 00:08:12.480 align:middle line:90%


00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.270 align:middle line:90%
That's looking exceptional.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:17.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm very excited.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's take that
away from the pan.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.730 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:27.400 align:middle line:84%
I used to make these for my
friend, Tyler [? Tallman, ?]

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.920 align:middle line:90%
nearly maybe three times a week.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And he used to
always say to people,

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.179 align:middle line:84%
Cynthia makes these
amazing breakfasts,

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:37.090 align:middle line:84%
and vegetables seem
to stick together

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:41.647 align:middle line:84%
with this small amount
of eggs which is true.

00:08:41.647 --> 00:08:42.730 align:middle line:90%
They just happen that way.

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:43.929 align:middle line:90%
It just happens.

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:45.976 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how it happens.

00:08:45.976 --> 00:08:48.830 align:middle line:84%
See that water that's
coming off that?

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:50.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put
that back in there,

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.840 align:middle line:90%
because it creates steam.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Really low heat on the
bottom, it's not burning.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.155 align:middle line:90%
I can smell that.

00:08:56.155 --> 00:09:00.625 align:middle line:84%
It's smelling sweet and lovely,
really is sweet and lovely.

00:09:00.625 --> 00:09:02.250 align:middle line:84%
It's the leeks that
make this so sweet.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.990 align:middle line:90%


00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.790 align:middle line:90%
Have another look.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:20.870 align:middle line:90%


00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.497 align:middle line:84%
Nearly done, I'm going
to turn this off.

00:09:24.497 --> 00:09:25.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to grab a plate.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:34.170 align:middle line:90%


00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:35.873 align:middle line:90%
Give this another 10 seconds.

00:09:35.873 --> 00:09:37.290 align:middle line:84%
I just want to
show you something.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm turning it back on to give
you a little bit of an idea,

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.540 align:middle line:84%
if you're finding the top
of it's not cooking as quick

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.560 align:middle line:90%
as the bottom.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Is you get a little
bit of water,

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.230 align:middle line:84%
and you turn your
heat up really high.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.600 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.370 align:middle line:84%
This is throughout
the cooking process,

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.230 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to get
a little bit of water.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:59.467 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to put a
little bit of water there,

00:09:59.467 --> 00:10:01.050 align:middle line:84%
and that's going to
create some steam.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to
turn that off, and let

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.520 align:middle line:84%
that steam come
through, and that'll

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.440 align:middle line:90%
cook that surface of the egg.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Really good tip instead of
adding more oil, more oil.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.170 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people do that with
stir fries as well is adding

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.250 align:middle line:84%
that little bit of water,
just creates that steam,

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.660 align:middle line:84%
and that's really
cooking the top now.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.150 align:middle line:90%
See that?

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Good tip, it's ready
to be served up.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm so happy with this.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.770 align:middle line:84%
OK, my pan's quite
a deep pan, some

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.205 align:middle line:90%
of those little chef-y moments.

00:10:32.205 --> 00:10:37.028 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.028 --> 00:10:39.070 align:middle line:84%
How the hell am I going
to get this out actually?

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:49.960 align:middle line:90%


00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.930 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:54.930 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.440 align:middle line:90%
Ah, yeah.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.840 align:middle line:90%
I know, right?

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.518 align:middle line:84%
Now, to top it off, I just
want a little bit of tomato.

00:11:02.518 --> 00:11:03.935 align:middle line:84%
I have a really
nice, ripe tomato.

00:11:03.935 --> 00:11:06.647 align:middle line:90%


00:11:06.647 --> 00:11:08.730 align:middle line:84%
I just tipped that over,
because I couldn't get it

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:09.690 align:middle line:90%
out which is awesome.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.190 align:middle line:90%
At all it all holds together.

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:12.028 align:middle line:90%
Look at it.

00:11:12.028 --> 00:11:14.070 align:middle line:84%
It's all holding together,
and I'm actually glad.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.198 align:middle line:84%
Because it just shows
you what the bottom looks

00:11:16.198 --> 00:11:17.490 align:middle line:90%
like, and that's what you want.

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.720 align:middle line:90%
You don't want it to burn.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.882 align:middle line:90%
I love mistakes.

00:11:21.882 --> 00:11:23.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's not really a
mistake, really, is it?

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.950 align:middle line:84%
It's just the wrong pan,
and it wasn't in the end.

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I love it.

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:36.460 align:middle line:84%
So I just want a bit of
tomato, just like that.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:42.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to salt and pepper
this tomato, really important,

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:50.530 align:middle line:84%
mix that through,
just like this,

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.650 align:middle line:84%
and then I want sprouts
on there as well.

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:57.010 align:middle line:90%


00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:58.950 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:02.070 align:middle line:84%
That gives you a
really great idea

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:03.400 align:middle line:90%
of how to amp up your plant--

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:08.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm so into this-- how to amp
up your plant in the morning.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:13.560 align:middle line:84%
How to get more living plants
into your diet, and this

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:18.720 align:middle line:84%
is the most quickest,
easiest breakfast

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.630 align:middle line:84%
that you can ever make
that has a full flavor.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And trust me, you
follow that process,

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.590 align:middle line:84%
and you'll get that
flavor through.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And we only cooked that
for, what, like two minutes

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:31.710 align:middle line:84%
sauteing the vegetable through,
and then the eggs on top.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And adding that bit of
steam to make the top cook

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:38.820 align:middle line:84%
without the bottom
getting burnt.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:39.900 align:middle line:90%
I just need to try some.

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.026 align:middle line:84%
Look at how that's really
held well together.

00:12:43.026 --> 00:12:44.490 align:middle line:90%
Wow, it's amazing.

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:47.490 align:middle line:90%


00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:52.055 align:middle line:90%
God, I love food so much.

00:12:52.055 --> 00:12:56.820 align:middle line:90%


00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.530 align:middle line:90%
Mm, OK.

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:01.320 align:middle line:90%


00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.340 align:middle line:90%
That is good.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:04.950 align:middle line:90%
That is good.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.600 align:middle line:90%
It's really good.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.090 align:middle line:84%
That could be for
lunch or even a snack.

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:10.590 align:middle line:84%
The amount of plant
that's in there,

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:12.556 align:middle line:90%
you saw what was on here.

00:13:12.556 --> 00:13:14.300 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm so happy.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.090 align:middle line:90%
OK, goodbye.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:16.890 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy.

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:18.510 align:middle line:90%
Good morning.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:20.400 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy your day.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:90%
>> You ready?

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.150 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready?

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.950 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready?

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:24.860 align:middle line:90%
(SINGING) Welcome to my kitchen.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:28.250 align:middle line:84%
My voice, my voice, my
voice, my voice, my voice.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:29.405 align:middle line:90%
It's a salad.

00:13:29.405 --> 00:13:31.080 align:middle line:90%
It's a salad.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:31.880 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.850 align:middle line:90%


00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:38.700 align:middle line:84%
That indicates--
hang on a minute.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.060 align:middle line:90%
The phone's ringing.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:43.410 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:51.574 align:middle line:90%
