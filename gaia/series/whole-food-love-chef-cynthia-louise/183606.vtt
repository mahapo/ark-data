00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.381 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.381 --> 00:00:12.580 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>> I love this recipe.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.528 align:middle line:90%
This is incredible.

00:00:15.528 --> 00:00:17.320 align:middle line:84%
I learned this from
my friend [INAUDIBLE],,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.440 align:middle line:90%
who's behind the camera.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that
this is called toggie.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.880 align:middle line:90%
And toggie means sprouts.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.080 align:middle line:90%
And it's such a quick meal.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.790 align:middle line:84%
If you've had a really,
really busy day,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.832 align:middle line:84%
and you want something
quite nourishing and quite

00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:31.570 align:middle line:90%
luxurious--

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.240 align:middle line:84%
and when I mean
luxurious, I mean

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.740 align:middle line:84%
there is nothing better
than a steamed meal.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.220 align:middle line:90%
I find that luxurious.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.277 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people find
other things luxurious.

00:00:39.277 --> 00:00:40.360 align:middle line:90%
But I find that luxurious.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.920 align:middle line:90%
This is really, really simple.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.837 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
we're going to do first

00:00:43.837 --> 00:00:47.100 align:middle line:90%
is clean our mushrooms.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And I like to not wash them
because it washes away flavors.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.170 align:middle line:84%
So using a paper towel is the
best way to clean mushrooms.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.720 align:middle line:90%
Some people wash them.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a fan of the
washing of the fungi.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.950 align:middle line:90%
No, not good.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.000 align:middle line:90%
So what I do is--

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.960 align:middle line:84%
and there's a little bit of
dirt on there, as you can see.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.800 align:middle line:84%
So what I do, is I
just wipe them down.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Just wiping down one at a time
and going through them all.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And please, please
don't peel them.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.780 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people do these ones.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.800 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea why.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.440 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] No.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Really, I don't know
why people do that.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.500 align:middle line:84%
But as chefs, we
just wipe them down.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.940 align:middle line:90%
We bless them.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And full flowered--
[LAUGHS] full flavor.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you do wash
them in water,

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.520 align:middle line:90%
they will absorb that water.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling you they
will absorb that water.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.285 align:middle line:90%
And they'll be very, very moist.

00:01:51.285 --> 00:01:52.160 align:middle line:90%
So we're ready to go.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.740 align:middle line:90%
This is a great recipe.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.410 align:middle line:90%
I need some capsicum as well.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.260 align:middle line:90%
I need some garlic.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.225 align:middle line:90%
I need some chili.

00:02:03.225 --> 00:02:04.600 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, I've
just come home.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
be this simple.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.210 align:middle line:90%
And I need some cabbage as well.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.278 align:middle line:84%
So I've got a lovely
green cabbage here.

00:02:10.278 --> 00:02:11.820 align:middle line:84%
So I've got all my
ingredients ready.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.020 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to chop up
these mushrooms first.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Now you can chop them as big
and as little as you like.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.510 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on what you
want to accomplish here.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.910 align:middle line:84%
I want things to
be quite chunky.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.565 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to cut
them into quarters.

00:02:27.565 --> 00:02:30.610 align:middle line:90%


00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And you can have as much
and as little as you like.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.996 align:middle line:90%
This is going to be for two.

00:02:34.996 --> 00:02:37.600 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be for myself
and my girlfriend, who's

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.238 align:middle line:90%
just in the background.

00:02:39.238 --> 00:02:48.132 align:middle line:90%


00:02:48.132 --> 00:02:49.590 align:middle line:84%
So I've got those
chopped up ready.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.472 align:middle line:90%


00:02:55.472 --> 00:02:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Actually, [INAUDIBLE],, you
might like to have some of this

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:58.800 align:middle line:90%
as well, hey?

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm?

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.572 align:middle line:84%
>> I said, you might like to
have some of this as well.

00:03:01.572 --> 00:03:04.180 align:middle line:90%


00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.350 align:middle line:90%
This is your dish here.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:17.610 align:middle line:90%


00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.120 align:middle line:90%
Now for some chili.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.510 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to add
chili if you don't want to.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.355 align:middle line:84%
Actually, my knife
is just a bit blunt.

00:03:28.355 --> 00:03:49.440 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.240 align:middle line:84%
As much and as little
chili as you like.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Take the seeds out if you
don't want it too hot.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I want it like
this because I like the heat.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.350 align:middle line:90%
And so does my girlfriend.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.450 align:middle line:90%
So I want it-- now, garlic.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.860 align:middle line:84%
This was the
unusual part for me,

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.010 align:middle line:90%
was steaming cloves of garlic.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.460 align:middle line:84%
But I tell you, it just
brings [INAUDIBLE] this dish.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Just taking off the
skins like that,

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.797 align:middle line:84%
see how they come off
easy when you just

00:04:13.797 --> 00:04:15.320 align:middle line:90%
give it a bit of a tap?

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.120 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.060 align:middle line:90%
I love how that happens.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.089 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
greatest things

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:22.380 align:middle line:90%
I ever learned, was that.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.570 align:middle line:90%


00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.022 align:middle line:90%
And one more.

00:04:27.022 --> 00:04:29.355 align:middle line:84%
Just a little tap because I
don't want them to be mush--

00:04:29.355 --> 00:04:32.870 align:middle line:90%
oh, like that one [LAUGHS].

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.380 align:middle line:90%
Just a little tap.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.735 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to chop
this up into slices.

00:04:38.735 --> 00:04:42.290 align:middle line:90%


00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Now to my right, I have some
water boiling in a steamer.

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.500 align:middle line:84%
So I've got a little steam
basket on top of a pot of water

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.160 align:middle line:90%
just here.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.550 align:middle line:90%
And it's ready to rock and roll.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to take my--

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.415 align:middle line:84%
now be careful with this
because it is steam.

00:04:58.415 --> 00:05:00.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to take my basket out.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.620 align:middle line:84%
You can use a bamboo
steamer if you like.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.330 align:middle line:90%
It would be awesome if you did.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.600 align:middle line:84%
I just don't happen
to have one right now.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.100 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.330 align:middle line:90%
We've got what we've got.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:16.135 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to put my mushrooms
just in here like this,

00:05:16.135 --> 00:05:18.400 align:middle line:90%
just so they're out of the way.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And then I've got my
garlic, chili, and capsicum

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.250 align:middle line:90%
just there in the corner there.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.280 align:middle line:90%
This is so good.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.530 align:middle line:90%
Now I need some green cabbage.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.100 align:middle line:90%


00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.122 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually going to use a half
a green cabbage for two people.

00:05:39.122 --> 00:05:41.882 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to take
off that outer leaf.

00:05:41.882 --> 00:05:43.020 align:middle line:90%
It's a wee bit damaged.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:53.850 align:middle line:90%


00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Not too thin and not
too thick, just right.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.720 align:middle line:90%


00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Put that cabbage
in there like this.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:07.435 align:middle line:90%
Just pack it down.

00:06:07.435 --> 00:06:14.638 align:middle line:90%


00:06:14.638 --> 00:06:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Now the next thing I want to
do-- before I put any more

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.600 align:middle line:84%
cabbage-- is that I just
want to put some salt

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.020 align:middle line:84%
and pepper on my
cabbage before I start

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.150 align:middle line:90%
pushing it down even more.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.854 align:middle line:84%
So there's a little bit
of flavor happening there.

00:06:28.854 --> 00:06:29.830 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.880 align:middle line:90%


00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.704 align:middle line:90%
Salt and pepper on my mushrooms.

00:06:39.704 --> 00:06:41.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty sure
everything's got everything.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.580 align:middle line:90%


00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.120 align:middle line:90%
Now it seems like a lot.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.960 align:middle line:90%
And it actually is.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.850 align:middle line:84%
But when you steam
it, it all shrinks.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.750 align:middle line:90%
And it becomes a perfect amount.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.330 align:middle line:90%
The next bit is the tempeh.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.320 align:middle line:90%
This is fresh tempeh.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm in Indonesia right now.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.550 align:middle line:90%
And this is on tap.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:04.900 align:middle line:90%
And it's exquisite.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.580 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:16.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to put
a few slices in here.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to put
this in so it captures--

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.550 align:middle line:84%
you can get some of that
steam coming through.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.645 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to salt
and pepper that as well.

00:07:25.645 --> 00:07:27.270 align:middle line:84%
It's really important,
salt and pepper.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.003 align:middle line:90%
I've mentioned this 1,000 times.

00:07:29.003 --> 00:07:30.170 align:middle line:90%
And I'll keep mentioning it.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.000 align:middle line:84%
It is the building
blocks of flavor.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Now the last thing
is the toggie--

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.060 align:middle line:90%
sprouts in English.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
put these in last.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.050 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to pop
this in my steam--

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:46.960 align:middle line:84%
into my pot that's already
boiling and ready to go,

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.145 align:middle line:90%
being mindful it is steam.

00:07:48.145 --> 00:07:51.590 align:middle line:90%


00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:52.910 align:middle line:90%
So I've come home.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:54.327 align:middle line:84%
Now I've used
whatever vegetables.

00:07:54.327 --> 00:07:55.127 align:middle line:90%
I've got.

00:07:55.127 --> 00:07:57.180 align:middle line:84%
So if I don't have the
same ingredients, it's OK.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.280 align:middle line:84%
If you got some pumpkin
or sweet potato--

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.450 align:middle line:84%
what makes this
dish is the garlic

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.087 align:middle line:90%
and the chili and the capsicum.

00:08:04.087 --> 00:08:05.420 align:middle line:90%
That's what just brings it home.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.573 align:middle line:90%
It's so delicious.

00:08:06.573 --> 00:08:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to steam
that for probably

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.800 align:middle line:90%
about four or five minutes.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going
to put the toggie in.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Now I want a little dressing
to go with this, just

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:15.930 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more flavor.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:20.870 align:middle line:84%
So I want to make just
a soy, sesame seed,

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:25.640 align:middle line:84%
gorgeous little dressing,
just to add that touch to it.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.631 align:middle line:90%
So I need some sesame seed oil.

00:08:28.631 --> 00:08:29.500 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's not it.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:37.549 align:middle line:90%


00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:40.789 align:middle line:84%
Sesame seed oil and
soy is just divine.

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:43.250 align:middle line:90%
And if you need that--

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:44.340 align:middle line:90%
oh.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.140 align:middle line:90%
hang on a minute.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.350 align:middle line:90%


00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:50.850 align:middle line:84%
If you need that
sweetness in there,

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:53.690 align:middle line:90%
you can add maple as well.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.060 align:middle line:84%
This whole situation
I've got here

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.810 align:middle line:84%
without any labels on anything
really forces me to smell.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:02.240 align:middle line:84%
So I would advise
you all at home

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.340 align:middle line:90%
to get present in this moment.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And even though there's a
label on that soy sauce,

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.250 align:middle line:84%
just to open it and smell it
and get really present with it

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:13.160 align:middle line:84%
because it's quite
extraordinary when

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:18.200 align:middle line:84%
you allow your senses to have
that moment because you just

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.250 align:middle line:90%
know it's soy sauce.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:20.708 align:middle line:84%
But when you smell
it, you're like,

00:09:20.708 --> 00:09:22.410 align:middle line:84%
oh, yeah, I remember
that flavor.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:23.735 align:middle line:90%
Just give this a wee mix.

00:09:23.735 --> 00:09:32.867 align:middle line:90%


00:09:32.867 --> 00:09:34.450 align:middle line:84%
I do want to add a
little bit of maple

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.100 align:middle line:84%
in there just because
I want to today.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.750 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, the
recipe is there,

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.147 align:middle line:84%
but to just take it where
you want to take it.

00:09:43.147 --> 00:09:45.730 align:middle line:84%
That little bit of sweetness to
that savory of the sesame seed

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:49.162 align:middle line:84%
oil, and the
saltiness of the soy,

00:09:49.162 --> 00:09:50.620 align:middle line:84%
and then the
sweetness of the maple

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.030 align:middle line:90%
is a really lovely dressing.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:57.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm smiling because this is
one of my favorite dressings.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.770 align:middle line:90%
Just have a taste of this.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, baby.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.655 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's that good.

00:10:03.655 --> 00:10:05.340 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] It really is.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.860 align:middle line:84%
It's just going to add to
that flavor over there.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.845 align:middle line:90%
Now the recipe is there.

00:10:09.845 --> 00:10:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm showing you what
to do, the technique of it

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:12.810 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:15.060 align:middle line:84%
You can really go to town
here with this sauce.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.800 align:middle line:84%
You can get some
grated ginger in there.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.040 align:middle line:84%
You could add some
chili in there.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.800 align:middle line:84%
You could put some
more garlic in there.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.570 align:middle line:84%
You could put some
shallots in there.

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:23.730 align:middle line:84%
It's just endless what
you could do with that.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:27.030 align:middle line:90%
So don't feel like this is it.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.520 align:middle line:84%
It's really important
that you know that.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.885 align:middle line:84%
So the next thing is this
is steaming quite nicely.

00:10:31.885 --> 00:10:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's have a look
how we're going here.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.580 align:middle line:84%
This is coming
along really nicely.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Just have a poke around and
see how soft things are.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:39.390 align:middle line:90%
Not yet.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.130 align:middle line:90%
Nearly, but not quite yet.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:43.530 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I can smell that garlic.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:45.360 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that garlic is sensational.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.370 align:middle line:90%
It's coming through.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:49.485 align:middle line:84%
Cabbage is a little bit
too crisp for my liking.

00:10:49.485 --> 00:10:51.905 align:middle line:90%


00:10:51.905 --> 00:10:53.280 align:middle line:84%
So we're just
going to let that--

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.905 align:middle line:84%
give it a couple more
minutes before we

00:10:54.905 --> 00:10:56.190 align:middle line:90%
had those sprouts in there.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:56.980 align:middle line:90%
And then we're ready to go.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:57.990 align:middle line:90%
But that sauce is ready.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.842 align:middle line:90%
It's fantastic.

00:10:58.842 --> 00:11:00.570 align:middle line:90%
You're going to love this.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:01.450 align:middle line:90%
What else do I need?

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:02.880 align:middle line:90%
I need a plate to serve it on.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.220 align:middle line:90%
And then we're ready to eat.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.810 align:middle line:90%
So this is just beautiful.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to
add my sprouts--

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:15.708 align:middle line:84%
toggie in Indonesian--
to my steaming pot here.

00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Everything's really
wilted down well.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:18.070 align:middle line:90%
The flavors have come through.

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:19.140 align:middle line:90%
I can smell the garlic.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.550 align:middle line:90%
It's gorgeous.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.228 align:middle line:84%
And this last bit of
ingredients is just

00:11:23.228 --> 00:11:24.270 align:middle line:90%
going to bring this home.

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:26.145 align:middle line:84%
And I'm only going to
steam this for a good--

00:11:26.145 --> 00:11:27.120 align:middle line:90%
maybe a minute.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't want them to
be completely mashed.

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.772 align:middle line:84%
So about a minute, and then
we're ready to serve up.

00:11:33.772 --> 00:11:34.980 align:middle line:90%
Like I said, this is for two.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was quite a
lot of cabbage there.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.713 align:middle line:84%
Did you notice that it was
quite a bit of cabbage.

00:11:38.713 --> 00:11:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
gone down a bit.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.830 align:middle line:84%
So I want a nice plate
that's enough for two.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:45.490 align:middle line:90%
So I've got one of these.

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:90%
This is done.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.585 align:middle line:84%
It's been about-- between
the time I got the plate out,

00:11:49.585 --> 00:11:51.210 align:middle line:84%
and I'm ready to
serve out, the sprouts

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:57.870 align:middle line:84%
have been on there for
less than a minute.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:00.420 align:middle line:90%
We are sorted.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Hot steam, so just be careful
and be really mindful of that,

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:06.230 align:middle line:90%
especially if kids are around.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:08.160 align:middle line:90%
Be really mindful.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.295 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to put this--

00:12:09.295 --> 00:12:10.920 align:middle line:84%
and it's one of those
things with food.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.080 align:middle line:84%
I love to make food
look gorgeous and really

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.760 align:middle line:90%
edible to the eye first.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.100 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going to do
is just arrange this.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And you can arrange
this however you like.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:21.630 align:middle line:84%
But I like to arrange
it so they're all

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:22.672 align:middle line:90%
into their little places.

00:12:22.672 --> 00:12:25.270 align:middle line:90%


00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.135 align:middle line:84%
And those sprouts
are just gorgeous.

00:12:27.135 --> 00:12:30.010 align:middle line:90%


00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And not for long either,
just that amount of time.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And that cabbage is wilted
down well, really well.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:44.440 align:middle line:90%


00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting a little
bit of a facial

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.690 align:middle line:84%
here [LAUGHS] while
I'm serving this.

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:52.080 align:middle line:90%
It's actually funny.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.250 align:middle line:84%
It's got a little
bit of color in here.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Now that's the
garlic and the chili

00:12:56.110 --> 00:13:00.460 align:middle line:84%
that is the strongest-smelling
ingredient here.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.400 align:middle line:90%


00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.570 align:middle line:90%
And it smells gorgeous.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:06.810 align:middle line:84%
Steaming garlic,
it's just beautiful.

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:10.450 align:middle line:84%
It's soft and sweet,
really lovely in that chili

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:13.228 align:middle line:84%
and that sweetness of
that capsicum as well.

00:13:13.228 --> 00:13:14.770 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely a
marriage, this one.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.215 align:middle line:90%
And then the mushrooms last.

00:13:17.215 --> 00:13:23.010 align:middle line:90%


00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is a divine dish
that my gorgeous friend,

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.910 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE],, which is
behind the camera right now,

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.380 align:middle line:90%
has taught me how to make this.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.713 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to put the
dressing in a little shot glass

00:13:33.713 --> 00:13:36.000 align:middle line:84%
because I'm going to serve
this up to my girlfriend.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.230 align:middle line:84%
There's quite a few people
behind the scenes here today.

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:42.200 align:middle line:90%
They're going to love this.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.660 align:middle line:90%
Just sit that in there.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.880 align:middle line:84%
That is one of
the most quickest,

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.410 align:middle line:84%
fastest meals for someone that's
rushing, that's just come home.

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:55.168 align:middle line:90%
There's cabbage in the fridge.

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:56.710 align:middle line:84%
There's some mushrooms
in the fridge.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:59.970 align:middle line:84%
That simple, into a
steamer and onto the plate

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:01.500 align:middle line:90%
and fully nourished.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And your organs are just
going to love you for this.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:08.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm salivating because I can
actually smell the garlic,

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:08.850 align:middle line:90%
it's so strong.

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.570 align:middle line:90%
So there we go.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:11.880 align:middle line:90%
Toggie.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.838 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to say
toggie sprout because that

00:14:13.838 --> 00:14:15.320 align:middle line:90%
means sprout, sprout [LAUGHS].

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.740 align:middle line:90%
Toggie and steamed tempeh.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:17.640 align:middle line:90%
It's just beautiful.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't like tempeh,
I put some tofu in there.

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't like tofu,
some gorgeous eggplant

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.160 align:middle line:90%
would be lovely.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.500 align:middle line:84%
But remember to season that
well with salt and pepper.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.650 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy this.

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:27.850 align:middle line:90%
Write your comments below.

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:29.260 align:middle line:90%
Let me know how you go.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.020 align:middle line:90%
Yum.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.040 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to where we eat.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.210 align:middle line:90%
It's what we do.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:45.020 align:middle line:90%
It's the new diet.
