00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.110 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a dish that I make
when I don't want to cook

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.000 align:middle line:84%
and I've just had enough, and
I don't want to eat out and I

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.013 align:middle line:84%
just want to chill out, and
I just feel like-- you know,

00:00:23.013 --> 00:00:24.680 align:middle line:84%
I just don't want to
do anything, right?

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.010 align:middle line:84%
This is the dish that I
just always make myself

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.480 align:middle line:90%
when I'm just at that point.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.670 align:middle line:90%
So it's called broccoli pasta.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:32.625 align:middle line:90%
It's really simple.

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:34.250 align:middle line:84%
An Italian man taught
me this actually,

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.690 align:middle line:90%
and I've loved it ever since.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.630 align:middle line:84%
So I've got some pasta with
some buckwheat noodles here.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.550 align:middle line:90%
You can use any past you like.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.800 align:middle line:84%
I've got boiling water
here, which I'm just

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.860 align:middle line:84%
going to now salt,
and then I'm going

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.840 align:middle line:84%
to add my pasta to
this boiling water.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And you're just going to read
the instructions of your pasta.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.210 align:middle line:90%
No big deal.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.480 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you how
long to cook pasta

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.410 align:middle line:84%
because all pastas
are different, right?

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.882 align:middle line:84%
So this is buckwheat, so
this is a gluten-free pasta.

00:00:59.882 --> 00:01:01.590 align:middle line:84%
I want to bring this
back up to the boil,

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.370 align:middle line:90%
so I'm going to put my lid on.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm going to
do, this is just like--

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.315 align:middle line:84%
I'm smiling because
I thought to myself,

00:01:09.315 --> 00:01:10.690 align:middle line:84%
should I put this
in the program?

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, hell yeah.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Hell yeah, I'm going to
put this in the program.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And when I made this
for my partner, Scott,

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.580 align:middle line:90%
he was like, what?

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.830 align:middle line:84%
This is the dish I make
when I don't want to cook.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.740 align:middle line:84%
So nice big head of
broccoli, and I'm

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.410 align:middle line:84%
just going to cut it into
same-size pieces, preferably.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.930 align:middle line:84%
So just have a look
what I'm doing here.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And see those leaves
that are on here?

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.050 align:middle line:90%
That's totally fine, OK?

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.890 align:middle line:90%
Leave the leaves on.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.440 align:middle line:90%
Not a problem in the world.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.540 align:middle line:90%
And I've got some peas.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.695 align:middle line:84%
So broccoli, some peas,
and I need a garlic clove.

00:01:42.695 --> 00:01:44.320 align:middle line:84%
If you don't want to
add garlic, don't.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.690 align:middle line:90%
I love it, personally.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.360 align:middle line:84%
All I'm going to
do is just do this.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.350 align:middle line:90%
So you imagine, right?

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.685 align:middle line:90%
I've worked all day.

00:01:51.685 --> 00:01:53.320 align:middle line:90%
Oh, come to the boil.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.250 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.210 align:middle line:90%
Good sound in there.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.610 align:middle line:84%
I've worked all day, and
I just can't be bothered.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.410 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.350 align:middle line:84%
But I know that if I get
takeaway or anything like that,

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to regret it.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.630 align:middle line:90%
It's like, don't do it.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.090 align:middle line:90%
So this is my alternative.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.960 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not even
going to cut that up.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm just doing that because,
you know, I'm doing it.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.950 align:middle line:84%
So this is cooking
beautifully, and it's just

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.860 align:middle line:84%
going to keep cooking till
it's just about cooked, OK?

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.420 align:middle line:84%
When I mean just about
cooked, when I take one out

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and I feel like it's enough for
me-- right now, it's solid hard

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.160 align:middle line:90%
and it's not ready, OK?

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.000 align:middle line:90%
So I'm just going to cook that.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.880 align:middle line:90%
And I want to add a leek.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, these are baby
leeks, but in Australia

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.330 align:middle line:84%
or in other countries,
you get them quite big.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to chop
them up like this--

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.825 align:middle line:90%
the hard part of the leek, OK?

00:02:42.825 --> 00:02:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And then the soft
part, I'm going

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.020 align:middle line:84%
to cut it thinner,
which is the green part.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.260 align:middle line:90%


00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.970 align:middle line:90%
So chop all that up.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And when you get to the very
end of those leafy green tops--

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.060 align:middle line:90%
that's all finely chopped--

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.860 align:middle line:90%
check on the pasta.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.500 align:middle line:90%


00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.380 align:middle line:90%
See where we're at.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.250 align:middle line:90%
Nearly there.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to wait, I
think, another minute

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.180 align:middle line:84%
for me on my buckwheat
pasta, and then

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show
you the next step.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.183 align:middle line:84%
So with your pasta, if
you've got spaghetti,

00:03:14.183 --> 00:03:15.910 align:middle line:84%
if you've got
fettuccine, if you've

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.150 align:middle line:84%
got any kind of rice noodles or
gluten-free pasta or anything

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.730 align:middle line:84%
light, remember, just cook
it to the instructions.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And just before it's cooked,
like two minutes before

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.888 align:middle line:84%
it's cooked-- two to
three minutes, actually--

00:03:26.888 --> 00:03:28.930 align:middle line:84%
I want you to put the rest
of the ingredients in.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.258 align:middle line:84%
So we'll do that in a minute,
so I'm just going to wait.

00:03:32.258 --> 00:03:35.040 align:middle line:90%
This will take another minute.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.500 align:middle line:84%
All right, I've been cooking
this, and for me, I'm like,

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.670 align:middle line:90%
is this nearly cooked?

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.185 align:middle line:84%
For me, yes, it
totally nearly is.

00:03:44.185 --> 00:03:45.070 align:middle line:90%
It's a bit chewy.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.760 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.240 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.170 align:middle line:84%
This is where everything's
going to go in.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.215 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:03:49.215 --> 00:03:50.015 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:03:50.015 --> 00:03:53.240 align:middle line:90%


00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.240 align:middle line:84%
This is the dish when
you don't want to cook.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.295 align:middle line:90%
The best dish on the planet.

00:03:58.295 --> 00:03:59.095 align:middle line:90%
Give it a stir.

00:03:59.095 --> 00:04:02.830 align:middle line:90%


00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.523 align:middle line:84%
And I want to cook this for a
further two or three minutes,

00:04:07.523 --> 00:04:08.940 align:middle line:84%
just until the
broccoli is cooked.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.510 align:middle line:90%


00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Remember, my pasta
was still very chewy,

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.120 align:middle line:84%
so that's going to
take another, I reckon,

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.172 align:middle line:84%
for my pasta to be completely
cooked, probably four minutes.

00:04:18.172 --> 00:04:19.380 align:middle line:90%
So this is me at home, right?

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.755 align:middle line:84%
So you just deal
with your pasta.

00:04:20.755 --> 00:04:23.700 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as you
feel like it's hard

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.700 align:middle line:84%
and then it's
medium kind of hard,

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.110 align:middle line:84%
that's when I put it in,
because mine is on medium hard

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.910 align:middle line:90%
to just cooked.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.205 align:middle line:84%
So I will see you guys back
here in a couple of minutes.

00:04:36.205 --> 00:04:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, we've got
peas, leeks, broccoli.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you remember I made
this-- but tell everybody.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember I
made this for you

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.300 align:middle line:84%
when I couldn't be
bothered cooking?

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And we just
wanted something--

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Simple.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>> --simple.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, I'll
make you broccoli pasta.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And you're like,
what dish is that?

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you remember that?

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And we sat on the couch
and we shared a bowl of it.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>> A fork each.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:53.280 align:middle line:90%
>> It's good as new.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Can we talk now?

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:54.277 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:54.277 --> 00:04:55.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you finished?

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.430 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] This is actually
a really simple dish.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.460 align:middle line:90%
It's just full of flavor.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.130 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.678 align:middle line:84%
You can do it,
right, as a bloke?

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, as a bloke,
I can cook this.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>> If you didn't have
any of those ingredients,

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.830 align:middle line:90%
what would you put in?

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I could use-- with
pasta, I'd use spinach.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.882 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but when would
you put the spinach in?

00:05:11.882 --> 00:05:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Right near the end--

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>> --because it doesn't
need much cooking, right?

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.170 align:middle line:90%
Just wilt it.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>> What else goes with pasta?

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.392 align:middle line:90%
>> This is good.

00:05:19.392 --> 00:05:20.850 align:middle line:84%
You could put
cauliflower in there.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:21.600 align:middle line:84%
You could put any
kind of flavors.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I wouldn't do--

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Pumpkin?

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:23.660 align:middle line:90%
>> You could do.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.370 align:middle line:84%
Ah, you could-- I would
roast the pumpkin there.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.766 align:middle line:90%
I'd have roast pumpkin pasta.

00:05:27.766 --> 00:05:28.700 align:middle line:90%
>> And then put it in the--

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>> That's getting a little
bit fancy, isn't it?

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>> No, you're getting
a little bit fancy now.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.460 align:middle line:84%

>> The pasta.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:48.480 align:middle line:90%

>> Yeah.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.320 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see this being made.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.840 align:middle line:84%
All right, so this
is what I did.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>> That's got pasta
in it already?

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's do it again.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, the pasta's nearly cooked.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.930 align:middle line:84%

00:06:00.515 --> 00:06:01.890 align:middle line:84%

the spiral pasta.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:02.730 align:middle line:84%
I've had it with
spaghetti before.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, yeah, but this
is what I had, right?

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:04.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>> So all I've done is--
and this is what I've told

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.470 align:middle line:90%
everybody.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:08.515 align:middle line:90%
>> You're so clever.

00:06:08.515 --> 00:06:09.510 align:middle line:90%
>> I know, right?

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.720 align:middle line:90%
Wait.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.110 align:middle line:90%
Just wait.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.980 align:middle line:84%
What I've done
Scott, because you

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.090 align:middle line:90%
need to do this when I'm away--

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>> --what I did was I boiled the
pasta, and it was quite hard.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:16.690 align:middle line:90%
Then it was medium hard.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:17.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And then when
it was medium hard,

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.540 align:middle line:84%
I threw everything
else in there.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:20.220 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.570 align:middle line:84%
By the time it gets soft,
everything else will be yummy.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.445 align:middle line:84%
>> Did she add the
building blocks of flavor,

00:06:24.445 --> 00:06:25.460 align:middle line:90%
salt and pepper?

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.180 align:middle line:90%
>> I did salt, not pepper.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.980 align:middle line:90%
Pepper last.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And I put my lid
back on because I

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.350 align:middle line:84%
want to bring it back up to the
boil really, really quickly.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:33.090 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:33.490 align:middle line:90%
Good job.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Incredible.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:34.660 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.080 align:middle line:90%

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.080 align:middle line:90%

Nearly there.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.220 align:middle line:90%
My broccoli is looking hard.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.995 align:middle line:90%
My pasta, where are we at?

00:06:57.995 --> 00:06:59.100 align:middle line:90%
Oh, nearly there.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.100 align:middle line:90%
This is great timing.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.920 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Lit back on, bring
it to the boil.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.700 align:middle line:84%
As soon as it starts coming
up to a boil, lid off.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.400 align:middle line:90%
Let it cook a little bit longer.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.540 align:middle line:90%
OK, this is done.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.790 align:middle line:84%
So the next step is
grabbing a strainer

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:23.050 align:middle line:84%
into my beautiful
big sink of glory.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.720 align:middle line:90%
Taking it over here.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.860 align:middle line:90%
I want to get a bowl ready.

00:07:30.564 --> 00:07:33.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm almost ready.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.910 align:middle line:90%
This is the meal of all meals.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.762 align:middle line:90%
I'm straining into my strainer.

00:07:38.762 --> 00:07:40.255 align:middle line:90%
Give it a good shake.

00:07:40.255 --> 00:07:43.750 align:middle line:90%


00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:47.212 align:middle line:90%
Get all that water out.

00:07:47.212 --> 00:07:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Get a bit of a facial
while you're at it.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.720 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.710 align:middle line:90%


00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:56.000 align:middle line:84%
OK, I want a little bit
of olive oil for flavor.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.102 align:middle line:90%


00:08:00.102 --> 00:08:02.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to drizzle
a little bit on here--

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.470 align:middle line:90%
just a little bit.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Then it goes straight
into my bowl.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And that to me is the best meal
on the planet, broccoli pasta.

out and get takeaway,
