00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:12.610 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Spicy eggplant is-- it's one
of those dishes that is like

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.490 align:middle line:90%
a complement.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.290 align:middle line:90%
A complement?

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.680 align:middle line:90%
To an array of dishes.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.530 align:middle line:84%
So say I was having
dinner one night.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.363 align:middle line:84%
One night-- I have
dinner every night.

00:00:26.363 --> 00:00:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted something
a little bit more

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.780 align:middle line:84%
with some heat in there and
a little bit more Asian kind

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.820 align:middle line:90%
of flavors with the kaffir lime.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.280 align:middle line:84%
This is perfect,
and the sauce is

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.270 align:middle line:90%
extraordinary, and even cold.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.800 align:middle line:84%
I've had it the next day with
bits of eggplant in my salad.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.900 align:middle line:90%
So it's really awesome.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.590 align:middle line:84%
I've got my hot plate on, as
you can see, here on the stove.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.020 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of smoking
a bit, which is cool.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.390 align:middle line:84%
I've got these amazing long
eggplants from the market

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.540 align:middle line:84%
this morning, which are
really, really yummy.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And all I'm going to do is,
I'm going to cut these up.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.623 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are just
extraordinary colors.

00:00:59.623 --> 00:01:01.873 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to cut these up
and I'm going to grill them.

00:01:01.873 --> 00:01:03.850 align:middle line:84%
I just want some color
here, and a little bit

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.703 align:middle line:84%
of cooking as well, but
it's color I'm really after.

00:01:06.703 --> 00:01:08.620 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to cut
them longways, really

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.674 align:middle line:90%
simply like this.

00:01:12.674 --> 00:01:15.960 align:middle line:84%
This is such a really
easy dish, inspired to me,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.140 align:middle line:84%
and taught to me by a
lady in Bali, actually.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.760 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Ayu.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.510 align:middle line:90%
And she showed me this recipe.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.600 align:middle line:90%
I was very grateful.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Now you don't need
to salt these.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.480 align:middle line:84%
You can if you feel they're very
hard and really, really young,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.710 align:middle line:84%
just cut a little bit off
there and have a taste.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Now that's very sweet, so it
doesn't need salting at all.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.210 align:middle line:90%
So they're ready.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.640 align:middle line:84%
The next thing I'm going
to do is make up the paste.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Now I've got these gorgeous
little shallots here from Bali.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.350 align:middle line:90%
They're so cute and small.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.142 align:middle line:84%
In Australia we get
bigger ones than these.

00:01:51.142 --> 00:01:53.970 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you do see
these sizes in Australia.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.830 align:middle line:84%
But I've got these
ones the most.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.240 align:middle line:90%
We need a couple of them.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.780 align:middle line:84%
We need some chili,
some red chili,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.742 align:middle line:90%
and we need some garlic as well.

00:02:02.742 --> 00:02:07.068 align:middle line:84%
The eggplant's really
sweet, actually.

00:02:07.068 --> 00:02:08.856 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:08.856 --> 00:02:10.289 align:middle line:90%
Just pop that back there.

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.250 align:middle line:84%
I've got so much stuff
here from the market,

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.140 align:middle line:84%
which is lovely to
have it all around me.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.390 align:middle line:90%
It's really beautiful.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.303 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to do is
just chop this up roughly,

00:02:19.303 --> 00:02:20.720 align:middle line:84%
because we're going
to blend this.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.137 align:middle line:84%
We're going to cook this and
then we're going to blend it.

00:02:23.137 --> 00:02:29.207 align:middle line:90%


00:02:29.207 --> 00:02:30.040 align:middle line:90%
Just really roughly.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.210 align:middle line:90%


00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.310 align:middle line:90%
Get some garlic cloves.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.620 align:middle line:90%
Spicy eggplant-- this is--

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.830 align:middle line:84%
when I first had this,
I was so excited.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.520 align:middle line:90%
It rocked my world.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.340 align:middle line:90%
It really did.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.660 align:middle line:84%
There was a few
ingredients in here

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.660 align:middle line:84%
from Bali that we don't
have in other countries,

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.510 align:middle line:84%
so we've left them out, and
we've altered the recipe

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.610 align:middle line:90%
so everyone can make it.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And you're still
getting that lovely hint

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.020 align:middle line:84%
of that Asian feel through
there, that Asian flavors

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.330 align:middle line:90%
through there.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.890 align:middle line:90%


00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.160 align:middle line:84%
Notice how sometimes I leave
the skins on and just chop,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.090 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes I don't.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.465 align:middle line:84%
It just depends
on what I'm doing

00:03:11.465 --> 00:03:12.645 align:middle line:90%
with that particular dish.

00:03:12.645 --> 00:03:13.445 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:13.445 --> 00:03:17.495 align:middle line:84%
So there's my
garlic and my chili.

00:03:17.495 --> 00:03:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to do
the shallots, which

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take
the ends off like so,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.900 align:middle line:84%
and then just take
that first slice.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.500 align:middle line:84%
They're not at sharp in
flavor as onion and garlic,

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.310 align:middle line:90%
even red onion.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.360 align:middle line:84%
They're a softer, more
gentle, sweet flavor,

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.510 align:middle line:90%
these little shallots are.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:42.620 align:middle line:90%


00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.910 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.605 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm just going to
roughly chop them like that.

00:03:48.605 --> 00:03:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to put
all of these ingredients

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.070 align:middle line:90%
into a glass bowl, ready to go.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Some skins and garlic
in there as well--

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.100 align:middle line:84%
skins from the garlic
in there as well.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.607 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:03:59.607 --> 00:04:00.440 align:middle line:90%
Put that over there.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I want
is kaffir lime leaves.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.690 align:middle line:84%
Kaffir lime leaves are so
fragrant and so delicious,

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.140 align:middle line:90%
and they're also expensive.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.750 align:middle line:90%
So when I buy them--

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.000 align:middle line:84%
as you can see, my freezer's
all of these herbs.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.910 align:middle line:90%
I freeze them-- really good tip.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.540 align:middle line:84%
There's so many herbs
in that freezer.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.440 align:middle line:84%
There's curry leaves, there's
lemongrass, there's ginger,

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.750 align:middle line:84%
there's turmeric, just
depending on what I can get

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.240 align:middle line:90%
and what's in season.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to go buy
some kaffir lime leaves

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.020 align:middle line:90%
when you make this recipe.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's probably going
to be that much of them.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.090 align:middle line:90%
And you're going to use two.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So this is a really
good opportunity

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.490 align:middle line:90%
to freeze those leaves.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.290 align:middle line:90%
And they stay.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.248 align:middle line:90%
They're just beautiful.

00:04:37.248 --> 00:04:38.700 align:middle line:90%
They stay fragrant and lovely.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.500 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.252 align:middle line:90%
So we want a few of them.

00:04:42.252 --> 00:04:45.440 align:middle line:84%
I'll pop this back in the
freezer for next time.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Look, I've got a
curry leaves in here.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.330 align:middle line:90%
Check this out.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.660 align:middle line:90%
Still keeping their color.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.510 align:middle line:90%
It's all in here.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.090 align:middle line:90%
I've got frozen bananas.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.920 align:middle line:84%
I've got some frozen
chili in here.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.860 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.440 align:middle line:90%
It's good later, you know.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.430 align:middle line:84%
It's just a good
way to have stuff.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.010 align:middle line:84%
So kaffir lime leaf-- there's
two ways you can do this.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to bother.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean you can
take the stalk out,

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.600 align:middle line:90%
which I just rip like that.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.910 align:middle line:90%
It's no problem, like that.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:25.540 align:middle line:90%


00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.450 align:middle line:84%
I just roll it up,
nice and tightly.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to run
my knife through that.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.990 align:middle line:90%


00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.050 align:middle line:90%
Lovely, bubbly.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.850 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.130 align:middle line:90%
You can smell that already.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And to this-- so there's
three sections of this dish.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.333 align:middle line:84%
To this I'm going
to add my tomatoes.

00:05:45.333 --> 00:05:47.500 align:middle line:84%
This is what's going to
make the paste and the sauce

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.350 align:middle line:90%
part of this to be red--

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.900 align:middle line:84%
really, really,
really, really red.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.710 align:middle line:84%
So just cutting
roughly, these tomatoes.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.180 align:middle line:84%
If we're going to
be blending 'em,

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.730 align:middle line:84%
we just want them to
cook down a little bit.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:02.590 align:middle line:90%
Our sharp knife.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:09.200 align:middle line:90%


00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.000 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.970 align:middle line:84%
The heat from that hot plate,
I can feel that from here.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.090 align:middle line:84%
Actually I can, more
like smell it from here.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.620 align:middle line:90%
Lovely.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.837 align:middle line:84%
So the next stage is, I'm
going to put some oil on here.

00:06:22.837 --> 00:06:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Actually I'm going to put
some oil on my eggplant.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.370 align:middle line:84%
Some coconut oil
might be better,

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.720 align:middle line:84%
sort of putting it straight
and directly on the heat.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:38.010 align:middle line:90%


00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.810 align:middle line:90%
Even better yet.

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.184 align:middle line:90%


00:06:42.184 --> 00:06:43.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.960 align:middle line:90%
Ah, these are beautiful.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.031 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.031 --> 00:06:52.422 align:middle line:90%
Let that soak in there.

00:06:52.422 --> 00:06:54.582 align:middle line:90%
Just do this with it.

00:06:54.582 --> 00:06:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Get a bit of a rub, and
then straight onto here.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:02.570 align:middle line:90%


00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.510 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.680 align:middle line:90%
Just plopping them down.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.430 align:middle line:90%


00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Now these will really,
really suck up this oil.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:18.130 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I choose to just
put it on the eggplant first.

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:19.177 align:middle line:90%
See what happens, aye.

00:07:19.177 --> 00:07:20.510 align:middle line:90%
We might have to add more to it.

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.000 align:middle line:90%
We'll see what happens.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.583 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:07:24.583 --> 00:07:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Get the rest of
that oil on there.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.280 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.090 align:middle line:90%
The next part of this--

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.330 align:middle line:84%
just wash my hands, because
we're a bit oily now.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it makes
a good moisturizer.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:38.464 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:07:38.464 --> 00:07:41.210 align:middle line:90%


00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.080 align:middle line:84%
Actually makes a really
good moisturizer.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.090 align:middle line:90%
That's lovely.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.340 align:middle line:90%
Glad I thought of that.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:46.760 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.560 align:middle line:90%
We need a pan.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.080 align:middle line:90%


00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.630 align:middle line:90%
Put these aside a bit.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.665 align:middle line:84%
Don't want anything to
burn, all my goodies.

00:07:55.665 --> 00:07:58.285 align:middle line:90%


00:07:58.285 --> 00:08:00.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to cook the rest
of the other ingredients

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:02.250 align:middle line:90%
on this pan.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.850 align:middle line:84%
Now we need some tong, so we
know what we're doing just

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.890 align:middle line:90%
here, while this is happening.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:07.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.850 align:middle line:84%
We'll just check how
we're going here.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:11.770 align:middle line:90%
Ah, lovely color.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:12.570 align:middle line:90%
Lovely.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:23.385 align:middle line:90%


00:08:23.385 --> 00:08:24.762 align:middle line:90%
Oh, they smell good too.

00:08:24.762 --> 00:08:27.870 align:middle line:90%


00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:28.670 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.950 align:middle line:90%


00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:31.750 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.789 align:middle line:84%
So a little bit of
coconut oil into this pan.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:37.429 align:middle line:90%


00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
add our shallot,

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:46.370 align:middle line:90%
garlic, and chili first to this.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.610 align:middle line:90%
And some more salt and pepper--

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.180 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of salt and
pepper on there as well.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.930 align:middle line:84%
Not a lot, because
we're going to add that

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.320 align:middle line:90%
throughout the blending process.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.080 align:middle line:90%
Ah, it smells good.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.680 align:middle line:90%
Just let that heat up.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.180 align:middle line:84%
You can do this on
a barbecue, yeah.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.930 align:middle line:90%


00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Actually I do wish I had
a barbecue here in Bali,

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.236 align:middle line:90%
doing this outside.

00:09:12.236 --> 00:09:13.670 align:middle line:90%
A lovely color.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.340 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're after.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.328 align:middle line:84%
The sugars are really
coming out of there.

00:09:18.328 --> 00:09:20.620 align:middle line:84%
That's why things go brown,
yeah, they're caramelizing.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:26.000 align:middle line:84%
There's natural sugars in these
beautiful, sweet eggplants.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.587 align:middle line:84%
I won't add any
more oil just yet.

00:09:27.587 --> 00:09:29.420 align:middle line:84%
It is looking a little
bit dry, but I'm just

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.190 align:middle line:84%
going to leave that for a
minute, and let that cook down.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:34.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:34.990 align:middle line:90%
Now.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:39.865 align:middle line:90%


00:09:39.865 --> 00:09:41.820 align:middle line:90%
We're not after color here.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.260 align:middle line:84%
We're not after color
like here, for here.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.620 align:middle line:84%
We're just after this to
just [WHOOSH SOUND] marry.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Just, you know, release their
flavors and their goodness.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:56.400 align:middle line:90%


00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.200 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.520 align:middle line:90%
Bringing in the present moment.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.200 align:middle line:90%


00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.260 align:middle line:90%
I want that blistering look.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:06.060 align:middle line:90%
See that?

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.930 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm after.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:09.250 align:middle line:90%
I want that blistering.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:10.420 align:middle line:90%
Ah, yum.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.740 align:middle line:90%
This is awesome.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:12.680 align:middle line:90%
This makes me happy.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's not so hot
at the back there.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.385 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put one
of these babies there.

00:10:18.385 --> 00:10:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Because this is starting
to get a bit floppy,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.052 align:middle line:84%
so I might put this
one at the front there.

00:10:22.052 --> 00:10:26.000 align:middle line:84%
So just adjust your eggplant
to where that heat is.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.720 align:middle line:84%
It's really
important to do that.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.850 align:middle line:90%


00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Because my heat is
just in a circle here.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:37.415 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to find
what's cooking quicker.

00:10:37.415 --> 00:10:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm keeping them-- see
how I'm keeping the stalks on?

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:42.450 align:middle line:90%
Cause just I just want, to show.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.250 align:middle line:90%
And they look good too.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:46.050 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:47.920 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm going
to add my onion.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.508 align:middle line:84%
Add my onion, [LAUGHS] my tomato
and my chopped up kaffir lime

00:10:52.508 --> 00:10:53.550 align:middle line:90%
leaf on the bottom there.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:58.700 align:middle line:90%


00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.500 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.900 align:middle line:84%
The fragrance is coming
through now, folks.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:07.980 align:middle line:90%


00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.990 align:middle line:90%
I wish we had Smell-o-Vision.

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.790 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:13.920 align:middle line:90%
Get that really happening.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.045 align:middle line:90%
Did I lose something there?

00:11:15.045 --> 00:11:18.140 align:middle line:90%


00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.530 align:middle line:90%
Turn that down to a low.

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:22.200 align:middle line:84%
So we just mixed that
really carefully.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.700 align:middle line:90%
Well, carefully as you can.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:26.600 align:middle line:90%
Ah yeah.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.550 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:30.130 align:middle line:90%
And just let that cook.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:32.950 align:middle line:90%


00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Bam, bam, everything's
happening.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:40.410 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:42.290 align:middle line:90%
Fabulous.

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:43.090 align:middle line:90%
Fabulous.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:46.563 align:middle line:90%


00:11:46.563 --> 00:11:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Look at that, the water's
started to come out.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.280 align:middle line:90%
This is good.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.870 align:middle line:90%
This is what I'm after.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:53.940 align:middle line:90%
Really nice.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:12:00.330 align:middle line:90%


00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:01.360 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.160 align:middle line:90%
Happy days.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:08.417 align:middle line:90%


00:12:08.417 --> 00:12:10.500 align:middle line:84%
You know when you flick a
pan, a lot of people go,

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.840 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to flick a pan too.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:16.830 align:middle line:84%
You always push it
down, not too far.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.230 align:middle line:90%
You always push it--

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:19.030 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Push your ingredients to the
front and then pull back.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:23.700 align:middle line:90%
Front and pull back.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:28.150 align:middle line:90%


00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.950 align:middle line:90%
It's funny.

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:32.310 align:middle line:84%
When you become a chef, it's
the first thing you want to do.

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:36.100 align:middle line:84%
You want to master the cutting
fast and flicking the pan.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:36.900 align:middle line:90%
It's so ego.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.022 align:middle line:84%
It's so much ego,
it's ridiculous.

00:12:39.022 --> 00:12:43.490 align:middle line:90%


00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:45.440 align:middle line:90%
These are great.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.007 align:middle line:90%
I'm loving the color.

00:12:48.007 --> 00:12:49.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm loving everything
about these right now.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.575 align:middle line:90%


00:12:52.575 --> 00:12:54.200 align:middle line:84%
I might put this one
at the front here.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:59.490 align:middle line:90%


00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:00.980 align:middle line:90%
This is perfect, perfect.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:04.120 align:middle line:84%
It starting to split
open, all that gooeyness.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:04.920 align:middle line:90%
Mmm.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.157 align:middle line:90%
Look at that, bubbling through.

00:13:08.157 --> 00:13:08.990 align:middle line:90%
That's what we want.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:14.490 align:middle line:90%


00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:15.986 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:15.986 --> 00:13:20.660 align:middle line:84%
The next part of this
recipe is blending.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:21.620 align:middle line:90%
Now this is hot.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:26.270 align:middle line:84%
So take it easy, yeah,
when you're blending this.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:27.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to turn this off.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.390 align:middle line:84%
So this is cooked for
about three minutes.

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:30.190 align:middle line:90%
That's enough.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.400 align:middle line:90%


00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.200 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.470 align:middle line:90%


00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:38.270 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Be careful, yeah,
cause this is hot.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Just take it easy, getting
it into the Vitamix,

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:46.670 align:middle line:90%
as gracefully as you can.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:51.960 align:middle line:90%


00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:52.760 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:58.015 align:middle line:84%
And we want to definitely
scrape all this goodness out

00:13:58.015 --> 00:13:58.815 align:middle line:90%
from this pan.

00:13:58.815 --> 00:14:02.580 align:middle line:90%


00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:03.390 align:middle line:90%
Lovely, bubbly.

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:08.050 align:middle line:90%


00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:09.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, baby.

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:11.350 align:middle line:90%
Now we're going to blend this.

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.643 align:middle line:90%
Now, very important.

00:14:13.643 --> 00:14:15.060 align:middle line:84%
To the side, yeah,
cause it's hot.

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:23.988 align:middle line:90%


00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:24.860 align:middle line:90%
OK, wow.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.590 align:middle line:90%
Look at the color of that.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:28.860 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:29.660 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.120 align:middle line:90%
Back on.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:31.920 align:middle line:90%
Back into the pan.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:32.720 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.940 align:middle line:90%
Look at the color of that!

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.300 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.100 align:middle line:90%
Back to here.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.340 align:middle line:90%
Get that heat back on again.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.050 align:middle line:90%
Really easy here.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:45.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.080 align:middle line:90%
Now this is spicy.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.780 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:49.760 align:middle line:90%
And look at the color.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:50.560 align:middle line:90%
This is beautiful.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.990 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm going to taste.

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:55.392 align:middle line:90%
100% needs salt and pepper.

00:14:55.392 --> 00:14:56.991 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:56.991 --> 00:14:58.680 align:middle line:90%
100%.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And I want to get some more
of those kaffir lime leaves.

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:06.982 align:middle line:84%
I just want that fragrance
of these beautiful leaves--

00:15:06.982 --> 00:15:12.535 align:middle line:84%
where are they--
to come through.

00:15:12.535 --> 00:15:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'm just
going to get them,

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:16.000 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just going
to scrunch them.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000 align:middle line:84%
I've got four of
them in my hand here.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.490 align:middle line:84%
That's what I want, that
flavor coming through.

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:25.830 align:middle line:90%


00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.570 align:middle line:90%
Just let that cook a little bit.

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:31.120 align:middle line:90%


00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.700 align:middle line:90%
These are looking fabulous--

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.560 align:middle line:90%
nice and soft and gooey.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's what we were after.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.280 align:middle line:90%
Really beautiful.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.080 align:middle line:90%
Mmm.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.150 align:middle line:90%
Really lovely.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:47.460 align:middle line:90%
Very Balinese, this one.

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:51.798 align:middle line:90%


00:15:51.798 --> 00:15:56.340 align:middle line:90%
A bit more salt.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Now sometimes,
depending, I like to put

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.265 align:middle line:84%
a splash of honey in
there, just because

00:16:05.265 --> 00:16:06.390 align:middle line:90%
of that balance of flavors.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, and today
is one of those times.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.640 align:middle line:90%
Just a splash.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.290 align:middle line:90%
Nothing big.

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Just a little tiny
dribble like that,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.720 align:middle line:90%
toward that little bit of heat.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.040 align:middle line:84%
A little bit sweet coming
through with that heat.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:21.840 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.355 align:middle line:90%


00:16:25.355 --> 00:16:26.155 align:middle line:90%
Have a taste.

00:16:26.155 --> 00:16:29.920 align:middle line:90%


00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:30.970 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, baby.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:31.770 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:33.535 align:middle line:84%
Then I'm just
going to add these.

00:16:33.535 --> 00:16:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to bathe
these in this spicy mixture.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:45.265 align:middle line:84%
And they're just going to sit
in there and do their thing.

00:16:45.265 --> 00:16:50.380 align:middle line:90%


00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.265 align:middle line:90%
It's fabulous.

00:16:53.265 --> 00:16:54.065 align:middle line:90%
Really fabulous.

00:16:54.065 --> 00:17:00.490 align:middle line:90%


00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And I would serve that up
in this pan, just like that.

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.869 align:middle line:90%
And turn off the heat.

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:10.829 align:middle line:84%
I would totally take
that to the table

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:13.260 align:middle line:90%
and just serve it up like that.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:17.140 align:middle line:84%

rice salad with this.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:25.910 align:middle line:90%
Endless.

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:26.993 align:middle line:90%
This goes with everything.

00:17:26.993 --> 00:17:28.630 align:middle line:90%
Take it to a barbecue.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Chop up the eggplant, so
it's like in an condiment.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.070 align:middle line:84%
So this is like
a saucy condiment

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:36.730 align:middle line:90%

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:37.780 align:middle line:90%

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.240 align:middle line:90%
it's so luxurious, actually.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And especially this
eggplant that's all

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:47.020 align:middle line:90%
oozing and soft and yummy.

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And this will just sit in
there for a good 10 minutes.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:55.375 align:middle line:84%
And these flavors will
just come through.

00:17:55.375 --> 00:17:56.860 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:01.810 align:middle line:90%


00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:02.800 align:middle line:90%
Ah yeah.

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:06.760 align:middle line:90%
Ah yeah.

that's coming through.
