00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:12.660 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a lovely little
salad for a lovely little lunch,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.230 align:middle line:90%
barbecue.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.220 align:middle line:90%
Take it to work.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.833 align:middle line:84%
It's just something
really different.

00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:23.250 align:middle line:84%
The first thing
you're going to do

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.510 align:middle line:90%
is put your water on the boil.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.093 align:middle line:90%
So I've got a pot of water--

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:28.260 align:middle line:84%
and you know what that looks
like-- on the boil just

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.680 align:middle line:90%
over here.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's getting to a boiling
point to cook my soba noodles.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've got some
green tea soba noodles.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.920 align:middle line:90%
I love these noodles.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.510 align:middle line:90%
I think they're just delicious.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.235 align:middle line:90%
They're creamy texture.

00:00:38.235 --> 00:00:39.360 align:middle line:90%
They're just really lovely.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.660 align:middle line:90%
You can get buckwheat ones.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.320 align:middle line:90%
You can get green tea ones.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.120 align:middle line:90%
Have a look.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.670 align:middle line:90%
They have got wheat in them.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.473 align:middle line:84%
So if you are gluten
free, it's a no-go.

00:00:47.473 --> 00:00:49.140 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, if you're
celiac, that's a no-go.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.910 align:middle line:84%
If you're gluten free, a
lot of gluten-free people

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.368 align:middle line:84%
can handle it because it's half
and half buckwheat and half

00:00:53.368 --> 00:00:54.168 align:middle line:90%
wheat.

00:00:54.168 --> 00:00:55.230 align:middle line:90%
So remember that.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.670 align:middle line:90%
So water's on the boil.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going to cut
up all our ingredients, which

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.980 align:middle line:90%
is just awesome.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And there's going to be
a lovely little dressing

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.680 align:middle line:90%
to go with this as well.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.300 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with making
our dressing first, I think.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.940 align:middle line:90%
I think I know, I know I think.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.460 align:middle line:90%
Ginger-- I love ginger.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.130 align:middle line:84%
I love, love, love the
fragrance of ginger.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.930 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to wash this.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.155 align:middle line:84%
We only need a couple
of tablespoons of this.

00:01:22.155 --> 00:01:26.490 align:middle line:84%
So if you do buy some ginger
and it's quite a big piece

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.790 align:middle line:84%
and you only need a couple of
tablespoons, freeze it, OK?

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.830 align:middle line:84%
Freeze it in your
freezer in a Ziploc bag

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.110 align:middle line:90%
so you have it for another day.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.210 align:middle line:90%
So just grate some ginger.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Love the microplanes
because I make it so fine.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.830 align:middle line:90%
It's really great.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.118 align:middle line:90%
It's a great grater.

00:01:45.118 --> 00:01:48.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.130 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I made a joke.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.530 align:middle line:84%
No, really, that's
the first joke

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.113 align:middle line:84%
I've made throughout
the whole series.

00:01:54.113 --> 00:01:56.550 align:middle line:90%


00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.280 align:middle line:84%
So I've got all of this left,
and I'm not going to use it.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Just pretend I am, but I'm
not, but I'm not, but I am.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.140 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, freeze it.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.380 align:middle line:90%
Definitely do that.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:13.590 align:middle line:84%
I want some tamari, and
I want some maple syrup.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.930 align:middle line:90%
Yummy.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:15.988 align:middle line:90%
I love soy sauce.

00:02:15.988 --> 00:02:16.905 align:middle line:90%
I think it's gorgeous.

00:02:16.905 --> 00:02:19.824 align:middle line:90%


00:02:19.824 --> 00:02:21.350 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah, it gets you present.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.640 align:middle line:84%
I just thought then
it was something else.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.690 align:middle line:90%
Just for the sweetener.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.330 align:middle line:90%
OK, what else do I need here?

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.490 align:middle line:90%
Sesame seed oil-- yes.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the toasted flavor
is just beautiful.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:90%
Just a wee bit of that.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And I want to give
this a mix, and I

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.496 align:middle line:84%
want to taste it and see
if it's up to standard.

00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:47.240 align:middle line:90%
It looks so good.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.720 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.580 align:middle line:90%
Just beautiful.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.842 align:middle line:90%
A wee bit of water--

00:02:50.842 --> 00:02:52.050 align:middle line:90%
what a great little dressing.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.445 align:middle line:90%


00:02:55.445 --> 00:02:56.300 align:middle line:90%
So good.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.500 align:middle line:90%


00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.940 align:middle line:90%
A bit more soy.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.370 align:middle line:90%
All righty.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.090 align:middle line:90%
Dressing is done.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.245 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:08.245 --> 00:03:09.045 align:middle line:90%
Set that aside.

00:03:09.045 --> 00:03:11.550 align:middle line:90%


00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:12.450 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.870 align:middle line:90%
Just beautiful.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.245 align:middle line:84%
Next thing I'm going to do is
cut up all our ingredients.

00:03:16.245 --> 00:03:18.170 align:middle line:90%
So I need a red onion.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you don't like a lot
of onion, just use half this.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.940 align:middle line:84%
You definitely don't have
to use the whole amount, OK?

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.340 align:middle line:90%
Just use half or a quarter.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want it into
really thin slices

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.000 align:middle line:90%
because this is raw onion.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.770 align:middle line:90%
We're not cooking this.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.380 align:middle line:84%
So super thin-- if you can get
them as thin as you possibly

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.490 align:middle line:90%
can.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.328 align:middle line:90%
And how you can do that--

00:03:40.328 --> 00:03:42.120 align:middle line:84%
just make sure everything's
off your board.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.230 align:middle line:90%
It's on a storage center.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Remember that because
that's how you cut yourself.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.560 align:middle line:84%
So fingers in the onion and then
slowly getting as thin as you

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.400 align:middle line:90%
possibly can.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:00.930 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.617 align:middle line:90%
So I'm letting my fingers--

00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:03.700 align:middle line:90%
they're straight in there.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.550 align:middle line:90%
I can't cut my nail.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just getting
it super thin.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.290 align:middle line:90%
It's almost--

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm just catching the onion.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.110 align:middle line:90%
That's how thin it is.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.399 align:middle line:84%
It takes time,
actually, to do this,

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:18.040 align:middle line:84%
to take your time
when you're doing it.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.720 align:middle line:90%


00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.780 align:middle line:90%
All righty.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.870 align:middle line:90%
I need a garlic clove.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.070 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my water's boiling.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.080 align:middle line:90%
That's awesome.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.480 align:middle line:90%
Just 1 garlic clove--

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.080 align:middle line:84%
I want to grate this just
like I did the ginger.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't particularly
want big chunks of garlic

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.170 align:middle line:84%
in there, even though there's
nothing wrong with that.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.030 align:middle line:90%


00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.100 align:middle line:90%
Don't leave me.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.600 align:middle line:84%
All right, I'm just going to
grate this on top of the onion.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.790 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.110 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.550 align:middle line:90%
I want some spring onion.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.470 align:middle line:90%


00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.485 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's have a look here.

00:05:03.485 --> 00:05:05.110 align:middle line:84%
All those bits that
don't look too good

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.710 align:middle line:84%
can go straight into
the compost bin.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.200 align:middle line:90%


00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.827 align:middle line:84%
All right, nice and thin
round circles, very thin.

00:05:14.827 --> 00:05:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Getting to the end here, I've
got all these little bits.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.120 align:middle line:90%
Just slowly cut through them.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.450 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if they're
not all the same size.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:22.480 align:middle line:90%
Do the best you can.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.640 align:middle line:90%
Look at them.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.773 align:middle line:90%
All right, put that aside.

00:05:26.773 --> 00:05:27.690 align:middle line:90%
I want some coriander.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.736 align:middle line:90%
This is such a cool salad.

00:05:29.736 --> 00:05:35.450 align:middle line:84%
It just fits into our feeling
today, actually, something

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:41.144 align:middle line:90%
fruity and light as well.

00:05:41.144 --> 00:05:45.402 align:middle line:84%
OK, just nice big
chunks of this--

00:05:45.402 --> 00:05:49.200 align:middle line:84%
just running it all through
right down to the stalk.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.000 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.730 align:middle line:90%
Set that aside.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:52.730 align:middle line:90%
Now you need some basil.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.122 align:middle line:90%


00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:57.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you get
basil-- remember,

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.320 align:middle line:90%
I've spoken about this before--

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.772 align:middle line:84%
if you get any seeds
like this one--

00:06:02.772 --> 00:06:05.530 align:middle line:90%
oh, hello.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.040 align:middle line:84%
If you get any seeds like
this here, just keep them.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.252 align:middle line:90%
Just do this.

00:06:10.252 --> 00:06:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, don't throw them away
because a lot of flavor's

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.193 align:middle line:90%
in that, lots of flavor.

00:06:17.193 --> 00:06:18.860 align:middle line:84%
People come and go
all the time in here.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.350 align:middle line:90%
It's hilarious.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.350 align:middle line:90%
It's like we're filming.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:28.820 align:middle line:90%


00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.325 align:middle line:84%
All right, go
through all of this.

00:06:31.325 --> 00:06:32.200 align:middle line:90%
What else do we need?

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.698 align:middle line:90%
We need some parsley.

00:06:34.698 --> 00:06:35.740 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful, isn't it?

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.720 align:middle line:90%
So many herbs in this.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.910 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to chop those
woody parts just off the bottom

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.623 align:middle line:84%
here, just as you can
see, just here off.

00:06:46.623 --> 00:06:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going
to run my knife

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.650 align:middle line:84%
through this just briefly,
even the stalks as well.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:54.800 align:middle line:90%
Push that to the side.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.380 align:middle line:90%
So that's ready.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.436 align:middle line:90%
Now I need my mango.

00:06:59.436 --> 00:07:00.415 align:middle line:90%
Now, look at these.

00:07:00.415 --> 00:07:03.970 align:middle line:84%
These are green, but
inside they're yellow

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:07.180 align:middle line:90%
and they're ready to eat.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.920 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful, just beautiful.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.710 align:middle line:84%
We're in Bali,
Indonesia where this

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.320 align:middle line:90%
is how the mangoes come to us.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.870 align:middle line:90%


00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.548 align:middle line:90%
Amazing, isn't it?

00:07:21.548 --> 00:07:23.090 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't think
it would be ready.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.850 align:middle line:90%


00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.826 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it smells so good.

00:07:28.826 --> 00:07:32.120 align:middle line:90%
OK, now, you want to make sure--

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.620 align:middle line:90%
like I can feel the seed.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm running my knife
directly on top of the seed.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.200 align:middle line:84%
So there's a seed there--
same as the other side.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.193 align:middle line:90%
Sharp knife-- be very careful.

00:07:45.193 --> 00:07:46.610 align:middle line:84%
These are slippery
little suckers.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:47.540 align:middle line:90%
You can cut yourself.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:48.485 align:middle line:90%
So be really careful.

00:07:48.485 --> 00:07:51.170 align:middle line:90%


00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.460 align:middle line:90%
That was like a fish.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:57.410 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.860 align:middle line:90%
OK, and then into dice--

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.660 align:middle line:84%
so nice big chunks
I want in this.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.450 align:middle line:90%


00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm imagining mangoes
aren't in season.

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:08.690 align:middle line:90%
What would you use?

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:12.077 align:middle line:84%
A peach-- you could
definitely use a peach.

00:08:12.077 --> 00:08:13.160 align:middle line:90%
You could use a nectarine.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.600 align:middle line:90%
You could use pineapple.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.905 align:middle line:90%
What else could you use?

00:08:15.905 --> 00:08:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>> I was thinking of a pear.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Pear-- awesome.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:19.430 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:middle line:90%
I'd totally use a pear.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.750 align:middle line:84%
Strawberries-- you
could use strawberries.

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.760 align:middle line:84%
So don't feel like you
just have to use mangoes.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Papaya?

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Papaya-- absolutely.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:33.409 align:middle line:84%
You could definitely
use papaya--

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:35.590 align:middle line:90%
studio audience.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.299 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to put my soba
noodles straight in here

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:39.539 align:middle line:90%
into the boiling water.

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:41.400 align:middle line:84%
So come over here
and have a look.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.419 align:middle line:90%
Go straight into the hot water.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:44.870 align:middle line:90%
These are going to take minutes.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.990 align:middle line:84%
So we're just going
to watch that.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Everything else is ready
over here, which is cool.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:54.810 align:middle line:90%
I want to put my pan on.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:57.518 align:middle line:84%
So I want it nice and hot
here and to really heat up.

00:08:57.518 --> 00:08:59.310 align:middle line:84%
What I'm going to do
is cook some eggplant.

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.100 align:middle line:90%
Now, have a look at this.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:05.600 align:middle line:84%
I've got two types of eggplant
here, which the same thing

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.498 align:middle line:90%
really, but this one's ripe.

00:09:07.498 --> 00:09:08.540 align:middle line:90%
This one's getting there.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.700 align:middle line:90%
Is that right, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:10.910 align:middle line:90%
Is this one not ripe yet?

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh no, there is
different kinds.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Different kind.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>> That is green--

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Green.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>> --that one.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>> So this is ready?

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:20.950 align:middle line:90%
>> The things you find in Bali--

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:21.950 align:middle line:90%
take a look at everyone.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.820 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE] Say hi.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:24.776 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:09:24.776 --> 00:09:27.650 align:middle line:90%


00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:28.887 align:middle line:90%
>> This is awesome.

00:09:28.887 --> 00:09:30.470 align:middle line:84%
I always thought
that it wasn't ready,

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.300 align:middle line:90%
but it's just a different type.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.750 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:34.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Small and a big one.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.238 align:middle line:84%
I'm just cutting
these into rounds.

00:09:37.238 --> 00:09:40.490 align:middle line:90%


00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you don't get
eggplant like this at home

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:46.642 align:middle line:84%
and you get those standard
brown ones, it's totally fine.

00:09:46.642 --> 00:09:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And actually, in Bali,
there's these little eggplants

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:50.350 align:middle line:90%
that are about this round.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:52.120 align:middle line:84%
They're green, really
hard and green.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.930 align:middle line:84%
I always thought they weren't
ripe, and they're beautiful.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.190 align:middle line:90%
OK, so they're cooking nicely.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:03.540 align:middle line:84%
We're going to put our
eggplant straight onto here

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:08.810 align:middle line:84%
in some coconut oil in a
pan that's on medium heat.

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to add a little
bit of salt and pepper to this.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to let
these cook until they're

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:17.530 align:middle line:90%
brown on each side, OK?

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:18.490 align:middle line:90%
Really important.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:20.310 align:middle line:84%
These noodles are
going to take seconds,

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:22.750 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to get
myself ready and make sure

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:26.340 align:middle line:84%
that I've got a strainer ready,
I've got water in my sink,

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.790 align:middle line:90%
obviously.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:29.770 align:middle line:84%
I've got water in
my tap-- sorry--

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:34.370 align:middle line:84%
so my sink is ready and clean
to take this on when I need it.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:35.420 align:middle line:90%
Everything else is ready.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:36.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling very calm.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.130 align:middle line:90%
Everything's great.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.380 align:middle line:84%
One thing about soba noodles,
they do come to the boil

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.090 align:middle line:90%
and they tend to boil over.

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:45.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure why, but they do.

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:47.500 align:middle line:90%
Have a look at them.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.980 align:middle line:84%
They don't take long
at all to get ready.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:52.960 align:middle line:90%
They're amazing.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.550 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to stay
with this, let this boil,

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:58.840 align:middle line:84%
watch this, know that's
ready, and just kind of just

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.110 align:middle line:84%
ride into it and be
at peace with it.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:03.850 align:middle line:90%
This is a really cool salad.

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:07.280 align:middle line:84%
This is really delicious
and quite yummy.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.080 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.122 align:middle line:90%
So we want this to brown.

00:11:09.122 --> 00:11:11.722 align:middle line:90%


00:11:11.722 --> 00:11:13.780 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I want you to
know with eggplant--

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.700 align:middle line:84%
this is really cool--
that you can keep

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.130 align:middle line:84%
adding more oil and more
oil and more oil thinking

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:19.090 align:middle line:90%
that you need more oil.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:20.090 align:middle line:90%
Just be mindful of that.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:23.080 align:middle line:84%
I've added a good splash of oil,
and it sucked it up, all of it,

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.200 align:middle line:84%
like it's gone right
into the eggplant.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.260 align:middle line:90%
It's quite awesome.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And I've got this on
quite a high heat.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And I want to cook it so that
it's golden brown, and it takes

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:33.430 align:middle line:90%
time, OK?

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:35.180 align:middle line:90%
So don't keep adding oil.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.380 align:middle line:90%
Make sure you--

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.530 align:middle line:84%
I drag the eggplants
around and scoop up

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:41.490 align:middle line:84%
any oil that's around
there and suck that in.

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I do turn it over,
I do add a splash to that next

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.875 align:middle line:84%
when I'm turning it over, but
not again after I've done this.

00:11:47.875 --> 00:11:49.000 align:middle line:90%
These are coming on nicely.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do I know
when they're cooked?

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:51.210 align:middle line:90%
It's just like.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.800 align:middle line:90%
Pasta it's the same, same thing.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.390 align:middle line:90%
You just want to test it.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't want these
to be al dente, OK?

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.590 align:middle line:84%
I want them to be
really cooked properly.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:02.365 align:middle line:84%
Soba noodles aren't
supposed to be al dente--

00:12:02.365 --> 00:12:03.490 align:middle line:90%
well, in my opinion anyway.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.730 align:middle line:90%


00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:06.530 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.300 align:middle line:84%
This is minutes and
they're nearly done.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.380 align:middle line:90%
That's awesome.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.725 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to turn these
over, these little eggplants,

00:12:14.725 --> 00:12:17.180 align:middle line:90%
and get the other side.

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.462 align:middle line:90%
Nice color.

00:12:19.462 --> 00:12:21.670 align:middle line:84%
So this is when I am going
to add a little bit of oil

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:27.700 align:middle line:84%
to this side, a little bit more
coconut oil, just a little.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:32.060 align:middle line:90%


00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Just roll that oil
around in your pan.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.990 align:middle line:90%
Give your pan a shake.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.250 align:middle line:84%
You see a lot of
chefs doing this.

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:39.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a good idea.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.570 align:middle line:84%
So what it does is it turns the
food around, the ingredients

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:47.930 align:middle line:84%
around, into the pan, and the
oil actually grabs onto that.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:49.970 align:middle line:90%
Cast-iron pans are fantastic.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.670 align:middle line:90%
These will be done, I reckon.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:53.780 align:middle line:90%
Just minutes these take.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Read the packet of
your soba noodles.

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:58.010 align:middle line:84%
This is a green
tea one, this one.

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:02.305 align:middle line:84%
So it's dyed in a
green tea powder, which

00:13:02.305 --> 00:13:05.845 align:middle line:90%
is kind of awesome, really.

00:13:05.845 --> 00:13:07.250 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Not quite-- nearly,
very, very nearly.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.040 align:middle line:90%
We wait.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:18.560 align:middle line:90%


00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.990 align:middle line:90%
Lovely bubbly.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:24.062 align:middle line:84%
Look at the color on
these little suckers.

00:13:24.062 --> 00:13:25.145 align:middle line:90%
So I'm turning them twice.

00:13:25.145 --> 00:13:34.410 align:middle line:90%


00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:37.310 align:middle line:90%
OK, have a look here.

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:46.700 align:middle line:90%


00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.070 align:middle line:90%
[VOCALIZING]

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:51.300 align:middle line:90%


00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.140 align:middle line:90%
Strain into here.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, they will stick
together-- so running water

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:57.780 align:middle line:90%
straight over soba noodles.

00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.130 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:02.880 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah, oh yeah--

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.490 align:middle line:90%
straight over them.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.650 align:middle line:90%
Cool them down immediately, OK?

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.540 align:middle line:90%
This is a salad.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:10.500 align:middle line:90%
It's not a hot pasta.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:15.670 align:middle line:90%


00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.700 align:middle line:90%
Oh, these are beautiful.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:22.080 align:middle line:84%
OK, make sure all
that water comes out.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.430 align:middle line:90%
I can hear my eggplant cooking.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.815 align:middle line:90%


00:14:25.815 --> 00:14:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Never stress when
you're cooking.

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:28.990 align:middle line:90%
Know that that's OK.

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:31.750 align:middle line:90%
Know that this is OK.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.210 align:middle line:84%
Time-- takes time to
fall in love with food.

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:36.460 align:middle line:84%
It takes time to
get the confidence

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.380 align:middle line:84%
to run from one
thing to the other.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.720 align:middle line:84%
So don't knock
yourself when something

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.460 align:middle line:84%
burns or fails because it's
never a failure, right?

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:46.820 align:middle line:90%
It's never a failure.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.810 align:middle line:84%
It's always an opportunity
to be more present.

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:50.610 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:54.080 align:middle line:90%


00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Can you pass me the
paper towels, Scott?

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:57.680 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, mate.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:03.210 align:middle line:90%


00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:05.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to put
some paper towel--

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:06.050 align:middle line:90%
thank you--

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:07.220 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>> --on this just to
suck up any extra oil.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.970 align:middle line:90%


00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Oh yeah, they were ripped
skillfully, weren't they?

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:18.440 align:middle line:90%


00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm at home.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:20.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm in my kitchen.

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm teaching you guys.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.930 align:middle line:90%
We're doing this together.

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:28.580 align:middle line:84%
No fancy master
chefisms going on here.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.565 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's get this
party started.

00:15:31.565 --> 00:15:34.410 align:middle line:90%


00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:37.790 align:middle line:90%
That was really noisy.

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Grab some of these
delicious noodles.

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:43.537 align:middle line:84%
So all the water's come out
of them, which is awesome.

00:15:43.537 --> 00:15:45.870 align:middle line:84%
This is going to feed, like,
how many of us-- all of us,

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:48.160 align:middle line:84%
really, isn't it, at
the end of the day.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.040 align:middle line:84%
OK, straight away
I want to put some

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.070 align:middle line:84%
of that dressing
on those noodles

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:57.850 align:middle line:84%
so it just sucks up this
flavor straight away.

00:15:57.850 --> 00:15:58.650 align:middle line:90%
Leave some aside.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:02.767 align:middle line:90%


00:16:02.767 --> 00:16:03.600 align:middle line:90%
Give it a good toss.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:11.490 align:middle line:90%


00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:12.440 align:middle line:90%
Give a good mix.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:16.380 align:middle line:90%


00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:17.180 align:middle line:90%
More dressing.

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:21.510 align:middle line:90%


00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:23.980 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:26.288 align:middle line:90%
Give it a really good mix.

00:16:26.288 --> 00:16:28.080 align:middle line:84%
Try not to break them
up when you mix them.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.180 align:middle line:90%
Just be very gentle.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.170 align:middle line:90%
OK, bit of salt and pepper.

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:36.807 align:middle line:90%


00:16:36.807 --> 00:16:37.607 align:middle line:90%
Lovely.

00:16:37.607 --> 00:16:40.570 align:middle line:90%


00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.000 align:middle line:90%
Can you smell that?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.290 align:middle line:90%
Can you smell it, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:47.755 align:middle line:84%
They're saying yes, but like
this, because they're all

00:16:47.755 --> 00:16:48.555 align:middle line:90%
told to be quiet.

00:16:48.555 --> 00:16:52.210 align:middle line:90%


00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:54.690 align:middle line:90%
OK, have a taste.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:55.490 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:17:00.730 align:middle line:90%


00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.620 align:middle line:90%
It's so good.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:08.210 align:middle line:84%
OK, my onion-- my
onion, my spring onion.

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.360 align:middle line:84%
My garlic's going to
go straight in there,

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.079 align:middle line:84%
bit of the other
herbs, does matter,

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:14.329 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
quickly mix this around.

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:15.770 align:middle line:90%
Get this all incorporated.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.500 align:middle line:90%
Break up the onion.

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:19.579 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:21.020 align:middle line:84%
My eggplant's going
to go in next.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.940 align:middle line:84%
It's cooled down enough
for me to handle.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.300 align:middle line:90%
So my eggplant's in.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And now my herbs, half my
herbs, and half my mango

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:33.950 align:middle line:90%
going to go in.

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's kind of more
than half, isn't it?

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:41.570 align:middle line:84%
OK, now I want a delicious
plate that I can serve this on.

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:42.710 align:middle line:90%
I got people coming over.

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:45.590 align:middle line:90%


00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:47.105 align:middle line:90%
OK, put that to the side.

00:17:47.105 --> 00:17:51.930 align:middle line:90%


00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:52.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes, use your hands.

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:59.460 align:middle line:90%


00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.530 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the best
salads I've ever made.

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.900 align:middle line:90%


00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:05.700 align:middle line:90%
No joke.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to put some
more mango and herbs on there,

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:17.310 align:middle line:84%
and then I want to put
this last bit on top.

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:21.865 align:middle line:84%
And then make sure all
that dressing is on there.

00:18:21.865 --> 00:18:22.665 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:18:22.665 --> 00:18:27.642 align:middle line:90%


00:18:27.642 --> 00:18:29.790 align:middle line:90%
It's that good.

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:32.100 align:middle line:84%
If you want to put some chili,
put some chili on there.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.308 align:middle line:84%
If you want to put some
nuts, put some nuts on there.

00:18:34.308 --> 00:18:37.420 align:middle line:90%


00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.990 align:middle line:90%
Get it all mixed.

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh, hello.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:49.390 align:middle line:90%


00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:56.750 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the most
delicious salads I've ever had.

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember, if you
can't get the mango-- what

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.958 align:middle line:84%
did we decide on, Scott, if
you can't get the mango--

00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:02.150 align:middle line:90%
a peach, a pear.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Papaya.

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:03.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Papaya.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.680 align:middle line:90%
What else did we say--

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.520 align:middle line:84%
papaya, peach, a pear,
pineapple, apple.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.680 align:middle line:90%


00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And there we go, a beautiful,
stunning, stunning, yummy,

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.690 align:middle line:84%
delicious, saturated in
that ginger and that tamari

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:25.940 align:middle line:84%
and, oh my goodness,
this goodness

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.010 align:middle line:90%
of epic glory and this mango.

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:31.110 align:middle line:90%
I've got to stop talking.

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:32.470 align:middle line:90%
Mm, mm.

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:35.010 align:middle line:90%


00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:35.810 align:middle line:90%
Some nuts.

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:39.594 align:middle line:90%


00:19:39.594 --> 00:19:42.410 align:middle line:84%
You could even put some
seeds on there if you like--

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:46.340 align:middle line:84%
black sesame seeds
just for show.

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:47.750 align:middle line:90%
This is my favorite salad.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:50.630 align:middle line:90%
Now, what if you're gluten free?

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:52.760 align:middle line:90%
What if you're gluten free?

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.650 align:middle line:90%
Use a rice noodle.

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:57.920 align:middle line:90%
Use a gluten-free noodle.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:58.760 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy this, guys.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:02.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad I got to cook
this with you guys.

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:03.710 align:middle line:90%
Have fun.

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:05.120 align:middle line:90%
Have fun with this one.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.890 align:middle line:90%
This is just beautiful.

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:09.135 align:middle line:90%
I could eat that whole plate.

00:20:09.135 --> 00:20:11.010 align:middle line:84%
I actually really could
eat that whole plate.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:13.580 align:middle line:90%


00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.920 align:middle line:90%
There we go, soba noodle salad.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:16.820 align:middle line:90%
Great for a barbecue.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:17.930 align:middle line:90%
Great, great any time.

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Christmas would be
awesome, actually.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:21.140 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy this.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:29.076 align:middle line:90%


00:20:29.076 --> 00:20:30.068 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:30.068 --> 00:20:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Fix it.

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.052 align:middle line:90%
>> Now?

00:20:32.052 --> 00:20:35.130 align:middle line:90%
OK, now?

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:38.130 align:middle line:90%
[VOCALIZING]

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:48.477 align:middle line:90%


00:20:48.477 --> 00:20:49.770 align:middle line:90%
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:50.800 align:middle line:90%
I got this.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.600 align:middle line:90%
I got this.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.300 align:middle line:90%
Hang on.

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.200 align:middle line:90%
Shoot.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.950 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.
