00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.940 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.870 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I made this dish
once, and I loved it.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.200 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was awesome.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.690 align:middle line:90%
And it was something that I--

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.092 align:middle line:90%
I bloody love it.

00:00:20.092 --> 00:00:21.300 align:middle line:90%
That's all I can say, really.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm something I'm so glad
to pass on to you guys at home.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.810 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of my version
of French toast.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.672 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know what
French toast even means,

00:00:30.672 --> 00:00:32.130 align:middle line:84%
but I'm just going
to call it that.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Because anything with
an egg wash apparently

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.340 align:middle line:90%
is called French toast.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Nothing to do with the
French, as our French editor

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.080 align:middle line:90%
in the background tells us.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.490 align:middle line:84%
So I've got some
brown bread here

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.690 align:middle line:90%
that I've put in the fridge.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.523 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the
most important things

00:00:44.523 --> 00:00:45.900 align:middle line:90%
that I found with making this.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.220 align:middle line:84%
It was easier when it was
in the fridge and cold.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.020 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.770 align:middle line:84%
So that was something I didn't
realize until I made it.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.210 align:middle line:90%
Make sure it's cold, Cynthia.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.780 align:middle line:90%
So brown bread.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.800 align:middle line:84%
I've got some beautiful,
good quality brown bread.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.605 align:middle line:90%
You could use gluten-free bread.

00:01:00.605 --> 00:01:01.980 align:middle line:84%
You could use any
bread you like,

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.709 align:middle line:84%
a sourdough, any kind
of grain you like.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:07.890 align:middle line:84%
I love kamut, and I love
spelt. I think it's exquisite.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.640 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first
thing I'm going to do.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.098 align:middle line:84%
The second thing
I'm going to do is

00:01:11.098 --> 00:01:12.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to cut up my herbs.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.880 align:middle line:90%
So get up in here.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.790 align:middle line:84%
I've got some spring onions
here, so I want some of these.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And having all these
herbs and food around me,

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.292 align:middle line:84%
it actually makes me
feel really comfortable.

00:01:26.292 --> 00:01:27.190 align:middle line:90%
I know, right?

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Comfortable.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.220 align:middle line:84%
I just want to take
the ends off those.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.420 align:middle line:90%
Super, super comfortable.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.400 align:middle line:84%
I feel like life's
easy when there's

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.960 align:middle line:90%
food's smuttered all around me.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.940 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.970 align:middle line:90%
Smuttered?

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.014 align:middle line:90%
Is that a word, smuttered?

00:01:40.014 --> 00:01:42.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
what that word means.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.310 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait for you guys
to actually write in and go,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.400 align:middle line:90%
Cynthia, you said this word.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.590 align:middle line:90%
Cynthia, you said that word.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.950 align:middle line:90%
I think it's awesome.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.740 align:middle line:90%
I've got some parsley.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.900 align:middle line:90%
I just want some of this.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.770 align:middle line:90%
Bring it home.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Ah, this is good
parsley, lots of parsley.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.510 align:middle line:90%
And I just want to chop this up.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm quite fine.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.720 align:middle line:90%
In other words-- give me that.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.780 align:middle line:90%
Put that there.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.770 align:middle line:90%
What I mean by quite fine--

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.770 align:middle line:84%
make sure you've got
a sharp knife too.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't want them
too big of pieces.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.150 align:middle line:84%
So I've got my herbs
together like this.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to fold this
over, kind of roll it around,

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.580 align:middle line:84%
tip it this way just
so I can handle it.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.380 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.572 align:middle line:84%
If you can't handle
that much, use half.

00:02:26.572 --> 00:02:27.780 align:middle line:90%
And I always get rid of that.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.322 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to cut
that up in a minute.

00:02:29.322 --> 00:02:32.990 align:middle line:84%
But I just want it
to be quite fine.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.640 align:middle line:84%
So chop this up as
you can manage it.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.580 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.600 align:middle line:90%
Just coming up to the last bits.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.610 align:middle line:90%
Smells delicious, very fresh.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.990 align:middle line:90%
Parsley just gives me--

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.420 align:middle line:84%
I feel, when I cut
parsley, a freshness

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.440 align:middle line:84%
to my food and a
lightness to my food.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.088 align:middle line:90%
So running a nice knife through.

00:02:53.088 --> 00:02:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you run
your knife through,

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.750 align:middle line:84%
I've got my hand,
my fingers here,

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.680 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just sliding
my knife through.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.500 align:middle line:84%
We call it running our knives
through those last little bits

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.300 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.980 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:08.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.372 align:middle line:90%
So that's done.

00:03:11.372 --> 00:03:15.320 align:middle line:84%
The next thing I want to do
is definitely put my pan on.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.030 align:middle line:84%
So I've got a cast iron pan
here, which I love cast iron.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.830 align:middle line:90%
I use cast iron.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.640 align:middle line:84%
I've got it on low because I
don't want it super, super hot.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.810 align:middle line:90%
What else do we need here?

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.370 align:middle line:90%
We need a glass bowl.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to crack
our eggs into this.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to need another
bowl because I don't want

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.000 align:middle line:90%
to add all the eggs at once.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.140 align:middle line:84%
Because I find what
happens sometimes--

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.120 align:middle line:84%
Mother Nature has its way,
and one egg can ruin it all.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.250 align:middle line:90%
So one at a time.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.270 align:middle line:90%
And our last egg.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.790 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:53.990 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Now I need to add
some milk into this.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.760 align:middle line:90%
Up to you what you want to use.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.560 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.270 align:middle line:90%
Completely up to you.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.280 align:middle line:90%
I've used oatmeal.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.540 align:middle line:90%
I've used soy milk.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.770 align:middle line:90%
I've used rice milk.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.518 align:middle line:84%
I've used really
weak almond milk.

00:04:10.518 --> 00:04:12.560 align:middle line:84%
In other words, what's a
really weak almond milk?

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.430 align:middle line:84%
So something like 1 cup of
nuts to 5 cups of water,

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.581 align:middle line:90%
something along those lines.

00:04:18.581 --> 00:04:20.289 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to
put all this in there.

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:26.420 align:middle line:84%
You're going to add all your
herbs to this eggy wash.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.265 align:middle line:84%
You're going to add
salt and pepper.

00:04:29.265 --> 00:04:30.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember, your
pan is on, and it's

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.880 align:middle line:84%
on low, which is important--
super, super low.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.100 align:middle line:90%


00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:39.920 align:middle line:90%
Give this a good whisk.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:50.090 align:middle line:90%


00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.460 align:middle line:90%
Really simple ingredients.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.880 align:middle line:90%
Good fun.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.830 align:middle line:90%
Let's cook.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:56.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.650 align:middle line:90%
This is nice and warm.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't want it too hot,
so I want low heat, OK?

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.120 align:middle line:90%
Really, really important.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.000 align:middle line:84%
I've got my olive
oil ready, and I've

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.750 align:middle line:84%
got my eggy bread
ready over here.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Put everything on
the slow stove.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.040 align:middle line:90%
Be nice and slow.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.990 align:middle line:90%
Allow things to happen.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.110 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
pop that in there,

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.760 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just going to put
a splash of this in there.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm just going to
toss this in there like this,

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.975 align:middle line:90%
get it all happening.

00:05:26.975 --> 00:05:31.220 align:middle line:84%
I want all those herbs in
there and straight into my pan.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.930 align:middle line:90%
Yum.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.940 align:middle line:90%
Yum.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:35.990 align:middle line:90%
Just on low, yeah?

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.085 align:middle line:90%
Remember that.

00:05:37.085 --> 00:05:39.722 align:middle line:90%
Put those herbs on there.

00:05:39.722 --> 00:05:41.180 align:middle line:84%
There's quite a
few herbs on there.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.180 align:middle line:90%
I do want a few herbs on there.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And on that side, I'm going
to take some more herbs

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.563 align:middle line:90%
and put them on there.

00:05:47.563 --> 00:05:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Let's let these
soak for a minute.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.880 align:middle line:90%
How quick is that?

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.360 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing, right?

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.660 align:middle line:90%
Just move that to the side.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.730 align:middle line:84%
When I first made this, I
was just stoked, so happy.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.130 align:middle line:84%
My friend Tyler, I
think, put maple syrup

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.600 align:middle line:84%
and fried an egg as well
and put that on there.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.510 align:middle line:90%
It's just really weird.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:10.310 align:middle line:90%
Savory.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.620 align:middle line:84%
You know the Americans love
their bacon and their eggs

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.380 align:middle line:90%
and their maple syrup.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Make sure the oil
is well distributed.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:27.885 align:middle line:90%


00:06:27.885 --> 00:06:28.685 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, baby.

00:06:28.685 --> 00:06:31.270 align:middle line:90%


00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get a
bit of that egg wash

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.730 align:middle line:84%
and just dip it onto this
bread so it soaks through.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.660 align:middle line:90%


00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.910 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.980 align:middle line:90%
This is super, super great.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.500 align:middle line:84%
This is one way
to have your eggs.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.953 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:06:47.953 --> 00:06:49.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to add
a little bit more

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.400 align:middle line:84%
seasoning because
I just want to.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.730 align:middle line:90%
Salt and pepper.

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:56.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to wash my hands now.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.370 align:middle line:84%
One thing I want to do is not
make these too dark in color.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.220 align:middle line:84%
But I needed to cook right
through because I don't really

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.380 align:middle line:90%
want to taste raw egg.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.740 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean?

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.320 align:middle line:84%
I just want to be
really mindful of that.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.310 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to figure
out the heat of my pan.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.200 align:middle line:84%
I am working with gas here,
and I'm working with cast iron.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.490 align:middle line:90%
And that holds a lot of heat.

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.500 align:middle line:84%
So just be really
mindful of that.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.030 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to adjust
the heat up a bit.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you don't
have cast iron,

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.930 align:middle line:84%
and you just have a plain
or stainless steel situation

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.450 align:middle line:90%
of glory, it's still the same.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.330 align:middle line:84%
You've just got to watch
how thick your pan is.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.480 align:middle line:84%
This is quite thick
iron, it will hold heat.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Quite thin steel will take on
heat really, really quickly

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:40.070 align:middle line:90%
and could burn.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.260 align:middle line:84%
So be really mindful,
and staying with it,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.940 align:middle line:84%
and adjusting your
heat as you go.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.730 align:middle line:90%


00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:48.530 align:middle line:90%
Eggy bread.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:52.530 align:middle line:90%


00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:53.930 align:middle line:90%
Let's have a look at this one.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.870 align:middle line:90%


00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.400 align:middle line:90%
Not quite yet.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Give it about a minute,
minute and a half.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.723 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's a good color.

00:08:04.723 --> 00:08:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, see how there's
no oil there?

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.340 align:middle line:90%
Just put the pan down.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.530 align:middle line:90%
Make sure the oil gets to there.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:10.490 align:middle line:90%
And then straight over.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.800 align:middle line:90%


00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.600 align:middle line:90%
And just cook.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:28.970 align:middle line:90%


00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:32.539 align:middle line:84%
I haven't added any
more oil to the pan.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:36.169 align:middle line:84%
So just making sure my oil is
there, making sure my pan--

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:37.669 align:middle line:84%
my heat is turned
down for a minute.

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:38.890 align:middle line:90%
It's smoking a bit.

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:39.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't want that.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.607 align:middle line:84%
I want to be very mindful
because I don't want

00:08:41.607 --> 00:08:44.200 align:middle line:90%
to burn the greens on here.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm just putting
it on low again.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.580 align:middle line:90%
So we'll just see how we go.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.090 align:middle line:84%
With you guys at
home, I want you

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:52.485 align:middle line:84%
to be really mindful of
putting your hands in the egg

00:08:52.485 --> 00:08:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and then putting your
hands in the pan.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Because the hands-- it's
actually quite hot in here,

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.190 align:middle line:90%
so be really careful.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And manage that as
much as you can.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.360 align:middle line:84%
You may have to use two
of these or something.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.360 align:middle line:84%
If you use a pair of tongs,
it will just full fall apart.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.110 align:middle line:84%
So if I did that,
it would just--

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:13.820 align:middle line:84%
I can already feel it falling
apart, so don't use tongs.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:14.710 align:middle line:90%
What you could do--

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:17.140 align:middle line:84%
you could take it with
a spatula like this

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.760 align:middle line:90%
and then place it in the pan.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.750 align:middle line:90%
So let's do that.

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Since my hands
have this asbestos,

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:27.580 align:middle line:84%
I call it, nature about
them, I can handle heat.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:28.410 align:middle line:90%
Let's do that.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:29.450 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:30.010 align:middle line:90%
That's what you can do.

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:30.880 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.200 align:middle line:90%
Just be mindful.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.100 align:middle line:84%
Adding these beautiful meals
to your fantastic family homes,

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.270 align:middle line:84%
and looking at the
value system you

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:41.140 align:middle line:84%
are creating within your organs,
and stepping into nature,

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:45.730 align:middle line:84%
stepping into it, and allowing
yourself to play with this--

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:49.450 align:middle line:84%
this is just gorgeous that you
guys have bought this program,

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:51.048 align:middle line:84%
and you can now do
all these things.

00:09:51.048 --> 00:09:52.090 align:middle line:90%
I've overcooked that one.

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:52.930 align:middle line:90%
Check out that.

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:54.580 align:middle line:90%
That's what I don't want to do.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:55.420 align:middle line:90%
So remember that.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:59.170 align:middle line:84%
You want to keep that
really quite green.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:00.420 align:middle line:90%
Let's turn this one over.

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:00.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to finish
the rest of this off,

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.310 align:middle line:90%
and then we'll serve up.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:04.477 align:middle line:90%
So I'll see you in a minute.

00:10:04.477 --> 00:10:06.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to add any
more oil to this too.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.252 align:middle line:90%
My pan has got enough.

00:10:08.252 --> 00:10:09.580 align:middle line:90%
I've salivating.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.830 align:middle line:84%
My pan has got enough little bit
of oil to cover that last bit.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:13.630 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:14.672 align:middle line:90%
I'll see you in a minute.

00:10:14.672 --> 00:10:20.130 align:middle line:90%


00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to make
sure that the egg is

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.100 align:middle line:90%
cooking right through.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's been a good
five minutes here--

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.037 align:middle line:90%
actually, five to six minutes.

00:10:27.037 --> 00:10:28.120 align:middle line:90%
And I've turned them once.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.128 align:middle line:90%
I've got my pan on low.

00:10:30.128 --> 00:10:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And how do I know that
it's cooked through?

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.642 align:middle line:84%
Well, the color is going to
indicate that, which it has.

00:10:35.642 --> 00:10:37.600 align:middle line:84%
But I just want to cook
it a little bit longer.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.020 align:middle line:84%
I want it to really get that
heat right through, so really

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:40.530 align:middle line:90%
low pan.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:41.490 align:middle line:90%
Remember that.

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.030 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:47.220 align:middle line:84%
With a chopstick
here, and I'm just--

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.960 align:middle line:90%
so you can see that.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.040 align:middle line:90%
It's lovely.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:51.998 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful color.

00:10:51.998 --> 00:10:53.707 align:middle line:84%
That's going to take
a little bit longer.

00:10:53.707 --> 00:10:54.640 align:middle line:90%
These ones are ready.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.440 align:middle line:90%
Grab a plate.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.160 align:middle line:90%


00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.840 align:middle line:90%
This is good.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.885 align:middle line:90%
Grab your tongs.

00:11:00.885 --> 00:11:07.650 align:middle line:90%


00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Great for when you've got
people over, some eggy bread.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.501 align:middle line:90%
Let's put this last one in.

00:11:15.501 --> 00:11:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going
to add any more oil.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:21.684 align:middle line:84%
I've said that before,
but I'm definitely not.

00:11:21.684 --> 00:11:26.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to let this one
cook for a little bit longer.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.800 align:middle line:90%
And there we have it.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.900 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.247 align:middle line:90%
Let's have a little piece of it.

00:11:32.247 --> 00:11:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what it looks
like when we cut it.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.490 align:middle line:90%


00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:38.290 align:middle line:90%
Nice and soft.

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:42.520 align:middle line:90%


00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.540 align:middle line:90%
What's in there?

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.310 align:middle line:90%


00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:50.180 align:middle line:90%
Lots of flavor, lots of flavor.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:56.060 align:middle line:90%


00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.290 align:middle line:90%
Super different.

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:59.128 align:middle line:84%
Like, all the flavor
has gone into here.

00:11:59.128 --> 00:12:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Like, you can't even
see it, but the flavor

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:05.030 align:middle line:84%
of the onions and the
parsley and everything

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:07.610 align:middle line:90%
is just-- it's just so good.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:08.490 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy this.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:11.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to-- I would have
this with a big salad, actually,

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:12.110 align:middle line:90%
for breakfast.

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:13.930 align:middle line:84%
I think that would
be really cool.

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And I like to have bread
once in a while, good bread.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.080 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy this.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:23.140 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:23.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:24.740 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:25.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.658 align:middle line:90%
Hi, everybody.

00:12:27.658 --> 00:12:30.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi!

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Enjoy.

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:33.536 align:middle line:90%
Hey, it's dinnertime.

00:12:33.536 --> 00:12:36.512 align:middle line:90%
>> Yay!

00:12:36.512 --> 00:12:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Good work.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Good work.

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Voila.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>> it's like this.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:49.963 align:middle line:90%
