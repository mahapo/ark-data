00:00:03.388 --> 00:00:12.600 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>> I love plants--

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.480 align:middle line:90%
fact.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.320 align:middle line:84%
It's not about being
vegetarian or vegan.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not about that, trust me.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.670 align:middle line:84%
It's about amping
it up in your life,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.410 align:middle line:84%
and this is a
great way to do it.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.910 align:middle line:84%
A really, really
great way to-- this

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.640 align:middle line:84%
will set you up throughout
the day, this dish, actually.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.550 align:middle line:84%
I call it the green
bowl of glory.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.350 align:middle line:90%
Really simple.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.683 align:middle line:84%
I've got just a steamer on
at the moment just over here,

00:00:34.683 --> 00:00:37.740 align:middle line:84%
just water's bubbling
away and it's getting

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.780 align:middle line:90%
ready to take all my isms on.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.260 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to
do is I want to eat

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.437 align:middle line:90%
the vegetables I like to eat.

00:00:45.437 --> 00:00:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So you might not like these
particular vegetables.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.293 align:middle line:90%
Change them, please.

00:00:49.293 --> 00:00:50.460 align:middle line:90%
But I like to have broccoli.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.180 align:middle line:84%
I think broccoli, to
me, is outstanding.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.130 align:middle line:90%
Like, truly outstanding.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.590 align:middle line:90%
It's just yummy.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.640 align:middle line:90%
It's meaty.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.598 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to cut
them up into florets--

00:01:01.598 --> 00:01:02.900 align:middle line:90%
bite-sized florets like this.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.150 align:middle line:90%


00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.692 align:middle line:90%
Really easy.

00:01:08.692 --> 00:01:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
have to wash these

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.010 align:middle line:84%
really well because there's lots
of bugs on them, which we love.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.230 align:middle line:90%
Let's be honest.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.030 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.197 align:middle line:90%
I want those leaves as well.

00:01:19.197 --> 00:01:21.890 align:middle line:84%
So I've got some broccoli,
which is awesome.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.580 align:middle line:90%
I have some zucchini.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.020 align:middle line:90%
I love zucchini.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.840 align:middle line:84%
So I just want some
chunks of zucchini.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.700 align:middle line:90%
This is breakfast, yeah?

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.360 align:middle line:90%
Crazy, right?

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.970 align:middle line:90%
Who would have thought?

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.893 align:middle line:90%
Who would have thought?

00:01:36.893 --> 00:01:37.810 align:middle line:90%
I've got some cabbage.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.740 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to slice this up
really finally, this cabbage.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.113 align:middle line:84%
As fine as you can
get it because this

00:01:47.113 --> 00:01:49.359 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the raw
part of the breakfast.

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:54.050 align:middle line:90%


00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Really interesting cutting
with my finger, my sore finger.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.530 align:middle line:90%
Mushrooms?

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.020 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.830 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.630 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, honey.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.910 align:middle line:90%
Pop them in there.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.978 align:middle line:84%
My good friend
[? Marnot. ?] Thanks, mate.

00:02:08.978 --> 00:02:09.970 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:10.770 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.030 align:middle line:90%
It's all natural going on here.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.497 align:middle line:84%
We don't hide any-- we're
not hiding anything from you.

00:02:16.497 --> 00:02:17.830 align:middle line:90%
So I've got some cabbage cut up.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.163 align:middle line:90%
Now, you might not like cabbage.

00:02:19.163 --> 00:02:20.190 align:middle line:90%
Have lettuce, then.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.990 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Or rocket or something
that you like to have.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.120 align:middle line:90%
This is my gig here.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.970 align:middle line:90%
This is what I like to have.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.170 align:middle line:90%
OK, so mushrooms.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember, we
never wash mushrooms.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.400 align:middle line:84%
Really important, because
what they do, they are fungi

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.780 align:middle line:84%
and then they're just going to
absorb so much of the water.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.840 align:middle line:84%
So try and just use a paper
towel and just dry them over.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.340 align:middle line:90%
So I'm just going to dry--

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.940 align:middle line:84%
so I'm just going to wipe
down these mushrooms,

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.070 align:middle line:84%
just to get the dirt and
bits and pieces off there.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.220 align:middle line:90%


00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.220 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's enough.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.870 align:middle line:90%
That's all I need.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.440 align:middle line:90%
Let's pop that there.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.276 align:middle line:90%
OK, washing this other stuff.

00:03:00.276 --> 00:03:02.950 align:middle line:90%
Now, I've got some peas here.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.090 align:middle line:90%
I've got some avo there.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.423 align:middle line:84%
I've got some spinach
and some leek here.

00:03:07.423 --> 00:03:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, with your
leeks-- so I'm just

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.340 align:middle line:84%
going to let that
wash for a minute.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.220 align:middle line:84%
With your leeks,
this is what I do.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.440 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of a really cool idea.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.530 align:middle line:84%
I just cut directly down
the center like that.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.250 align:middle line:90%


00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.500 align:middle line:90%
And see all the dirt in there?

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.580 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to do
is I want to wash that.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.180 align:middle line:90%
That's all washed.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.925 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to get
in between those leaves.

00:03:34.925 --> 00:03:40.308 align:middle line:90%


00:03:40.308 --> 00:03:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to
use the whole leek,

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.980 align:middle line:84%
and I've mentioned this
many times before how

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.810 align:middle line:84%
chefs, for some bizarre reason,
do that and throw that away.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.592 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

00:03:50.592 --> 00:03:52.050 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
use the whole leek.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.175 align:middle line:84%
And leek is just going to give
so much flavor to this dish.

00:03:55.175 --> 00:03:57.327 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's that light
onion with that heat

00:03:57.327 --> 00:03:58.410 align:middle line:90%
of garlic coming through--

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.210 align:middle line:90%
I reckon, anyway.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.780 align:middle line:84%
It's just a subtle flavor
but can boost up any dish

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.040 align:middle line:90%
and make it a taste sensation.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.840 align:middle line:90%
Leeks.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.950 align:middle line:90%
Would you believe it?

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.952 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

00:04:09.952 --> 00:04:11.660 align:middle line:84%
All right, the next
thing I'm going to do

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.030 align:middle line:84%
is some spinach,
which is awesome.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.029 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful baby spinach.

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.829 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.662 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going to
do is I want to arrange

00:04:18.662 --> 00:04:19.840 align:middle line:90%
this in this steamer.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.640 align:middle line:90%
Really easy.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to bring
the steamer over here

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.470 align:middle line:90%
so we can do this together.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.795 align:middle line:84%
So you can have
a bamboo steamer.

00:04:27.795 --> 00:04:28.920 align:middle line:90%
It could be a clay steamer.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.350 align:middle line:84%
One of those Japanese
clay steamers are awesome.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.240 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I'm just going to
place my whole mushrooms

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.380 align:middle line:90%
on this side.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And what happens when you do
this is things cook faster

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.115 align:middle line:84%
than the others, and you
can pull them out as you go.

00:04:44.115 --> 00:04:53.730 align:middle line:84%
My zucchini and my broccoli
and the broccoli leaves.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.910 align:middle line:90%
Then I want my peas in here.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.780 align:middle line:90%
My peas on this side.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to put the leek
through the peas because I can.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And then I want my spinach,
which I'm just going

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.450 align:middle line:90%
to spin her in half like that.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to plunk
that there in the corner.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put the rest of
the leek through that spinach.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And the next step
is salt and pepper.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:25.940 align:middle line:90%
Vital.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.610 align:middle line:90%
Building blocks of flavor.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.990 align:middle line:90%
That's boiling nicely there.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.480 align:middle line:90%
Salt and pepper.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.160 align:middle line:90%
And a little bit of olive oil.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes, before we steam.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.930 align:middle line:90%
It's just what I do, you know?

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.170 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.800 align:middle line:90%
Just a little bit, not a lot.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.470 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's it.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And my breakfast
basket is ready.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.970 align:middle line:84%
This breakfast, I
swear to you, it's

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.770 align:middle line:90%
going to set you up for the day.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.200 align:middle line:90%
It's going to nourish you.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Something's going to happen to
your body throughout the day.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.940 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
feel completely--

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.545 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to get those
big sugar highs or those peaks,

00:06:00.545 --> 00:06:02.420 align:middle line:84%
it's just going to bring
you really centered.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.470 align:middle line:90%
Trust me on this one.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.995 align:middle line:90%
Try it.

00:06:03.995 --> 00:06:04.795 align:middle line:90%
It's really easy.

00:06:04.795 --> 00:06:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Put the veggies you like in
there and just make it happen

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.990 align:middle line:90%
and flavor that up.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't like leeks and
you want onion, put the onion.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.990 align:middle line:90%
Or put chili.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.590 align:middle line:90%
Whatever you like.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.965 align:middle line:84%
But this is just
an understanding

00:06:13.965 --> 00:06:17.857 align:middle line:84%
of how the mean green
bowl of glory can unfold.

00:06:17.857 --> 00:06:19.940 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we're going to go
straight over to the pot,

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.040 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
steam this probably for

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.160 align:middle line:84%
about, I don't know,
two to four minutes.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.720 align:middle line:84%
This is boiling,
so be very careful.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.360 align:middle line:90%
Very, very careful.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.440 align:middle line:90%
Straight in like that.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.320 align:middle line:90%


00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Great for teenage boys to
do something like this.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.550 align:middle line:84%
My son Jayman is definitely--
this one's for you, darling,

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.595 align:middle line:84%
if you get to see
this, which you will.

00:06:42.595 --> 00:06:43.970 align:middle line:84%
This is a really
good one for you

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.090 align:middle line:84%
just to amp up those
greens in your day.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.470 align:middle line:90%
Really important and simple.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.110 align:middle line:84%
There's no cutting
skills or such there.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.350 align:middle line:90%
It was really, really easy.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.160 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's going to go for
about a couple of minutes.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
believe that there.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.905 align:middle line:84%
The next thing is, I
want to make a dressing,

00:06:57.905 --> 00:06:59.520 align:middle line:90%
but I'm going to give Udo's oil.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.215 align:middle line:90%
Udo's oil is like, for me--

00:07:02.215 --> 00:07:05.335 align:middle line:84%
you know how they talk about
having your omega-3s, 6, and 9,

00:07:05.335 --> 00:07:07.085 align:middle line:84%
and they talk about
you get it from salmon

00:07:07.085 --> 00:07:09.830 align:middle line:84%
and you get it from nuts and
seeds and da-da, da-da, da.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.060 align:middle line:84%
This dude here, Udo's,
Dr. whatever his name is,

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Udo's, I would marry
him in a heartbeat.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.070 align:middle line:84%
He's mastered
something very special

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.410 align:middle line:84%
here, very, very
special in this oil.

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.370 align:middle line:84%
You can get this oil anywhere
in health food stores.

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.330 align:middle line:84%
So all I'm going to do is
have a splash of this, about

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:28.130 align:middle line:90%
a tablespoon.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.190 align:middle line:84%
The recommended dose
of this, actually.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:31.940 align:middle line:84%
But I want to incorporate
this in my meal.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.600 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing
about supplements

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.500 align:middle line:90%
and bits and pieces.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to take them
like I have to take them.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.980 align:middle line:84%
I want them to be
part of my meal.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.660 align:middle line:84%
So Udo's is definitely something
that I would recommend.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:49.440 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to add some
vinegar to this, just a splash,

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.240 align:middle line:90%
just a little.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.310 align:middle line:84%
You can add a bit of sweetener
to this, if you like.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:53.477 align:middle line:90%
I might add a dash of honey.

00:07:53.477 --> 00:07:54.560 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And even if it's not in
the rest of [INAUDIBLE],,

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.572 align:middle line:84%
I just feel like a little
bit of honey with this today.

00:07:58.572 --> 00:08:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Intuitive cooking-- you're
getting the guidelines of how

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.430 align:middle line:84%
to do certain things,
but just getting there

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.680 align:middle line:90%
in the now and intuitively cook.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.150 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's
coming along nicely.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.235 align:middle line:84%
That's been about three
minutes over here.

00:08:11.235 --> 00:08:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Just going to give
this a little bit of

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:17.830 align:middle line:84%
a mix, a little bit of
salt and pepper in there.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And I want some parsley
with my cabbage.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.870 align:middle line:84%
Cabbage is such an
amazing vegetable.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:28.730 align:middle line:84%
I've heard so many stories
about how cabbage juice can

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:34.010 align:middle line:84%
cure a peptic ulcer, I think
it's called, in your stomach.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:35.615 align:middle line:90%
It's really amazing, yeah?

00:08:35.615 --> 00:08:37.385 align:middle line:90%
What vegetables can do.

00:08:37.385 --> 00:08:39.260 align:middle line:84%
I'll use a bit of
parsley to mix with that.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.875 align:middle line:84%
I just want that
color through there.

00:08:40.875 --> 00:08:43.115 align:middle line:84%
All right, let's put
that to the side.

00:08:43.115 --> 00:08:44.240 align:middle line:90%
Let's get that to the side.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.170 align:middle line:90%
This is done.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:46.210 align:middle line:90%
This has been about--

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:49.310 align:middle line:84%
ah-- I reckon, three or
four minutes for sure.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.710 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:52.857 align:middle line:90%
How easy is this?

00:08:52.857 --> 00:08:53.690 align:middle line:90%
Just watch yourself.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.340 align:middle line:90%
It is hot, OK?

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.793 align:middle line:90%
Just be really, really careful.

00:08:56.793 --> 00:09:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Ah, the smells of
steaming vegetables.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.590 align:middle line:90%
My mouth is watering.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.050 align:middle line:84%
So what I love to do
with food, as you've all

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:09.020 align:middle line:84%
know, that I love to
make it look pretty.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And when I mean pretty, I like
to do it justice, you know?

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.490 align:middle line:90%
Just make it look pretty.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:19.610 align:middle line:90%
Arrange it nicely.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.220 align:middle line:90%
It's respectful, for me, anyway.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And respectful in the way
that I feel good, too,

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:30.558 align:middle line:84%
when I eat like this and
arrange things nicely.

00:09:30.558 --> 00:09:33.620 align:middle line:84%
This is just beautiful
and smelling so wonderful.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:37.070 align:middle line:90%


00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:40.440 align:middle line:84%
There's our mushrooms with
a bit of pepper on them.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:45.770 align:middle line:90%


00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:46.770 align:middle line:90%
Slippery little suckers.

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:50.700 align:middle line:90%


00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.980 align:middle line:90%
Steaming mushrooms, hey?

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Who would have thought
that you could do that?

00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:00.590 align:middle line:84%
Here is that gorgeous little
bit of pepper on that as well.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:04.380 align:middle line:90%
Ah, it smells so good.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.720 align:middle line:84%
My girlfriend
Courtney and I used

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.700 align:middle line:84%
to have this for breakfast
a lot when we lived together

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.620 align:middle line:90%
in Sydney.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.310 align:middle line:84%
We'd always do things
like this all the time.

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.120 align:middle line:84%
It'd set us up for
the day, I swear.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.751 align:middle line:84%
It would just set
us up for the day.

00:10:20.751 --> 00:10:24.034 align:middle line:84%
I want to put that royal
cabbage in there like that.

00:10:24.034 --> 00:10:25.627 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my band-aid's coming undone.

00:10:25.627 --> 00:10:31.240 align:middle line:90%


00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:35.020 align:middle line:84%
OK, I want some avocado
because I have it.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:39.270 align:middle line:84%
I just want those
lovely avocado fats.

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going
to cut it like this

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.870 align:middle line:90%
and just take that off the skin.

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Do you see how
pretty this looks?

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.930 align:middle line:90%
I'll set that there like that.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:54.830 align:middle line:90%


00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:56.150 align:middle line:90%
OK, what else do we need?

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.020 align:middle line:90%
We need a little dressing.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:00.440 align:middle line:90%
Let's give it a bit of a stir.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.600 align:middle line:90%


00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.090 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah, baby.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:07.820 align:middle line:90%
Just set that in like that.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a few olives
because we have them.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.160 align:middle line:90%


00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:14.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And maybe some seeds
because we have them.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:20.130 align:middle line:84%
See how I'm just like-- see
how I'm amping up the plant?

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:21.560 align:middle line:90%
Look at the size of that.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.320 align:middle line:90%
It looks huge.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.350 align:middle line:84%
This will really set
you up for the day.

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Really, really set
you up for the day.

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.940 align:middle line:84%
I keep saying it because
it's so important that you

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.010 align:middle line:90%
see where I'm coming from.

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.540 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:37.430 align:middle line:90%
Put that there.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a wedge of lime
because we have them.

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:45.780 align:middle line:90%


00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.437 align:middle line:90%
I love these limes in Indonesia.

00:11:47.437 --> 00:11:48.770 align:middle line:90%

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.510 align:middle line:90%
