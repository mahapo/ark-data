>> Do not stop dreaming.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.730 align:middle line:10%
Whatever I dream, to make it.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.880 align:middle line:10%
If I really want it, to do it.

>> My name is Daniel.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.530 align:middle line:84%
I live in the Isle
of Wight in Sandown.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm 38 years old.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.019 align:middle line:84%
I'm a care support worker,
working with elderly people

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.040 align:middle line:84%
and different types
of Alzheimer's.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.040 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.050 align:middle line:84%
My dad is born and
bred in England.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.060 align:middle line:84%
My mother, she was born
and bred in Venezuela.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.440 align:middle line:10%
They both met when my dad,
working in the farming industry,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.990 align:middle line:10%
landed a job back
in South America,

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.625 align:middle line:10%
and bumped into my mother.

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:24.425 align:middle line:90%
Here I am.

[LAUGHS]

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.860 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in Venezuela
until the age of 16,

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.960 align:middle line:84%
when I went to
agriculture college trying

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.760 align:middle line:90%
to follow my dad's footprints.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.650 align:middle line:84%
But decided it
wasn't really for me,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.970 align:middle line:84%
and decided to come to the
UK and join the British army.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Which I did pretty
well, but then again,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.152 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't fulfilled
with myself and I

00:01:43.152 --> 00:01:44.610 align:middle line:84%
decided to do
something else, which

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.490 align:middle line:90%
involved helping humans' life.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.170 align:middle line:84%
As time goes on,
obviously moving

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.870 align:middle line:84%
on with different types of
job with the elderly people,

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.270 align:middle line:84%
high challenging behavior
with a young adult.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Trying to get to learn
the grasps of working

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.630 align:middle line:84%
in that environment, bumping
to now who she is, my missus.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.960 align:middle line:90%
She actually opened the door.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.970 align:middle line:84%
I thought she was the
manager of the place.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:07.830 align:middle line:90%
She was not.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.759 align:middle line:90%
Shook her hand.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Funny enough, I
knew that she was

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.130 align:middle line:84%
going to be involved
in my life somehow,

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.662 align:middle line:84%
not knowing that 10
years down the line,

00:02:16.662 --> 00:02:18.120 align:middle line:84%
we would still be
together and have

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.950 align:middle line:90%
a beautiful family together.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And we decided it was the right
thing to move somewhere else.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.920 align:middle line:84%
So we came to the Isle
of Wight one weekend.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.290 align:middle line:90%
But life continues the same.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Everyday routine, routine,
routine, and more routine.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm too wild to be
tame in that sense.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.642 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] For me, I need that
sense of adventure all the time.

00:02:39.642 --> 00:02:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Not knowing what's
happening, going

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.810 align:middle line:84%
to different places,
different cultures,

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.360 align:middle line:84%
meeting different
people, different food,

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.450 align:middle line:84%
taking challenges, skydiving,
bungee jumping, just

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.860 align:middle line:90%
doing the unknown.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.810 align:middle line:84%
That is what is meaning
in my life for me.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Trying to find a
meaning for myself,

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.920 align:middle line:90%
what am I supposed to be doing.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.850 align:middle line:84%
Not being lost, because I know
who I am and what my family

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:08.650 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.920 align:middle line:84%
But it's the feeling of what
am I supposed to be doing?

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's always trying to
chase that feeling of what

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.150 align:middle line:90%
is my meaning here.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.440 align:middle line:84%
My wife met Ellemiek Drucker
through a friend of hers.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And I felt really curious
with the outcome of hers.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I
was wondering like,

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.010 align:middle line:90%
maybe perhaps I should try.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.400 align:middle line:84%
My hope is after having
these sessions with Ellemiek

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.660 align:middle line:84%
I can find my own answers
and many other answers.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.555 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully she will be able
to help me with and come back

00:03:39.555 --> 00:03:40.355 align:middle line:90%
with a clear mind.

I'm a between lives spiritual

I'm a proud mom of two teenage

Between life
spiritual regression

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.200 align:middle line:10%
is a form of
hypnosis where I take

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.750 align:middle line:10%
the client into a deep
state of relaxation,

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.550 align:middle line:10%
and then I take him
back to the period

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.700 align:middle line:10%
in between lives to experience
the journey their soul was

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.835 align:middle line:10%
on before they were
born into this life.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.130 align:middle line:84%
I was very lucky
growing up in Holland

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.690 align:middle line:84%
that my parents
never really pushed

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.340 align:middle line:84%
a religious or
spiritual narrative

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.610 align:middle line:90%
onto me and my brother.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.370 align:middle line:84%
So we were really
given a lot of freedom

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.460 align:middle line:84%
to discover what we
thought was important.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.590 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.350 align:middle line:90%
What am I here to do?

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Really searching for ways
of improving my life,

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.430 align:middle line:84%
getting those deeper
answers for myself.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.110 align:middle line:84%
After high school,
went to the States.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.940 align:middle line:84%
Was an exchange
student for a year,

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.970 align:middle line:84%
lived with a wonderful
family in Colorado.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.110 align:middle line:84%
After there, I
studied some more,

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.690 align:middle line:84%
then just had a series
of office jobs, banks,

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.710 align:middle line:84%
I worked in nature conservation
where I met my husband.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.370 align:middle line:84%
After 10 years in
Holland with me,

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.530 align:middle line:84%
he really wanted to
go back to England.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.630 align:middle line:84%
So then I went
back to university,

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.740 align:middle line:84%
did a psychology degree, and
that really rekindled my love

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.400 align:middle line:90%
for spiritual matters.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.660 align:middle line:84%
So I did training with
Dolores Cannon at QHHT.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.420 align:middle line:10%
And then I discovered Andy
Tomlinson with the Past Life

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.630 align:middle line:10%
Regression Academy.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.260 align:middle line:84%
They train hypnotherapist
regression therapists

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.820 align:middle line:84%
and Between Life
Spiritual Regression

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.070 align:middle line:84%
therapists all over the world,
both in person and online.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.870 align:middle line:84%
When I discovered
Andy Tomlinson,

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.150 align:middle line:84%
it was like a new
world opened up for me.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.490 align:middle line:84%
I'd done a regression
into past lives before,

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.800 align:middle line:84%
but there it was, lacking
the clarity for me.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.280 align:middle line:84%
I'd go back to past lives,
but I wouldn't know why

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.880 align:middle line:90%
I was feeling sad, for example.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And with Andy and his method, I
know exactly what's happening.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.163 align:middle line:90%
I know why I'm sad.

00:05:59.163 --> 00:06:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many
different techniques

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.470 align:middle line:84%
for resolving whatever
issue comes up

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.620 align:middle line:84%
or for getting a real
clarity into what

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.610 align:middle line:90%
happened between lives.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a
fascinating method.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.360 align:middle line:84%
I offer sessions on the Isle
of Wight in Glastonbury,

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.342 align:middle line:90%
and in Holland, and via Zoom.

00:06:16.342 --> 00:06:18.050 align:middle line:84%
Clients that come to
me for between life,

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.480 align:middle line:84%
spiritual regression
are usually clients

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.010 align:middle line:84%
that don't really have any
issues in their current life.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.372 align:middle line:90%
They have questions.

00:06:23.372 --> 00:06:25.330 align:middle line:84%
They want to know who
they are, whether they're

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.640 align:middle line:84%
on the right path,
what they can do

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.090 align:middle line:90%
to improve their relationship.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's not so much that
they've got things going on,

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.390 align:middle line:84%
in fact, if they do,
I would generally

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:38.320 align:middle line:84%
suggest that they resolve those
first with regression therapy,

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.238 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:06:39.238 --> 00:06:40.780 align:middle line:84%
But between life
spiritual regression

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.980 align:middle line:84%
just gives insight to
questions that they might have.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.450 align:middle line:90%

I met Dan through a
mutual friend of ours.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And have done one discovery
session where I took Dan back

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:54.900 align:middle line:90%
to a positive past life.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.480 align:middle line:84%
That was a really interesting
experience for him.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.640 align:middle line:84%
He's now coming back
to me for between life

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.160 align:middle line:84%
spiritual regression
because he's

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.730 align:middle line:90%
got questions about his life.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And he just wants
to know the journey

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.460 align:middle line:84%
that his soul undertook between
his last death and his birth

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.710 align:middle line:90%
now as Dan.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.438 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really excited
what Dan's going

00:07:10.438 --> 00:07:12.230 align:middle line:84%
to uncover during his
session, and we never

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.430 align:middle line:90%
know what's going to happen.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.930 align:middle line:84%
One of my mentors
always said, we're

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.680 align:middle line:84%
simple folk in
regression therapy.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.000 align:middle line:90%
We just follow the energy.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.440 align:middle line:84%
So wherever the client needs
to go, that's where we'll go.

00:07:44.632 --> 00:07:45.840 align:middle line:90%
what's going to happen today.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll have a look at the
questions that you brought in.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll just go on straight
to the between life session

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:51.025 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:07:51.025 --> 00:07:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:52.690 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.355 align:middle line:84%
>> So I had a lovely
discovery session with you,

00:07:55.355 --> 00:07:56.230 align:middle line:90%
that was a few weeks.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.520 align:middle line:90%
That was--

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.000 align:middle line:90%
>> We did.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.962 align:middle line:90%
>> Via Zoom, wasn't it?

00:07:57.962 --> 00:07:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it was
really interesting.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:00.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Especially with
the smell of lavender.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:04.180 align:middle line:90%
>> The lavender you said that.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:04.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.180 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't stand it.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.487 align:middle line:84%
Funny enough that I felt
I loved it and I liked it.

00:08:08.487 --> 00:08:10.320 align:middle line:84%
But part of me was
saying what you're doing?

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:10.860 align:middle line:90%
What you're doing?

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:11.440 align:middle line:90%
You hate it.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.010 align:middle line:90%
You don't like this.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:12.520 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So it felt really strange and
peculiar, to be honest with you.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Indeed, there's
a double awareness.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.612 align:middle line:84%
You are going to be
aware at all times

00:08:21.612 --> 00:08:23.820 align:middle line:84%
that you're Dan, that you're
here in the room with me

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:24.620 align:middle line:90%
in Ventnor.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.560 align:middle line:84%
But also you're going to be
like oh wow, I'm in this,

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.549 align:middle line:84%
I'm meeting this beautiful
light, or oh I feel so peaceful

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:35.260 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And you will have that little
voice, like, what are you doing?

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.669 align:middle line:84%
I don't like lavender
or whatever it is.

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:42.277 align:middle line:84%
>> That felt really
weird, at first.

00:08:42.277 --> 00:08:43.610 align:middle line:90%
>> And you did that brilliantly.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.120 align:middle line:90%
Just go with it.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:45.920 align:middle line:90%
That's for me.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.680 align:middle line:84%
If I can get people
to just be open

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.410 align:middle line:84%
like you did brilliantly
during the discovery session,

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:51.830 align:middle line:90%
that's all I need.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:56.000 align:middle line:84%
My questions are just to help
you open up your experience.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.090 align:middle line:84%
So whatever it is that comes to
you, it will be coming from you.

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:00.625 align:middle line:90%
I'm not interjecting anything.

00:09:00.625 --> 00:09:01.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:02.630 align:middle line:90%
That's brilliant.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>> When we go into the session,
I'll first induce a deep level

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.370 align:middle line:84%
of hypnosis for you, and then
I'm going to ask your higher

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:13.330 align:middle line:84%
mind if there is anything we
need to do for you to have

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:17.330 align:middle line:84%
the best possible between
life spiritual regression.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.140 align:middle line:84%
After that, when we're all
done, when we're all good,

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.680 align:middle line:84%
in all likelihood, we will have
met your spirit guide by then.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.640 align:middle line:90%
Check whether we're all good.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.040 align:middle line:84%
I've got my trusted
pendulum with me.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.730 align:middle line:84%
I'll double check as well,
and then I'll take you back

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.290 align:middle line:90%
to your most recent past life.

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:35.740 align:middle line:84%
The information
that you experience

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.660 align:middle line:84%
could be quite
abstract, but it still

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.790 align:middle line:84%
has got to go through
your human brains,

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.820 align:middle line:84%
then got to come out in
words using your vocal cord,

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.740 align:middle line:84%
and in words that I
understand, ideally in English.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:47.780 align:middle line:90%
So there's quite a lot going on.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.360 align:middle line:84%
So some people say
there might only

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.250 align:middle line:84%
be 10%, 20% of what
you experience.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.430 align:middle line:84%
You'll actually be
verbalizing to me in words.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:56.780 align:middle line:90%
Does that all make sense?

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:57.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it does.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:57.380 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, cool.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:02.320 align:middle line:84%
So if we can look at the
questions that you've got here,

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.830 align:middle line:84%
what's your purpose
in this life?

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:06.280 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's a lovely
question, isn't it?

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.895 align:middle line:84%
Why do I dream a lot
with a white bull?

00:10:08.895 --> 00:10:10.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I do.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.935 align:middle line:84%
I keep dreaming with
this white bull.

00:10:11.935 --> 00:10:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's the same dream every
time, or it's different dream?

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Different scenarios.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.490 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes I'm riding the
bull like American rodeo.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's no fear against
that bull or anything--

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.735 align:middle line:90%
>> But he just keeps appearing.

00:10:22.735 --> 00:10:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>> And he's white.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, white bull.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:25.430 align:middle line:90%
>> How cool.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.940 align:middle line:90%
How interesting.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:26.980 align:middle line:84%
We're going to find
out about that.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>> That's weird.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.570 align:middle line:90%
>> White bull, yeah.

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:32.450 align:middle line:84%
So why do I need to
succeed all the time?

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:33.492 align:middle line:90%
Failure is not an option.

00:10:33.492 --> 00:10:34.292 align:middle line:90%
>> Not exactly.

00:10:34.292 --> 00:10:36.310 align:middle line:84%
It's like for me, failure
is like, I can't fail.

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>> If I fail, I'm
letting myself down.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.210 align:middle line:84%
It's like, even those things
like silly tasks, for me,

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.170 align:middle line:90%
they must be done a certain way.

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:47.140 align:middle line:90%
>> We'll find out.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.490 align:middle line:84%
How come I can help anybody, but
at times I can't help myself?

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:51.940 align:middle line:90%
>> It's so frustrating.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.775 align:middle line:84%
I'm very good at
helping people, right?

00:10:53.775 --> 00:10:54.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:54.575 --> 00:10:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Any time they
call me, I'm there.

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:59.298 align:middle line:84%
I go the extra mile for
anybody, because I do.

00:10:59.298 --> 00:11:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And then when it comes
to me, I'm like, OK,

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:02.420 align:middle line:90%
but I can't really help myself.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.420 align:middle line:90%
But then I don't want failure.

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:07.050 align:middle line:84%
But I need to, But
it's just weird.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:07.850 align:middle line:90%
It's just bizarre.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:10.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm good at helping others, but
I'm not good at helping myself.

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Good question.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.760 align:middle line:90%
Brilliant question.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.720 align:middle line:90%
Wow, OK.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:18.560 align:middle line:84%
So you know what we're
doing today, deep hypnosis.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.100 align:middle line:90%
We'll ask your higher mind.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.027 align:middle line:84%
And we'll just
take it from there.

00:11:23.027 --> 00:11:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>> That's fine, thank you.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool, lovely.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:26.425 align:middle line:90%
Let's get to it then.

00:11:26.425 --> 00:11:27.758 align:middle line:90%
>> I feel privileged to be here.

00:11:27.758 --> 00:11:28.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, thank you.

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:29.070 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>> No, thank you.

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:36.382 align:middle line:90%


00:11:36.382 --> 00:11:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And tell me, what is the
first thing that you notice

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.055 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:11:42.055 --> 00:11:43.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Boat.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.090 align:middle line:10%
>> A boat.

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:47.885 align:middle line:10%
It's in a city with water.

00:11:47.885 --> 00:11:50.765 align:middle line:10%
>> What else can
you notice here?

00:11:50.765 --> 00:11:53.310 align:middle line:10%
>> It's like an open market.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:54.110 align:middle line:10%
People trading.

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:56.075 align:middle line:90%
>> People trading, yes.

00:11:56.075 --> 00:11:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like being asleep
and you're dreaming.

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's really realistic
because you can touch,

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.310 align:middle line:90%
you can smell, there's texture.

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:06.635 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell me, is there anything
on your feet or are they bare?

00:12:06.635 --> 00:12:08.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Like boots.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>> What about the
rest of the body.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.835 align:middle line:84%
Is there any
clothing on the body?

00:12:11.835 --> 00:12:14.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, heavy clothing.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.610 align:middle line:10%
Some of it has got metal
on the top of my body.

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:21.033 align:middle line:84%
>> What I tend to do is,
I get people to describe

00:12:21.033 --> 00:12:22.950 align:middle line:84%
their surroundings first,
and then after that,

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.370 align:middle line:84%
I get them to focus
on themselves.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And when he started describing
this, it was heavy--

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.620 align:middle line:90%
metal on the top of his body.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.780 align:middle line:84%
That really told me
that he was there

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.855 align:middle line:84%
because he could feel
that on his body.

00:12:32.855 --> 00:12:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>> It felt heavy, like
really, really heavy.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.475 align:middle line:84%
If I would have to run,
I wouldn't know how.

00:12:38.475 --> 00:12:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the body of a
man or the body of a woman?

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:42.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Man.

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:43.565 align:middle line:10%
>> Man.

00:12:43.565 --> 00:12:45.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Late 20s.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Just tell me
what happens here?

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:49.892 align:middle line:90%
What happens next?

00:12:49.892 --> 00:12:53.890 align:middle line:10%
>> I see old buildings
around the market.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:55.802 align:middle line:10%
>> Aha.

00:12:55.802 --> 00:12:59.110 align:middle line:10%
>> It's like a port
for vessel ships.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:02.710 align:middle line:10%
Also people loading
ships with livestock.

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:03.705 align:middle line:10%
>> With livestock.

00:13:03.705 --> 00:13:07.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Livestock and fruits.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.525 align:middle line:10%
>> Livestock, fruits.

00:13:09.525 --> 00:13:12.630 align:middle line:10%
>> I feel like I'm
guarding the area.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.180 align:middle line:10%
It's a lot of people
walking around.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's move forward to the
next significant event in that

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.320 align:middle line:90%
same lifetime.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Just tell me what you
become aware of here.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Wine.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Wine.

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.210 align:middle line:10%
Like an old pub.

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:31.985 align:middle line:10%
>> Is it just you in the
pub or are there others?

00:13:31.985 --> 00:13:32.985 align:middle line:10%
>> No, There are others.

00:13:32.985 --> 00:13:34.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Others as well.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:38.900 align:middle line:10%
>> People drinking, laughing.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.780 align:middle line:84%
It felt like whatever
people I was working with,

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:45.320 align:middle line:84%
they were there as well, and we
were just having a good laugh,

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.220 align:middle line:90%
happy hour.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:50.790 align:middle line:84%
Drinking the most amazing wine
I've tried ever in planet Earth.

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:51.685 align:middle line:90%
It was delicious.

00:13:51.685 --> 00:13:54.655 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] You should take
me back there again.

00:13:54.655 --> 00:13:56.115 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:13:56.115 --> 00:14:00.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's move forward to the
next significant event in that

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:01.610 align:middle line:90%
same lifetime.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.680 align:middle line:84%
The scene in the pub
felt like that was

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.640 align:middle line:90%
more to set the scene for him.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.490 align:middle line:84%
It didn't really feel like
there was a significant event.

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:10.950 align:middle line:84%
It was more about him catching
up with his colleague.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:12.740 align:middle line:84%
We didn't need any
more information there,

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:14.715 align:middle line:90%
so then I just moved him on.

00:14:14.715 --> 00:14:17.520 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm sailing a ship.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.320 align:middle line:10%
Storm.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.205 align:middle line:10%
Storm weather.

00:14:19.205 --> 00:14:21.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Storm weather.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:24.630 align:middle line:84%
What is it that you do
on this sailing ship?

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.020 align:middle line:10%
Telling people what to do.

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:27.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Ah.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.910 align:middle line:10%
>> We're heading north.

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:31.170 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't feel good, though.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.150 align:middle line:10%
>> It doesn't feel good?

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:36.100 align:middle line:90%
I've got a storm coming.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.190 align:middle line:84%
I need to head North to go
around to the storm to continue.

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:40.530 align:middle line:90%
Weather's getting worse.

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:41.620 align:middle line:90%
So what do we do?

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.480 align:middle line:90%
Do we go back?

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.900 align:middle line:90%
We can't, because of the sea.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.903 align:middle line:84%
So it just felt like
on the losing battle.

00:14:45.903 --> 00:14:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling
people what to do,

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.040 align:middle line:84%
with not really certainty
of what's going to happen.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>> In this preparation for
going into the between lives,

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:55.290 align:middle line:84%
if there's anything difficult
we move people on straightaway

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:56.090 align:middle line:90%
after.

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:58.860 align:middle line:84%
If somebody were to get oh my
goodness, my ship is sinking.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.960 align:middle line:90%
Oh my men, oh I'm going to die.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.500 align:middle line:90%
And all this emotion comes out.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.500 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult,
if not impossible,

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.630 align:middle line:84%
to move on from
that to then oh, I'm

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:08.020 align:middle line:90%
reaching this higher vibration.

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm seeing the light.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:10.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm moving on.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:15.636 align:middle line:84%
So let's move now to the
last day of that lifetime.

00:15:15.636 --> 00:15:18.235 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm surrounded by people.

00:15:18.235 --> 00:15:20.180 align:middle line:10%
I have a rope on my neck.

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.912 align:middle line:10%
>> Rope on my neck.

00:15:22.912 --> 00:15:24.020 align:middle line:10%
>> They're hanging me.

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.390 align:middle line:10%
And I'm thinking, why?

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:26.630 align:middle line:90%
I haven't done nothing wrong.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:27.577 align:middle line:90%
This is not fair.

00:15:27.577 --> 00:15:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And actually they were
even throwing stones at me.

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:30.577 align:middle line:90%
But they were missing.

00:15:30.577 --> 00:15:32.470 align:middle line:84%
I thought that you
can't aim that good.

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:34.585 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] something inside me.

00:15:34.585 --> 00:15:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Again, same thing there.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:38.890 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want him to
re-experience that death,

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:40.580 align:middle line:84%
so I just moved
him straight along.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.240 align:middle line:84%
So let's go forward
in time to the time

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.880 align:middle line:84%
just after you take
your last breath.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.930 align:middle line:10%
>> I feel peaceful but cold.

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:51.730 align:middle line:10%
It's dark.

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:53.130 align:middle line:10%
It was dark.

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:55.270 align:middle line:10%
>> So can you see the body?

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:56.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Next to me.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.502 align:middle line:10%
>> Next to you.

00:15:58.502 --> 00:16:01.270 align:middle line:10%
>> People looking at it.

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:04.780 align:middle line:10%
Some crying, some don't.

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:08.050 align:middle line:10%
Some that look in satisfaction.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:13.390 align:middle line:10%
But the body is lying on a
hard surface like a stone or--

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:15.130 align:middle line:10%
that actually scared me a bit.

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:17.230 align:middle line:90%
Because I felt cold, it's true.

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And then to see me and
down like, but this is me.

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:22.160 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing there?

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.243 align:middle line:90%
I'm here but you're there.

00:16:23.243 --> 00:16:24.043 align:middle line:90%
Peekaboo.

00:16:24.043 --> 00:16:25.430 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] You don't get off me.

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:26.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's go forward in time
a little bit to the time that

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.860 align:middle line:84%
you're able to leave
that body behind.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Feels peaceful.

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:37.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Feels peaceful.

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:39.660 align:middle line:10%
>> A lot of trees.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.840 align:middle line:10%
>> What else can
you notice here?

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.092 align:middle line:10%
>> White bull.

00:16:44.092 --> 00:16:47.775 align:middle line:84%
>> Is the white bull near you
or is it a bit further away?

00:16:47.775 --> 00:16:50.242 align:middle line:10%
>> A bit further away.

00:16:50.242 --> 00:16:52.620 align:middle line:10%
It's grazing.

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:57.270 align:middle line:10%
He knows I'm here, but he's--

00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:02.100 align:middle line:10%
remains calm, like
minding his own business.

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I see him in all my
dreams all the time.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:05.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, not you again.

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:08.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't get really intimidated
by him, nor does he.

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.799 align:middle line:90%
We make peace in that way.

00:17:09.799 --> 00:17:10.599 align:middle line:90%
You stay there.

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:11.839 align:middle line:90%
I'll stay here.

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:15.230 align:middle line:90%
>> What else is happening here?

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:17.000 align:middle line:10%
It's like a farm.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.940 align:middle line:10%
I can see people
working the land.

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.710 align:middle line:10%
I like picking vegetables.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.146 align:middle line:10%
Some sort of vegetables.

00:17:26.146 --> 00:17:28.380 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you feel here?

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.246 align:middle line:90%
This farm.

00:17:30.246 --> 00:17:31.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Happy.

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:33.080 align:middle line:10%
>> You're happy.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:37.040 align:middle line:84%
I was expecting him to go then
into the between lives space

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.930 align:middle line:84%
where perhaps they meet
a light or whatever,

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:41.075 align:middle line:84%
but instead he went to
a different past life.

00:17:41.075 --> 00:17:43.360 align:middle line:90%
What do you look like here?

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.640 align:middle line:10%
>> In my 30s, I'd say.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:50.222 align:middle line:10%
Strange looking sandals,
but comfortable.

00:17:50.222 --> 00:17:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's move to the
last day of your life.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.460 align:middle line:84%
Because our aim was to go
into the between lives space,

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.267 align:middle line:84%
we didn't really need to
explore that many past lives.

00:17:59.267 --> 00:18:01.100 align:middle line:84%
So then again, that's
the reason why I said,

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.160 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're going to move on
to the last day of your life

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.795 align:middle line:90%
in that past lifetime.

00:18:05.795 --> 00:18:08.935 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm standing right
next to the body.

00:18:08.935 --> 00:18:10.850 align:middle line:10%
I see people crying.

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:12.320 align:middle line:10%
But I feel comfortable.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.770 align:middle line:10%
>> You feel comfortable.

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:14.570 align:middle line:10%
Good.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:15.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Relieved.

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>> This one felt more human
because I had people who cared

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:23.435 align:middle line:84%
for me and they were
crying and it felt normal.

00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:24.235 align:middle line:90%
It felt OK.

00:18:24.235 --> 00:18:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And how do you feel being
here in this gathering?

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.195 align:middle line:10%
>> I left but not content.

00:18:30.195 --> 00:18:31.550 align:middle line:10%
>> Not content.

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:36.090 align:middle line:10%
>> I didn't fulfill enough.

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:40.800 align:middle line:84%
It felt I didn't fulfill all my
expectations and dreams that I

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:44.350 align:middle line:84%
had for that life or pass
on whatever knowledge I had.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd like you to
go to a time, place,

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:53.130 align:middle line:84%
where you planned
your current life.

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:56.730 align:middle line:10%
>> It's inside a house.

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.640 align:middle line:10%
A lot of wooden furniture.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.386 align:middle line:10%
Hand crafted wooden furniture.

00:19:02.386 --> 00:19:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>> What is it that happens here
in this big house where you

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:08.320 align:middle line:90%
planned your current life?

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:11.005 align:middle line:10%
>> Just building it, making it.

00:19:11.005 --> 00:19:16.002 align:middle line:84%
>> So tell me about building
your life, making it.

00:19:16.002 --> 00:19:20.480 align:middle line:10%
>> The sense of wanting more,
more, and more, and more,

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.985 align:middle line:10%
but not enough.

00:19:21.985 --> 00:19:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So the sense of wanting
more, but a sense of not having

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:25.865 align:middle line:90%
enough.

00:19:25.865 --> 00:19:27.040 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm not doing enough.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Not doing enough.

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So what things are you
wanting from this life that

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:35.740 align:middle line:84%
you're making, that
you're building?

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:36.905 align:middle line:10%
>> Happiness.

00:19:36.905 --> 00:19:38.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Happiness.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:43.590 align:middle line:84%
He came to this space where he
was literally building his life.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.320 align:middle line:84%
The way it came
out for him is I'm

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.180 align:middle line:84%
building furniture
made with wood.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.260 align:middle line:84%
He was building literally
his life now is done.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.090 align:middle line:90%
It was beautiful to see.

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:55.950 align:middle line:84%
Just tell me how that
building is coming on.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:57.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Beautiful.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.150 align:middle line:10%
It's perfect.

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.810 align:middle line:10%
Everything is working
the right way.

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:02.610 align:middle line:10%
>> All right.

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:03.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Precise.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.995 align:middle line:10%
And I feel happy about it.

00:20:05.995 --> 00:20:07.620 align:middle line:84%
I remember just
standing there looking,

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.150 align:middle line:90%
wow, look what I've done.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:10.210 align:middle line:90%
It looks amazing.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:12.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm making the tables, I'm
making, furniture and stuff

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:12.910 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:13.770 align:middle line:90%
It looked beautiful.

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:15.430 align:middle line:84%
It was a feeling
of accomplishment

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:16.442 align:middle line:90%
like, yes, I've done it.

00:20:16.442 --> 00:20:18.150 align:middle line:84%
I've done everything
what I wanted to do,

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:19.140 align:middle line:90%
how I wanted to do.

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:24.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that the shape that
the happiness has taken now?

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:28.155 align:middle line:84%
Is it the shape of something
handcrafted, wooden?

00:20:28.155 --> 00:20:28.955 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:28.955 --> 00:20:30.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:34.450 align:middle line:84%
So just describe this
handcrafted happiness to me.

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:36.900 align:middle line:90%
Happiness with a loved one.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:40.880 align:middle line:10%
I'm making like
tables and ornaments.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Are they all made of wood,
or are they different materials?

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:45.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Made of wood.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:47.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Wood.

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:50.520 align:middle line:10%
Is it any particular wood
that they're made of?

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Cherry.

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:52.910 align:middle line:10%
It's strong.

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:54.010 align:middle line:10%
>> It's strong

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:54.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Durable.

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:55.610 align:middle line:10%
>> I understand.

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:57.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Strong.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.500 align:middle line:90%
Durable.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.550 align:middle line:84%
What is it specific
about cherry wood?

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:01.627 align:middle line:90%
What made him pick that?

00:21:01.627 --> 00:21:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes that can tell
us a little bit more about it.

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:05.660 align:middle line:90%
And he said it's durable.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.560 align:middle line:90%
It's really hard-wearing.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little bit
about one of the ornaments

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.070 align:middle line:90%
that you've made.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:13.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Handles for tools.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.196 align:middle line:10%
Saws.

00:21:15.196 --> 00:21:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And how is having the cherry
wood handles with the saws,

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:22.180 align:middle line:84%
how is it going to bring
happiness with a loved one

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.085 align:middle line:90%
in your upcoming life?

00:21:24.085 --> 00:21:25.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Long lasting.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>> And how are the tools?

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:30.050 align:middle line:84%
How is the saw
going to help you?

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:33.400 align:middle line:10%
>> By measuring and
cutting correctly.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>> When something is cut
correctly, measured correctly,

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:39.060 align:middle line:84%
that contributes to the
happiness, doesn't it?

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.025 align:middle line:10%
>> Fits correctly.

00:21:40.025 --> 00:21:42.940 align:middle line:10%
>> It fits correctly.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:46.250 align:middle line:84%
How are the tables going to
contribute to the happiness?

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Family.

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:51.520 align:middle line:84%
I was making those tables
for our family to come.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, having had that
big house, it felt empty.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.790 align:middle line:84%
So the more furniture
I made, in my mind,

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:58.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking the more
people will come.

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>> He was measuring,
he was planning.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:03.292 align:middle line:84%
He was literally
building his life.

00:22:03.292 --> 00:22:04.750 align:middle line:84%
It's happiness he
wanted, isn't it?

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's how he was
creating that for himself.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Now that the planning, the
preparation is all done,

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:13.570 align:middle line:90%
what else did you do?

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:15.100 align:middle line:90%
Who else did you meet?

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Two friends.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:20.950 align:middle line:10%
One is tall, gray hair.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:22.690 align:middle line:10%
He's very serious.

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:24.435 align:middle line:10%
But a good friend.

00:22:24.435 --> 00:22:26.000 align:middle line:10%
>> A good friend.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.050 align:middle line:10%
>> We speak about life.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:31.465 align:middle line:10%
He says, in order
to have strong roots

00:22:31.465 --> 00:22:35.590 align:middle line:10%
you need to create strong
foundations, to have

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:37.062 align:middle line:10%
a good life.

00:22:37.062 --> 00:22:40.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you fully understand
what he means by that?

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:42.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:43.360 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.930 align:middle line:84%
He needed to get the roots, the
elemental things of his life

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:47.810 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:50.570 align:middle line:84%
He needed to measure that
correctly, plan that correctly.

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And once those
foundations were correct,

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.670 align:middle line:84%
then anything he
would build, create

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:58.705 align:middle line:84%
on top of that would also do
well and be solid and be strong.

00:22:58.705 --> 00:23:00.753 align:middle line:84%
>> Without foundation you
can't have good roots.

00:23:00.753 --> 00:23:02.920 align:middle line:84%
Without good roots you can't
have a good foundation.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:03.812 align:middle line:90%
Just simple as that.

00:23:03.812 --> 00:23:05.770 align:middle line:84%
So you need to have the
balance of both of them

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:07.395 align:middle line:84%
in order to be what
you want to become,

00:23:07.395 --> 00:23:08.780 align:middle line:90%
what you want to build in life.

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe you mentioned there
was another friend you were

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:13.047 align:middle line:90%
meeting, wasn't there?

00:23:13.047 --> 00:23:13.847 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:23:13.847 --> 00:23:14.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Tell me how the other
friend appears to you.

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:19.910 align:middle line:10%
>> Very drunk.

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:22.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Very drunk.

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:22.910 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:24.760 align:middle line:90%
Tell me more about that.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Joking, always joking.

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:32.912 align:middle line:10%
And he goes to the opposite
of what my other friend says.

00:23:32.912 --> 00:23:38.210 align:middle line:10%
He says live and dance
as if it's the last day.

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Basically, don't stop
enjoying yourself in life.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.170 align:middle line:84%
If you want to do
something, just do it.

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:44.420 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it just nice to do
something what you want to do

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:45.510 align:middle line:90%
and when you want to do it.

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:46.140 align:middle line:90%
Simple as that.

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Regardless, you have family,
you have bills to pay,

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:48.860 align:middle line:90%
you got a wife.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.082 align:middle line:90%
Just you're your own person.

00:23:50.082 --> 00:23:52.290 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean, you cannot
do things you want to do.

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:55.386 align:middle line:84%
>> Does he say anything
more about that?

00:23:55.386 --> 00:23:59.190 align:middle line:10%
>> No, but he's looking at my
other friend, sarcastically.

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:01.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Sarcastically.

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:04.010 align:middle line:10%
How does the other
friend react to that?

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:07.350 align:middle line:10%
>> He reacts by looking
at him with wide eyes.

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:09.345 align:middle line:10%
>> He say anything?

00:24:09.345 --> 00:24:12.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Just the look is enough.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:17.040 align:middle line:84%
He just opened his eyes, like
whoa, with eyebrow up, really.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.335 align:middle line:84%
But to be honest with
you, it felt really funny

00:24:19.335 --> 00:24:21.960 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, because I was
looking at them and I was like,

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.250 align:middle line:84%
you're telling me like I
need roots on foundation.

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:27.380 align:middle line:84%
You're telling me just to enjoy
as much as I want to in case,

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:28.180 align:middle line:90%
it's the last day.

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.140 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:30.495 align:middle line:90%
So which one do I opt for.

00:24:30.495 --> 00:24:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And how do
these friends feel?

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:36.245 align:middle line:84%
Do these friends feel familiar,
as if you've met them before?

00:24:36.245 --> 00:24:40.375 align:middle line:84%
Or does it feel like this is
the first time you've met?

00:24:40.375 --> 00:24:41.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Very familiar.

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I wonder if the
gray-haired friend,

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:47.760 align:middle line:84%
if he says anything about in
order to have strong roots,

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:51.440 align:middle line:84%
you need to create strong
foundations to have a good life.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Don't stop dreaming.

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:57.100 align:middle line:10%
Whatever I dream, to make it.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:00.210 align:middle line:10%
If I really want to do it.

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:03.162 align:middle line:10%
But he keeps saying, strong
roots, strong foundations.

00:25:03.162 --> 00:25:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>> If you can dream
it, you can make it.

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:07.342 align:middle line:90%
And that spoke to me as well.

00:25:07.342 --> 00:25:09.300 align:middle line:84%
If you can dream, if you
can imagine something,

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:12.760 align:middle line:84%
if you can see it in your mind's
eye, then you can manifest it,

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.128 align:middle line:90%
you can realize it.

00:25:14.128 --> 00:25:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>> You choose what
advice you want to take.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.350 align:middle line:84%
You can take the
quick one, which

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:19.180 align:middle line:84%
is just to have
fun all the time,

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:20.780 align:middle line:90%
and don't achieve anything.

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Or you can take and
achieve whatever you

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:24.555 align:middle line:90%
want to achieve then have fun.

00:25:24.555 --> 00:25:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>> No wonder whether there
is anything else that you did

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:31.590 align:middle line:84%
in order to get ready
for this upcoming life.

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:32.865 align:middle line:10%
>> I met this woman.

00:25:32.865 --> 00:25:34.700 align:middle line:90%
>> You met this woman.

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell me, perhaps,
first of all,

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.240 align:middle line:90%
how this woman appears to you?

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Very cheeky.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.760 align:middle line:10%
Confident.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:48.540 align:middle line:10%
She tells me I need
to balance myself.

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:51.675 align:middle line:10%
And she shows me, like
the symbol of yin yang?

00:25:51.675 --> 00:25:52.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Something similar.

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:55.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Symbol of Yin Yang.

00:25:55.970 --> 00:26:01.200 align:middle line:10%
>> She mentions something
like too much yang is good,

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.170 align:middle line:10%
but not enough yin is not good.

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:06.120 align:middle line:10%
Pace myself.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:11.430 align:middle line:10%
She says it's OK to be
very masculine, but also

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:13.000 align:middle line:10%
too much of it is not good.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:15.490 align:middle line:90%
>> It's OK to be, man.

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:16.380 align:middle line:90%
It's OK to be loud.

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.250 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to have a
strong character.

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:21.690 align:middle line:84%
But you need to lower it down
and bring the yin up a bit.

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Have a bit more emotions, have
a bit, a bit of everything

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.490 align:middle line:90%
in order to be balanced.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:27.490 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, it's no good.

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>> What does she
mean by yin and yang?

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:32.800 align:middle line:10%
>> She's like telling
me, go one step back.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.670 align:middle line:10%
Like, pace yourself,
hold your horses.

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:36.710 align:middle line:10%
Something like that.

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:37.510 align:middle line:10%
It feels that way.

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:38.845 align:middle line:10%
>> Hold your horses.

00:26:38.845 --> 00:26:44.340 align:middle line:10%
>> I need to find a balance
with my character and myself,

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:48.480 align:middle line:10%
to take a step back.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.280 align:middle line:10%
Patience.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.997 align:middle line:84%
Before I finish something, I
started three things already.

00:26:51.997 --> 00:26:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And then I think, OK, how
am I going to do it all?

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.000 align:middle line:84%
So probably that's
the reason why.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.940 align:middle line:84%
Start something, finish it,
then move on to the next stage.

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:01.595 align:middle line:90%
>> Does she say anything else?

00:27:01.595 --> 00:27:04.022 align:middle line:10%
>> I need to eat more fruit.

00:27:04.022 --> 00:27:05.255 align:middle line:10%
>> How is that going--

00:27:05.255 --> 00:27:06.080 align:middle line:10%
>> And beetroot.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.212 align:middle line:90%
>> More fruit and beetroot.

00:27:08.212 --> 00:27:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't eat a lot of fruits.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Put a steak in front of me, a
T-bone, straight away on it.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:14.910 align:middle line:84%
But fruits, no yeah,
they're all right.

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:15.710 align:middle line:90%
They're there.

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:16.790 align:middle line:90%
They look nice and shiny.

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>> What is eating more
fruit going to give you?

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:21.894 align:middle line:10%
>> Vitamins.

00:27:21.894 --> 00:27:24.771 align:middle line:10%
>> And the beetroot?

00:27:24.771 --> 00:27:26.290 align:middle line:10%
>> For my immune system.

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:27.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Immune system.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.080 align:middle line:10%
>> I hate beetroot.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.940 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely hate beetroot.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.000 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely hate it.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:32.800 align:middle line:90%
Oh my God.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:33.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm traumatized with it.

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:36.360 align:middle line:84%
But in there again, I
didn't dislike beetroot.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.753 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
my subconscious

00:27:37.753 --> 00:27:38.920 align:middle line:90%
is like, what are you doing?

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.753 align:middle line:84%
Don't even think of
planting beetroot there.

00:27:40.753 --> 00:27:42.220 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
go well with you.

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.300 align:middle line:90%
I hated beetroot.

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:44.230 align:middle line:90%
You can tie me up.

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:45.030 align:middle line:90%
Torture me.

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:46.496 align:middle line:90%
No, thank you.

00:27:46.496 --> 00:27:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there anything else about
the future that is discussed

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:51.480 align:middle line:90%
here between you and her?

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.280 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:54.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:58.890 align:middle line:84%
You came to this session with
some questions, didn't you?

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:02.240 align:middle line:84%
We're going to just
ask those questions.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.515 align:middle line:84%
What is your purpose
in this life?

00:28:05.515 --> 00:28:08.480 align:middle line:10%
>> I need to find myself first.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.675 align:middle line:10%
I'm there, but not
quite there yet.

00:28:10.675 --> 00:28:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>> What can help you
to find yourself?

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:15.942 align:middle line:10%
>> Learn to forgive.

00:28:15.942 --> 00:28:18.030 align:middle line:10%
>> What can help you do that?

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:19.785 align:middle line:10%
>> Talking to them.

00:28:19.785 --> 00:28:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Once you've found yourself
and you've learned how

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:26.650 align:middle line:84%
to forgive, what can they tell
you about the purpose in this

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:27.450 align:middle line:90%
life?

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:29.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Helping people.

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:30.970 align:middle line:10%
Finding solutions.

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So am I right then in
thinking that what you do now

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:38.080 align:middle line:84%
fits in with your
purpose in life?

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.301 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:28:40.301 --> 00:28:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Another question you had was,
why do you dream with a white

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:45.870 align:middle line:90%
bull.

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:48.310 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a father figure.

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:50.100 align:middle line:10%
Not to be afraid.

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So am I right in thinking the
white bull is there to help you?

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.592 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:28:55.592 --> 00:28:59.025 align:middle line:84%
>> What things might the white
bull be able to help you with?

00:28:59.025 --> 00:29:01.101 align:middle line:10%
>> Guidance.

00:29:01.101 --> 00:29:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned having a
need for success all the time.

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:06.900 align:middle line:84%
That failure is not
an option for you.

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.420 align:middle line:10%
>> To do one thing at a time.

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:13.215 align:middle line:10%
Don't rush and try and
make 10 things at once.

00:29:13.215 --> 00:29:17.615 align:middle line:10%
Do one task then move to
the other task step by step.

00:29:17.615 --> 00:29:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So is this again about
finding that balance?

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:22.365 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:29:22.365 --> 00:29:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Is finding balance, I wonder,
does that relate to you not

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:28.930 align:middle line:90%
accepting failure as well?

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:29.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:31.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.175 align:middle line:10%
Can you explain that a
little bit more to you?

00:29:34.175 --> 00:29:37.625 align:middle line:10%
>> It's good to lose
and not always win.

00:29:37.625 --> 00:29:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Am I right in thinking
that they also mean,

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:43.890 align:middle line:84%
things don't have to be
perfect all the time.

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:46.900 align:middle line:84%
Again, having that balance,
or do they not mean that?

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:47.700 align:middle line:10%
>> That's correct.

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:48.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:49.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Three things.

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:51.750 align:middle line:90%
Patience.

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Calm down and do what I want to
do, that the sky has no limits.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Those are values that I
will take on board now.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think it helped
me a lot, this session,

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.890 align:middle line:84%
because now I have
more clarity to this.

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I wonder if there's any other
questions that you would like

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.270 align:middle line:90%
to ask them.

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:10.261 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:30:10.261 --> 00:30:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>> It was lovely to do
the session with Dan.

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:13.790 align:middle line:84%
I think he'll benefit
from it a lot.

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:16.120 align:middle line:84%
He'll get that sense
of balance, and he'll

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.790 align:middle line:84%
get to really
understand and feel

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:21.760 align:middle line:84%
why things feel so
important for him,

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.210 align:middle line:84%
and why sometimes it's good
to take a little step back.

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:26.605 align:middle line:90%
How long do you think it's been?

00:30:26.605 --> 00:30:28.633 align:middle line:84%
>> It felt like I'd
been like 20 minutes.

00:30:28.633 --> 00:30:29.675 align:middle line:90%
>> It's been three hours.

00:30:29.675 --> 00:30:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Seriously?

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:32.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my God.

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:32.965 align:middle line:90%
Seriously.

00:30:32.965 --> 00:30:33.765 align:middle line:90%
>> Seriously.

00:30:33.765 --> 00:30:34.765 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:30:34.765 --> 00:30:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Before, I didn't have much
belief, like in hypnotherapy,

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.350 align:middle line:90%
now I highly recommend it.

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:44.210 align:middle line:84%
If I could have one every
single day of the week, I would.

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:45.380 align:middle line:90%
As simple as that.

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.610 align:middle line:90%
That's how good it feels.

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:47.813 align:middle line:90%
You feel like you slept.

00:30:47.813 --> 00:30:50.230 align:middle line:84%
But now I feel like bouncing
off the walls full of energy,

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:52.000 align:middle line:84%
full of life,
which is the truth.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.910 align:middle line:90%

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:56.850 align:middle line:90%


00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:59.080 align:middle line:10%
It's been two weeks
since my session,

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.050 align:middle line:10%
and I feel amazingly great.

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:05.150 align:middle line:84%
What came up is strong
roots, strong foundation.

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:07.650 align:middle line:84%
For me, it means we
have to start somewhere

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:11.130 align:middle line:84%
in order to build something
solid for ourselves.

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:14.800 align:middle line:84%
I remember like, I hate eating,
for example, eating beetroot.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.315 align:middle line:90%
But now I took that on board.

00:31:17.315 --> 00:31:19.890 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Believe it or not.

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:22.455 align:middle line:84%
Even if I have to hold my nose
every time I take a mouthful.

00:31:22.455 --> 00:31:25.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] But I thought, why not?

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:27.000 align:middle line:90%
Let's give it a go.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.050 align:middle line:90%
And I do feel much better.

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Funny enough, I'm building
some furniture back

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:36.210 align:middle line:84%
in the mainland for my
mother from cherry wood.

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:37.840 align:middle line:90%
Things just coming together.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.090 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:40.810 align:middle line:90%
And yes, I feel much better.

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And I am putting
things into progress

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:48.570 align:middle line:84%
as well with regarding patience,
regarding myself, regarding

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:49.800 align:middle line:90%
thinking things ahead.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.170 align:middle line:84%
But not hitting myself
in the chest too much

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:53.470 align:middle line:90%
with things or anything.

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:55.290 align:middle line:90%
Just going with the flow.

00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:56.830 align:middle line:84%
Just trying to
balance, yeah, I can

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:58.390 align:middle line:84%
have fun when I
need to have fun,

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:01.120 align:middle line:84%
but also, I got my own
responsibilities and family

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.290 align:middle line:90%
to take care of.

00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:03.280 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Ellemiek.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:07.030 align:middle line:84%
I had a journey into my
soul and moving forward,

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:10.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm taking everything what
I learned from that day

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:14.770 align:middle line:84%
into my future as a guidance,
step by step on my daily basis.
