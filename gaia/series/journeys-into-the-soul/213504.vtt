>> So, can you
tell me about him?

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>> He molested me for three
years when I was little and told

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.130 align:middle line:84%
me that if I told her or
anybody that he would kill her.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And so from six
to nine years old,

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.940 align:middle line:90%
I lived with massive trauma.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.610 align:middle line:84%
He held a gun on my stomach
every time things occurred.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.360 align:middle line:90%

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.810 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Becky.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm a mother, a grandmother.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.460 align:middle line:90%
I live here in Arizona.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.950 align:middle line:84%
I've been on a spiritual journey
for a little over a decade now,

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.550 align:middle line:84%
and I feel like there
is a huge block,

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.910 align:middle line:84%
and I need to release
that so I can move forward

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.710 align:middle line:90%
in whatever my mission is.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.500 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of things to be
worked on and a lot of things

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.980 align:middle line:84%
that I would like to
find out about myself.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.960 align:middle line:84%
I tell my grandkids,
life is like a puzzle.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you just have to
take a step back and look at it

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.740 align:middle line:84%
from a different perspective
because the pieces don't always

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.620 align:middle line:84%
fit where you
think they need to.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.688 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:34.688 --> 00:01:36.080 align:middle line:90%


00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.270 align:middle line:84%
I found Erica through
a friend of mine

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.100 align:middle line:84%
named Brian, who
told me about her

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.560 align:middle line:84%
and told me that she
does the QHHT sessions.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.030 align:middle line:10%
So I got in contact with her
and scheduled my first session

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.650 align:middle line:10%
with her about a
year and a half ago,

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.430 align:middle line:10%
and I had an intensely
positive outcome from that.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so grateful
that I got to do that.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.450 align:middle line:84%
It's more things over the last
year and a half have come up,

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.330 align:middle line:84%
and I have a lot more
questions, and I'm

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.480 align:middle line:84%
hoping to be able to release
a lot of these blocks

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.460 align:middle line:84%
so that I can get to a
point where I feel more--

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.169 align:middle line:90%
my voice isn't so blocked.

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:14.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm not so scared and timid.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm not so quiet and sitting
back and watching everybody.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.300 align:middle line:84%
I kind of feel like I need
a little bit more guidance

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.410 align:middle line:84%
on what I need to be
doing next with my life.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.660 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And so I reached
back out to Erica,

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.270 align:middle line:84%
and we have another
session scheduled

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm really excited for.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.532 align:middle line:90%


00:02:34.532 --> 00:02:38.025 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:38.025 --> 00:02:47.030 align:middle line:90%


00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>> My name is Dr.
Erica Middlemiss.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm a naturopathic physician
and a level 3 QHHT practitioner.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.090 align:middle line:84%
I've always wanted to help
people be healthy, learn

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.630 align:middle line:90%
how to keep themselves well.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.910 align:middle line:90%
And then I found Dolores Cannon.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.560 align:middle line:10%
This genius of a woman
developed a technique

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.070 align:middle line:10%
to help people understand
themselves, understand

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.570 align:middle line:10%
why they are going through the
things they are going through

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.660 align:middle line:10%
in their lives, why they
are experiencing the health

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.940 align:middle line:10%
conditions and
concerns that they are.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.140 align:middle line:90%
We all came to learn lessons.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.550 align:middle line:90%
And we're here doing that.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.140 align:middle line:90%
And it's not always easy.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the
traumas affect us

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.020 align:middle line:84%
so deeply that we just
don't understand it

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:90%
and can't get to it.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.270 align:middle line:84%
This technique offers us
a different perspective

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.220 align:middle line:84%
where we can look
at what's happened

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.650 align:middle line:84%
to us in our lives
in a whole new way,

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.860 align:middle line:84%
understand it and heal
from it and move forward.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.280 align:middle line:10%
I decided to use this method
of Quantum Healing Hypnosis

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.740 align:middle line:10%
Technique because I felt
that it was extremely

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.350 align:middle line:10%
important for people to
get their own answers

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.070 align:middle line:10%
and to understand that they
have this power within them,

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.950 align:middle line:10%
that this does not come
from outside of them,

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.270 align:middle line:10%
that each and every single one
of us has the answers within us,

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.510 align:middle line:10%
has this connection and has
the ability to connect to it.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And so when we are able to tap
into these aspects of our self

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.740 align:middle line:84%
and get our answers, our
path can be way more clear.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Our understanding of our
life is way more clear,

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.485 align:middle line:84%
and understanding of
ourselves what makes us us.

00:04:15.485 --> 00:04:22.380 align:middle line:90%


00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.079 align:middle line:84%
We will always be
offered the opportunity

00:04:25.079 --> 00:04:27.970 align:middle line:84%
to learn these lessons
that we came here to learn.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And relationships
are the only way

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.740 align:middle line:84%
we get to learn them because we
need another to love, to learn

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.920 align:middle line:84%
to be mad at, to have to
forgive, to have compassion for.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.890 align:middle line:84%
We need that relationship in
order to learn these lessons.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.700 align:middle line:84%
First, it's the parents, then
comes the siblings, and then

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.300 align:middle line:90%
our relationships with others.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.720 align:middle line:84%
So notice in your life,
if there are difficulties

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.840 align:middle line:84%
in relationships, you can
find that pattern and that

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.270 align:middle line:84%
will point to the lesson
you're here to learn.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.660 align:middle line:10%
When Becky comes in for her
session what we'll first do

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.220 align:middle line:10%
is sit down and have
a nice conversation.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.170 align:middle line:90%
I want to learn all about her.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.230 align:middle line:84%
I want to learn how
she grew up, what

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.800 align:middle line:84%
life was like for her, what type
of experiences that she's had,

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.670 align:middle line:84%
and how that has shaped her,
how that's made her who she is.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.690 align:middle line:10%
From there, I will have a really
wonderful understanding of hers

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.440 align:middle line:10%
that I can ask her the most
poignant and effective questions

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.320 align:middle line:10%
to help her get the
answers that she needs.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.530 align:middle line:10%
We will go into the
session at that point

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.140 align:middle line:10%
where I put her into a
deep state of relaxation,

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.110 align:middle line:10%
where she has access
to all of her answers,

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.890 align:middle line:10%
and she will also be
guided into an experience

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.140 align:middle line:10%
that her higher self
wants to show her

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.700 align:middle line:10%
that will help her make sense of
what's going on in her life now.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.906 align:middle line:10%

00:05:45.906 --> 00:05:53.560 align:middle line:90%


00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.810 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, first of all.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:56.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm glad you're here today.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.350 align:middle line:84%
Tell me why you wanted
to have another session.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.950 align:middle line:84%
>> There's been a lot of things
coming up recently around Eric

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.370 align:middle line:84%
and the grandkids and some trust
issues that I'm having that I

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.730 align:middle line:84%
think are coming from
my childhood trauma.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.280 align:middle line:84%
I have been pushing
that down and not

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.770 align:middle line:84%
bringing that
forward to address it

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.038 align:middle line:84%
and how it's affecting
me in my life now.

00:06:19.038 --> 00:06:20.580 align:middle line:84%
So I thought this
would be a good way

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.640 align:middle line:84%
to go a little deeper
into that and see

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.950 align:middle line:84%
if there's some healing
available for that.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>> So talk to me about the
feelings that it's bringing up

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:30.540 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Like, I'm trying so hard to
protect the kids that I think

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.010 align:middle line:84%
that I almost feel like, and I
don't think this is the truth,

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.090 align:middle line:84%
but it's a good possibility that
I might be making things stories

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.960 align:middle line:90%
up in my own mind.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.780 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
it's bringing up

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.140 align:middle line:84%
those-- the feeling
of as a child not

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.120 align:middle line:84%
being protected, what can I do
as a grandma to protect them?

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Is there a reason why
there's triggers happening?

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.230 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm struggling
really a lot with this,

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.660 align:middle line:90%
but it feels like it's time.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>> So can you tell me about it?

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was six,
my mom's boyfriend,

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.720 align:middle line:84%
his name was also
Eric, by the way.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.680 align:middle line:84%
He molested me for three
years when I was little

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.040 align:middle line:84%
and told me that if
I told her or anybody

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.510 align:middle line:90%
that he would kill her.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And so from six
to nine years old,

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.760 align:middle line:90%
I lived with massive trauma.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.210 align:middle line:84%
He held a gun on my stomach
every time things occurred.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And so that was
very hard, and then

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.400 align:middle line:84%
it just-- there's
this cycle and then

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.170 align:middle line:84%
I met Eric when I
was 13 years old.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.600 align:middle line:90%
My Eric now.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.510 align:middle line:84%
We kind of grew up
together and then got

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.070 align:middle line:90%
married when we were 17--

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.470 align:middle line:84%
18 years old, had
my daughter at 18.

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.070 align:middle line:90%
And we were divorced at 27.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.330 align:middle line:84%
He was extremely
physically abusive.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.270 align:middle line:84%
He put me in the hospital
a couple of times,

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.550 align:middle line:90%
shattered my face plate.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.410 align:middle line:84%
I had to have
reconstructive surgery.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.020 align:middle line:84%
There was just so
much around him, too.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And recently, at home,
I've started really

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:06.280 align:middle line:84%
kind of pushing everybody
out emotionally from me.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.580 align:middle line:90%
Do I need to go?

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.520 align:middle line:90%
Do we all need to go?

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.320 align:middle line:90%
Does he need to--

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.780 align:middle line:90%
like something has to give.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.660 align:middle line:84%
We can't keep going
like this, you know?

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm very scared, very
nervous because I'm not

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.170 align:middle line:84%
sure what's going
to come up today

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:25.323 align:middle line:84%
because I have avoided this one
part of my life for so long.

00:08:25.323 --> 00:08:26.740 align:middle line:84%
I've always kind
of brushed it off

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.630 align:middle line:84%
and said, no, I've
already done with that.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.200 align:middle line:90%
We don't need to go back there.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.260 align:middle line:84%
No more victim mentality,
like the whole thing.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.880 align:middle line:84%
But when you start realizing
that it's affecting things that

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.470 align:middle line:84%
are happening in
your daily life,

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:41.080 align:middle line:84%
the sadness that I have felt
for the last couple of days,

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:45.940 align:middle line:84%
just this unbelievable sadness
like feelings of abandonment,

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.985 align:middle line:84%
anger, like just
everything has come up

00:08:49.985 --> 00:08:51.110 align:middle line:90%
in the last couple of days.

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And I just couldn't
quite figure out

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.180 align:middle line:84%
where that was
coming from exactly

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.150 align:middle line:90%
except I feel like this is--

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:02.260 align:middle line:84%
it's the space for this to
be able to bring this out

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.640 align:middle line:90%
and to heal from it.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've literally
tried to talk to everybody.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, OK, here's
what's going on.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.540 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.560 align:middle line:90%
He's not here right now.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.830 align:middle line:84%
He's off and he's working out
of state so he left the house.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:13.750 align:middle line:90%
Thank God.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:16.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm really angry with him.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
how to express this.

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:20.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm angry.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm frustrated.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:24.400 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I just think
that it's probably

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.860 align:middle line:84%
a very good idea
for a separation

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.380 align:middle line:90%
to happen of some sort.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.180 align:middle line:90%
Energy is so off.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.400 align:middle line:84%
Everybody walks
around eggshells.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.900 align:middle line:90%
It's exhausting.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm being honest.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:37.780 align:middle line:90%
It is exhausting.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:44.230 align:middle line:84%
So I need to find out what my
next steps are here around that.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Let me ask you this.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.430 align:middle line:84%
When you're living
in a place where

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:52.380 align:middle line:84%
you're not walking on eggshells,
where you're not scared?

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.880 align:middle line:90%
What does that look like?

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>> That looks like before Eric
came back into the picture.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.710 align:middle line:90%
I live by myself.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:00.270 align:middle line:90%
I painted every night.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.180 align:middle line:84%
I had the grandkids
over on the weekends.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:02.980 align:middle line:90%
We painted.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.060 align:middle line:90%
We went out to the park.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:04.860 align:middle line:90%
We played.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.370 align:middle line:84%
I was happy with them, and we
would dance and play and sing,

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.660 align:middle line:84%
and that just was
like my happy place.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.640 align:middle line:90%
And my house was always clean.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.360 align:middle line:84%
I know that sounds weird,
but living with seven people,

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:90%
it's never clean.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:17.600 align:middle line:90%
>> I understand.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I would come home and
just take a nice big,

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.945 align:middle line:90%
deep breath and just--

00:10:22.945 --> 00:10:25.930 align:middle line:84%
and then, I just couldn't say
no, I let everybody back in,

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:29.000 align:middle line:90%
and here we are.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I know because can
you have that again?

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:34.668 align:middle line:90%
>> I think I can.

00:10:34.668 --> 00:10:35.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm scared to death to do that.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:36.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Say that again.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:37.790 align:middle line:90%
>> I said, I think I can.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:38.590 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Say it again, but say
it differently this time,

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:41.940 align:middle line:90%
the way you know how.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I can.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:45.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I can.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>> You know you can.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.890 align:middle line:90%
>> I know you can.

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:51.117 align:middle line:84%
>> Like, I say that to you
and your face goes, ah.

00:10:51.117 --> 00:10:52.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.830 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh, my gosh.

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:57.073 align:middle line:84%
We might not even
need to do the QHHT.

00:10:57.073 --> 00:10:59.540 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.290 align:middle line:90%
We can just do this all day.

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:05.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, this is how it works.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Jesus.

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the thing.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.130 align:middle line:84%
You always have
all your answers.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:11.540 align:middle line:90%
Always.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And they're coming so clearly
because you're just saying it.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:18.720 align:middle line:84%
You're just thinking out loud
essentially and telling me.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is how you
get your answers.

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:22.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:22.830 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.205 align:middle line:84%
I'll remind you
of the three tips

00:11:24.205 --> 00:11:26.630 align:middle line:84%
you want to say the very first
thing that comes to mind,

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.560 align:middle line:84%
describing things to me in as
much detail as you possibly can.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:29.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>> If you're watching things,
if you're seeing things,

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.720 align:middle line:84%
tell me about them
simultaneously.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.530 align:middle line:84%
You're focused on
something, tell me.

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:37.390 align:middle line:90%
If I'm not asking you, tell me.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Got it?

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:39.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's do this.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.930 align:middle line:84%
The best way to prepare to
have a session like this

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:45.790 align:middle line:84%
is to let go of any
and all expectations.

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Your session will not be like
another person's session.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And so letting go
of all control,

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.440 align:middle line:84%
allowing it to be
whatever it's going to be,

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.570 align:middle line:84%
allowing yourself
to feel like you're

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:00.130 align:middle line:84%
making it up because it
kind of feel that way.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:01.330 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Our intuition kind of
feels like our imagination.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:09.450 align:middle line:84%
We will learn to discern
through this process what's real

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:11.610 align:middle line:84%
and what's not,
and we learn what's

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:13.160 align:middle line:84%
real through
feeling the feeling.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.560 align:middle line:90%


00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Tell me the very
first thing that

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:19.990 align:middle line:90%
comes to mind when I ask you.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:23.040 align:middle line:84%
What made you decide
to come to this place?

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.410 align:middle line:10%
>> The waterfall Guardian.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:27.270 align:middle line:90%
>> The waterfall Guardian.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:29.280 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about the guardian.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.980 align:middle line:10%
>> He's the Guardian
of the waterfall.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Is he big or small or what?

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.360 align:middle line:10%
>> He's part of the mountain.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.120 align:middle line:10%
His face shows
through the waterfall.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Immediately, Becky went to
this beautiful place that is

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.530 align:middle line:90%
sacred to her in Mount Shasta.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I saw this face in the rocks,
and he was called the Guardian.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:55.375 align:middle line:84%
>> And how do you feel
when you look at him?

00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:56.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Love.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>> What made you want to
come to see this guardian?

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.280 align:middle line:10%
>> He's showing me with
feelings that I'm getting when

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.040 align:middle line:10%
I'm touching the water and
seeing the trees and hearing

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.260 align:middle line:10%
the angels.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.410 align:middle line:10%
We're all part of
the same being.

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.410 align:middle line:84%
I have a picture of that
same waterfall on my phone

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.230 align:middle line:84%
that I've had on there
since I visited Mount Shasta

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.420 align:middle line:90%
a few years ago.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>> She has this picture on
her phone and never saw this

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.180 align:middle line:90%
guardian there before.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Had no idea that this
face was in the rocks.

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at it, it is
so clear you can't unsee it.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>> It happens to be there's
a face in the rocks,

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.350 align:middle line:90%
and he looks like a guardian.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:35.900 align:middle line:90%
So that's pretty cool.

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Does he have anything
specific that he wants to tell

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:42.030 align:middle line:90%
you or any messages for you?

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.890 align:middle line:10%
>> I keep seeing a crown.

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:45.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.760 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about it.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.410 align:middle line:84%
Describe to me
what it looks like.

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:51.920 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a gold crown
that has jewels.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you find
yourself wearing it?

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, it's on my head.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:57.840 align:middle line:10%
There's colors.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.820 align:middle line:10%
There's-- I see red
and purple and pink.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:04.100 align:middle line:10%
They glow.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The crown was very symbolic,
and it was helping Becky

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:09.540 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
light within herself.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.830 align:middle line:84%
>> It was made of gold,
but the jewels lit up,

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:16.410 align:middle line:84%
and it had very long,
sharp points on it.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:19.730 align:middle line:84%
I would put it on
and the jewels--

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:21.770 align:middle line:84%
I would light the jewels
up, like, they would

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:23.848 align:middle line:90%
glow because of my inner light.

00:14:23.848 --> 00:14:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>> That was empowering her to
know that this light was coming

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:29.060 align:middle line:84%
from within her, not
from outside of her.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:33.200 align:middle line:10%
Is there anything that you
do that makes that happen?

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.230 align:middle line:10%
>> It happened when
I put it on my head.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:36.030 align:middle line:10%
>> I see.

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:37.740 align:middle line:10%
So it glows when you wear it?

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:38.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Got it.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.760 align:middle line:10%
>> I keep wanting
to take it off.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.820 align:middle line:90%
>> How come?

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Because I forgot.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So you feel like
because you forgot,

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.260 align:middle line:90%
you don't deserve to wear it?

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>> But you are wearing it.

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's lighting
up when you wear it.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Would it do that if you
weren't worthy of it?

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:05.200 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>> A big message that many
clients are given is to be

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:11.230 align:middle line:84%
the light because
that's what we are.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything else
he wants to tell you?

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Walk the path.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:17.900 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:22.430 align:middle line:84%
>> What I felt he meant by
walk the path is walk the path

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:26.760 align:middle line:84%
into darkness because sometimes
in the darkness there is beauty.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And we don't see that until
we're there and our eyes adjust

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.720 align:middle line:84%
and we adjust, and we can see
the beauty in the darkness

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.950 align:middle line:90%
and light it.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:38.760 align:middle line:10%
>> I then start
walking down the path.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:39.910 align:middle line:10%
It's a little scary.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:41.940 align:middle line:10%
It's very dark.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Why is it dark?

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.900 align:middle line:10%
>> The trees are very
thick and it's very dark.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:52.170 align:middle line:10%
No light can come in there.

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:56.550 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you feel about walking
the path when it's dark and not

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:58.965 align:middle line:90%
sure what's there?

00:15:58.965 --> 00:16:02.820 align:middle line:10%
>> I have to trust that
it's going to be OK.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:05.700 align:middle line:10%
>> And how do you know that you
can trust that it's going to be

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.620 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:12.300 align:middle line:10%
>> I have my crown and it will
light up the path and light

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.770 align:middle line:10%
my way.

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And with that, you know you
can trust to walk this path

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:18.460 align:middle line:90%
you'll be OK.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:25.530 align:middle line:84%
So do that then and
tell me about it.

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:29.160 align:middle line:10%
>> There is nothing
to fear in here.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:33.750 align:middle line:10%
Almost an overwhelming
feeling of love.

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:36.480 align:middle line:10%
And I keep moving
forward on this path.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.080 align:middle line:10%
I can't see where I'm going.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.610 align:middle line:10%
There's no light at all now.

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And so how do you feel
about continuing forward then?

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.840 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm OK.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't need to relive that
trauma in order to understand

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.600 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.320 align:middle line:84%
They have this beautiful
way of giving us

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.290 align:middle line:84%
other examples, like having
her walk into the dark

00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:00.780 align:middle line:84%
and showing her that it's not
scary, that there's not monsters

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:01.580 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.220 align:middle line:84%
They're not always monsters
just because it's dark,

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:07.190 align:middle line:90%
that she can be her own light.

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:10.339 align:middle line:84%
That was so huge
because when she

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:14.220 align:middle line:84%
was younger and traumatized,
that's not the way she felt.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.800 align:middle line:90%
She didn't feel powerful.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.569 align:middle line:90%
She didn't feel safe.

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Seeing things from
this perspective,

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:21.680 align:middle line:90%
she knows she's always safe.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.190 align:middle line:90%
She's very powerful.

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:25.099 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter
what happens out there

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:26.880 align:middle line:90%
because this is what's inside.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.290 align:middle line:90%
So they show you what's inside.

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:29.582 align:middle line:90%
They show you what's important.

00:17:29.582 --> 00:17:31.430 align:middle line:90%
They show you the meat.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:36.450 align:middle line:84%
So from here, where do you
go when you leave this place?

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:38.730 align:middle line:90%
What do you do next?

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:41.730 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm back out
at the waterfall.

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.480 align:middle line:10%
I didn't walk.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.450 align:middle line:10%
>> You didn't walk?

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:45.250 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:46.870 align:middle line:10%
>> How did you get there?

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:49.660 align:middle line:10%
>> I just thought about it.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.180 align:middle line:84%
So you thought about it and
you went back to the waterfall?

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:54.910 align:middle line:10%
>> It's time to go.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:57.552 align:middle line:10%
>> And how did you
know it was time to go?

00:17:57.552 --> 00:17:59.920 align:middle line:10%
>> The Guardian was asleep.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And what does it tell you
when the guardian is asleep?

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:03.970 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:06.820 align:middle line:10%
>> There's no more message.

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:09.710 align:middle line:10%
>> You already
received the message?

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:10.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>> We went back
to the waterfall,

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:13.660 align:middle line:84%
and I thought that there was
going to be more information

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:14.990 align:middle line:90%
there from the guardian.

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:17.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And I told her no
because he fell asleep,

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:19.580 align:middle line:84%
and he was literally
no more messages.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:20.640 align:middle line:90%
It was time to go.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.730 align:middle line:84%
>> She responded
with, no, he's asleep.

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:24.880 align:middle line:90%
It's time to go.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:29.280 align:middle line:84%
So you got your messages
and now it's time to go?

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>> After I asked Becky about
the lessons that she learned

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.850 align:middle line:84%
and the purpose for
learning those lessons,

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:39.170 align:middle line:90%
I then call her higher self.

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:42.460 align:middle line:84%
The client will immediately
start speaking about themselves

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:43.990 align:middle line:90%
in third person.

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Why did you bring her to
that scene, to that life?

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.860 align:middle line:10%
>> She needs to learn to trust
her intuition instead of her

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.740 align:middle line:10%
eyes.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Tell her about her lighting
the path so she can really

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.410 align:middle line:10%
understand how she does that.

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:03.400 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a glow that
comes from within her,

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.680 align:middle line:10%
but only she can see it.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Before she came
in, what was her goal?

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:12.112 align:middle line:84%
What did she want to
experience or accomplish here?

00:19:12.112 --> 00:19:14.036 align:middle line:10%
>> Martyr.

00:19:14.036 --> 00:19:15.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.590 align:middle line:10%
Tell me about that.

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:22.530 align:middle line:10%
>> She would sacrifice
herself for the greater good.

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you feel about that?

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:27.270 align:middle line:90%
Do you want her to be a martyr?

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.100 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Tell her what you
would like to see.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.540 align:middle line:10%
>> I would like to
see her be happy.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.910 align:middle line:10%
>> So tell her how
she can do that.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:38.950 align:middle line:10%
How can she be happy.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:41.860 align:middle line:10%
>> She spends all of
her time on others.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.200 align:middle line:10%
>> And what does that do to her?

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.800 align:middle line:10%
>> It depletes her,
her energy, her light.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.160 align:middle line:90%
It's exhausting.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.180 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if it's just
me putting that on myself

00:19:54.730 --> 00:20:00.250 align:middle line:84%
or if it's really just this
exhausting to always trying

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:04.360 align:middle line:84%
to be fixing everything, taking
everything, all the pain away

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.730 align:middle line:84%
from somebody else and
putting it onto myself, being

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:09.990 align:middle line:84%
the buffer between the
bad guy and the kids

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:11.430 align:middle line:90%
or the people, whoever.

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:15.210 align:middle line:90%
It's exhausting.

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:21.430 align:middle line:84%
What about her home now
that she currently lives in,

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.900 align:middle line:90%
how do you feel about that?

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:29.700 align:middle line:10%
>> It's like a black hole.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So what advice do you
have for her about her living

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.095 align:middle line:90%
situation?

00:20:35.095 --> 00:20:37.890 align:middle line:10%
>> She can go.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.740 align:middle line:10%
It needs to be alone.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:41.860 align:middle line:10%
>> She needs to go alone?

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:42.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:43.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Tell her why.

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:46.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Because the energy that's
getting depleted from her

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:49.470 align:middle line:10%
isn't just from him.

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:50.680 align:middle line:10%
>> It's the others, too.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>> She's putting her daughter
and grandkids before herself,

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:55.890 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:56.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:01.200 align:middle line:84%
So it'd be best for her to have
her own place and also make sure

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.970 align:middle line:84%
that they're safe as
well in their own place.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:04.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.090 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:07.840 align:middle line:90%
And tell her how that will go.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.140 align:middle line:90%
Will that be easy for her?

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.230 align:middle line:10%
>> It will be very easy, yes.

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:15.160 align:middle line:84%
I did get during
the session today

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.670 align:middle line:84%
that my subconscious
told me that

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:21.040 align:middle line:84%
because of what's happening
at my house right now,

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:25.090 align:middle line:84%
my household with my family
and the depletion of energy

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:27.580 align:middle line:84%
that I'm getting that
it is time for me to go

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.790 align:middle line:84%
and that I need to leave and
just be alone for a while.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that will last forever
or maybe just for a while.

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:39.460 align:middle line:84%
But right now, it
just needs to happen.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>> When would you like
to see her do this?

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:44.257 align:middle line:10%
>> As soon as she can.

00:21:44.257 --> 00:21:45.057 align:middle line:10%
>> All right.

00:21:45.057 --> 00:21:45.880 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Tell her how you see her,
how you feel about her.

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:58.390 align:middle line:10%
>> She is a beautiful light
being, and she is very happy,

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:00.760 align:middle line:10%
very joyful.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.280 align:middle line:10%
That's what we see
when we see her.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.080 align:middle line:10%
>> All right.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.900 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Could you do a body
scan on Becky, please?

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.430 align:middle line:90%
Look over her body.

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Let us know what's the
first area that you

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:15.466 align:middle line:90%
would like for us to focus on.

00:22:15.466 --> 00:22:18.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Her knee.

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>> As part of this
method of hypnosis,

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.320 align:middle line:84%
we do a scan of
the physical body.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And we ask the higher self
to take a look at the body

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:27.510 align:middle line:84%
and see if there's anything
that needs attention,

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:29.280 align:middle line:84%
if there's any
energies that are off,

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.690 align:middle line:84%
if there's anything physically
that is off with the body.

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:33.660 align:middle line:84%
They immediately
talked about her knee.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:37.710 align:middle line:10%
Anything symbolic about
that area for her body?

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:41.370 align:middle line:10%
>> It's made her recognize the
weight of the world crushing her

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:44.940 align:middle line:10%
bones, if she
continues this way.

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Explain to her how she's
doing it so she understands what

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:50.790 align:middle line:90%
exactly she's doing.

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:54.930 align:middle line:10%
>> She takes everybody's
problems from them,

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:58.200 align:middle line:10%
everybody's anxieties,
everybody's sadness,

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.050 align:middle line:10%
everybody's anger.

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>> So just having her own
place, living on her own,

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:07.550 align:middle line:84%
being able to take care of
herself, that will handle it?

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:09.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Where there's light,
there can't be darkness.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.930 align:middle line:10%
She needs to push the light out.

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, is there a message for
her in her knee that she needs

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:20.380 align:middle line:84%
to understand anymore,
or is that it?

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Slow down and unburden.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, since she has all the
understanding and she's going

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.790 align:middle line:90%
to do the action that's needed.

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:30.720 align:middle line:84%
Could you heal that
knee for her now?

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:34.110 align:middle line:90%


00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:39.180 align:middle line:10%
>> The cells are
regenerating around the tear.

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:40.890 align:middle line:10%
We see it healed.

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:43.390 align:middle line:10%
We saw it regenerating.

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:45.210 align:middle line:10%
>> What does it
look like to her?

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:47.754 align:middle line:10%
>> Inside of her leg, her bones.

00:23:47.754 --> 00:23:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:51.890 align:middle line:90%
Can she see it healing?

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:52.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:55.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Anything else in the
body that needs attention?

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:57.170 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So the burden that she
was feeling, that's gone now?

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:06.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Mostly it will be
better when she leaves.

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what was she supposed
to learn from these experiences?

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:13.550 align:middle line:10%
>> How to let go of control.

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:16.090 align:middle line:10%
She needs to step out of
the way so that Crystal can

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:17.900 align:middle line:10%
be the mother to her children.

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.507 align:middle line:84%
>> Letting go of control is a
very common thing with people

00:24:20.507 --> 00:24:22.840 align:middle line:84%
who've experienced trauma in
their lives because anytime

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.390 align:middle line:84%
we've experienced trauma,
we then want to control

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:27.160 align:middle line:84%
our atmosphere so
that we are safe.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And we try to control
in these little ways

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:32.350 align:middle line:84%
and what we're doing is
creating so much resistance

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:36.040 align:middle line:84%
in our lives, just building
walls, not allowing free flow.

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Letting go of that control is
what allows you to be present

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:40.520 align:middle line:90%
and allows your life to flow.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>> What I saw was me stepping
too far into the way with her

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.570 align:middle line:84%
in between her
and her parenting,

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:51.190 align:middle line:84%
and it's not giving her
opportunity or room to be mom

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:54.300 align:middle line:84%
instead of me being mom
all the time to the kids.

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>> She's had a lot more trauma
in this life than most other

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:58.760 align:middle line:90%
humans.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.940 align:middle line:90%
Is there a reason for that?

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:04.270 align:middle line:10%
>> She had to go through these
experiences so that she could

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:07.480 align:middle line:10%
teach others how to
overcome their fears,

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:13.610 align:middle line:10%
how to overcome their
anxiety about moving out,

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:18.170 align:middle line:10%
moving on, leaving an abuser,
knowing that they have

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:22.130 align:middle line:10%
the confidence and the strength
and the willpower within them

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:23.720 align:middle line:10%
to do these things.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:28.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And how is she going to
feel overall after today?

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:33.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Overall, I think she's
going to feel very light,

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:36.680 align:middle line:10%
more peaceful and find joy.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>> So do you have any final
words then for Becky today?

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.290 align:middle line:90%
Any final messages?

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:44.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Love yourself.

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.600 align:middle line:10%
Only when you love yourself
can you love others.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the biggest lessons
that I see light beings here

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.040 align:middle line:84%
learning is the
refinement of self love.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.240 align:middle line:84%
We've come to refine this
lesson to really understand

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.250 align:middle line:84%
how worthy each
and every one of us

00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:01.240 align:middle line:84%
is that there is no better
than, there is no less than.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.510 align:middle line:84%
>> If you don't love yourself,
you won't be able to love

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:05.310 align:middle line:90%
others.

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:08.100 align:middle line:84%
You have to love yourself first
and it's not a selfish thing.

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:11.960 align:middle line:84%
It fills up your bucket so
that you can give that love out

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.640 align:middle line:84%
to the rest of the
world for other people.

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.495 align:middle line:84%
But you have to come first
and you have to choose self.

00:26:17.495 --> 00:26:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>> How long do you feel
like you've been out?

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:20.705 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know, like an hour.

00:26:20.705 --> 00:26:21.505 align:middle line:90%
>> An hour?

00:26:21.505 --> 00:26:23.050 align:middle line:90%
That's what it feels like.

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Three hours.

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you kidding me?

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:29.300 align:middle line:84%
What the hell did we talk
about for three hours?

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>> I had lots of questions.

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:34.030 align:middle line:84%
I wanted you to
get some answers.

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:35.970 align:middle line:90%
You got him.

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:36.770 align:middle line:90%
How's your knee?

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:39.680 align:middle line:90%


00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Apparently, it's really good.

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:41.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm bending it.

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:42.770 align:middle line:90%
Holy crap.

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:43.640 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.080 align:middle line:90%
Are you seeing this right here.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:45.880 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:49.700 align:middle line:90%


00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.906 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:26:51.906 --> 00:26:53.130 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God.

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:54.200 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.380 align:middle line:90%
Look at my knee.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not even
swelled up anymore.

00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:58.510 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:00.200 align:middle line:90%
You guys, shut up.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.730 align:middle line:90%
Seriously.

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:02.790 align:middle line:90%
I can bend it.

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:04.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm not, like, doing anything.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.400 align:middle line:90%
Like, that's just bizarre to me.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.795 align:middle line:90%
That was, like, such--

00:27:08.795 --> 00:27:09.662 align:middle line:90%
like, oh, my gosh.

00:27:09.662 --> 00:27:11.120 align:middle line:84%
In your face healing,
that's crazy.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to me, that's insane
because it was this big

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:16.890 align:middle line:84%
and now it's not, like
they're the same size now.

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:17.897 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty cool.

00:27:17.897 --> 00:27:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>> The reason why I love doing
these sessions is because I see

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:25.520 align:middle line:84%
people come into my office one
way and I see them leave another

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.510 align:middle line:90%
way and they feel lighter.

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:31.160 align:middle line:84%
Their body doesn't hurt, they
feel happy, they feel peaceful,

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.270 align:middle line:90%
and they feel calm.

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>> This was an awesome
session with Dr. Erica today.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.965 align:middle line:84%
I definitely had a
journey into my soul.

00:27:38.965 --> 00:27:42.054 align:middle line:90%

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:46.630 align:middle line:84%
It's been two weeks since
my session with Erica,

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:48.230 align:middle line:90%
and I feel amazing.

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:51.280 align:middle line:84%
The clarity and the peace
that I have inside of my soul

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.800 align:middle line:90%
is just amazing.

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:56.650 align:middle line:84%
I walk around every day with
this bubbly mood and attitude,

00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:58.270 align:middle line:90%
and I'm smiling a lot more.

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:00.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm standing up straight.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:02.320 align:middle line:90%
I just feel absolutely amazing.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.390 align:middle line:84%
During my session, one of
the things that came up

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:07.990 align:middle line:84%
was I needed to have my own
space or my own peace of mind

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:09.590 align:middle line:84%
and just kind of
away from the family.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And I have actually been
seeking other households,

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:15.700 align:middle line:84%
and I have a couple
pretty good prospects

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.030 align:middle line:90%
in the works right now.

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:19.390 align:middle line:84%
So I'm pretty
excited about that.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:21.880 align:middle line:84%
I definitely had a
journey into my soul.

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.600 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Dr. Erica.

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.700 align:middle line:90%
This was life changing for me.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.360 align:middle line:84%
I had a bunch of questions
in my soul, answered them,

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:31.490 align:middle line:84%
and there is so much more
clarity and peace in my life.

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:32.840 align:middle line:90%
I just feel liberated.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:36.382 align:middle line:84%
I'm so excited for what is
about to happen in my life.

00:28:36.382 --> 00:28:38.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm just I can feel it, and
it's going to be awesome.
