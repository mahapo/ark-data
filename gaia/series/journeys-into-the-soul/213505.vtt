>> My name is Joanna Arkell.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.694 align:middle line:90%
I'm 66, and I live in Italy.

00:01:04.694 --> 00:01:08.220 align:middle line:90%

I suppose I consider
myself a teacher.

I've taught cooking.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.590 align:middle line:90%
I teach English.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.180 align:middle line:84%
I think I just teach
things that I love.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.240 align:middle line:84%
So I was living quite
happily in Australia.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.160 align:middle line:84%
I had two restaurants there
with a business partner.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.710 align:middle line:84%
We weren't getting on so
well, so I decided to sell up.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And this friend of mine
wanted to go to Italy.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.370 align:middle line:84%
She was passionate about
Italy, about the men, the food,

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.480 align:middle line:90%
the language, everything.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was to
travel all around Europe

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.350 align:middle line:84%
and then end up in Italy
and take a language course

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.840 align:middle line:90%
for three months, which we did.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And she was hoping to meet the,
you know, the love of her life,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.080 align:middle line:90%
some hot Italian lover.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.300 align:middle line:84%
Now it sort of all
happened to me.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.250 align:middle line:84%
I stayed here, learned
Italian, met my husband,

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.720 align:middle line:90%
and been here ever since.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.440 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, now
it's over 30 years.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.180 align:middle line:90%


00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.670 align:middle line:84%
I got sick when I was very
young with kidney disease.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And my mother also died
when I was very young.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, last year, I
had a tube put in my stomach

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.780 align:middle line:90%
to start peritoneal dialysis.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.730 align:middle line:90%
And so I've been doing that.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.570 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't easy getting
used to it initially,

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.215 align:middle line:84%
but I'm just
feeling much better.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.270 align:middle line:84%

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.230 align:middle line:90%
It's been very helpful.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.420 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm here
because the same time

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.350 align:middle line:84%
that I was having
this tube put into me

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.210 align:middle line:84%
for the peritoneal dialysis,
my friend, Dora, died.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And this has been
a friend of mine

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.040 align:middle line:84%
now for many years, a very,
very close friend that

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.450 align:middle line:84%
was like family for me because
after I separated and then

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.590 align:middle line:84%
divorced my husband, I sort of
felt as though I was kicked out

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.560 align:middle line:90%
of paradise.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.180 align:middle line:84%
His family had this
wine estate, and we were

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.890 align:middle line:90%
living on this wine estate.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.350 align:middle line:90%
And then the marriage breaks up.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And I have this friend,
Dora, who I meet.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.700 align:middle line:90%
And we just became a family--

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.680 align:middle line:84%
my son, her daughter,
me, Dora, many years

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.910 align:middle line:90%
of Christmases together.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, I'm in
hospital, and she's in hospital.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.410 align:middle line:90%
And she just suddenly dies.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.380 align:middle line:90%
And it's just--

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.260 align:middle line:84%
I still haven't come
to terms with it.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And I just feel that I need to
have a session with Dr. Axinn

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.960 align:middle line:90%
to just--

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.035 align:middle line:90%
I can't accept her death.

00:04:07.035 --> 00:04:09.750 align:middle line:90%


00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.930 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't say
things to her that I

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.290 align:middle line:90%
feel that I just wanted to say.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.500 align:middle line:90%
And it's just torn me apart.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's
pain there as well

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.940 align:middle line:84%
because I don't feel as though
I told her how much I really

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.160 align:middle line:90%
cared for her.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.570 align:middle line:84%

some help with understanding.

to see your life

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.490 align:middle line:10%
from an objective viewpoint.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.150 align:middle line:84%
So you're able to look at
your traumas, your situation,

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.910 align:middle line:84%
your problem and put
them in a perspective.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.240 align:middle line:84%
My original degree was in
psychology and philosophy.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And along the way,
I took degrees

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.030 align:middle line:84%

to her astrology class.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And I went to her class
not believing in astrology.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.670 align:middle line:84%
There was a person who led us
to past lives spontaneously.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And I had what is called the
cinematic experience-- visual,

deep, profound, life-changing.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.610 align:middle line:84%
But at that point,
I just sort of

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.960 align:middle line:84%
thought it was a very
creative experience,

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.242 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't trust how
easily people sort of did it.

I didn't realize how we
can travel in the mind.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.890 align:middle line:10%
I still kept-- on my way,
had a period working in film,

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:29.410 align:middle line:10%
did different things, worked
at a museum of modern art,

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.980 align:middle line:10%
and then ended up getting a
degree to teach at university,

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:38.680 align:middle line:10%
and ended up moving overseas to
a little tiny town in Italy that

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.870 align:middle line:10%
is a marble-carving area.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And at a certain
point, I thought,

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to keep
teaching university.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:45.800 align:middle line:90%
I want to help people.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And I became a
practitioner, and I

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.080 align:middle line:84%
began to see it was
much more effective

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.630 align:middle line:84%
and useful as a
therapeutic tool.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.070 align:middle line:90%
It is a powerful tool.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.540 align:middle line:90%
It's very sacred.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.910 align:middle line:84%
It requires huge trust, and
it is a massive responsibility

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.730 align:middle line:84%
to help someone connect
to their unconscious mind.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.150 align:middle line:84%
You need to be trained
for if anything comes up.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.390 align:middle line:84%
You need to be trained for
how to help someone, know

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.600 align:middle line:90%
how to integrate it.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.760 align:middle line:84%
It is a therapy that you want to
reinforce your clients' autonomy

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.030 align:middle line:90%
and independence.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's a tool
where you can even

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.735 align:middle line:84%
come back to that same story
and use it again and again.

00:07:21.735 --> 00:07:26.820 align:middle line:90%


00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.910 align:middle line:84%
When people come here,
something magical happens.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.530 align:middle line:84%
For me as a therapist, it's
the perfect place to work.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:36.280 align:middle line:84%
There's a saying here that the
marble is going to talk to you.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.460 align:middle line:84%
You're going to bring
out the sculpture that

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.410 align:middle line:90%
already exists in the stone.

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.840 align:middle line:84%
For the kind of work I'm
doing, it's the perfect place

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.770 align:middle line:84%
to be because there is this
defining the contours of who you

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.220 align:middle line:84%
are and how you exist in
this amazing thing that

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.830 align:middle line:84%
is our human bodies
to exist in the world,

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:56.400 align:middle line:84%
to understand the shape of who
the artwork of ourselves is.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.480 align:middle line:84%
In this work, what's amazing
is the sense of continuity

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.600 align:middle line:84%
because you can do a session
that can be life-changing,

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.820 align:middle line:84%
and then you may come
back and work on something

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.910 align:middle line:90%
completely different.

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And yet there are links
between one session to another,

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.220 align:middle line:90%
so you build a kind of base.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And so Joanna, who
I've worked with,

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:18.260 align:middle line:84%
has a particular issue that came
up that she wanted to work with.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:28.560 align:middle line:90%


00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.720 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.508 align:middle line:90%
>> So how are you feeling?

00:08:33.508 --> 00:08:36.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Pretty good overall.

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:40.150 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, as we've
spoken on the phone,

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:44.860 align:middle line:84%
I just felt that I needed
to come and see you again.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And enough time passed since
the death of my friend, Dora.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's just still a lot of
grief going on, which you know,

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.850 align:middle line:90%
obviously.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:03.990 align:middle line:84%
It was such an important
friendship for me.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.500 align:middle line:90%
It was a family.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>> It was--

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.330 align:middle line:84%
>> We created this
family together.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.710 align:middle line:84%
So it was-- it wasn't like
that my best friend type

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.250 align:middle line:90%
of friendship.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:18.590 align:middle line:84%
It was just-- it was more
like a family, you know?

All the problematics
of a family, you know?

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:22.860 align:middle line:90%

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes she would drive me
insane, crazy, and, you know.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Such an intimate
friend in that sense.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.540 align:middle line:90%
I've always wanted family.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:42.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And as you've spoken
to me about before,

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.880 align:middle line:84%
you had come to Italy
and created family.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And then we created this
sort of second family.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.160 align:middle line:90%
And then that's gone.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to be
a pattern, you know?

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Childhood, losing my
mother when I was young,

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:07.930 align:middle line:84%
and the breakup of the family,
and then my father remarrying.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:12.350 align:middle line:84%
So I was always searching
for this family.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>> A longing for the family.

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:20.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've not been ever
ambitious on the outside world,

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.100 align:middle line:84%
but I could say my ambition
is being in a family.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Ambition was, yeah.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>> To be important, have an
important role in the family.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you have an
important role in the family,

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.450 align:middle line:90%
what does that feel like?

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:35.810 align:middle line:90%
>> I've got purpose.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>> You've got a purpose?

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.260 align:middle line:90%
This is what I'm all about.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.950 align:middle line:90%
This is my life.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:42.920 align:middle line:90%
I've got this role.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:43.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Big mother or whatever,
cooking in the family.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:51.717 align:middle line:84%
>> Cooking in the family,
being in the family,

00:10:51.717 --> 00:10:52.675 align:middle line:90%
fighting in the family.

00:10:52.675 --> 00:10:53.655 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, whatever.

00:10:53.655 --> 00:10:54.455 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:10:54.455 --> 00:10:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, just being
present to the family.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Your family moved to
Australia when you were young.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.980 align:middle line:90%
>> When I was very young.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.290 align:middle line:90%
>> And then you came over here.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, when I was about 29.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.030 align:middle line:90%
I came over here.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>> How does family look to you?

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>> For someone who would like
to do Sunday lunch every Sunday.

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:18.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.650 align:middle line:84%
It looks like
Italian Sunday lunch.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, living alone, I
don't have this big family that

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:27.320 align:middle line:90%
I always dreamed of.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, obviously, there's
learning about the inner

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.970 align:middle line:90%
journey, the inner family.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So the inner journey,
the inner family?

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Maybe just needing to
connect more with that,

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:45.490 align:middle line:84%
like on a deep soul level that
I'm connected to it, you know,

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:50.725 align:middle line:84%
not that it's just me speaking
on this psychological level.

00:11:50.725 --> 00:11:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Mm, such as just your human
soul, personality speaking,

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:58.810 align:middle line:84%
but there's something deeper,
more profound with that linked

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:01.100 align:middle line:90%
to the inner, higher self.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:02.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Are there any other things
that are important or relevant?

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.330 align:middle line:90%
You know how pretalk goes.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:08.440 align:middle line:90%
We mention the things.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Then when we're in
session, whatever

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.870 align:middle line:84%
comes up your higher mind's
guided us towards, but just

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:14.080 align:middle line:90%
to have a list.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:14.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that's sort
of the crux of it.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:17.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And how are you feeling
in this second right now,

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.480 align:middle line:90%
in this moment?

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Curious.

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Curious?

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>> To know what's
going to happen.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:25.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:33.350 align:middle line:90%


00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>> What are you feeling
or sensing right now?

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:43.640 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a little wooden house,
like a children's house somehow.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Uh-huh.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:46.200 align:middle line:10%
>> It's isolated.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.690 align:middle line:10%
>> It's isolated?

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:49.550 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a bit dark.

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And how does that make you
feel to be in this isolated,

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:54.380 align:middle line:90%
a bit dark?

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:59.350 align:middle line:10%
>> It's sort of got that
atmosphere of like a fairy tale.

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:00.290 align:middle line:10%
And I don't know.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:03.010 align:middle line:10%
There's something a
bit ominous about it.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:03.810 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:07.070 align:middle line:10%
I just keep thinking something
like Hansel and Gretel.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:08.990 align:middle line:84%
In the very beginning,
it was fine.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:13.220 align:middle line:84%
But then it just, this
atmosphere took over,

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.500 align:middle line:84%
and I was-- sort of started
absorbing the atmosphere.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- there's something
ominous, something not OK here.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:25.380 align:middle line:10%
It's not quite what I--

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:29.430 align:middle line:10%
I'd hoped for or
expected or something.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:31.720 align:middle line:10%
>> What did you expect?

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Something brighter,
more sunshine, more happy.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:36.130 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.840 align:middle line:84%
So here, she's
expressing expectation.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.170 align:middle line:84%
No matter how much we
try, even as therapists,

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.730 align:middle line:84%
we can't get away
from expectations.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.310 align:middle line:84%
So for me, that she
was disappointed

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:47.860 align:middle line:84%
was brilliant because it
meant we could work with it.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.300 align:middle line:10%
>> There's something
about abandonment there,

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.470 align:middle line:10%
and I feel abandoned.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:57.010 align:middle line:10%
It's not the sunshine
that I wanted.

00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So now that you know
this, what happens now?

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Find people or
go somewhere else.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:07.580 align:middle line:84%
So you have to find people
or go somewhere else?

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:09.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And what do you do now to go
somewhere else or find people?

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:14.872 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm going to the beach.

00:14:14.872 --> 00:14:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>> You're going to the beach?

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:16.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:17.878 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:14:17.878 --> 00:14:19.420 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't comfortable
where she was,

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.337 align:middle line:84%
so I realized she needed
to go somewhere else.

00:14:21.337 --> 00:14:23.350 align:middle line:84%
So I offered different
possibilities

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:24.470 align:middle line:90%
of what she could do.

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So then she asks me if I
wanted to go somewhere else.

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:29.680 align:middle line:90%
And I shoom out like a shot.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>> How does it feel to
arrive to the beach?

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:33.140 align:middle line:10%
>> It's good.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.500 align:middle line:10%
I just remember a
photo of my mother

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.040 align:middle line:10%
and me sitting on the beach.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.730 align:middle line:10%
I don't have any memory of it.

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:47.190 align:middle line:10%
I just have a photo, but I'm
really feeling loved by her.

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:49.560 align:middle line:10%
You know it makes me very happy.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.800 align:middle line:10%
So I think she was
really happy then too.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.680 align:middle line:84%
My mother died when I was
12, and I don't really

00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:01.990 align:middle line:84%
have memories of her hugging me
and really feeling loved by her.

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:06.150 align:middle line:84%
It was just like this period
before we went to Australia.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:09.750 align:middle line:10%
And I felt as though it
was all sort of light.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:13.140 align:middle line:10%
You know I feel as though
they were sort of light years

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:16.690 align:middle line:10%
before the darkness came.

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:22.650 align:middle line:10%
I didn't have a burden
somehow to feel weighed down.

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:24.220 align:middle line:10%
>> You didn't feel weighed down?

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.595 align:middle line:10%
You didn't have a burden?

00:15:25.595 --> 00:15:30.030 align:middle line:10%
>> All this was in England
and before we immigrated

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:32.000 align:middle line:10%
to Australia.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000 align:middle line:10%
I remember it was a big
secret, and my father

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.790 align:middle line:10%
told me this secret.

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:41.315 align:middle line:10%
And I was only
sort of about four.

00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:43.160 align:middle line:10%
>> It was a big secret?

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.470 align:middle line:10%
>> That we were going to
go to live in Australia,

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:47.116 align:middle line:10%
but I couldn't tell anybody.

00:15:47.116 --> 00:15:48.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Uh-huh.

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>> My father tells
me, this is a secret.

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:52.670 align:middle line:84%
You mustn't tell
anyone, but we're

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:54.970 align:middle line:84%
going to go and
emigrate to Australia.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:16:01.970 align:middle line:84%
What I took on then is
his fear, his doubts.

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:04.760 align:middle line:84%
God, if he's scared
about this big journey

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:08.150 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to
take, what about me?

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:09.710 align:middle line:10%
And then we went to Australia.

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:12.060 align:middle line:10%
And then we didn't
have any family.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:12.920 align:middle line:10%
Nobody.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.720 align:middle line:10%
Didn't know anybody.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.260 align:middle line:10%
And I think it was that
first sort of setting up

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:22.160 align:middle line:10%
that pattern for
me of being cut off

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.630 align:middle line:10%
from roots and
family and my mother

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:31.040 align:middle line:10%
then being sick in
Australia and the change.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.855 align:middle line:10%
I think it sort of then
became the dark years

00:16:33.855 --> 00:16:37.340 align:middle line:10%
you know with the family.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:46.100 align:middle line:10%
I can't remember her sort of
ever kissing me or affection.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.100 align:middle line:10%
You know I've always sort of
thought of it more as my mother

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.490 align:middle line:10%
died, but it was really that--

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Moving to Australia
and keeping the secret,

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.040 align:middle line:10%
it being a secret even?

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:56.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:57.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:59.940 align:middle line:10%
>> I think 'cause I
was just very young,

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:05.560 align:middle line:10%
I haven't ever felt the
emotional impact of that on me.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.619 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:08.990 align:middle line:84%
She steps into this
revelation about her father

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:10.819 align:middle line:84%
where she suddenly
understands it's not

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:12.530 align:middle line:84%
just that she was
keeping a secret

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:17.119 align:middle line:84%
but that she was picking up on
all of his own emotional fauna

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:18.270 align:middle line:90%
and his fears.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.599 align:middle line:84%
And this for her was very
overwhelming and frightening,

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:22.849 align:middle line:84%
which then led to her
basic theme, which

00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:26.300 align:middle line:84%
is the theme of losing the
family, of grief, of not having

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.620 align:middle line:84%
what she needs, of
being disappointed.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:31.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Just seems like
too much emotion.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.280 align:middle line:10%
>> There's too much emotion?

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:38.070 align:middle line:10%
>> And what happens when
there's too much emotion?

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.290 align:middle line:10%
>> I have to tune out.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:42.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Uh-huh.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:45.630 align:middle line:84%
You have to tune out when
there's too much emotion.

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And when you tune
out, where do you go?

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.270 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:50.590 align:middle line:10%
>> I sleep.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>> You sleep?

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:53.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And when you sleep,
what happens?

00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:00.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Then I can go and
dream and go anywhere.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:03.050 align:middle line:84%
>> That's one of her themes,
is that she is very influenced

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:06.530 align:middle line:84%
by other people's emotions,
and it can be overwhelming.

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:08.840 align:middle line:84%
She uses sleep to
regenerate her body.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.020 align:middle line:84%
She uses sleep to
become more clear.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:14.660 align:middle line:90%
And she uses it also to heal.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:18.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Feels just like
going to the stars,

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:25.010 align:middle line:10%
just going out into nothingness.

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:26.405 align:middle line:10%
Space.

00:18:26.405 --> 00:18:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're added to
the stars and to space.

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.641 align:middle line:10%
Ultimate freedom.

00:18:33.641 --> 00:18:38.630 align:middle line:84%
It's like this limitlessness,
this feeling of one

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:43.550 align:middle line:84%
with whatever is but you
haven't got all of this drama.

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:44.660 align:middle line:90%
It's just free.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.700 align:middle line:90%
It's flying free.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.020 align:middle line:10%
It's dissolving now.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:53.720 align:middle line:10%
I just feel as though I'm
coming back into sleep.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.550 align:middle line:10%
>> And how does that feel?

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:58.350 align:middle line:10%
>> In my body now, not in this--

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:00.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, in the space.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.710 align:middle line:10%
>> In that space of
being with no body.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Would it be useful to
go further back in time?

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Or is there anywhere else
you need to go first?

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:12.990 align:middle line:90%
What's happening now?

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:15.540 align:middle line:10%
>> No, I was just
thinking of Dora again,

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.590 align:middle line:10%
just something about--

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:22.770 align:middle line:10%
you know, when you say, is there
anything else, any other place

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:26.120 align:middle line:10%
you need to go, I just
immediately thought,

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.010 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:27.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Uh-huh.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:28.610 align:middle line:10%
And so--

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:29.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Just Dora.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:30.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:33.300 align:middle line:84%
So if you need to go to Dora,
let's see what happens, OK?

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:38.090 align:middle line:10%
I'm sorry if I've
caused her any pain.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:41.042 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:19:41.042 --> 00:19:47.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Or if any of my
actions have hurt her or--

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:49.810 align:middle line:10%
it just weighs on me that--

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:52.621 align:middle line:10%
I haven't wanted
to hurt you or--

00:19:52.621 --> 00:19:54.345 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:19:54.345 --> 00:19:59.150 align:middle line:10%
>> And I tried so
hard, I tried so hard.

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, you tried so hard.

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:03.896 align:middle line:90%
>> [SNIFFLES]

00:20:03.896 --> 00:20:06.890 align:middle line:90%


00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:09.650 align:middle line:84%
I just have felt
this remorse that we

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:13.500 align:middle line:84%
couldn't clear up a couple of
misunderstandings that we had.

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And I felt that there was a
little bit of lack of trust

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:19.200 align:middle line:90%
and that we hadn't gone into it.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.353 align:middle line:84%
And then she just very
suddenly, abruptly dies.

00:20:22.353 --> 00:20:25.770 align:middle line:90%


00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:27.990 align:middle line:10%
I feel she's here.

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:30.444 align:middle line:10%
>> You feel she's there?

00:20:30.444 --> 00:20:34.030 align:middle line:10%
>> She's telling me it's OK.

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:38.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Instead of me saving her,
instead of thinking of solutions

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:middle line:84%
to make her feel better,
Dora came on her own.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that was
extremely important

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.110 align:middle line:84%
because it wasn't
something contrived.

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:46.840 align:middle line:90%
It was natural.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.410 align:middle line:90%
Take all the time you need.

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:51.260 align:middle line:90%


00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.846 align:middle line:10%
>> She said it's all OK.

00:20:53.846 --> 00:20:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:57.640 align:middle line:90%
So she's speaking with you?

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:03.490 align:middle line:90%


00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>> The OK-ness was that I could
just see her totally OK and big

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:15.730 align:middle line:84%
smile and happy and certainly
not holding on to something like

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:17.020 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.590 align:middle line:10%
No, I felt my heart warm.

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:22.130 align:middle line:90%
>> You felt your heart warm?

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:25.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:27.830 align:middle line:10%
No, I'm not--
she's not here now.

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:30.130 align:middle line:10%
I don't feel that she's--

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:34.540 align:middle line:10%
but when she was here, I
felt it go to my heart.

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.805 align:middle line:10%
And she told me she loved me.

00:21:36.805 --> 00:21:39.090 align:middle line:10%
She never told me that before.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.750 align:middle line:10%
>> She never told you?

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:46.510 align:middle line:10%
>> I told her that I loved her,
but she'd never said it to me.

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>> She'd never said it to you?

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:52.300 align:middle line:90%
And now she has.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.010 align:middle line:90%
Dora says to her, I love you.

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:57.220 align:middle line:84%
Now you have to
remember, her mother

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:00.740 align:middle line:84%
never expressed
emotion and affection.

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.430 align:middle line:90%
And she speaks about this.

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:04.730 align:middle line:90%
Dora was her dear friend.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:06.380 align:middle line:90%
It was a brilliant friendship.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.600 align:middle line:84%
But she had said I
love you to Dora.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.400 align:middle line:90%
Dora never said I love you back.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.070 align:middle line:84%
We know that Dora
said it was OK.

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And that immediately shifted
something in her body.

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:17.530 align:middle line:84%
Her whole body, if
you really study it,

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:20.770 align:middle line:84%
relaxed because she's been
carrying this as a tension,

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:24.010 align:middle line:84%
because this has
been massive for her.

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Is there any place you need to
go now or anyone you need to see

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.950 align:middle line:90%
or something you need to do?

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:37.150 align:middle line:10%
I think maybe I need to connect
to some guide or something

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:38.600 align:middle line:10%
to help me.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:43.605 align:middle line:84%
And if you are connecting to
your guide, where do you go?

00:22:43.605 --> 00:22:46.990 align:middle line:90%


00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:49.630 align:middle line:10%
>> This woman has shown up.

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:51.160 align:middle line:10%
I don't know her.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>> This woman showing up,
and you don't know her?

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:55.767 align:middle line:84%
>> Why don't you ask
her why she's come?

00:22:55.767 --> 00:22:59.410 align:middle line:90%


00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.510 align:middle line:10%
>> She says I can call her Mama.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:03.540 align:middle line:10%
>> How does that feel
to call her Mama?

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:06.040 align:middle line:10%
>> She's very funny.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.650 align:middle line:10%
>> And how does it
feel to be with her?

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:10.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Very nice.

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>> She deepens into this
connection of feeling this Mama

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:17.440 align:middle line:84%
figure, which we don't want to
romanticize the session before

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:21.040 align:middle line:84%
it's begun, but we've
already understood that Mama

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.540 align:middle line:84%
in childhood did not
give her all she needed.

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:26.960 align:middle line:84%
So as a result, here's Mama
right now in this moment.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Now we go for
a walk together.

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And as you're
walking together,

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.350 align:middle line:90%
what is the terrain like?

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:36.340 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a forest.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:39.100 align:middle line:10%
Feels very secure with her.

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:42.320 align:middle line:10%
It's quite dark.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>> But you feel very secure?

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:44.530 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:45.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>> In the beginning,
the session starts off,

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:48.590 align:middle line:90%
and she's not as deep.

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And she goes into this Hansel
and Gretel creepy kind of place

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.490 align:middle line:90%
and chooses to go away.

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Mama's taking her
through the same terrain,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.330 align:middle line:84%
and she's feeling it's creepy
and scary, only it's OK.

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And are you walking alongside
Mama or behind or in front?

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:07.680 align:middle line:10%
>> No, I stopped to talk.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.730 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, she's telling me
to take care of myself,

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:12.780 align:middle line:10%
first and foremost.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Wondering if you might
ask her about your hands.

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I've got this arthritis that
just in the past few months,

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:22.410 align:middle line:84%
this winter, it seemed
to have got worse.

You know, it was just
one of the things

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:28.450 align:middle line:84%
that we had talked about
that possibly could come up.

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:33.690 align:middle line:10%
There's something about an
overidentification with doing.

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:39.390 align:middle line:10%
I'm always using my hands to
do something, do it for others

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:40.740 align:middle line:10%
or, you know--

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:45.000 align:middle line:10%

Something about
the arthritis being

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:07.800 align:middle line:10%
about resentment, about the
doing because sometimes you

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.790 align:middle line:10%
don't want to do or
I don't want to do,

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:16.990 align:middle line:10%
but I feel as though I
have to because then I

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:20.890 align:middle line:10%
feel useful and needed.

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:24.100 align:middle line:10%
And that's also with
the family, 'cause then

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:29.820 align:middle line:10%
I feel a useful
member of the family.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.700 align:middle line:10%
You know that my life
has purpose and meaning

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:36.210 align:middle line:10%
and makes me feel good.

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:42.120 align:middle line:10%
You know that like the
trade-off for me is recognition.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:46.420 align:middle line:84%
The payback is that
they recognize me.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you're wonderful.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:49.750 align:middle line:90%
You're doing whatever.

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And then if they
don't, I get resentful.

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Arthritis is the resentment
and the anger around the doing.

I'm not appreciated.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:02.970 align:middle line:84%

I feel I'm trying

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:05.970 align:middle line:84%
to please people and help
people and serve people

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:07.180 align:middle line:90%
because I want to belong.

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:10.330 align:middle line:84%
I want to feel my right
to be allowed to be here.

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:14.160 align:middle line:84%
In her mind, she's
working hard to be loved.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:19.120 align:middle line:10%
>> She's saying that I need
to recognize those qualities.

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.570 align:middle line:10%
You don't need it
from the outside.

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:25.150 align:middle line:84%
If I validate
myself, then I'm not

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:30.010 align:middle line:84%

me by doing something for them.

archetypal mother

type mother.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.410 align:middle line:90%

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:58.410 align:middle line:10%
You know, she feels like
a part of me, a part of me

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:01.610 align:middle line:10%
that I can call on to mother me.

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:04.594 align:middle line:10%


00:27:04.594 --> 00:27:07.340 align:middle line:10%
It's sort of like
she was just slipping

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:14.040 align:middle line:10%
inside of a little part of me
or something, this type of--

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.450 align:middle line:10%
like just connecting with that--

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:18.610 align:middle line:10%

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:26.900 align:middle line:84%
I could just feel it sort of
entering into my head here.

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Then it sort of just
became, yeah, she's there.

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:31.880 align:middle line:90%
I can mother myself.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:36.020 align:middle line:84%
This is like an
archetype that's in me.

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:40.210 align:middle line:10%
It's just a joy of being
'cause there's not--

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:43.620 align:middle line:10%
yeah, there's not the
identification with mother.

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:49.140 align:middle line:10%
I think that's the lesson
for me, being and expressing

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:53.670 align:middle line:10%
your love, really,
that's all she's doing.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:58.800 align:middle line:10%
You know that I'm putting onto
her this sort of big mother

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:02.520 align:middle line:10%
that she appears to me,
but it's not really--

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:06.280 align:middle line:10%
the energy is really
just living love.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And so the lesson
for you is it's not

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.500 align:middle line:90%
the identifying with the role.

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:12.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the essence of being.

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:17.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:21.610 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like I can say
I've been on a mother journey

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:29.170 align:middle line:84%
all my life, all trying to
make up for some sort of a loss

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:32.500 align:middle line:84%
and then fitting into this
role of being a mother

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:36.430 align:middle line:90%

also about coming

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.010 align:middle line:84%
to the massive healing
that goes all the way back

through an entire lifetime.

to heal or come to a peace

or understand more
about this loss,

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:57.880 align:middle line:84%
it touched her
entire life where she

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.700 align:middle line:84%
could open the door to see
one of the original sources.

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.031 align:middle line:90%
So how are you doing?

00:29:03.031 --> 00:29:05.620 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

into your body.

I think this work makes
the world a better place.

And the whole point
is that we should all

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:15.160 align:middle line:84%
be allies in supporting
each other to do this, which

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:19.040 align:middle line:84%
is why, as therapist and client,
it's great because this is all

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.250 align:middle line:90%
coming from the client.
