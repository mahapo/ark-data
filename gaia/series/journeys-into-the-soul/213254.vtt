My name is Diyali.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm 55 years old.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.020 align:middle line:84%
I live in Dubai, and I
am a professional artist

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.030 align:middle line:90%
and a fashion designer.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.625 align:middle line:90%


00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:22.980 align:middle line:84%
I was born and
brought up in India.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.860 align:middle line:84%
I've had a very happy,
fulfilled childhood.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.710 align:middle line:84%
I remember it full of laughter
and happiness and love.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.800 align:middle line:84%
We had a lot of fun,
a lot of adventures,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.490 align:middle line:90%
and I was always creative.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.240 align:middle line:84%
I was always building things
out of whatever I could find,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.720 align:middle line:84%
whether it was tires or
wire or art of any sort,

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.190 align:middle line:84%
a painting on walls and doors
and windows and everything,

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.260 align:middle line:84%
much to the annoyance
of my mother.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.190 align:middle line:90%
I found creativity everywhere.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.880 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I think I've
found myself even today.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.280 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.600 align:middle line:84%
In 2004, I got a job
offered to me here in Dubai

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.360 align:middle line:90%
to run a fashion store.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.139 align:middle line:84%
Though that job took about
six months for me to quit,

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:09.610 align:middle line:90%
I started on my own.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And I teach fashion, and I teach
abstract art and mixed media

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.510 align:middle line:84%
at the Dubai
International Art Centre.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.210 align:middle line:90%
It's a community art center.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.960 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the largest and
prestigious art community

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.290 align:middle line:90%
centers here in Dubai.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.130 align:middle line:84%
I've been the chairperson for
that place for the past seven

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.240 align:middle line:90%
years now.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, that's how
I ended up in Dubai,

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.210 align:middle line:84%
and now it's been
nearly 20 years.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.750 align:middle line:84%
In my spiritual quest, I was
looking for a lot of answers,

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.150 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, I had a
lot of questions which was

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.320 align:middle line:90%
difficult to find answers to.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.730 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.180 align:middle line:90%
What is the purpose of my life?

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And as a child,
when one should be

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.330 align:middle line:84%
doing all of the naughty
stuff and not really bothering

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.230 align:middle line:90%
about these things.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.230 align:middle line:84%
These were the burning
questions in my life,

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.900 align:middle line:84%
and I had to keep
asking everyone.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Religion, unfortunately,
didn't give me these answers.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And I turned to Buddhism and
found a lot of my answers

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.920 align:middle line:84%
in there, and I found a lot
of stillness in my heart

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.980 align:middle line:90%
from there.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Then I happened to
meet Indrani Sinha.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.850 align:middle line:84%
Wonderfully, I got to know that
she does life-between-lives

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.130 align:middle line:84%
hypnotherapy, and I thought that
maybe that would kind of bring

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.180 align:middle line:84%
me, finally, to what I
was really searching for.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.540 align:middle line:90%
I had my first session with her.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.540 align:middle line:90%
I had a breakthrough.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's been really
wonderful, because I always

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.250 align:middle line:84%
find that when I do
these sessions with her,

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.438 align:middle line:84%
I reach somewhere where
you couldn't reach

00:03:37.438 --> 00:03:39.230 align:middle line:84%
in your conscious mind,
and I couldn't even

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.450 align:middle line:90%
hope to reach it there.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Because she's just a wonderful,
deeply spiritual person

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.880 align:middle line:84%
who gently takes you there
without you really forcing

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.210 align:middle line:90%
yourself doing all of that.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.970 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's where
our connection is, really.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.540 align:middle line:84%
Today, I'm seeking
another session with her.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.500 align:middle line:90%
I lost my father in 2017.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.100 align:middle line:84%
I was very close to him,
and we were very bonded.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't see him, would
my father not be happy about it

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.850 align:middle line:90%
with me?

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.880 align:middle line:90%
Are we really connected?

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Those were the questions, and I
really want to reach out today

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.370 align:middle line:84%
and possibly hope to find
those answers from him.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:27.272 align:middle line:90%

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.300 align:middle line:10%
Life-between-lives
hypnotherapy is

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:14.210 align:middle line:10%
about enabling an individual to
connect to the soul's journey

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.230 align:middle line:10%
and going into that space
between two lifetimes.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a
beautiful experience

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.510 align:middle line:84%
because you tap
into understanding

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.280 align:middle line:84%
what you're going
to be doing here,

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.050 align:middle line:84%
what your purpose
is, why are you here?

What are all those other
people in your life?

Therefore, you can
live your life way,

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.020 align:middle line:84%
way better because
you've connected

to your basic
potential as a soul.

and I lived there till
2006 when I moved to Dubai.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.830 align:middle line:84%
My search for myself,
who am I, this question

that we're a lot of times
asking ourselves actually

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.910 align:middle line:84%
kicked in the year
when I was turning 15,

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.370 align:middle line:84%
and I used to keep
on questioning about,

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.160 align:middle line:90%
so where does the soul go?

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.170 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.250 align:middle line:84%
I used to ask so many questions
to my parents which they weren't

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.590 align:middle line:84%
always equipped to answer, so
I would turn to the teachers.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And throughout my
college life, I

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.960 align:middle line:84%
remember sitting in the
cafe in a university campus

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.760 align:middle line:84%
with a mug of coffee
and the Bhagavad Gita.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.330 align:middle line:84%
I used think, maybe I'll
find all my answers there.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Years later, the next chapter
of life began in Dubai.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.190 align:middle line:84%
I learned clinical
hypnotherapy in this land.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.260 align:middle line:84%
I learned transpersonal
regression therapy.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.090 align:middle line:90%
I trained in theater healing.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.200 align:middle line:84%
I dabbled with quite
a few modalities

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.150 align:middle line:90%
which were all interconnected.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.600 align:middle line:84%
But what again and
again drew me was

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.480 align:middle line:84%
the connection between
the mind and the body

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.230 align:middle line:84%
and thoroughly enjoyed
the journey of regression,

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.950 align:middle line:84%
whether it is age regression,
you in this lifetime,

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.610 align:middle line:84%
going right back to the time
you were in your mom's womb,

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.930 align:middle line:84%
and then, go a little further
back, the other lifetimes,

soul has gone through.

instant connection.

And the souls who come to me,
I truly believe they seek me.

I believe there is some
kind of resonance somewhere,

I'm so grateful I
went through them

Because of who I am,

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.242 align:middle line:10%
that I want to remember
him the way I saw him

00:09:25.242 --> 00:09:26.700 align:middle line:10%
and the way I
remembered him, and I

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.460 align:middle line:10%
didn't want to remember him like
a lifeless body, so to speak.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.770 align:middle line:10%
And somehow that's bothered me
and I think filled me with guilt

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:36.240 align:middle line:10%
to a large extent.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:41.430 align:middle line:84%
Was he unhappy with
me not seeing him?

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.950 align:middle line:10%
So that was a question
that has bothered me

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:45.905 align:middle line:10%
and still bothers me.

00:09:45.905 --> 00:09:47.030 align:middle line:90%
That's what brings me here.

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping that
you will help me.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.960 align:middle line:10%
>> If you remember, in
your last few sessions,

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.540 align:middle line:10%
which were done
after his passing,

00:09:55.540 --> 00:10:00.460 align:middle line:10%
this is one topic you avoided,
and I want to know if there is

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:04.910 align:middle line:10%
anything that triggered you to
wanting to address this today.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:11.740 align:middle line:84%
So, in fact, I think last year
I went for a 10-day Vipassana

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:16.090 align:middle line:84%
course, which, as you know, is
this intense meditation course

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:20.470 align:middle line:84%
where one has to be
silent for 10 days.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:24.070 align:middle line:10%
And it forces you to go
inside and into places

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.590 align:middle line:10%
inside of oneself
where you don't

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.670 align:middle line:10%
allow the conscious mind to go.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is
what triggered me to ask

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:34.280 align:middle line:90%
these questions of myself.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And I stopped myself
going there because I

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:40.300 align:middle line:90%
don't want to feel vulnerable.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.180 align:middle line:10%
And I think that is one
of the main issues which

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:49.480 align:middle line:10%
stops me from maybe grieving
or mourning or really deeply

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.770 align:middle line:10%
letting out my emotions,
because I don't want to look

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:56.530 align:middle line:10%
or seem vulnerable.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>> What's the first word that
comes to you when you think

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:01.720 align:middle line:90%
of the word "vulnerable"?

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Weak.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:07.240 align:middle line:90%
Not being able to handle things.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.670 align:middle line:10%
I've been the elder one.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.860 align:middle line:90%
I have to look after people.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.760 align:middle line:84%
I have to be the one
who's guiding people,

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.450 align:middle line:84%
and I have to be the
one in the forefront.

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:23.350 align:middle line:10%
So how can I be someone
who kind of is in danger

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.250 align:middle line:10%
of falling or failing?

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's quite a lot that we
can actually look to explore

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:29.990 align:middle line:90%
in your journey today.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know what the
journey will open up for you.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:33.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it's kind of
percolated into your adult space

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.140 align:middle line:84%
where you're the giver,
you're the nurturer,

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:41.060 align:middle line:84%
you're the nourisher, and
you're also the one in control.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think that corroborates
and validates who I am

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.770 align:middle line:90%
constantly,

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:48.695 align:middle line:10%
>> And also, it strengthens
this feeling that, yes,

00:11:48.695 --> 00:11:50.783 align:middle line:10%
you cannot fail, yes,
you cannot cry, yes,

00:11:50.783 --> 00:11:53.200 align:middle line:10%
you cannot be weak because
other people are looking at you

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.970 align:middle line:10%
for support.

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.350 align:middle line:10%
And how can they
lose their support?

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.170 align:middle line:10%
I think that's where
I'm coming from.

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:00.190 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And today we are going to
explore that I can still allow

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.910 align:middle line:84%
myself to do all of this and
still be that strong Diyali.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:07.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Support.

00:12:07.925 --> 00:12:08.725 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:08.725 --> 00:12:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And that is my intent
for you, Diyali,

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:16.210 align:middle line:84%
that you possibly not be
so critical of yourself.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:17.064 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:17.064 --> 00:12:25.960 align:middle line:90%


00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And once you come
to November 2017,

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:34.170 align:middle line:84%
just nod your head
and let me know.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:38.860 align:middle line:90%
What is happening there?

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:42.370 align:middle line:10%
>> I get a phone call.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:47.230 align:middle line:10%
That's Ma to tell me about
Baba that they rushed him

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:51.520 align:middle line:10%
to the hospital, and she
doesn't know what's happening.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:55.400 align:middle line:84%
November 17 was when
I lost my father.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I traveled back to
India to be with my mother,

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.260 align:middle line:90%
and I was all strong throughout.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.890 align:middle line:84%
I have not been able
to grieve my father.

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And, again, intellectually,
I do understand

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.170 align:middle line:90%
that I must do that grieving.

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Allow that Diya, the 2017
Diya, to step out and face you.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:16.900 align:middle line:90%
See what she has to say.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.190 align:middle line:90%
Listen to her.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Going back and talking to
that inner child or that

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Diyali, that subpersonality,
was important.

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Once she and the adult
could face each other,

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:27.790 align:middle line:90%
she's no longer in the shadow.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:31.652 align:middle line:10%
Then she's enabling the
rest of the session.

00:13:31.652 --> 00:13:33.685 align:middle line:10%
>> Should've had more time.

00:13:33.685 --> 00:13:36.080 align:middle line:10%
>> More time.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.110 align:middle line:10%
>> I should've held him more.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:44.060 align:middle line:10%
I wish I'd been a child
a little bit more.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.760 align:middle line:10%
>> What else is she saying?

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.805 align:middle line:10%
>> To allow myself to be loved.

00:13:48.805 --> 00:13:51.860 align:middle line:90%


00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:55.270 align:middle line:10%
I must show it.

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:57.220 align:middle line:10%
It's OK to feel.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.660 align:middle line:90%
>> It's OK to feel.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:04.540 align:middle line:90%
>> It's OK to let go.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:11.290 align:middle line:10%
It's OK to cry, and it's normal

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:13.690 align:middle line:10%
This is the narrative
I've given myself.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.690 align:middle line:84%
I have to be the strong
one because if I break,

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.920 align:middle line:84%
then they will have
no one to look up to.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.220 align:middle line:90%
And I am the one.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:22.050 align:middle line:10%
She cannot cry.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:25.656 align:middle line:90%


00:14:25.656 --> 00:14:29.050 align:middle line:10%
I have to be strong.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:30.140 align:middle line:10%
You cannot break.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:34.250 align:middle line:90%


00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:35.156 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:14:35.156 --> 00:14:38.630 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:39.710 align:middle line:90%
I cannot break because?

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:42.230 align:middle line:90%


00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.055 align:middle line:10%
>> Because I have to be
strong for other people.

00:14:45.055 --> 00:14:47.960 align:middle line:90%


00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.325 align:middle line:90%
>> For who?

00:14:50.325 --> 00:14:52.400 align:middle line:10%
>> For my mother.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.215 align:middle line:10%
>> For my mother.

00:14:53.215 --> 00:14:54.846 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:14:54.846 --> 00:14:55.990 align:middle line:10%
>> For my brother.

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:59.240 align:middle line:90%


00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:05.275 align:middle line:10%
Because if they see me
break, they cannot break.

00:15:05.275 --> 00:15:08.230 align:middle line:90%


00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So here you have
the 2017 inner child

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:16.900 align:middle line:84%
or the subpersonality of Diyali
telling the adult that it's OK.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.190 align:middle line:90%
It's OK for us to grieve.

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:19.460 align:middle line:90%
It's OK for us to cry.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, the very
controlling part of her

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.890 align:middle line:90%
says, no.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.010 align:middle line:84%
So I'm already
seeing at that moment

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:29.570 align:middle line:84%
that there is another
aspect popping up.

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:31.700 align:middle line:84%
One is wanting,
the other seeking.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.410 align:middle line:90%
But there is this third element.

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:35.500 align:middle line:90%
We have to find out who it is.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:39.110 align:middle line:84%
So when was it when
you first thought,

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:45.055 align:middle line:84%
I have to be strong
for Ma and Toi?

00:15:45.055 --> 00:15:47.550 align:middle line:10%
>> I am in his workshop.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:49.088 align:middle line:90%
>> In his workshop.

00:15:49.088 --> 00:15:51.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>> How old are you?

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:54.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Six years old.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Six years old.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.430 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a Bee Gees poster.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.655 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:16:01.655 --> 00:16:05.220 align:middle line:10%
>> And it's his workplace.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.000 align:middle line:10%
I can see machinery.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.730 align:middle line:10%
That's where he used to work.

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:13.100 align:middle line:84%
He wouldn't allow
me inside that room

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.970 align:middle line:84%
because that was his
workplace, and there

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:17.430 align:middle line:84%
are a lot of dangerous
machines and stuff like that.

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And he was this big fan
of Bee Gees at that time.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:24.350 align:middle line:84%
So there were two big
posters, one of Bruce Lee.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.480 align:middle line:84%
That day, I remember
very clearly

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:31.160 align:middle line:84%
when I had got into some
scrap with some people.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And I was crying, and he
dragged me to that room.

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:37.090 align:middle line:10%
And I'm crying because
somebody's hit me.

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.090 align:middle line:10%
>> He tells me, you
have to be strong,

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:44.060 align:middle line:10%
and you always
have to be strong.

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:48.320 align:middle line:10%
You cannot let other
people beat you up.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.600 align:middle line:10%
And you can never cry.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:55.070 align:middle line:10%
You shouldn't cry
like weak girls.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:58.820 align:middle line:10%
You are not weak.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:02.510 align:middle line:10%
And after that, I never cried.

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:06.710 align:middle line:10%
I want him to be proud of me.

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:10.750 align:middle line:10%
I wanted him to just
see me as strong.

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:12.819 align:middle line:10%
And I was.

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:18.819 align:middle line:10%
When other people cried and I
didn't cry, he was proud of me.

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>> What the father
does is out of love,

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.750 align:middle line:84%
not realizing has passed
on a very limiting,

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:28.230 align:middle line:90%
controlling belief to the child.

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:31.640 align:middle line:84%
The child is not at
the age to understand,

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.990 align:middle line:90%
is this good for me or not?

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:36.190 align:middle line:84%
So the whole thing
goes in, sits there,

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:38.080 align:middle line:90%
and becomes part of her rule.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, every time she's
going through an experience

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:46.450 align:middle line:84%
and that rule gets triggered,
she's trained to say,

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:48.070 align:middle line:90%
oh, no, I have to be stoic.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:49.510 align:middle line:90%
I have to be strong.

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:50.715 align:middle line:90%
Go back even further.

00:17:50.715 --> 00:17:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>> You're going to a
very, very young age.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:59.500 align:middle line:10%
Tell me a significant moment.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.150 align:middle line:10%
>> My mother's in hospital.

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:03.140 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.850 align:middle line:10%
How old are you?

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:07.160 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm just born.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Just born.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.810 align:middle line:84%
The moment we said go to
another significant moment

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:13.760 align:middle line:84%
as you're going back
in time, she quickly

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.890 align:middle line:84%
went at the moment
right after her birth.

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.700 align:middle line:10%
>> And I'm so confused.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Why are you confused?

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:24.350 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't where I am.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:28.430 align:middle line:10%
But I know my father.

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:31.370 align:middle line:10%
He's confused also.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:34.010 align:middle line:10%
He's confused because
he can't believe

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:37.830 align:middle line:10%
this has happened to him.

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.482 align:middle line:10%
>> And how do you
feel in his arm?

00:18:40.482 --> 00:18:44.240 align:middle line:10%
>> I feel I've arrived.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.331 align:middle line:10%
So much to do.

00:18:47.331 --> 00:18:55.220 align:middle line:10%
But I feel like I have
to protect my father.

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.716 align:middle line:10%
It's strange.

00:18:57.716 --> 00:19:04.510 align:middle line:10%
I have to make sure he's
happy, that he's safe.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:05.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you see him,
you're feeling all this, is it?

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.473 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:19:10.473 --> 00:19:11.473 align:middle line:10%
That's why I'm confused.

00:19:11.473 --> 00:19:14.420 align:middle line:10%


00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:18.830 align:middle line:10%
I should be holding him,
but he's holding me.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:23.550 align:middle line:10%
>> "I should be holding
him, but he's holding me."

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, because I'm so small.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Red flag for
me, the therapist.

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:33.140 align:middle line:84%
That means there's
something sitting here which

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:37.870 align:middle line:84%
feels like something unfinished
in some other incarnation

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:39.800 align:middle line:84%
these two souls would
have gone through.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:43.100 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of taking their
accounts into this lifetime

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:47.060 align:middle line:84%
to match and clear
the account balance.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Breathe and go back
even further, dear.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:54.030 align:middle line:10%
Go back.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:57.470 align:middle line:10%
You're moving back.

00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:00.190 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm a young girl.

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:01.780 align:middle line:10%
>> How young?

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:03.730 align:middle line:10%
>> 18, maybe

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:04.960 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Wearing something white.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>> White.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.430 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:12.130 align:middle line:90%
Look at your feet.

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:13.160 align:middle line:90%
Are you barefoot?

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.770 align:middle line:90%
Do you have shoes, sandals?

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:15.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Bare feet.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Bare feet.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.110 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm on the grass somewhere.

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Grass somewhere.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.550 align:middle line:90%
What's your complexion like?

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:26.191 align:middle line:10%
>> White.

00:20:26.191 --> 00:20:28.200 align:middle line:10%
I have light brown hair.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:33.200 align:middle line:84%
So the skin color, the feet,
her surroundings, these

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.950 align:middle line:84%
are ways to anchor in the
mind that you have moved

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:39.410 align:middle line:84%
into the deeper recesses
of the subconscious mind,

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:41.630 align:middle line:84%
and you've gone into the
primitive mind, where you

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:43.640 align:middle line:90%
have all your past life files.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.220 align:middle line:10%
>> I can see a young boy.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.950 align:middle line:10%
He's next to me, and
I'm playing with him.

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:50.120 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.960 align:middle line:10%
>> He's my son.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.082 align:middle line:84%
Look very carefully
at his face, his eyes.

00:20:57.082 --> 00:20:59.540 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the things I
always do, is the moment you're

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:02.570 align:middle line:84%
meeting someone in another
lifetime, check the eyes,

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:05.400 align:middle line:84%
because there's usually
a soul recognition.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.450 align:middle line:10%
>> There's my dad.

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:11.322 align:middle line:10%
Of course, it's my dad.

00:21:11.322 --> 00:21:13.286 align:middle line:90%
[SOBBING]

00:21:13.286 --> 00:21:16.723 align:middle line:90%


00:21:16.723 --> 00:21:21.142 align:middle line:10%
And I love him so much.

00:21:21.142 --> 00:21:23.824 align:middle line:10%
And somehow I know I
have to protect him.

00:21:23.824 --> 00:21:26.162 align:middle line:10%
>> Protect him.

00:21:26.162 --> 00:21:30.620 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm the only one
who can protect him.

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:35.220 align:middle line:10%
And he's looking up at
me like he depends on me.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Depends on you.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.680 align:middle line:90%
OK, is she a single parent?

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Is this a child
born out of wedlock?

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
else the matter?

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Because she's not claiming
anyone else is there.

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:52.220 align:middle line:84%
Just move to the next
significant moment.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:57.890 align:middle line:84%
In that space, this 18-year-old
girl, what is your name?

00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Mary.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Mary.

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:02.960 align:middle line:10%
>> And I have to go.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.090 align:middle line:90%
>> You have to go.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:06.363 align:middle line:90%
Where?

00:22:06.363 --> 00:22:07.280 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know where.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.550 align:middle line:10%
But I have to go, and I
know I have to leave my son.

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>> To leave him behind.

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.790 align:middle line:90%
How is that making you feel?

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:18.830 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm so torn.

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:21.450 align:middle line:10%


00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:24.480 align:middle line:10%
I don't want to go.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:29.590 align:middle line:84%
Maybe had the child out of
wedlock or something like that.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:32.640 align:middle line:10%
These people were taking
me away from my son,

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.045 align:middle line:10%
and he was to be looked after.

00:22:36.045 --> 00:22:36.845 align:middle line:10%
I'm so sad.

00:22:36.845 --> 00:22:41.250 align:middle line:90%


00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:43.300 align:middle line:90%
>> You leave him and you go.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:46.050 align:middle line:10%
Then what happens?

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:48.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Then I tell him
I will come back.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:49.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.970 align:middle line:84%
So you told him
you will come back.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:56.290 align:middle line:10%
>> I will come back,
and I will protect him.

00:22:56.290 --> 00:23:00.802 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you come back, Mary?

00:23:00.802 --> 00:23:03.170 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:05.360 align:middle line:10%
>> What happened to you?

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.760 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm not there.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.655 align:middle line:10%
He's been told
his mother's died.

00:23:10.655 --> 00:23:13.600 align:middle line:90%


00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Pure helplessness,
powerlessness.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.290 align:middle line:84%
The fact that she had promised
the child I'll come back,

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:21.680 align:middle line:90%
and she couldn't.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Guilt of a parent
abandoning the child.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:28.000 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm lying on the road.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.980 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:32.320 align:middle line:10%
Are you still in your body.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:36.945 align:middle line:10%
>> What are your
thoughts and feelings?

00:23:36.945 --> 00:23:41.320 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm just panicking because
there's going to be no one

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.190 align:middle line:10%
to look after my son.

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:49.845 align:middle line:10%
And I know I'm not
going to be there.

00:23:49.845 --> 00:23:52.590 align:middle line:10%
And I'm still watching over him.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Still watching.

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:56.820 align:middle line:90%
Who is he with?

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:59.280 align:middle line:10%
>> With my parents.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.380 align:middle line:10%
He seems happy.

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:02.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:03.860 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm floating.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.808 align:middle line:90%
>> You're floating.

00:24:05.808 --> 00:24:07.440 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.740 align:middle line:84%
You could clearly see that
there was a slight change

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:11.840 align:middle line:90%
in her expression.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Her facial muscles
started to relax.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So that letting-go
feeling was coming in.

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.320 align:middle line:10%
>> I reached a
gate of someplace.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Reached a gate.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:23.760 align:middle line:84%
OK, can you describe
the gate to me?

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.930 align:middle line:10%
>> It's just a gate, and
it's a wide-open space.

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:29.500 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.280 align:middle line:10%
>> It's about now
I've reached home.

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.930 align:middle line:90%
>> "I've reached home."

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:35.580 align:middle line:90%
What does it feel like?

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.000 align:middle line:90%
"I've reached home," you said.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:38.910 align:middle line:10%
>> Peaceful.

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:40.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Peaceful.

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Is there anyone there on that
other side of that open gate?

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:47.010 align:middle line:10%
>> My grandmother.

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:48.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Your grandmother.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.680 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Ancestor coming to greet
you so it makes sense.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:56.158 align:middle line:84%
She was quite a very
beloved grandchild.

00:24:56.158 --> 00:24:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Had a great
relationship with her.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:01.470 align:middle line:10%
She was very, very
deeply spiritual.

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:04.290 align:middle line:10%
There's another person
I don't recognize.

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:06.030 align:middle line:10%
Says he's my teacher.

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Your teacher.

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:09.000 align:middle line:90%
You said "he."

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.785 align:middle line:90%
Can you describe him?

00:25:10.785 --> 00:25:13.240 align:middle line:10%
>> He's wearing an orange shirt.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.870 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:16.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Very gentle.

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:18.110 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:20.192 align:middle line:10%
>> With white hair.

00:25:20.192 --> 00:25:23.000 align:middle line:10%
He says, I was waiting for you.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:30.955 align:middle line:10%
Because of all the work you've
done, you're already strong.

00:25:30.955 --> 00:25:36.030 align:middle line:10%
You don't have to
be this person.

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:38.870 align:middle line:10%
Shed your armor.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.060 align:middle line:10%
Be yourself.

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Those three words pretty
much sum up the whole session.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.070 align:middle line:90%
When do you wear an armor?

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:48.920 align:middle line:84%
When you're at
war or you believe

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.190 align:middle line:90%
you're going to be attacked.

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:52.440 align:middle line:84%
That means you're functioning
from a space of fear.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:57.200 align:middle line:84%
Her life is all about being
loved, feeling love, sharing

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.510 align:middle line:90%
love, being in the flow of love.

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And vulnerability is actually
when you're really strong.

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:09.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Baba is telling me that
I've given you so much light,

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:15.950 align:middle line:10%
and I'm sending you down now
as a woman this time so you can

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:18.260 align:middle line:10%
feel.

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:19.710 align:middle line:10%
He's saying, I'm preparing you.

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:20.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:21.645 align:middle line:10%
For?

00:26:21.645 --> 00:26:27.850 align:middle line:10%
>> For all the people
you have to show love.

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:33.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Here is a soul who, in her
discussions and dialogues,

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:35.060 align:middle line:90%
is coming as a woman.

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:38.590 align:middle line:84%
So there's this whole
strength thing, being strong.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:39.490 align:middle line:90%
She's armored.

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:40.900 align:middle line:90%
She can take it all.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.030 align:middle line:84%
But there's the
other side of hers

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:47.320 align:middle line:84%
who's absolutely comfortable
to get help from people, where

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.540 align:middle line:84%
people do things for
her, where people are

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:51.700 align:middle line:90%
very protective towards her.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:56.170 align:middle line:10%
Showing her softer self,
showing her femininity,

00:26:56.170 --> 00:27:00.040 align:middle line:10%
that's what she's come here to
experience, because that also

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.260 align:middle line:10%
is being strong.

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:05.290 align:middle line:10%
>> You have to flow.

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:08.670 align:middle line:10%
That's why I'm sending
you down as a woman.

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:09.470 align:middle line:10%
As a mother.

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:12.310 align:middle line:10%


00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:16.110 align:middle line:10%
Because as a mother,
you have to be soft.

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:21.770 align:middle line:10%
You have to be a mother
to so many people.

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:22.920 align:middle line:90%
Emotions are strong.

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Women can feel it
and can express it.

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And not because of
conditioning of society where

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.740 align:middle line:90%
she's allowed to express it.

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.070 align:middle line:84%
It's natural for her
to express things

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:33.170 align:middle line:84%
because emotions are
always at the topmost.

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:36.500 align:middle line:84%
She expresses and feels
life with emotions.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.110 align:middle line:10%
He's saying, you have to
cry everybody's tears.

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Cry everybody's tears.

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:46.920 align:middle line:10%
>> You must cry
everybody's tears.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.780 align:middle line:10%


00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:57.540 align:middle line:10%
He's saying, if you don't cry,
you can't cry for anybody else.

00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:00.570 align:middle line:10%
And it's not weakness.

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:02.210 align:middle line:10%
Oh, he's got his
hand on my head.

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:03.042 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:28:03.042 --> 00:28:06.160 align:middle line:90%


00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.130 align:middle line:10%
He's saying it's not weakness.

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:10.072 align:middle line:10%
>> Great.

00:28:10.072 --> 00:28:11.530 align:middle line:10%
>> He's saying,
you're like a bird.

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:13.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:16.610 align:middle line:10%
>> You're always free.

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:20.390 align:middle line:10%
He's laughing, and he's
telling me tears are good.

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:23.660 align:middle line:10%
They're like a river
that washes away.

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>> She's super
critical about herself.

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:30.060 align:middle line:84%
What she's gifting herself today
is, it's OK to feel for me.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:34.320 align:middle line:84%
It's OK for me to cry, and
it's OK if others see me cry.

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.970 align:middle line:10%
Because what they said was, till
you don't accept your own tears,

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:41.330 align:middle line:10%
how are you going to be
able to do it with others?

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:42.860 align:middle line:10%
>> I can see Baba.

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:43.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, lovely.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:44.560 align:middle line:90%
Baba's there?

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Take a few moments.

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:47.230 align:middle line:90%
Talk to him.

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:51.238 align:middle line:90%


00:28:51.238 --> 00:28:55.115 align:middle line:10%
>> We're holding each
other, and he's happy.

00:28:55.115 --> 00:28:58.990 align:middle line:90%


00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:00.255 align:middle line:10%
Got his hand on my head.

00:29:00.255 --> 00:29:02.770 align:middle line:10%


00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:06.100 align:middle line:10%
He says he loves me.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:09.520 align:middle line:10%
He's apologizing to me.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:14.562 align:middle line:10%
That I'm sorry I took
away something from you.

00:29:14.562 --> 00:29:17.830 align:middle line:10%
You're OK now.

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:20.560 align:middle line:84%
I realized today
that I think it was

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.290 align:middle line:84%
his thing that he was putting
on to me most of the times.

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:27.460 align:middle line:84%
What he couldn't do, he
would put it on to me,

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:28.990 align:middle line:90%
that I would be able to do it.

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:30.500 align:middle line:90%
And then took it on as well.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.630 align:middle line:84%
I was a willing partner
to this whole thing.

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:37.840 align:middle line:84%
>> In his apology to her, and
therefore her apology to him

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.590 align:middle line:90%
in some ways, creates closure.

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:40.390 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Because they are both
able to say sorry.

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:44.520 align:middle line:90%
So there's no guilt there.

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:48.370 align:middle line:10%
There's no guilt-induced belief
or guilt-induced behavior

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:49.870 align:middle line:10%
patterns.

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:54.572 align:middle line:10%
>> They're just telling me not
to be afraid of being myself.

00:29:54.572 --> 00:29:59.530 align:middle line:10%
They're telling me just create.

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:03.610 align:middle line:10%
And there's so much to
do, they're telling me.

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:05.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Does Baba have
anything to say?

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:08.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:14.650 align:middle line:10%
Why are you afraid that
you have to be strong?

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:17.170 align:middle line:10%
You already are.

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:20.180 align:middle line:10%
You don't have to be.

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Her message isn't
just for women.

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:25.460 align:middle line:84%
It's for anybody
who has been taught

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.770 align:middle line:84%
or has been
conditioned as a child

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:29.590 align:middle line:90%
that tears is equal to weakness.

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:32.295 align:middle line:90%

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:37.090 align:middle line:90%
>> How long do you think it is?

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Two hours, at least.

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So, Diya, it was actually 2
and 1/2 or I think a little more

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:43.650 align:middle line:90%
than that.

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:45.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my god.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Her session is
about liberating you

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.110 align:middle line:84%
into acknowledging your
feelings, emotions.

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And the most important
message for me, vulnerability

00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:56.890 align:middle line:90%
is equal to strength.

00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:00.740 align:middle line:84%
I am OK loving myself
just the way I am.

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:09.160 align:middle line:84%
It's been two weeks
since my session.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.320 align:middle line:90%
I do feel the difference.

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:14.270 align:middle line:84%
I remember how I
did feel before,

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:16.710 align:middle line:84%
not allowing myself
to be vulnerable,

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:18.660 align:middle line:90%
and you have to be strong.

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:21.500 align:middle line:84%
But after this session,
there has been a huge shift

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:26.040 align:middle line:84%
that I can visibly
feel within myself.

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm not afraid anymore
to be vulnerable,

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:32.360 align:middle line:84%
and it's OK to feel
emotional and not weak.

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Emotionally, if one is stuck and
you have unhealed parts of you,

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:41.190 align:middle line:84%
then I don't think you can go
ahead and heal anyone else.

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:43.550 align:middle line:84%
So that was a huge
thing for me, where

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:47.270 align:middle line:84%
I did heal those parts of
me which were unhealed,

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:52.880 align:middle line:84%
and I can freely now go ahead
and help other people, which

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.800 align:middle line:90%
is always my purpose.

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.860 align:middle line:84%
In the session where
we spoke about my dad,

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:01.940 align:middle line:84%
and he did not hold any kind
of grudge against me to say,

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:02.860 align:middle line:90%
you didn't see us.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:05.430 align:middle line:84%
He said, I was there
with you all the time.

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's true,
because I do feel him,

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.540 align:middle line:90%
and that was really wonderful.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:12.560 align:middle line:84%
