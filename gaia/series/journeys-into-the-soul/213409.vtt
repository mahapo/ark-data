>> She wants to be
accepted by all.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.580 align:middle line:10%
And once she feels that
that's not happening,

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.980 align:middle line:10%
she digs her heels in and
works harder to be understood.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.683 align:middle line:10%
You do not need to be understood
by every single aspect.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm Monica.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm 33, and I live
in Los Angeles.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.290 align:middle line:84%
I had a session with Jeroen
exactly a year ago almost.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.450 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know exactly
what to expect,

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.960 align:middle line:84%
but I kind of went in with a lot
of questions based on curiosity.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And that was really
enjoyable, amazing experience,

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.480 align:middle line:84%
and some things that
really helped me in my life

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.890 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.950 align:middle line:84%
This time, I'm going to go in
with a really specific intent.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.890 align:middle line:84%
I've really been wondering
what's next for me.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.070 align:middle line:84%
I've been in the advertising
world for 11 years.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And I admittedly haven't
really enjoyed very much of it.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.200 align:middle line:84%
One day, I was hit by a car, and
I had a very intense experience

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.640 align:middle line:90%
that changed my life.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.960 align:middle line:84%
I had an out-of-body
experience and saw something

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.000 align:middle line:84%
that is hard to
describe, but made

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.630 align:middle line:84%
me feel an intense connection
to all other beings

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.260 align:middle line:90%
and things in the world.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And I just felt I couldn't
help but cry and feel

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.830 align:middle line:90%
like I had missed the point.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.870 align:middle line:84%
I felt as if I had
forgotten something

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.480 align:middle line:84%
that was vitally important
to the process of life.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And after that, it was
really difficult to go back

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.580 align:middle line:90%
to my normal life.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.280 align:middle line:10%
It's taken me years to
get out of that industry

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.900 align:middle line:10%
and start to move into
reconnecting with who I feel

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.590 align:middle line:10%
like I am naturally
and in a spiritual way,

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.810 align:middle line:10%
and inviting that
into my life in a way

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.080 align:middle line:10%
that I never had before.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.020 align:middle line:84%
I'd been really
skeptical person.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.030 align:middle line:84%
I come from a really
analytical background.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.920 align:middle line:90%
I love science.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.820 align:middle line:90%
I love physics.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.680 align:middle line:10%
And it's hard for me to leave
that part of myself behind.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.550 align:middle line:84%
At least I feel
sometimes when I'm

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.160 align:middle line:84%
sharing my more spiritual
side with people,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.740 align:middle line:84%
that I am taking away credence
from the more scientific side

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:39.540 align:middle line:90%
of myself.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.420 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like I'm really
separated into right now.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.630 align:middle line:10%
I haven't been able
to merge those two.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.930 align:middle line:10%
I haven't been able to bridge
that gap in my relationships

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.950 align:middle line:10%
other than with my absolute
closest friends and closest

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:52.770 align:middle line:10%
family members.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.890 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like I just want
to share more of myself.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.630 align:middle line:84%
But it's really difficult to
merge the two sides of myself

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.790 align:middle line:84%
together and authentically
share both at the same time.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.280 align:middle line:84%
I've been on a
journey of learning

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.000 align:middle line:90%
for the past couple of years.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.880 align:middle line:10%
Now, I really want to find out
how I can use what I've learned,

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.822 align:middle line:10%
use my journey to help
other people who are

00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:18.030 align:middle line:10%
going through the same thing.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.930 align:middle line:10%
Five years ago, I was a
very different person,

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.320 align:middle line:10%
and I was deeply saddened
by the state of the world.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.240 align:middle line:84%
I was deeply saddened by the
state of my daily existence,

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.110 align:middle line:84%
what I was doing
on a daily basis.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.580 align:middle line:10%
And I feel a huge
amount better now.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:10%
I feel lighter, happier.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.410 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm able
to serve people better.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm able to use my
empathic abilities better.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.000 align:middle line:90%
I understand them.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.040 align:middle line:84%
I can help other people
understand them who

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.600 align:middle line:90%
are going through a hard time.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.240 align:middle line:10%
It's really difficult to pick
up on the emotions of others

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.752 align:middle line:10%
and not recognize
that that's happening.

00:03:52.752 --> 00:03:55.460 align:middle line:84%
You feel like you're just taking
on the weight of the world, that

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:90%
what you think.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.110 align:middle line:90%
It's your weight.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.070 align:middle line:84%
You don't realize
what's happening.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I
want to do today

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.920 align:middle line:84%
is really understand how
I can better do that,

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.920 align:middle line:84%
how I can better serve
the world with the things

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.680 align:middle line:84%
that I've learned, and what this
next chapter looks like for me.

I'm a level 3 Quantum Healing
Hypnosis Technique practitioner.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.530 align:middle line:10%
And I'm based in Los Angeles.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.190 align:middle line:10%
My name is a little
funny or weird

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.140 align:middle line:10%
because I was born
in the Netherlands.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.220 align:middle line:10%
And apparently, we do
funny names over there.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.040 align:middle line:90%

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.330 align:middle line:84%
I identify as gay
and gender queer.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.500 align:middle line:84%
I have interest in things
that most people didn't have,

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.400 align:middle line:84%
the time that I was growing
up from a very small town.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.250 align:middle line:84%
So there weren't
very many examples

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.220 align:middle line:84%
of me being a possibility
out in the world.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.000 align:middle line:90%
And I felt not good enough.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.140 align:middle line:90%
Like I didn't match up.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is when I picked
up a book by Dolores Cannon

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.200 align:middle line:90%
back in 2006.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.140 align:middle line:84%
I was visiting a friend
in his healing practice.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.090 align:middle line:10%
And there was a book
on the coffee table,

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.100 align:middle line:10%
with a little Grey
alien on the cover.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.760 align:middle line:10%
And it said "Custodians."

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.340 align:middle line:10%
I started leafing
through this book

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.780 align:middle line:10%
and found out about this lady,
Dolores Cannon and the work

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.660 align:middle line:10%
that she did.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.130 align:middle line:10%
And my mind was blown.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.740 align:middle line:84%
What she was speaking
of resonated so strongly

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.690 align:middle line:84%
with what I
perceived to be true.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.720 align:middle line:10%
I looked her up
immediately and found out

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.650 align:middle line:10%
that she was teaching her
beautiful QHHT, Quantum Healing

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.980 align:middle line:10%
Hypnosis Technique class in
The Hague in the Netherlands

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:42.920 align:middle line:10%
at the time.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.190 align:middle line:90%
I was able to join this class.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And this was a really
strong indicator for me

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.810 align:middle line:84%
that this is what I
wanted to do with my life.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.420 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to help people access
different parts of their soul

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.320 align:middle line:84%
with the purpose of
healing issues and problems

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.710 align:middle line:90%
in the current lifetime.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.590 align:middle line:84%
I started practicing
after this class

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.440 align:middle line:84%
right away because I just
couldn't hold back my excitement

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.490 align:middle line:84%
and had crazy, beautiful
experiences that propelled

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:13.940 align:middle line:90%
me forward to do more of it.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.780 align:middle line:84%
So I've just been so focused
on this work because of all

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.550 align:middle line:84%
the beautiful
healing experiences

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.240 align:middle line:90%
that my clients went through.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And here we are
now, 16 years later,

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing this work full-time,
and I absolutely love it.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.100 align:middle line:84%
I see people connect
to their soul

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.450 align:middle line:84%
and they're able to navigate
their life with this added

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:35.570 align:middle line:90%
sense of self.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the higher
self, or as we call it,

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.750 align:middle line:84%
the subconscious mind
describes over and over

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.420 align:middle line:84%
and over again that we're
here to love ourselves,

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.250 align:middle line:84%
that we're all the
point the universe

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.310 align:middle line:84%
is trying to make,
to learn to access

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.910 align:middle line:84%
our uniqueness, our
authenticity, and our freedom

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.400 align:middle line:90%
as a unique expression of sorts.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Why this work is
so beautiful to me

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.600 align:middle line:84%
is because people find
their own answers.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And they're focusing on their
own inner truth, the higher

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.480 align:middle line:90%
self, their inner wisdom.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.370 align:middle line:84%
It's like people recover a
sense of their own identity.

Monica about a year ago.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And she recently
contacted me again.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.830 align:middle line:84%
She wanted to have a little bit
of a deeper dive into her life

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.970 align:middle line:90%
and ask more specific questions.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.070 align:middle line:84%

do the session.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.630 align:middle line:84%
So, Monica, you're back
after about a year.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.320 align:middle line:84%
>> What brought
you back in today?

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Last time I came in
with a million questions.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you remember
we were here forever.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And this time I have
a specific intention

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.180 align:middle line:84%
that I want to get to the
bottom of, or at least explore.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:51.980 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I had a near-death
experience.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And everything about
my life changed.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And I've been kind of going
through the steps of that,

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.280 align:middle line:84%
of just learning and
growing, changing, healing

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.030 align:middle line:90%
certain parts of myself.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And now I feel like I'm at the
precipice of another big change.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And I want to be able
to use the things I've

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.850 align:middle line:84%
learned to help other
people who are particularly

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:17.360 align:middle line:84%
in the same spot that I was in,
and find a way to authentically

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.380 align:middle line:84%
be myself without that
fear of being invalidated

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.260 align:middle line:90%
because I'm a wackadoo.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Join the club.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, right.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:27.410 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:32.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So you said you kind of feel
like you're on the precipice

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:36.330 align:middle line:84%
of like a whole new
era in your life.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been doing
readings recently.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And I find it really
hard to charge for them.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:46.350 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people in my life
have been pushing me to do so.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.870 align:middle line:84%
But really, it even took
a lot of other people

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.600 align:middle line:84%
in my life pushing me to
do them in general for me

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.990 align:middle line:90%
to start doing them.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't always trust myself.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:57.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't always
trust the messages

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.300 align:middle line:90%
that come through to me.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:01.710 align:middle line:84%
I kind of really need
external validation

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.390 align:middle line:84%
to trust some of the
things that come through.

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.630 align:middle line:84%
If something comes
through, then somebody else

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.020 align:middle line:84%
says, oh, my god, like,
especially in readings,

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:10.962 align:middle line:90%
when people--

00:09:10.962 --> 00:09:12.420 align:middle line:84%
when it really
connects with people

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.710 align:middle line:84%
and it's very specific
information, it still shocks me.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:20.028 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to be more
comfortable with myself

00:09:20.028 --> 00:09:22.320 align:middle line:84%
and with the things that come
through and my connection

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.667 align:middle line:84%
to my soul and my
ability to hear

00:09:24.667 --> 00:09:26.250 align:middle line:84%
the whisperings of
other people's soul

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:27.610 align:middle line:90%
and pass that along.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>> What is your mind tell you
about if people were to see you

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.600 align:middle line:84%
in a way that you don't
want them to see you?

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Like, if people
were to go like, I

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.530 align:middle line:84%
thought you were
all like fact-based.

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:40.830 align:middle line:84%
But now you're coming up
to me with this bullshit.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.330 align:middle line:90%
What happens inside of you?

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.550 align:middle line:84%
What does that mean
about you as a person?

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I take it on as my
responsibility to allow people

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.370 align:middle line:84%
to be really
comfortable around me.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And I will sometimes put my
own comfort on the back burner

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:57.600 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a great awareness
because I'm guessing that

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.520 align:middle line:84%
sometimes I'll make
you feel uncomfortable.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, really at the bottom
of it all is that I want to be

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.020 align:middle line:90%
loved and liked and accepted.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And when I share
my full self, I'm

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.590 align:middle line:84%
worried that that won't be as
available as it is freely now.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I've really created a
bunch of defense mechanisms

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.840 align:middle line:84%
that allow me to at
least not actively

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.070 align:middle line:90%
see when people don't like me.

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:30.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind enough and
somewhat charming enough

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.490 align:middle line:84%
for them to not show
me that to my face.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:35.970 align:middle line:84%
So I don't have to deal
with it very often.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:39.190 align:middle line:90%
But that's a fear for me.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:44.160 align:middle line:84%
I've always wanted other
people to validate that I'm

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.330 align:middle line:90%
a nice person and sane.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.565 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, thank you
for sharing this.

00:10:50.565 --> 00:10:53.110 align:middle line:84%
This such great awareness
is about what's going on.

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>> The work that
we're doing today,

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.227 align:middle line:84%
your higher self will bring in
more of the authentic Monica,

00:10:59.227 --> 00:11:01.560 align:middle line:84%
the pieces of the puzzle that
you've been aware of until

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.400 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.025 align:middle line:84%
I never know how it's
going to do that,

00:11:04.025 --> 00:11:06.240 align:middle line:84%
but I know this is what
is experienced-- you

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:10.780 align:middle line:84%
will experience more
of your true self.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, whether it's big chunks or
little sprinkles, I don't know.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:16.120 align:middle line:90%
But we'll see what happens.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.650 align:middle line:84%
So the best way to
be in your process

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.830 align:middle line:84%
is to trust everything that
you're seeing or feeling

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.380 align:middle line:90%
or sensing and to talk--

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.210 align:middle line:84%
to talk about it, to be
as descriptive as you can.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find that as
you keep talking about it,

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.250 align:middle line:84%
there's less chance
to think about it.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:35.580 align:middle line:84%
You'll be so relaxed
that all of your body

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.260 align:middle line:84%
will be completely
relaxed, but you'll

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.370 align:middle line:84%
be able to answer
me nonetheless.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:41.667 align:middle line:84%
And you have full
control in this process.

00:11:41.667 --> 00:11:43.500 align:middle line:84%
You're always in control,
meaning you're not

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.490 align:middle line:90%
going to be zonked out.

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Or if you needed a glass of
water or an extra blanket,

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.430 align:middle line:90%
you could ask me about it.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.555 align:middle line:84%
So what I want you to do
now is to use the restroom

00:11:52.555 --> 00:11:55.138 align:middle line:84%
because you're going to be so
relaxed that all of your muscles

00:11:55.138 --> 00:11:56.640 align:middle line:84%
are going to be
completely relaxed.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll get you
comfortable in the table.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get started
to get your answers.

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:06.910 align:middle line:90%


00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.300 align:middle line:90%
Describe it to me, please.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.090 align:middle line:10%
>> It's near the mountains.

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:15.610 align:middle line:10%
There's a lake, a small lake.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.680 align:middle line:10%
And there's other people there.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Part of the induction is that
we take a client to a special

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.310 align:middle line:84%
place and we have them describe
what's going on there in order

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:29.000 align:middle line:84%
to start their inner
eye process working.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.160 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing?

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.750 align:middle line:10%
>> They're around the
lake, pointing energy.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:39.790 align:middle line:10%
There's light coming off of
them, moving upward in a column

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.070 align:middle line:10%
and connecting together.

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>> She described that
there was a small lake.

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:46.210 align:middle line:90%
It was beautiful.

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:47.570 align:middle line:90%
There were mountains.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So there were like people
on four sides of the lake.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.500 align:middle line:90%
And I was in the middle.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And they were standing
straight, but there

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:59.300 align:middle line:84%
was light coming off of them
at an angle and connecting.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And then they
were beaming energy,

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.180 align:middle line:90%
like together and then going up.

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.160 align:middle line:84%
What color is the
light or the energy?

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.550 align:middle line:10%
>> Very bright,
like diamond white.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>> What does it feel like to
be in the middle of these four

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.120 align:middle line:90%
beings directing energy?

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.290 align:middle line:10%
>> It feels like a bath.

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.250 align:middle line:10%
>> What do they look like?

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.790 align:middle line:10%
>> They're tall, and
they're light-skinned,

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:25.010 align:middle line:10%
surrounded and covered by light.

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:27.200 align:middle line:10%
They have long hair.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.740 align:middle line:90%
They're in flowing clothes.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>> I love this work.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And what I think is
funny is that whenever

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:36.350 align:middle line:84%
people describe
that they're looking

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:40.058 align:middle line:84%
at a council or
spiritual beings and ask

00:13:40.058 --> 00:13:41.600 align:middle line:84%
them to describe
what they look like,

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.350 align:middle line:90%
they're always wearing robes.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:45.770 align:middle line:84%
So I have this kind of
running joke with myself,

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:49.457 align:middle line:84%
like, where's the universal
discount robe warehouse store?

00:13:49.457 --> 00:13:50.790 align:middle line:90%
Where do they get all the robes?

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:52.730 align:middle line:10%
It seems to be all the garb.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:56.070 align:middle line:10%
Do you have any sense of the
kind of people these people are?

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:56.870 align:middle line:10%
What kind--

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:58.460 align:middle line:10%
>> I feel like I know them.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.370 align:middle line:10%
>> You feel like you know them.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:04.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, I feel
like they know me.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you send him a thought
and see if it's OK to ask them

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:09.510 align:middle line:90%
some questions.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>> They said it's OK.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:11.330 align:middle line:10%
>> All right.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Monica started to channel
this being that was

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:15.800 align:middle line:90%
with her in this other realm.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And I could just
ask her questions

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:21.440 align:middle line:84%
or interview it, really, to
ask all about who they were

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.140 align:middle line:84%
and what are they
there for, and then

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:25.920 align:middle line:90%
what is Monica's life about.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.100 align:middle line:84%
What's the purpose
of what's going on?

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:33.350 align:middle line:10%
>> We are working together to
better relish that experience

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:38.090 align:middle line:10%
and draw all of the basic
truths that we can from it.

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:42.740 align:middle line:10%
Truths of unity of all energy.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:50.660 align:middle line:10%
By being true to one's self,
you are being true to the whole

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:54.770 align:middle line:10%
by showing each other
individual aspect,

00:14:54.770 --> 00:15:00.800 align:middle line:10%
individualized aspect
that it's safe to do so.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.880 align:middle line:10%
Reminding subconsciously
each individual aspect

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:11.090 align:middle line:10%
you come in contact with
that there is true unity.

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Being true to yourself is giving
that permission to other people

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:15.960 align:middle line:90%
to be true to themselves.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And as more and more
individual pieces of energy

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.860 align:middle line:84%
start to be true
to themselves, that

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:26.600 align:middle line:84%
is servicing the whole by
allowing everybody else to feel

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.670 align:middle line:84%
comfortable and safe in
that experience, too.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:33.200 align:middle line:10%
She's transitioning
into a time where

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.320 align:middle line:10%
she would like to
work with affecting

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.760 align:middle line:10%
the emotions of others.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.230 align:middle line:10%
And this was her choice.

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:43.070 align:middle line:10%
No one decided for her.

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:46.360 align:middle line:10%
No one pushed her to do this.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:51.200 align:middle line:10%
No one pushed her into
this version of expressing

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.840 align:middle line:10%
her essence in this way.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.990 align:middle line:10%
This was her choice.

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:56.310 align:middle line:10%
This was her decision.

00:15:56.310 --> 00:16:00.770 align:middle line:10%
This is something we support
her through, not something we

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:02.910 align:middle line:10%
as a group have pushed her into.

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>> She was told that
she chose to be here.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.070 align:middle line:90%
She was not pushed to be here.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:11.390 align:middle line:84%
We always choose to be here,
not from the human perspective,

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:13.210 align:middle line:90%
but from the soul's perspective.

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:16.220 align:middle line:84%
How has Monica been doing
on this lifetime journey?

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.380 align:middle line:10%
>> She wants to affect all.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:22.160 align:middle line:10%
She wants to be accepted by all.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.670 align:middle line:10%
And once she feels that
that's not happening,

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:31.070 align:middle line:10%
she takes her heels in and
works harder to be understood.

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:36.620 align:middle line:10%
You do not need to be understood
by every single aspect.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.960 align:middle line:84%
That's hard to hear, and
it's because it's true.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:45.350 align:middle line:84%
When I feel like I'm getting
love really easily and freely,

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:46.910 align:middle line:90%
I just flow in that.

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:49.460 align:middle line:84%
When I feel like I'm
getting resistance,

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.380 align:middle line:84%
I put more attention
and more energy

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:55.950 align:middle line:84%
into those moments and
those people or whatever.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:17:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>> What would she need to do to
be able to trust herself more?

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:08.099 align:middle line:10%
>> She needs to recognize that
she is all that she needs to be.

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:16.470 align:middle line:10%
She wants to be unquestionably
good, is the best way to put it.

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:21.069 align:middle line:10%
>> As to avoid to experience
judgment or criticism?

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And are you saying this is
in conflict with who she is?

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:29.940 align:middle line:10%
>> This is in conflict
with the basic truths.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.600 align:middle line:10%
This is unattainable.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:38.370 align:middle line:10%
And as long as she yearns for
this, she will be left without.

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:42.090 align:middle line:10%
This is not a reality
of any existence.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.900 align:middle line:10%
This is unattainable.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:48.150 align:middle line:84%
I want everyone to tell me
that I've made good decisions

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and that I'm being
a good person.

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:51.100 align:middle line:90%
And I'm doing the right things.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.580 align:middle line:84%
People have so many opinions
that that is unattainable

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.680 align:middle line:84%
and that is never
going to happen.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.860 align:middle line:84%
>> What does she need to
feel free within herself,

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:04.380 align:middle line:84%
so she won't have to accommodate
the critical eyes and voices

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.390 align:middle line:90%
of the world around her?

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:11.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Release that need to be
protected from dis-resonance.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:16.560 align:middle line:10%
Humans see judgment,
and it's painful.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:23.100 align:middle line:10%
And so they see dis-resonance
as a negative thing,

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.070 align:middle line:10%
as something to be
avoided, as something

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:30.700 align:middle line:10%
to be worked through rather
than something to be accepted.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:34.770 align:middle line:10%
And we understand why,
because judgment causes people

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:38.310 align:middle line:10%
to do things that are hurtful.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:43.680 align:middle line:10%
But in eternity,
dis-resonance is not hurtful.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.890 align:middle line:10%
Dis-resonance does
not create rifts.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:51.270 align:middle line:10%
There are going to be
aspects, other energy that

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:56.580 align:middle line:10%
is either attractive to
you like a magnet or repels

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:59.130 align:middle line:10%
like opposing sides of a magnet.

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:02.160 align:middle line:84%
They kept saying
dis-resonance and using

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:07.080 align:middle line:84%
this analogy of magnets that
come together and lock together

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.170 align:middle line:84%
or you spin them around and they
just couldn't get them together

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:11.740 align:middle line:90%
no matter how hard you try.

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:14.940 align:middle line:84%
It's really just about,
hey, we're different.

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And you not liking me
doesn't have to mean anything

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.690 align:middle line:90%
about you or about me.

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.740 align:middle line:90%
So what do I actually want?

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.030 align:middle line:90%
Do I want to accept myself?

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:24.440 align:middle line:84%
Or do I want to keep working
for everyone to accept me,

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.440 align:middle line:84%
even though I know that's
never going to happen?

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Once I knew that
we were complete,

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.990 align:middle line:84%
we've drained that whole
experience with the guides from

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:35.400 align:middle line:84%
all its juice, it was time to
move her forward to another

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.530 align:middle line:90%
significant scene.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:39.100 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm on a boat.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.490 align:middle line:10%
It's wood.

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:43.890 align:middle line:10%
I was killed on this boat.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:45.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Can you tell
me what happened.

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:46.980 align:middle line:10%
>> I was pushed off.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Where?

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:49.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Into the ocean.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Why did that happen?

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.960 align:middle line:10%
>> There was somebody
who lost a child.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:59.490 align:middle line:10%
The child was coming to me,
and I shared that message.

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:05.940 align:middle line:10%
And superstitions drove the
crew to push me off the boat.

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.770 align:middle line:10%
And I died there.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Were you young?

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.300 align:middle line:10%
>> I was 16.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:11.670 align:middle line:10%
>> 16.

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:16.200 align:middle line:10%
>> My mother pushed me away.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:21.390 align:middle line:10%
She felt that I was
doing something wrong,

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:23.870 align:middle line:10%
connecting with.

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:27.330 align:middle line:10%
evil energies, as
she would put it.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.690 align:middle line:10%
She's been converted
to a religion.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>> As you look back
at that lifetime,

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:33.820 align:middle line:90%
what did you learn from it?

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.460 align:middle line:90%
What was the lesson?

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.340 align:middle line:10%
>> I learned how to
stand up for myself.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:42.930 align:middle line:10%
The purpose of this lifetime
was to share my rebellion.

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:49.050 align:middle line:10%
It came so easily and
naturally, and a lot of power

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:51.018 align:middle line:10%
was built within me.

00:20:51.018 --> 00:20:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>> What does it feel like to
no longer be in that body,

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:54.810 align:middle line:90%
to have left that life?

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:59.040 align:middle line:10%
>> It is quite easy to
release from that body.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:03.090 align:middle line:10%
But it is not easy to
release from those emotions.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:05.593 align:middle line:84%
>> When we're done
exploring the past life,

00:21:05.593 --> 00:21:07.510 align:middle line:84%
and they've gone through
the death experience,

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:10.380 align:middle line:84%
we always ask for what the
lesson and the purpose was

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:11.620 align:middle line:90%
of that lifetime.

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Why was she drowned for her
ability to relate his messages?

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:20.160 align:middle line:10%
>> We showed her that because
it is the opposite aspect of her

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.300 align:middle line:10%
true being.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:25.080 align:middle line:10%
In this life, she is very
much on the opposite end

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.150 align:middle line:10%
of that spectrum.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:33.750 align:middle line:10%
The spectrum being full
rebellion, full disconnection

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.350 align:middle line:10%
from the fear of judgment.

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:38.350 align:middle line:10%
>> And to show her that,
how does that help her?

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:43.080 align:middle line:10%
>> She often needs to move
through the full spectrum before

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.870 align:middle line:10%
she decides to come
back to center.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:48.330 align:middle line:10%
So we decided to show her.

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:51.930 align:middle line:84%
In that lifetime, I
really went all the way

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:53.680 align:middle line:90%
to this side of that spectrum.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.150 align:middle line:84%
I didn't care at all what
people thought about me.

00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:00.713 align:middle line:84%
I did not care if somebody
thought I was crazy.

00:22:00.713 --> 00:22:03.130 align:middle line:84%
I didn't care if they didn't
believe in what I was saying.

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:06.250 align:middle line:84%
I didn't care if it would
put me in danger to say it.

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:07.690 align:middle line:90%
I didn't care at all.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:10.560 align:middle line:84%
In this lifetime, I'm
sort of moving towards--

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.990 align:middle line:84%
I felt I feel myself more on
this side of the spectrum.

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:15.780 align:middle line:84%
So I'm excited
about this message

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:17.160 align:middle line:84%
because I feel
like now that I've

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.330 align:middle line:90%
seen this side of the spectrum.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:20.910 align:middle line:90%
And I've learned the lessons.

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:24.330 align:middle line:84%
I've been given this
knowledge that's so helpful,

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:26.590 align:middle line:84%
I can stop kind of
moving in this direction.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:30.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to touch that
jagged edge on the other side.

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:32.710 align:middle line:84%
I can start to move
back towards the middle

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:36.130 align:middle line:84%
and just take that
lesson, take this lesson,

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:38.870 align:middle line:84%
and start to come into
that balance point.

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you please scan her
physical body and let me know

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:44.540 align:middle line:84%
if there's any areas of the body
that need to be addressed today.

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Part of the QHHT process
is to have the subconscious

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:50.150 align:middle line:90%
mind do a body scan.

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:54.700 align:middle line:10%
>> It feels like a metal plate
that stops all energy from

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:58.540 align:middle line:10%
transferring between
these two areas.

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And what's the origin of this
metal plate that's between her

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:03.040 align:middle line:90%
head and her throat.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Fear, fear, fear, fear.

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:06.770 align:middle line:10%
She's afraid.

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:13.180 align:middle line:10%
We remember how many times
she's been physically hurt

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:18.280 align:middle line:10%
because of the power she felt
within her to share herself,

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.620 align:middle line:10%
regardless of what
people thought.

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:23.350 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I have
this metal plate that's

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:26.350 align:middle line:84%
separating my head from
the rest of my body.

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And there's no energy that's
transferring into my head.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>> It came back with that there
was some kind of plate between

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:35.570 align:middle line:84%
her head and her
throat, and it was fear.

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:40.900 align:middle line:10%
>> This plate was really
something we allowed her

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:44.650 align:middle line:10%
to develop so that
she could feel safe.

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:46.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Can you help with this today?

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:48.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Then please do so now.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.580 align:middle line:10%
>> We have to break
down that wall.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:54.620 align:middle line:10%
And we're doing it biologically.

00:23:54.620 --> 00:24:00.130 align:middle line:10%
We feed energy into
her cells and then

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:03.320 align:middle line:10%
it permeates through
into her ideology.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.490 align:middle line:10%
As we release that
wall biologically,

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:09.430 align:middle line:10%
she will start to understand
that she can release

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:11.260 align:middle line:10%
that wall ideologically.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:14.388 align:middle line:10%
She can release that
wall psychologically.

00:24:14.388 --> 00:24:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And how will she be affected
by the work that you're doing

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:17.920 align:middle line:90%
right now?

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.740 align:middle line:10%
>> If she can accept
all of herself,

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:24.730 align:middle line:10%
regardless of whomever
she happens to be with,

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:27.970 align:middle line:10%
regardless of wherever
she happens to be with,

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:31.090 align:middle line:10%
then she can gain that freedom.

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And is there anything else
that she should know about

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.350 align:middle line:90%
on how to accept herself?

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:37.960 align:middle line:10%
>> She is quick to annoyance.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.790 align:middle line:10%
We ask her to
breathe through that

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:45.530 align:middle line:10%
and know that she has a choice.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:49.790 align:middle line:10%
Annoyance is not
something that's

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:54.760 align:middle line:10%
created by the body,
created by the soul.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.590 align:middle line:10%
It is a reaction.

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:59.570 align:middle line:10%
She does not need
to react that way.

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:03.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm always easily
annoyed with my mom,

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:07.100 align:middle line:84%
which is like, she loves me
more than anyone ever could.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.415 align:middle line:84%
And why is she the one I'm
giving the most annoyance to?

00:25:10.415 --> 00:25:11.540 align:middle line:90%
She's just living her life.

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, mom, why
would you say that?

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.140 align:middle line:90%
And it's the worst.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:17.430 align:middle line:90%
And then I feel guilty.

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And so they asked me
to forgive myself.

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And they asked me
to be open about it.

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be open
about it with my mom.

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:26.120 align:middle line:84%
If I get annoyed, I'll
be like, I'm so sorry.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why I did that.

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:29.903 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there any other parts
of her body that need to be

00:25:29.903 --> 00:25:31.170 align:middle line:90%
addressed today?

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:32.400 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.680 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.000 align:middle line:10%
She's healthy.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:39.310 align:middle line:10%
>> How can she foster more
fulfillment in her life?

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:44.960 align:middle line:10%
>> She's not going to like this,
but she needs to share herself.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:48.340 align:middle line:10%
You need to allow
yourself to be seen.

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:51.370 align:middle line:10%
She's taken on the
beliefs of the culture

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:53.980 align:middle line:10%
and the beliefs of
this culture, is

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:57.250 align:middle line:10%
that it's egotistical
and self-centered to want

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:58.690 align:middle line:10%
to be seen.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:03.040 align:middle line:10%
But for somebody who does
not innately want to be seen,

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.670 align:middle line:10%
to open themselves
up to being seen

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:12.180 align:middle line:10%
is entirely different
than seeking attention.

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:12.980 align:middle line:10%
>> All right.

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.220 align:middle line:84%
This is more about
learning to share

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.550 align:middle line:90%
and to share our gifts as well?

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:17.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:23.290 align:middle line:10%
We tell her that her
want to be truly seen

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:30.500 align:middle line:10%
as morally unquestionable,
that is egotistical.

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:35.120 align:middle line:10%
That is the part of her
that is battling with ego.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:41.210 align:middle line:10%
Not the part of her that wants
to truly share who she truly is.

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:49.770 align:middle line:10%
These morals she has behind
her beliefs is based in ego.

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:53.490 align:middle line:10%
We feel sometimes
when she is trying

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:56.130 align:middle line:10%
to project certain
aspects of herself

00:26:56.130 --> 00:27:00.120 align:middle line:10%
and hide certain
beliefs, she is trying

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.210 align:middle line:10%
to manipulate the way
other people see her.

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:08.940 align:middle line:10%
It is for her own
protection in her mind,

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.550 align:middle line:10%
but it is still
manipulating the way others

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:14.190 align:middle line:10%
see you, which is futile.

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there anything that you
can do right now to help release

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.320 align:middle line:90%
the pride and the guilt?

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:25.491 align:middle line:84%
>> [VOCALIZING] Wah,
wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.

00:27:25.491 --> 00:27:27.782 align:middle line:90%


00:27:27.782 --> 00:27:28.582 align:middle line:90%
Waaah.

00:27:28.582 --> 00:27:39.340 align:middle line:90%


00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.480 align:middle line:10%
We're done.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The toning that she was
doing is not very common.

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:44.170 align:middle line:90%
And I was enjoying it.

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:45.320 align:middle line:90%
This was something new.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:46.240 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.040 align:middle line:90%
How did you do that for her?

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.610 align:middle line:10%
>> We feed energy into
the top of her head,

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:56.380 align:middle line:10%
and we have it fill
the center of her body,

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:59.710 align:middle line:10%
and then we clear her
energy with tones.

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:03.160 align:middle line:10%
She can heal any part
of her body with tones.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.740 align:middle line:10%
But we wish for her to know
that she can heal emotions

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:08.120 align:middle line:10%
with tones just as
easily as ailments.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:08.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Ailments.

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Now that I know that it
can affect my emotions too,

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.670 align:middle line:84%
I can start to figure out where
certain emotions are living.

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:17.890 align:middle line:84%
If I know I'm having
that emotion in my head,

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:21.010 align:middle line:84%
use that tone and let
it lead me to wherever

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:23.590 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of living in
my body and understand

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:25.900 align:middle line:84%
how my emotions are
affecting my physical body

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.277 align:middle line:90%
and my physical health.

00:28:27.277 --> 00:28:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there anything else that
has not been covered today that

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:32.800 align:middle line:90%
needs to be healed or cleared?

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:33.670 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Today I definitely took
a journey into my soul

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:42.560 align:middle line:84%
and my soul's really just
whispering to me that I'm OK.

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to
worry if I'm good.

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And by being myself,
I am being good.

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:50.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm sharing myself
with the world,

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.140 align:middle line:84%
and I'm making other people
comfortable to do the same.

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>> How much time do
you think it took?

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:00.540 align:middle line:90%
Like, half an hour, 40 minutes.

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:02.876 align:middle line:90%
>> It was actually three hours.

00:29:02.876 --> 00:29:03.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:04.610 align:middle line:90%
Oops.

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>> The session was a great
healing experience for Monica,

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:10.440 align:middle line:84%
but it also reminded me of this
important truth that we're all

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.890 align:middle line:90%
here to love ourselves.

00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:13.420 align:middle line:90%
It is like that famous quote.

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:16.510 align:middle line:84%
You best be yourself because
everyone else is taken.

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been two weeks
since my session.

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.330 align:middle line:90%
And I feel amazing.

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:30.280 align:middle line:84%
I feel like a weight
has been lifted.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.840 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I was
so hard on myself.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.110 align:middle line:84%
I was really being
critical and serious.

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And I don't feel that need
to be validated by something

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing externally.

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:43.440 align:middle line:84%
I know that my helping
people will happen naturally,

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.240 align:middle line:84%
and it will come together
when and how it's supposed to.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And I don't need to pressure
myself or try to figure it

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:51.150 align:middle line:90%
all out in one day.

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:53.040 align:middle line:84%
I just feel like I'm
accepting myself more

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:59.530 align:middle line:84%
and allowing myself to be goofy
and less quick to annoyance,

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:01.540 align:middle line:90%
like they said in the session.

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And I just feel
like I definitely

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:05.740 align:middle line:90%
had a journey into the soul.

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And I am so grateful to
Jeroen for helping me

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:09.760 align:middle line:90%
through this process.

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.680 align:middle line:84%
The first time was
absolutely amazing.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.670 align:middle line:84%
I've been utilizing what I got
from that session for a year.

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And now, I feel like a whole
new bag of tricks, tools,

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:22.140 align:middle line:84%
and understandings of
myself that I definitely

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:25.720 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't have had if I didn't
have this experience with him.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Going forward, I know I'm
going to utilize everything

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:29.380 align:middle line:90%
that I gained from this.

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm super excited to see
what comes out in the future.
