I'm 52 years old, and
I live in Wimbledon.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.100 align:middle line:90%
I work in the science field.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.880 align:middle line:90%
I have a degree in chemistry.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.010 align:middle line:84%
I now work in marketing
and business development.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.440 align:middle line:84%
When I was younger, I lived in
quite a religious Hindu family,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.640 align:middle line:90%
extended family.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.970 align:middle line:84%
My grandparents lived with us as
well, together with my uncles.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.380 align:middle line:84%
My mom has always been
extremely religious.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.930 align:middle line:84%
When I was about
17, she decided she

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.940 align:middle line:84%
wanted to explore spirituality
and leave the family unit,

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.230 align:middle line:84%
and then went to
India for 10 years.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.900 align:middle line:84%
I felt that because she
left the family unit,

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.210 align:middle line:84%
it was up to me to look after
the family in terms of cooking

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.400 align:middle line:84%
and cleaning and all of those
mature things that you do at 17,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.390 align:middle line:84%
and I felt quite suffocated with
all of those responsibilities.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.870 align:middle line:84%
So I was really happy for
her, but at the same time,

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:02.930 align:middle line:90%
I felt quite lost.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.000 align:middle line:90%
I went to university.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.850 align:middle line:84%
It was something
that I was encouraged

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.970 align:middle line:84%
to go to and get an education
because my parents aren't

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.120 align:middle line:90%
educated.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And it was such a big
thing for my parents

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.300 align:middle line:84%
to encourage me, but
more so my grandfather.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.210 align:middle line:84%
I was very close
to my grandfather,

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.630 align:middle line:84%
and he came to this
country in 1950

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.710 align:middle line:84%
to make a better
life for ourselves.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And I felt it was
something that I

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.080 align:middle line:90%
needed to do to make him proud.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.320 align:middle line:84%
I completed my
chemistry degree, and I

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.150 align:middle line:90%
went traveling to see my mom.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And she was in India,
so I was there for eight

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.640 align:middle line:84%
to nine months, which
was interesting to see

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.440 align:middle line:90%
an insight into her life.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.500 align:middle line:84%
I came back, graduated, and
then soon after, met a man

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.070 align:middle line:84%
and decided to be married to him
and then have children with him.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.690 align:middle line:84%
But I just wasn't
fulfilled and happy.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Something was missing, and I
couldn't share those aspects

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.280 align:middle line:90%
of myself with him.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.900 align:middle line:84%
And sadly, our
relationship ended,

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.850 align:middle line:84%
and I moved out
with my children.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.155 align:middle line:90%
I just didn't feel happy.

00:03:23.155 --> 00:03:27.440 align:middle line:90%


00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.660 align:middle line:84%
I wanted answers about myself
and why my marriage didn't work.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.580 align:middle line:90%
It was more of like, why me?

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.290 align:middle line:90%
What is happening to me?

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.220 align:middle line:90%
Why is this happening to me?

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Was there any lessons
for me in here?

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.310 align:middle line:10%
Am I going to make the
same mistakes again?

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.960 align:middle line:10%
Can I trust myself again?

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.070 align:middle line:84%
I completely lost
myself in that marriage.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.500 align:middle line:84%
I started doing a lot
of personal development.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.010 align:middle line:84%
I joined a facilitator group,
learning about myself and also

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.130 align:middle line:90%
coaching too.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.000 align:middle line:90%
And that's when I met Jovy Wan.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Jovy had mentioned to me that
she had done QHHT and learnt her

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.930 align:middle line:84%
techniques, and her
mentor is Dolores Cannon.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.690 align:middle line:10%
I did a little bit of
research on YouTube.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.160 align:middle line:10%
I saw some of the videos.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.070 align:middle line:10%
I found it fascinating about
going into past regression

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.070 align:middle line:10%
and just understanding
about souls,

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.710 align:middle line:10%
which is an area
that I'm absolutely

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.840 align:middle line:10%
curious and fascinated about.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.430 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to learn more.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.320 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to receive
a one-to-one with her

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.110 align:middle line:84%
and concentrate on
some of the things

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.780 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted to
understand about myself,

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.190 align:middle line:90%
like my purpose in life.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Am I in the right
career path that I'm in?

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.965 align:middle line:84%
And if not, then what
should I be doing?

00:04:51.965 --> 00:05:09.645 align:middle line:90%


00:05:09.645 --> 00:05:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Jovy Wan.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.690 align:middle line:90%
I live in London, England.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.000 align:middle line:84%
I am a QHHT level
3 practitioner.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.160 align:middle line:10%
It stands for quantum
healing hypnosis technique.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.280 align:middle line:10%
Through this deep hypnosis,
we take our client

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.600 align:middle line:10%
to a very, very deeply-relaxed
state, where in that state,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.780 align:middle line:10%
the conscious mind, the
analytical side of their brain,

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.170 align:middle line:10%
goes to sleep, and their
subconscious, the inner wisdom,

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.820 align:middle line:10%
the higher self,
can come through,

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.670 align:middle line:10%
answer all their questions,
give them the guidance they need

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.090 align:middle line:10%
and the healing for
their life right now.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.830 align:middle line:90%


00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.270 align:middle line:84%
I was born and
raised in Hong Kong.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.010 align:middle line:84%
All through my life,
I was so conforming

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.070 align:middle line:84%
to all the expectations of
the society, of my family,

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.550 align:middle line:84%
of my Chinese heritage,
culture, and everything.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.440 align:middle line:84%
But then in 2009, my father
passed away rather unexpectedly,

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.680 align:middle line:84%
and that was the time I got
this big wake-up call about,

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.880 align:middle line:90%
what did I want in life?

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.330 align:middle line:84%
In my years of working
in the corporate world,

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.760 align:middle line:84%
I was always in marketing,
mostly in the banking

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.990 align:middle line:90%
and finance field.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And I got a lot of material
rewards for what I did,

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.480 align:middle line:90%
but I never felt fulfilled.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.140 align:middle line:84%
I never felt like it's
something that I love to do.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.030 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't what I desired.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.660 align:middle line:84%
I honestly felt like
a little bit of me

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.240 align:middle line:84%
was dying every single
day, and I didn't

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.020 align:middle line:90%
know how to get out of it.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.400 align:middle line:84%
I felt stuck, but yet it
felt like the only path.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.430 align:middle line:84%
So I started on a journey
of searching, searching

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.370 align:middle line:84%
for what was for
me, Jovy, as opposed

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.320 align:middle line:84%
to what was expected
of me by everyone else.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2013, as a
student, I was finally ready.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.010 align:middle line:84%
So the great teacher,
Dolores Cannon, appeared.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.690 align:middle line:10%
I got the great opportunity
to meet her in person

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.740 align:middle line:10%
and trained personally with her.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, I have worked
and lived my entire life

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.900 align:middle line:84%
without any passion until
the point I met her.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.190 align:middle line:84%
That was the very first time
that I found something I truly

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:16.050 align:middle line:84%
love that's my passion, and the
passion continues until today.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.970 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
empowering modality.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:22.050 align:middle line:84%
It's not some guru, someone
outside of you telling you

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.300 align:middle line:84%
what you should do, what
is the best for you,

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.780 align:middle line:90%
what they felt for you.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.130 align:middle line:90%
It's you.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.940 align:middle line:84%
It's your connection to your
inner wisdom, your higher

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.010 align:middle line:84%
self that is giving
you the guidance.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And for you to have a taste that
the connection is always there,

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.440 align:middle line:84%
you can always tap
into that great wisdom.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.910 align:middle line:90%
It's all within you.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.595 align:middle line:84%
You are the best
healer for yourself.

I met Mala in the year 2020.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.010 align:middle line:84%
We were in the
same online group,

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.320 align:middle line:84%
studying about
law of attraction,

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.990 align:middle line:84%
and eventually we got into some
coaching training together.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:01.910 align:middle line:84%
She's always this lovely
lady, and of course, she

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:05.220 align:middle line:84%
knows what I do as
a QHHT practitioner.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.810 align:middle line:84%
She wants to have a one-on-one,
really, deep-dive session

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.210 align:middle line:84%
with me so that she
would get the answers she

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:12.390 align:middle line:90%
has been seeking.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Mala comes with a long
list of questions,

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.370 align:middle line:90%
and I'm so curious for her.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And you never know what is going
to come out, what kind of wisdom

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.730 align:middle line:84%
will come through from my
client's higher self, what

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:27.830 align:middle line:84%
kind of stories, or what
kind of planets or lifetime

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:28.860 align:middle line:90%
we will go into.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.820 align:middle line:90%
So it's always exciting and fun.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:40.490 align:middle line:90%


00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.460 align:middle line:84%
So before we begin,
I would like to ask,

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.080 align:middle line:84%
why are you interested
in having a session?

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.290 align:middle line:84%
What do you want to
accomplish through a session?

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel there's
so much to explore.

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.980 align:middle line:90%
I need some clarity.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:58.880 align:middle line:84%
I know that there's so much
more to learn about the soul

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.540 align:middle line:84%
and where it's been,
where it's come from,

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:06.810 align:middle line:84%
and what's going to happen
in the future for me.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.300 align:middle line:90%
And just some answers, really.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.735 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just very, very curious.

00:09:10.735 --> 00:09:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So we will begin with me
understanding your life story.

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.570 align:middle line:84%
I just need to know all the
important people and events

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.060 align:middle line:84%
in your life so that
during hypnosis I

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.540 align:middle line:84%
will have all the information I
need to ask questions for you,

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:24.930 align:middle line:90%
to dig deeper for you.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.425 align:middle line:84%
So Mala, which year,
and where were you born?

00:09:27.425 --> 00:09:29.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I was born in Leicester.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:33.170 align:middle line:90%
It's middle of the UK.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:34.580 align:middle line:90%
It was 1970.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.600 align:middle line:84%
Living in an extended
family, my grandparents

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.030 align:middle line:90%
are there and my mom and dad.

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.520 align:middle line:84%
It's traditional that
we all live together.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.710 align:middle line:90%
That's an Indian culture.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:51.260 align:middle line:84%
I was very close
to my grandfather.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:55.020 align:middle line:84%
He treated me as though
I was his daughter.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.490 align:middle line:90%
We have such a beautiful bond.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:07.560 align:middle line:84%
My mom, I've always felt there
was this dissatisfied sadness.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.940 align:middle line:90%
She was a very young mom.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.530 align:middle line:90%
She was 20 when she had me.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:14.630 align:middle line:84%
She left her family at 18,
came over to a new country,

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:17.350 align:middle line:84%
married my dad
through photographs.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So that was an
arranged marriage?

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Arranged marriage, yeah.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.340 align:middle line:90%
Proper arranged, that one.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.740 align:middle line:90%
Because they hadn't even met.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And her parents sent her over
to a complete stranger's family.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.000 align:middle line:90%
So there was this--

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.030 align:middle line:84%
I could feel it then that
there's that sadness.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:40.100 align:middle line:84%
She had me as a C-section,
and it was really

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:41.730 align:middle line:90%
traumatic in those days.

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And recovery and all
of that was just,

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.040 align:middle line:84%
I think,
soul-destroying for her,

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.710 align:middle line:90%
from what she was saying to me.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And then having to come home and
do all the chores that she had

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.040 align:middle line:90%
to continue with and not rest.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So what is your current
relationship with your mom?

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>> My relationship
with her is better,

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:05.190 align:middle line:84%
although there's this sense of,
I still have this frustration,

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.160 align:middle line:90%
and I want to, again, heal that.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.092 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:08.092 --> 00:11:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And my dad was just oblivious
to a lot of things and just

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.650 align:middle line:90%
working a lot.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I don't
want to get married.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.105 align:middle line:84%
It's just not-- I just
don't want to do it.

00:11:20.105 --> 00:11:22.080 align:middle line:90%
>> What did you study in uni?

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Chemistry.

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:26.470 align:middle line:84%
The subject was
fascinating for me,

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:29.110 align:middle line:84%
and so I really, really
enjoyed doing that.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:middle line:84%
I then ended up going into
the pharmaceutical industry.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:39.390 align:middle line:84%
So I met my now ex-husband,
but he was a really fun guy

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:40.190 align:middle line:90%
to be around.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And we used to have such
a laugh together, but not

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.065 align:middle line:84%
as a husband now when
I think about it.

00:11:46.065 --> 00:11:47.365 align:middle line:90%
>> I know you have two boys.

00:11:47.365 --> 00:11:48.550 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:50.840 align:middle line:84%
We just didn't have a
relationship with my husband.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And every time I asked
him to do something,

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.240 align:middle line:90%
they were just having arguments.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.420 align:middle line:84%
The children were four and
a half and two and a half,

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:03.610 align:middle line:84%
and I decided I don't want
to be with him anymore.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.100 align:middle line:84%
He just buried his
head in the sand.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.830 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as I
made that decision,

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.390 align:middle line:90%
everything fell into place.

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.690 align:middle line:90%
It was just such a relief.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:15.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was lovely.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Joined some social
clubs and social events

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:24.160 align:middle line:84%
and started going out,
and I met somebody else.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we just become
really good friends.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:31.205 align:middle line:84%
Relationship from that sort
of blossomed, and yeah,

00:12:31.205 --> 00:12:32.580 align:middle line:84%
it was nice three
years together.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:33.533 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:33.533 --> 00:12:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So have we pretty much covered
all the important people

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:38.120 align:middle line:90%
and events in your life?

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I think so.

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:40.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Any question?

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I think you've
covered everything.

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:48.552 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.552 --> 00:12:50.856 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm in space.

00:12:50.856 --> 00:12:52.530 align:middle line:10%
>> You're in space.

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:57.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Lots of different lights and
colors and the background is

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:58.660 align:middle line:10%
black.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.065 align:middle line:10%
>> What kind of colors?

00:13:00.065 --> 00:13:00.865 align:middle line:10%
Tell me.

00:13:00.865 --> 00:13:04.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Colors of the rainbow.

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.770 align:middle line:10%
The colors are swirly.

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:12.010 align:middle line:10%
The colors are
blended like waves.

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:15.150 align:middle line:84%
I just was floating
around in this wave

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:16.710 align:middle line:90%
of lots and lots of color.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:21.255 align:middle line:84%
And we're playing in there,
and I love being in that scene.

00:13:21.255 --> 00:13:24.095 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the
shape of your body?

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:25.900 align:middle line:10%
>> There isn't a shape.

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.060 align:middle line:10%
It's just blended
with all the colors.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I wonder, how does that
feel for you to be part

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:32.252 align:middle line:90%
of the colors?

00:13:32.252 --> 00:13:33.440 align:middle line:10%
>> One.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.805 align:middle line:10%
>> One.

00:13:34.805 --> 00:13:37.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Just one with space.

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:38.850 align:middle line:10%
Limitless.

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:40.625 align:middle line:10%
>> Limitless.

00:13:40.625 --> 00:13:42.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I could do whatever I want.

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:44.460 align:middle line:90%
These colors are not going away.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.670 align:middle line:84%
They're just going
to be there forever.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:50.550 align:middle line:84%
I can be limitless
like the colors,

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.960 align:middle line:90%
because I feel at one with them.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Does it feel to you
that you're just watching,

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.490 align:middle line:10%
or you are a part of them, or--

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:00.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Part of them.

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.590 align:middle line:10%
>> You're part of them.

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:04.980 align:middle line:10%
>> It is beautiful here.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:08.920 align:middle line:10%
>> How do you feel when you
look at this beautiful light,

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.065 align:middle line:10%
beautiful colors--

00:14:10.065 --> 00:14:11.245 align:middle line:10%
>> Really happy.

00:14:11.245 --> 00:14:13.762 align:middle line:10%
>> Really happy.

00:14:13.762 --> 00:14:18.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Just the colors of things
that are just merging together

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.650 align:middle line:10%
and being--

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:21.570 align:middle line:10%
Playing.

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:23.662 align:middle line:10%
>> Playing.

00:14:23.662 --> 00:14:26.552 align:middle line:10%
Oh, the colors are playing.

00:14:26.552 --> 00:14:30.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, with each other.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:34.240 align:middle line:10%
That's how I feel the way
they want to merge together

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.210 align:middle line:10%
to make a different color.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:40.200 align:middle line:10%
Let's see what this does,
and let's see what that does.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.930 align:middle line:10%


00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.470 align:middle line:10%
I feel I belong to them.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:50.630 align:middle line:10%
And I found my tribe.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:52.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.755 align:middle line:90%
And this tribe looks very happy?

00:14:54.755 --> 00:14:58.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Very happy, colorful play.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>> When the lights keeps
evolving and she realized that

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.990 align:middle line:84%
it's limitless and she is a
part of the light of the color,

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:10.820 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly she was
having this realization,

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.600 align:middle line:90%
I am with my tribe.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.950 align:middle line:90%
This is my tribe.

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:19.280 align:middle line:84%
She was smiling, all happy,
and it felt so playful and fun.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And she just enjoyed it,
totally bathed in the enjoyment.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.700 align:middle line:90%
Let's leave that scene.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And let's move forward
to another important day

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.880 align:middle line:84%
in this lifetime
that we are watching.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.150 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm going to school.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:36.870 align:middle line:10%
>> You're going to school.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:37.670 align:middle line:10%
Oh, tell me--

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.096 align:middle line:10%
>> With my grandfather.

00:15:39.096 --> 00:15:41.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, with your grandfather.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.360 align:middle line:10%
>> He's got a suit on.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.030 align:middle line:84%
>> How are you feeling going
to school with your grandfather

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.410 align:middle line:90%
and he even puts a suit on?

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:51.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Proud.

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:52.620 align:middle line:10%
He's really tall.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.150 align:middle line:10%
>> How about you?

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:55.410 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm tiny--

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:56.210 align:middle line:10%
>> You're tiny.

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:59.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Compared to him.

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:04.670 align:middle line:10%
But I feel secure, warm.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:07.415 align:middle line:10%
>> You feel secure, warm.

00:16:07.415 --> 00:16:08.676 align:middle line:10%
>> Protected.

00:16:08.676 --> 00:16:10.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Protected.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.610 align:middle line:90%
She felt protected.

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:12.600 align:middle line:90%
She felt safe.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.000 align:middle line:84%
She felt she could
trust, and she

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.890 align:middle line:84%
felt like she was
never alone when

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:17.630 align:middle line:90%
she was with her grandfather.

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.935 align:middle line:84%
How does it feel to be
walking together with him?

00:16:20.935 --> 00:16:23.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Loved.

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:27.900 align:middle line:10%
He's telling me, "I'll
be here after school.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.245 align:middle line:10%
You go and have a good time."

00:16:30.245 --> 00:16:34.325 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you trust that he
will be there after school?

00:16:34.325 --> 00:16:37.760 align:middle line:10%
>> If he says he's going
to be there, he will.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:38.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:44.530 align:middle line:10%
>> I just needed the validation
so I feel safe, secure,

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:46.440 align:middle line:10%
and loved.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And I don't always find
that in my physical world.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.220 align:middle line:84%
But he showed me that
you can have that again.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So I want to move her to an
important day in that lifetime

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:00.710 align:middle line:84%
that we were watching, because
I want to get more information.

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:03.315 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:17:03.315 --> 00:17:04.799 align:middle line:10%
>> Bottle-green uniform.

00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:08.155 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, in your
bottle-green uniform.

00:17:08.155 --> 00:17:11.599 align:middle line:10%
>> Somebody has taken
a picture of me.

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:12.760 align:middle line:10%
It's my first day.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, your first day.

00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:17.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Secondary school.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:18.730 align:middle line:10%
But I don't like my uniform.

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:23.241 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, you don't
like your uniform.

00:17:23.241 --> 00:17:25.589 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't like the way I look.

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there any ones who wear
a bottle-green uniform like you

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.600 align:middle line:90%
do?

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.400 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.230 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:32.520 align:middle line:10%
So it's just you?

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.515 align:middle line:10%
>> Just me.

00:17:33.515 --> 00:17:36.860 align:middle line:10%
It feels so out of place.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:41.000 align:middle line:84%
This is the school that my
mom chose for me to go to,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.720 align:middle line:84%
and it had this awful
uniform that I had to wear.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.935 align:middle line:90%
But it just made me feel ugly.

00:17:47.935 --> 00:17:52.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Now let's leave this scene.

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's move backward in
time to a very happy day

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.110 align:middle line:90%
when you were just a toddler.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:04.370 align:middle line:84%
I want to get more information,
so I was moving her backward,

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:05.930 align:middle line:90%
instead, this time.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Back to her when she
was a little girl,

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:09.855 align:middle line:90%
when she was just a toddler.

00:18:09.855 --> 00:18:10.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Pink dress.

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.875 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, a pink dress.

00:18:12.875 --> 00:18:14.580 align:middle line:10%
>> I've got curly hair.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.562 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:18:16.562 --> 00:18:18.086 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm fat.

00:18:18.086 --> 00:18:20.705 align:middle line:10%
>> You're fat.

00:18:20.705 --> 00:18:21.505 align:middle line:10%
>> Chubby.

00:18:21.505 --> 00:18:24.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Ooh, you're chubby, and
you're wearing a pink dress.

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:26.090 align:middle line:10%
>> My dad's got me.

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:28.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Your dad got you.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.195 align:middle line:10%
>> Holding me.

00:18:29.195 --> 00:18:30.552 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh.

00:18:30.552 --> 00:18:33.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Then he puts me on
a bonnet of the car.

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:39.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, my God.

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:41.795 align:middle line:10%
Somebody has taken
a picture of me.

00:18:41.795 --> 00:18:43.526 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:18:43.526 --> 00:18:46.846 align:middle line:10%
>> I look really sad.

00:18:46.846 --> 00:18:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you still in the
pink dress with curly hair?

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.711 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:18:53.711 --> 00:18:55.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Not a toddler.

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:58.491 align:middle line:90%
>> You're no longer a toddler.

00:18:58.491 --> 00:19:00.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Four or five.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:02.612 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:19:02.612 --> 00:19:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So a happy
memory from my dad.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:10.760 align:middle line:84%
He's holding me and
playing with me.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.050 align:middle line:84%
I was somehow transported
to this four-year-old,

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:16.200 align:middle line:90%
five-year-old girl.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.503 align:middle line:10%
I've got these pigtails.

00:19:17.503 --> 00:19:20.130 align:middle line:10%


00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:27.920 align:middle line:10%
But my grandmother has
completely ruined my hair.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.950 align:middle line:10%
She's put them up in
like little loops.

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:36.570 align:middle line:10%
So a pigtail, but then
looped it back up.

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:38.180 align:middle line:10%
So I've got these
two loopy things

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.970 align:middle line:10%
on the either side of my face.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:42.680 align:middle line:10%
I look hideous.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.220 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it was a plait
and then tied at the bottom

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:49.460 align:middle line:90%
and then taken up and put back.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And a bow, a ribbon,
and on both sides.

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, it was a thing in
India, but I looked awful.

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you tell your grandmother
that you didn't like it?

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:01.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.565 align:middle line:10%
>> And what was her response?

00:20:04.565 --> 00:20:06.400 align:middle line:10%
>> "You have to
have it like that."

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.530 align:middle line:90%


00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:17.220 align:middle line:10%
I feel scolded at for making
a suggestion or saying,

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.420 align:middle line:10%
"I don't want that."

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Now I want to move on to
directly talk to the higher

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:25.880 align:middle line:84%
self, to have a conversation, to
get answers, healings, guidance,

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.130 align:middle line:84%
directly from this
amazing part of her.

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:30.780 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing I
asked the higher self was,

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:33.690 align:middle line:84%
why did you choose that
lifetime to show her?

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.985 align:middle line:84%
Is she still a part of
those beautiful lights?

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:37.345 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:20:37.345 --> 00:20:40.690 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to show her beauty.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:46.470 align:middle line:10%
She deserves to know that
every form is beautiful,

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:52.080 align:middle line:10%
because sometimes
there's this fear in her.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.260 align:middle line:10%
But there's nothing
to worry about

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.860 align:middle line:10%
because everything's beautiful.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>> She is still a part of that
color while she is doing Mala

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:06.540 align:middle line:84%
in this lifetime, so there's way
more to what we perceive as who

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:07.440 align:middle line:90%
we are.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.355 align:middle line:90%
How about her tribe?

00:21:09.355 --> 00:21:10.545 align:middle line:10%
>> Always with her.

00:21:10.545 --> 00:21:12.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Always with her.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.730 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell who they are?

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:16.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Her mum.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:19.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Her mum.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.446 align:middle line:10%
Does her mother love Mala?

00:21:22.446 --> 00:21:24.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:26.615 align:middle line:10%
>> Can she feel it?

00:21:26.615 --> 00:21:29.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:32.560 align:middle line:10%
We all have our different
paths and journeys,

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.980 align:middle line:10%
and we're here to learn,
because we're here for all

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:39.650 align:middle line:10%
of our different experiences.

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:42.370 align:middle line:10%
And the way she feels
about them doesn't

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:45.790 align:middle line:10%
mean there's anything
wrong that you've done.

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.545 align:middle line:84%
That's a decision her mother's
soul chose to experience, right?

00:21:52.545 --> 00:21:54.886 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:21:54.886 --> 00:21:59.462 align:middle line:84%
>> There's nothing wrong
that Mala has done?

00:21:59.462 --> 00:22:01.060 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:04.060 align:middle line:10%
She just needs to
know she's not alone.

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:06.950 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes I feel I'm alone.

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:11.680 align:middle line:84%
The tribe side of
things helps me connect,

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.520 align:middle line:90%
and that feels powerful to me.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:23.320 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to show light and
the colors to make her aware

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:30.290 align:middle line:10%
that it's all one and
we are all together.

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And how does
that relate to Mala?

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:38.065 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a slight doubt
that anything is possible.

00:22:38.065 --> 00:22:41.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, I see.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:48.885 align:middle line:10%
>> Sometimes she isn't brave
enough to go for what she wants.

00:22:48.885 --> 00:22:50.114 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:22:50.114 --> 00:22:54.610 align:middle line:10%
>> But I want to say,
she is limitless.

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:59.340 align:middle line:10%
She can do whatever
she needs to do.

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.260 align:middle line:10%
That anything is possible.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.350 align:middle line:10%
So go for it.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:06.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Nothing is impossible,
and everything is possible.

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:09.450 align:middle line:84%
Just like Mala's higher
self saying, just go for it.

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I think Mala in the physical
world knows that but doesn't act

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:13.610 align:middle line:90%
on it.

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:17.800 align:middle line:84%
I have, in my past, evidence
of just going for it.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:18.990 align:middle line:90%
Things just work out.

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:21.740 align:middle line:90%
I just need to do that more.

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you show her a
scene when she was little,

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:29.430 align:middle line:84%
she was tiny, and going to
school with her grandfather.

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:32.496 align:middle line:90%
Why did you show her that scene?

00:23:32.496 --> 00:23:36.200 align:middle line:10%
>> I want her to know her
grandfather's with her always.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Always.

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:40.340 align:middle line:10%
>> She can feel him.

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:41.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:49.744 align:middle line:10%
>> He's a symbol of
courage, boldness,

00:23:49.744 --> 00:23:54.800 align:middle line:10%
somebody who pushes
her, looking after her.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:58.290 align:middle line:10%
I'm just giving her the nudge--

00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:00.080 align:middle line:10%
what are you afraid of?

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:04.950 align:middle line:84%
I feel as though he's pushing
me from the inside to,

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:06.600 align:middle line:90%
Mala, just go for it.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:10.010 align:middle line:10%
>> If her grandfather
has a message for her,

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:12.695 align:middle line:10%
has something to want
to say to her now--

00:24:12.695 --> 00:24:17.990 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm with you, and
I'm holding your hand.

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:26.360 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes she feels on her
own, but she really isn't.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.560 align:middle line:10%
I'm so proud of her.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.170 align:middle line:10%
>> You are.

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:33.180 align:middle line:10%
>> She has nothing
to be afraid of.

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:36.720 align:middle line:10%
Just live your life the
way you want to live it.

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:41.995 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of this making
sure people are validating me.

00:24:41.995 --> 00:24:43.120 align:middle line:90%
What you're doing is right.

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.245 align:middle line:90%
What you're doing is right.

00:24:44.245 --> 00:24:45.290 align:middle line:90%
I'll ask other people.

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:49.380 align:middle line:84%
But now I feel a lot
more braver and stronger

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:52.920 align:middle line:84%
to follow what I want to
do and living my life.

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So the next scene, when she
was wearing that bottle-green

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.195 align:middle line:90%
uniform that she hated so much.

00:24:59.195 --> 00:25:00.895 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:25:00.895 --> 00:25:02.580 align:middle line:10%
>> It wasn't that bad.

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.290 align:middle line:10%


00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:08.170 align:middle line:10%
But it's a lovely
memory that I want

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:13.570 align:middle line:10%
to show her that the
good, the bad, the ugly,

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:15.090 align:middle line:10%
there's so much fun in there.

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:16.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:22.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, she looked hideous,
but at least you can laugh

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:23.396 align:middle line:10%
at yourself.

00:25:23.396 --> 00:25:25.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Often, we get
way too serious.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.590 align:middle line:90%
It's all about us having fun.

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder, what
happened in the next scene?

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.210 align:middle line:84%
When you show her,
originally, she

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:36.060 align:middle line:84%
was this chubby, little
girl with curly hair,

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:37.380 align:middle line:90%
wearing a pink dress.

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And then turn a bit older
to four to five years old,

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:45.240 align:middle line:84%
and her grandmother was
fixing her hair in a way

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:48.100 align:middle line:84%
that she really
didn't like about.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.940 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:56.340 align:middle line:10%
>> She thought it was ugly,
but everybody else didn't.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:01.620 align:middle line:10%
She needs to
acknowledge her feelings

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:07.450 align:middle line:10%
and express more
of what she wants.

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>> It is so important for
you to express yourself,

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:13.410 align:middle line:84%
to be authentic, to
tell it as it is.

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:15.440 align:middle line:90%
It's how you feel.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:20.130 align:middle line:84%
She wants to know her
purpose in this lifetime.

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:27.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Keep doing things that
you enjoy, that you love.

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:31.170 align:middle line:10%
Once you stop loving that,
then it's time to change.

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I feel stuck,
and I think, OK, I've got--

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:38.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm in a job or a relationship
or whatever it is.

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:39.160 align:middle line:90%
I overthink it.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:43.000 align:middle line:84%
I stay there for a very long
time, and I don't take action.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.050 align:middle line:90%
There's this stuckness.

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:46.410 align:middle line:84%
If I don't love it,
then what am I doing?

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>> She wants to know why it's
such a struggle for her to lose

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:51.700 align:middle line:90%
weight.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:55.890 align:middle line:10%
>> She's holding on to things,
maybe sometimes her decision

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:58.110 align:middle line:10%
making.

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:03.300 align:middle line:10%
Rather than just going
for things, she'll ponder.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:09.120 align:middle line:10%
>> All right, I'll comfort
myself then grab something.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.490 align:middle line:10%
She should just decide.

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:14.250 align:middle line:10%
She's not going to get it wrong.

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:16.440 align:middle line:10%
Well, there's no
right and wrong.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:23.170 align:middle line:10%
Whatever happens, there's always
something to learn and grow.

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:24.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:25.847 align:middle line:10%
>> And expand.

00:27:25.847 --> 00:27:26.647 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:27:26.647 --> 00:27:30.990 align:middle line:10%
>> She's here for her curiosity.

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:33.900 align:middle line:10%
She signed up to this.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.000 align:middle line:10%
Go for it.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.040 align:middle line:10%
What are you afraid of?

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.580 align:middle line:90%
What are you afraid of?

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
no right or wrong.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.000 align:middle line:84%
There's always
learning something.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.705 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
something out of it.

00:27:46.705 --> 00:27:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Don't worry about
making wrong decisions.

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:50.470 align:middle line:90%
There's no wrong decision.

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:51.810 align:middle line:90%
There's no right or wrong.

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Everything is the experience
that we sign up for.

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:57.220 align:middle line:90%
We are here for the experience.

00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:00.580 align:middle line:84%
That's how we learn,
grow, and expand.

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.183 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:28:02.183 --> 00:28:03.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:28:03.395 --> 00:28:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>> How long does it feel
to you that it has been?

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Forever?

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>> It's over three hours.

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:10.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:14.200 align:middle line:84%
I feel, with this session, it's
pulled out some of these things

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.450 align:middle line:84%
that I need to
listen to more so,

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:18.370 align:middle line:84%
because I do
overthink sometimes,

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:23.150 align:middle line:84%
and I do get stuck in my little
way, and I prolong the process.

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And now my higher self is
just saying, just go for it.

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:27.770 align:middle line:90%
What is wrong?

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:30.435 align:middle line:84%
There isn't anything wrong,
and you learn so much.

00:28:30.435 --> 00:28:37.400 align:middle line:90%


00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.820 align:middle line:84%
It's been two weeks
since my session.

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:41.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling great.

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:46.070 align:middle line:84%
There's been a lot of clarity
with where I need to go,

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:47.670 align:middle line:90%
what I need to do.

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:51.300 align:middle line:84%
There were a few things
that I was hesitant on.

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:56.780 align:middle line:84%
One of them was looking to
move and also relationships,

00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:01.950 align:middle line:84%
and I was thinking too much in
a lot of my decision making.

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And now I feel as though
I want to just go for it.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:07.265 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Jovy.

00:29:07.265 --> 00:29:10.610 align:middle line:84%
I had an amazing
journey into my soul,

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:12.840 align:middle line:84%
and I'm really looking
forward to the future.

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And all the doors feel
as though they're open.
