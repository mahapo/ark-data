did rally in Denmark and Sweden.

and said, well,

some breathwork.

called rebirthing by breathing.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:12.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel it's a large challenge
for me to do 14 days of 5,000

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.010 align:middle line:90%
kilometers race in Africa.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:16.370 align:middle line:90%
No matter the setting--

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:21.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm going to die, but
it will be a tough, tough one.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.340 align:middle line:84%
It really is a childhood
dream from, like, eight,

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:26.810 align:middle line:90%
nine, 10 years old.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:31.040 align:middle line:84%
It's like, wow, it's
finally going to happen.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, now I got
goosebumps all over.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:35.380 align:middle line:90%


00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:39.730 align:middle line:10%
>> So your father was the one
who introduced you to the car

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:40.750 align:middle line:10%
rally.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was a small boy,
he told me that before I came

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:49.300 align:middle line:84%
into this world, he did rally
driving in an old Volvo Amazon

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.560 align:middle line:84%
when he was, like,
18, 19 years old.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh,
wow, that's cool, dad.

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And he always talked
about putting himself

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:02.140 align:middle line:84%
in a position where he would
be able to get me started

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:07.160 align:middle line:84%
in karting and buy me a
go-kart and support me on that,

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.830 align:middle line:90%
but he never got to it.

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So tell me a little more
about your relationship.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say that it has
been a tough relationship.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.340 align:middle line:84%
When I was a young man
or a kid or a teenager,

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.960 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand why
he was so tough on me.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.890 align:middle line:84%
At some point,
when I was 20, 21,

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:26.320 align:middle line:84%
I had this very large
argument with him

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.470 align:middle line:84%
that drove me to
consider suicide.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.940 align:middle line:84%
I actually stood on the
bridge on a dark, dark winter

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.310 align:middle line:84%
night thinking about throwing
myself into the water

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:41.650 align:middle line:84%
and just drown myself because I
couldn't cope with him anymore.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.880 align:middle line:90%
It was too tough.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:49.820 align:middle line:84%
I had this maybe voice inside
me saying, oh, it's too easy.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.730 align:middle line:84%
There's so much more to
life you have to experience.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:55.430 align:middle line:90%
The last 10 years of his life--

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:57.200 align:middle line:90%
we didn't have any connection.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.660 align:middle line:84%
When he was very, very
ill and hospitalized--

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and I went to visit him and held
his hand and told him that--

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.160 align:middle line:90%
what an asshole he was.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And I thanked him for all the
good stuff and all the bad stuff

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.060 align:middle line:84%
because at that
point, I could see

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.360 align:middle line:84%
that even though he was a
tough guy and tough on me,

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.500 align:middle line:84%
it was an opportunity
for me to learn things.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Even though in a daily situation
I doubted it sometimes,

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:28.190 align:middle line:90%
I always knew that he loved me.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:30.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Going into the session, trust
every little sensation, emotion,

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.780 align:middle line:90%
feeling that comes up.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.820 align:middle line:84%
You are the master
of this journey.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm with you all the time,
but I'm not inside your head,

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:49.790 align:middle line:84%
so I don't know exactly
what's going on.

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So you say everything
that comes up.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:56.350 align:middle line:84%
If I am ahead of
you, behind you,

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:59.410 align:middle line:84%
or you skip to somewhere
totally different

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:01.840 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
happened, you tell me.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.710 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So I guess we're ready to
change through the session.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you ready?

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I'm excited.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:22.770 align:middle line:90%


00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:24.480 align:middle line:10%
>> We're having a party.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.780 align:middle line:10%
>> You're having a party.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:26.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:34.350 align:middle line:10%
I'm standing up with a
jug of mead in my hand,

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:36.990 align:middle line:10%
looking at some men
and women sitting

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.330 align:middle line:10%
on a table in front of me.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.100 align:middle line:10%
They look like Vikings.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.110 align:middle line:84%
The feeling I had
in the situation

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.000 align:middle line:84%
was joyful, and
happiness, and jolliness.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.520 align:middle line:90%
And we're going on a quest.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.270 align:middle line:90%
And this guy is helping us.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.120 align:middle line:90%
So it was a party.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.070 align:middle line:10%
I'm not a Viking.

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:59.940 align:middle line:10%
I'm wearing a big, dark blue
cape with golden thread, edges,

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.390 align:middle line:10%
and corners, and symbols.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:04.230 align:middle line:10%
And on my head, I
have a headpiece

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:06.960 align:middle line:10%
with some golden material.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.890 align:middle line:10%
And there's a jewel on it
on the third eye position.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.950 align:middle line:10%
>> We enter the past life.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:14.920 align:middle line:10%
He is dressed very differently.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.410 align:middle line:84%
So if you look down at your
skin, what color is it?

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:19.480 align:middle line:10%
>> It's Caucasian.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.280 align:middle line:10%
It's white.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.170 align:middle line:10%
But I, at the same time, know I
can change it with my thought.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.550 align:middle line:10%
>> You can change it?

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.710 align:middle line:10%
>> I can change the
color of my skin.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:30.830 align:middle line:84%
I looked at my
arm, and I realized

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:35.160 align:middle line:84%
that I could change it in
any color I wanted instantly.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.520 align:middle line:90%
Whoa, this is strange.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.300 align:middle line:10%
I'm not one of them, but they
know me, and I know them.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.620 align:middle line:10%
I've taken the shape
of a human body

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:46.590 align:middle line:10%
so they can relate
to me as a human.

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:49.970 align:middle line:10%
I speak the language, but
I wear different clothing.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:51.680 align:middle line:10%
>> And why is that?

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Because I don't have to hide.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.130 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not one of them,
that I'm from somewhere else.

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:59.090 align:middle line:10%
And they know that I'm
from somewhere else.

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:02.660 align:middle line:10%
>> He's dressed differently,
so he might be a visitor.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:06.270 align:middle line:84%
In this case, he's able to
change the color of his skin,

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:11.600 align:middle line:84%
so that tells me he's definitely
not your normal human being.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.600 align:middle line:10%
So what's going on right now?

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.120 align:middle line:10%
>> We are preparing
for a journey.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.320 align:middle line:10%
I'm here to tell them
what way to sail,

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:23.820 align:middle line:10%
and what to be careful
of, and how to get there.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:28.860 align:middle line:84%
I was there like a guide
or instructor to tell them

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.870 align:middle line:84%
where to go, to find
what they were seeking,

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.850 align:middle line:90%
and how to go there.

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:37.906 align:middle line:84%
>> So tell me, where
do you come from?

00:14:37.906 --> 00:14:40.770 align:middle line:10%
>> I come from the stars.

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:41.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Tell me more.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:42.940 align:middle line:10%
>> They are not afraid of me.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:47.080 align:middle line:10%
And when they ask me where
I come from, I look up.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I come from the stars.

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.940 align:middle line:84%
It made me feel
familiar in some way

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:54.850 align:middle line:84%
because in my human
presence, I don't always

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:57.370 align:middle line:90%
feel like I'm at home.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:58.700 align:middle line:90%
All the places I go--

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.200 align:middle line:90%
I feel like a stranger.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>> And tell me about that place.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:07.800 align:middle line:10%
>> I register a lot of fuss,
and busyness, and joyfulness,

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.950 align:middle line:10%
and happiness, a lot
of light particles.

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:17.040 align:middle line:10%
It's like a place of departure,
the last place you are,

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.600 align:middle line:10%
where you prepare for
your next departure

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.530 align:middle line:10%
from this place of
pure consciousness.

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:25.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you have a specific form?

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.240 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.090 align:middle line:10%
It's not a physical place.

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:33.930 align:middle line:84%
>> On this place of departure,
what do you call it?

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Safe haven.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not really about the
Vikings that you're telling how

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.000 align:middle line:90%
to travel and how to sail.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.230 align:middle line:84%
It's about his
past life, and that

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:46.390 align:middle line:84%
leads to this place he
calls the safe haven.

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:49.890 align:middle line:90%
That is a departure port.

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:54.810 align:middle line:10%
>> I see all the intention
and coming into physical form.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:59.870 align:middle line:10%
From this place, I can
jump into a physical body.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:04.800 align:middle line:84%
I know that I'm a soul, and
I'm in a place with no time

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:05.620 align:middle line:90%
and space.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm, like, on hold
or something like that.

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And then I get this
impulse, or order, or task,

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:13.690 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And then you go to safe
haven, and you prepare.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:21.030 align:middle line:10%
It seems as if it's the place
where consciousness comes

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:26.280 align:middle line:10%
into concepts and thoughts,
and from there on,

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:31.520 align:middle line:10%
can come into
physical existence.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:38.470 align:middle line:10%
So when we manifest physical
shape, the soul goes with it.

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:44.970 align:middle line:10%
There's also feeling sensations
of joyfulness, and happiness,

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:49.290 align:middle line:10%
and excitement, everything
coming through that place

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:52.155 align:middle line:10%
and into some sort
of physical form.

00:16:52.155 --> 00:16:59.140 align:middle line:10%
I'm very happy and excited
about what, like, quest.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.230 align:middle line:84%
I had the sensation of
preparing for a quest

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.510 align:middle line:84%
to go there in
that time and space

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:08.859 align:middle line:84%
and help them, instruct them
to do things like this and this

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:11.040 align:middle line:84%
in order to achieve
this and that.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.020 align:middle line:84%
>> What is your quest
you're going on?

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:21.490 align:middle line:10%
>> The quest is to educate and
elevate, to help them evolve.

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:25.840 align:middle line:10%
>> In this place, there is the
ability to solve a specific

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:26.640 align:middle line:10%
mission.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.240 align:middle line:10%
He has not been born
into that lifetime.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:36.620 align:middle line:84%
He has chosen to take a form to
give guidance to those Vikings.

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:38.690 align:middle line:84%
Here, from the
safe haven, I want

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:43.260 align:middle line:84%
you to move to an even
higher consciousness.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.930 align:middle line:90%
So what do you notice here?

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:55.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Many souls,
heartbeat, larger groups.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Larger groups?

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:57.218 align:middle line:10%
>> 10 or 12.

00:17:57.218 --> 00:17:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.970 align:middle line:84%
Are you in a group, or are you
moving in between groups now?

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:05.850 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm moving between groups.

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:08.380 align:middle line:10%
I see threads of energy
between the groups,

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.940 align:middle line:10%
and I see all groups connected.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.220 align:middle line:84%
The background was,
like, the universe

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.980 align:middle line:84%
as a canvas, pitch
black, and galaxies,

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.340 align:middle line:90%
and stars in the background.

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And these groups of souls
were, like, floating in nothing

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:25.590 align:middle line:84%
like-- and then connected
with these threads, which were

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:28.630 align:middle line:90%
the roads between the groups.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:31.770 align:middle line:10%
We'll, I know right now,
I'm headed to that group.

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:34.590 align:middle line:10%
But I'm not sure I'm
going to stay there.

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>> No, but tell me what
happens when you get closer.

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.780 align:middle line:10%
>> I feel welcomed.

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:46.830 align:middle line:10%
I feel it's a rather new
group, three or four them.

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>> From Newton's work, we
understand that souls form

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:51.670 align:middle line:90%
groups.

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:55.110 align:middle line:84%
Those groups are often
a primary soul group

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:59.580 align:middle line:84%
of souls you have worked with
through numerous lifetimes.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.315 align:middle line:84%
So just tell me your
eternal spiritual name.

00:19:02.315 --> 00:19:06.870 align:middle line:90%


00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:07.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:11.560 align:middle line:90%


00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:14.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Maybe just let me know
him letter by letter.

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:25.530 align:middle line:10%
>> A-S-H-A-R.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Ashar?

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:30.890 align:middle line:10%
>> And then H again.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:31.690 align:middle line:90%
Asharh.

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:34.490 align:middle line:90%


00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:35.290 align:middle line:90%
Asharh.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:37.870 align:middle line:90%


00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:40.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Asharh.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.570 align:middle line:90%
Does that sound right?

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:42.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:45.690 align:middle line:10%
Asharh, Asharh.

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>> I couldn't pronounce it.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:52.240 align:middle line:84%
I just started to feel,
like, a vibration or a tone.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Hmm, how would I put
letters on that tone?

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:59.230 align:middle line:84%
How would that tone sound
like if I pronounce it?

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:03.010 align:middle line:84%
I've never known that souls
had, like, names like that,

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:06.430 align:middle line:84%
but it feels very
familiar to me.

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:09.930 align:middle line:84%
>> It helps the client to stay
connected to the soul essence

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:12.900 align:middle line:84%
and not jump into the past
life or the person I have

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:17.460 align:middle line:84%
in the chair because they get
that grasp of this is actually

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.050 align:middle line:90%
me.

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:27.560 align:middle line:84%
So tell me, Asharh, about
your relations to this group.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.547 align:middle line:10%
>> Stephen's father
is in that group.

00:20:29.547 --> 00:20:30.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.620 align:middle line:90%
How does that present him?

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:38.810 align:middle line:10%
>> In glimpses, it takes shapes
of the father of Stephen.

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:47.210 align:middle line:10%
Behind that, I get the sensation
of a brother, an equal.

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:51.260 align:middle line:10%
"Brothers in Arms," the
song by Dire Straits.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.840 align:middle line:10%


00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.950 align:middle line:10%
That we go way, way back.

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:59.512 align:middle line:10%
We have experienced so
many things together.

00:20:59.512 --> 00:21:01.980 align:middle line:10%
And we always
supported each other.

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:06.440 align:middle line:10%
We always had each other's backs
and were there for the other one

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.930 align:middle line:10%
old, old friend.

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:12.500 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't always a great
guy, behaving great, or what

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.130 align:middle line:90%
I felt being good to me.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:15.990 align:middle line:90%
I thought he was a harsh man.

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And on a human
level, I understand

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:23.370 align:middle line:84%
why he was such a douchebag
or whatever you call it.

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:29.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Sometimes when we meet
people in this lifetime that are

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:34.370 align:middle line:10%
a challenge, those are actually
people from our soul group that

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:37.250 align:middle line:10%
are here to help you evolve.

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:40.730 align:middle line:10%
>> It seems like we take turns
on being a father and son

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:44.200 align:middle line:10%
and also being brothers.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:50.580 align:middle line:10%
I get the picture of both twin
brothers and bigger and smaller

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:54.420 align:middle line:10%
brother, but always fighting.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:22:00.880 align:middle line:10%
But in that kind, brotherly,
friendly way, I love you,

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.790 align:middle line:10%
and I'll fight you, and I'll--

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:07.055 align:middle line:10%
>> And what is the
purpose of that?

00:22:07.055 --> 00:22:08.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, that's just for fun.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.890 align:middle line:90%
That's just for fun.

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>> It made me realize and
understand more about why we had

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:17.720 align:middle line:84%
these confrontations
in this human life.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.900 align:middle line:84%
I was his dad,
and he was my dad.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:23.940 align:middle line:84%
Or we were brothers, always
fighting, but only for fun.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>> So what have been the
purpose of that relation?

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:35.220 align:middle line:10%
>> The purpose has been to mold
and shape Stephen and not let

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:39.690 align:middle line:10%
him forget that you will
sometimes get hurt and people

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:40.980 align:middle line:10%
misunderstand you.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:44.970 align:middle line:10%
And they don't always
understand Stephen,

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:50.550 align:middle line:10%
and they react to that, so
he needed a thicker skin.

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:51.780 align:middle line:10%
That job is done.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.200 align:middle line:10%
And all is good.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:58.890 align:middle line:10%
And don't forget the lessons
you got from me, Stephen.

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:01.882 align:middle line:10%
>> And tell me more
about the lessons.

00:23:01.882 --> 00:23:05.190 align:middle line:10%
>> It makes me sad because the
lessons are that you cannot

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:09.990 align:middle line:10%
always trust the
humans closest to you.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:12.630 align:middle line:84%
It was good to hear him
on a soul level say,

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:15.030 align:middle line:84%
don't forget the
lessons, my friend.

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:16.860 align:middle line:84%
I might have been
hard on you, but there

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.130 align:middle line:90%
was a purpose with that.

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose--
the job's done.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And just remember what
you get out of it.

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:27.540 align:middle line:84%
>> When the client finds
purpose in a relationship,

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:31.950 align:middle line:84%
it often leads to the ability
to forgive or hold gratitude

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:35.380 align:middle line:84%
for that relation instead
of holding a grudge.

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And why did Stephen need
to learn that, Asharh?

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:42.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Stephen needs to remember
that even though he has been

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:46.470 align:middle line:10%
mistrusted and
betrayed so many times,

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:51.210 align:middle line:10%
there are people he can trust.

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:57.630 align:middle line:10%
It's also about Stephen
trusting his intuition.

00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:01.200 align:middle line:84%
So the lessons learned
through the actions of my dad

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:05.610 align:middle line:84%
was knowing that my
fifth sense or intuition

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:11.460 align:middle line:84%
is right, and listen to that,
and be more true to myself.

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>> So what I hear
you say, Asharh,

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:22.320 align:middle line:84%
is that the soul Stephen knows
as his father was teaching him

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.150 align:middle line:90%
about trusting himself.

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:33.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, because it seems as if
Stephen has taken a rather big

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:37.600 align:middle line:10%
job, and he's not always
trusting that he can do it.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Mm-hmm And tell me
about that big job.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.850 align:middle line:10%
>> To walk the
path of your soul.

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:48.420 align:middle line:10%
Never let anybody tell
you you cannot do that.

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So, Asharh, is there any
more you need from this group?

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.520 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm ready to move on.

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>> When I'm in the session, I
get a feeling that we have all

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:01.630 align:middle line:84%
the information from
this specific place.

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:04.110 align:middle line:84%
I ask them to move
on to the next place.

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:06.250 align:middle line:10%
>> To my left, there's
a group of souls.

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:10.940 align:middle line:10%
And in that group of
souls, there are--

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:11.740 align:middle line:10%
what?

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.100 align:middle line:10%
Three, four.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:19.260 align:middle line:10%
They're wearing the clothes
of motocross drivers.

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:22.720 align:middle line:10%
One is speaking in Polish.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.610 align:middle line:10%
I don't understand.

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:25.540 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:27.520 align:middle line:10%
>> That's not the point.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.340 align:middle line:10%
I'm waiting for you in Poland.

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:34.600 align:middle line:10%
There are three races in Poland
that Stephen are aware of.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:39.720 align:middle line:10%
And you should go there and
participate in at least one.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.550 align:middle line:10%
>> And why is that, Asharh?

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:46.620 align:middle line:10%
>> To Stephen, Poland
is a safe place to race.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:50.230 align:middle line:10%
It's like the message
is, come on out.

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:51.030 align:middle line:10%
Join us.

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:52.770 align:middle line:10%
Have fun.

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:54.090 align:middle line:10%
>> A driver turns up.

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:56.990 align:middle line:10%
That encourages him
to train and drive

00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:58.830 align:middle line:10%
in a place that feels safe.

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:03.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I was surprised to meet that
soul in that outfit saying,

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:04.400 align:middle line:90%
well, come on down here.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.660 align:middle line:90%
Let's have fun together.

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'll show you a trick or
two, and we'll just have fun.

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>> We move to an
even higher place.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Tell me how this
place presents itself.

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:21.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Late at night,
sky full of stars.

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:22.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:23.610 align:middle line:10%
Tell me more.

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:27.930 align:middle line:10%
>> There's one big, bright
shining right in front of me.

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:30.640 align:middle line:10%
>> And what is the message here?

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Just be what you are.

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.012 align:middle line:10%
And just shine your light.

00:26:35.012 --> 00:26:39.460 align:middle line:10%
I tried to blend in
and be like others.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.530 align:middle line:10%
Felt like a chameleon.

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:43.720 align:middle line:10%
In order to be
accepted, I need you

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.080 align:middle line:10%
to blend in and be like others.

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.640 align:middle line:10%
You don't have to, just be.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:52.360 align:middle line:84%
There were no words, or
messages, or pictures, just

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:58.150 align:middle line:84%
this great, great, beautiful,
pitch black background and then

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:02.890 align:middle line:84%
this one big light like a
sun or something like that.

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:04.480 align:middle line:90%
Just be you.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:07.600 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry about what other
people think about how you do it

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.020 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.330 align:middle line:90%
Just do it.

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Does the state "just
be" infect the areas

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:16.876 align:middle line:90%
of Stephen's life?

00:27:16.876 --> 00:27:19.570 align:middle line:10%
>> The rally
driving is good fun,

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:23.290 align:middle line:10%
and it helps Stephen
being in the moment.

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:26.620 align:middle line:10%
It's OK to have a
passion like that

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:30.710 align:middle line:10%
and also know that you
are a spiritual being.

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:31.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:32.650 align:middle line:10%
Tell me more.

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:35.140 align:middle line:10%
>> One doesn't
exclude the other.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:37.970 align:middle line:10%
In fact, it goes hand in hand.

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:41.080 align:middle line:10%
It's actually a part
of Stephen's power.

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:45.970 align:middle line:10%
By driving a rally, and doing
workshops, and writing books,

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:48.460 align:middle line:10%
telling about his
life experience,

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:52.810 align:middle line:10%
he can build a bridge
between the two worlds

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:56.940 align:middle line:10%
for people to understand
that you can be both.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:02.370 align:middle line:10%
You don't have to choose between
them, either a spiritual being

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:05.820 align:middle line:10%
or being just a physical being.

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.950 align:middle line:10%
You are both.

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>> What will happen when
humans understand this?

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:18.650 align:middle line:10%
>> They will be more
balanced and empowered.

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And how is this knowledge and
wisdom affect Stephen's life?

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:25.950 align:middle line:10%
>> It's his path to
be the messenger.

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:28.050 align:middle line:84%
I can do rally
driving in Africa,

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:30.420 align:middle line:84%
but I can also sit around
a bonfire, meditate,

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:32.590 align:middle line:90%
and just still be Stephen.

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:34.450 align:middle line:90%
My purpose is to be both.

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:39.540 align:middle line:84%
So I can be both spiritual
and material and enjoy life.

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>> How long do you
think that was?

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>> I have no idea.

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Almost two hours.

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:48.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:52.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Most people think that there
is a difference between being

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:56.470 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual person in this
lifetime and having fun.

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:58.590 align:middle line:10%
But actually, the
message that Stephen gets

00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:00.065 align:middle line:10%
is that he can be both.

00:29:00.065 --> 00:29:05.580 align:middle line:90%


00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been two weeks since
my session with Lisbeth.

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:10.980 align:middle line:10%
And the connection I
had with my dad's soul

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:15.270 align:middle line:10%
has really, really made
my life and understanding

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.610 align:middle line:10%
of my childhood much easier.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:21.750 align:middle line:84%
It landed in my heart,
as we say in Denmark.

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:23.620 align:middle line:90%
So that was very, very nice.

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:25.500 align:middle line:90%
Also, the rally car--

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.690 align:middle line:84%
it's come more to
my attention that I

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:30.180 align:middle line:84%
need to spend more
time with it and really

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.920 align:middle line:84%
go for it because
it's a long urging,

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:35.700 align:middle line:84%
a longtime wish I
have about doing that.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.220 align:middle line:84%
After that session, it's
more integrated in me

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:39.520 align:middle line:90%
that I can do that.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.690 align:middle line:90%
I can be both.

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:42.690 align:middle line:84%
I can write a book
about it, and I

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:45.900 align:middle line:84%
can do lectures, talks
about spirituality,

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.040 align:middle line:84%
and also have my
business on the side.

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And after that session,
it's more, like,

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.890 align:middle line:90%
centered or grounded in me.

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, Lisbeth, I definitely
had a journey into my soul.

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very
excited and thrilled

00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:00.150 align:middle line:84%
about what's going
to come and what's

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:02.670 align:middle line:84%
going to happen in my
life, writing the book,

00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:07.200 align:middle line:84%
and driving the rally car,
and experience all that.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:27.000 align:middle line:90%
