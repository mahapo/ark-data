00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:17.804 align:middle line:10%
>> I finally found the love that
I had searched for all my life.

00:00:17.804 --> 00:00:22.805 align:middle line:10%
And I felt so goddamn betrayed
when it didn't show up.

00:00:22.805 --> 00:00:25.470 align:middle line:10%


00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.765 align:middle line:10%
Having an affair with a
damned woman, his stupid ass.

00:00:29.765 --> 00:00:32.540 align:middle line:90%

00:00:35.998 --> 00:00:54.800 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.970 align:middle line:84%
Born San Rafael,
California, 1946.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.750 align:middle line:84%
So I'm 76 now, and it feels
like a really long life.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Having goals when you're
this age are more daily goals

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.180 align:middle line:90%
as opposed to long-term.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.930 align:middle line:84%
So my goal today is to
be here and be open.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:28.780 align:middle line:90%
And I just see where this goes.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Reading "Journey of Souls" by
Michael Newton had a profound

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.640 align:middle line:90%
effect on me.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.870 align:middle line:84%
When I was reading the book, I
just let myself fall into it.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.170 align:middle line:90%
I went into this altered state.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.350 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.330 align:middle line:90%
This is where you need to be.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.220 align:middle line:90%
This is what you want.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:53.110 align:middle line:84%
This is the culmination of all
of the spiritual searching.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.890 align:middle line:84%
It's finally coming
together here.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.340 align:middle line:84%
I chose to be in this
body, living this life,

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.870 align:middle line:84%
having the children that I had,
the marriages that I've had,

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.460 align:middle line:84%
all these twists and
turns and curiosity,

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.610 align:middle line:84%
listening to my
intuition and wondering

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.710 align:middle line:90%
where it's going to go.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.120 align:middle line:90%
I got really excited about it.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered if maybe there
was somebody around here

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.420 align:middle line:90%
that could do this.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.860 align:middle line:84%
So I found Diana Paque, and she
is in the Bay Area where I live.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.500 align:middle line:90%
So I called right away.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.450 align:middle line:90%
Got a session with her.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And it all fell into place,
and it all felt right.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And my body said, yes,
this is a progression,

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.730 align:middle line:84%
and this is how
you're going to do it.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.780 align:middle line:84%
If I've chosen this life,
I chose all the hard stuff,

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.220 align:middle line:90%
all the pain.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.320 align:middle line:90%
I was divorced twice.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.150 align:middle line:84%
What was the contract that
I had with my first husband?

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.470 align:middle line:84%
The contract was to have
three children by him.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.270 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.720 align:middle line:90%
Now, I understand that.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.550 align:middle line:84%
I am interested in seeing
where we go with this.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Diana and I have talked
about some intentions

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.670 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to start with,
but it's all up in the air.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
it's going to go.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm really excited
to see what kind of things

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.380 align:middle line:90%
are going to show up.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.545 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:03:18.545 --> 00:03:26.832 align:middle line:90%

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Dr. Diana Paque, and
I am the executive director

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.600 align:middle line:84%
of the Michael Newton Institute
for Life Between Lives

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.990 align:middle line:90%
Hypnotherapy.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:54.070 align:middle line:10%
We were founded by Dr.
Michael Newton in about 2005,

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.580 align:middle line:10%
as an adjunct to the
work that he had started

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.740 align:middle line:10%
in the '60s, doing
psychotherapy.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And he found in doing
past life regression

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.450 align:middle line:84%
work that his clients
were finishing their lives

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.700 align:middle line:84%
and going through
a death sequence

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.490 align:middle line:84%
in between lives,
where they found

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.220 align:middle line:90%
all sorts of new information.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.700 align:middle line:84%
They were able to see
themselves as a soul

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.850 align:middle line:84%
instead of within an
individual incarnation,

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.040 align:middle line:84%
and that gave them a
different viewpoint

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.820 align:middle line:84%
and helped them expand
upon their understanding

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.600 align:middle line:84%
of themselves in this lifetime,
the questions that they had,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.790 align:middle line:84%
why they were on the
journeys they were,

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.830 align:middle line:90%
and the people they were with.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.230 align:middle line:84%
So his work was
pioneering in this field.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.720 align:middle line:10%
"Journey of Souls" is
Michael Newton's first book,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.370 align:middle line:10%
based on about 7,000 cases.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.840 align:middle line:84%
So his intention was showing
universal experiences

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.060 align:middle line:84%
that were experienced
by many and that

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.870 align:middle line:84%
may be supportive of learning
more about you in this lifetime.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And since 2005, there have
been many people trained

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.590 align:middle line:84%
as Newton facilitators, who do
past life and life between lives

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.720 align:middle line:84%
regressions, and
they are worldwide.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.340 align:middle line:10%
We currently have about
225 facilitators worldwide.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Michael intended the training
to help facilitators build

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.310 align:middle line:84%
on their knowledge of
hypnotherapy, of past life

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.450 align:middle line:84%
regression, of all of these
client-centered practices,

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.470 align:middle line:84%
to help the client move beyond
their individual incarnation

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.550 align:middle line:84%
and body into the soul work,
where we are connected,

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:84%
our soul is connected
to consciousness.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And from that
perspective, you're

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.440 align:middle line:84%
able to see yourself
in different lights

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.840 align:middle line:84%
and different bodies
and different times,

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.620 align:middle line:84%
and explore yourself in the
infinite that each of us

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.645 align:middle line:90%
is as a soul.

00:05:52.645 --> 00:05:56.670 align:middle line:90%


00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.220 align:middle line:84%
When we come into
a body as a child,

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.660 align:middle line:84%
we see ourselves as that body
in this incarnation, when

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.920 align:middle line:84%
in fact, the body is simply
a manifestation of the soul.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And the soul is the
whole of who we are.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Michael's work mirrors the
statement from Teilhard de

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Chardin, "We are spiritual
beings having a human

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.840 align:middle line:84%
experience, not a human being
seeking a spiritual experience."

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.370 align:middle line:84%
Our primary experience is as
a human being in this body,

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:28.860 align:middle line:90%
in this incarnation.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Clients come seeking answers
to questions in this lifetime

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.440 align:middle line:84%
and ask the question,
why am I here?

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.240 align:middle line:90%
Why am I doing this?

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.790 align:middle line:90%
What does this all matter?

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.080 align:middle line:90%
Why is my life so hard?

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And this work can lead
them to understand

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.160 align:middle line:84%
the journey of the soul through
many lifetimes and many lessons

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.840 align:middle line:84%
for the soul to achieve
perfect alignment with love

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.290 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.380 align:middle line:90%
You picked your parents.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.130 align:middle line:90%
You picked this life.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.090 align:middle line:90%
You picked the lessons.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.430 align:middle line:84%
There's nobody but you who's
responsible for the choices

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.550 align:middle line:90%
you're making.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.973 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:10.973 --> 00:07:18.310 align:middle line:90%


00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Good to see you.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>> When Marti arrives, we will
go back into my office where we

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.420 align:middle line:84%
work, settle her in,
so she's comfortable,

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.320 align:middle line:84%
and then review the paperwork
that we have from previous

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.700 align:middle line:84%
sessions and review her
intentions for this coming

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.870 align:middle line:90%
session.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.140 align:middle line:84%
It's important to get
Marti into a place

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.380 align:middle line:84%
where she feels
comfortable, she's trusting,

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.105 align:middle line:84%
and she is ready to move
ahead with her session.

00:07:48.105 --> 00:07:52.240 align:middle line:90%


00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.490 align:middle line:84%
So we've done a past
life regression.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And we've done a second past
life, and between lives.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're here to do a
continuation of this journey

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:14.380 align:middle line:84%
today and to see where we go,
and to see what we uncover.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.620 align:middle line:84%
We're doing something
slightly different

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.650 align:middle line:84%
because we've been through
the past life and the

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.280 align:middle line:90%
between life aspects.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:28.330 align:middle line:84%
So this time we're going to do
what I call a quantum journey.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.230 align:middle line:84%
So this is approaching
everything a little bit

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.780 align:middle line:84%
differently than we've
done in the past.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:38.100 align:middle line:84%
I think what I did last time
when we went between lives,

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.440 align:middle line:84%
I took you up to
the clouds and then

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.870 align:middle line:90%
had you move into a past life.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:47.190 align:middle line:84%
So this time we're going to go
up and then simply expand out

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:48.920 align:middle line:84%
into the fullness
of consciousness.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:49.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Goody.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So we start with
something very easy.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:57.610 align:middle line:84%
We start with the stored
consciousness of Marti.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And so we'll invite
ages of Marti

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.640 align:middle line:84%
to come and speak and
share their wisdom

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.580 align:middle line:84%
and share their truth and
share what they need--

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:10.200 align:middle line:84%
whatever ages of you are needing
to speak or have something

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.550 align:middle line:84%
to share or have something
that they want to engage.

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:18.240 align:middle line:84%
So we move from that
stored consciousness

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.540 align:middle line:84%
into the next realm,
alternate consciousness.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:28.120 align:middle line:84%
There may have been times when
Marti made a different decision.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:33.120 align:middle line:84%
So let's say that you had
decided not to become a nurse.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.490 align:middle line:84%
You decided to become an artist
or you'd stayed a dancer.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.130 align:middle line:84%
What would that Marti's
life have look like?

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.970 align:middle line:90%
What would she have learned?

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:44.590 align:middle line:84%
You may find that
things pop up or not.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.510 align:middle line:84%
If they don't pop
up, we just go on.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.010 align:middle line:90%
So it isn't everything.

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:50.640 align:middle line:84%
I give you the opportunity,
but if it doesn't show up,

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.900 align:middle line:84%
we just go on to
where the wisdom is.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:57.030 align:middle line:84%
So don't feel you have
to concoct something

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.030 align:middle line:90%
if it doesn't show up.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:02.280 align:middle line:84%
But alternate Martis, to
get to those other yous who

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.350 align:middle line:84%
are entangled with
you, who may have made

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.360 align:middle line:90%
a different choice than you.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And see what would have happened
if I hadn't gone to college?

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.100 align:middle line:84%
What would have happened
if I didn't get married?

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.710 align:middle line:90%
See what comes up.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And then we move from there
into connection with eternal

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:21.990 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.370 align:middle line:90%
And we simply then expand.

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:28.440 align:middle line:84%
We're inviting all of
these yous to come along,

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:33.400 align:middle line:84%
all of these Martis to
come along and be with you.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And what is it that your
connection is giving you?

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.240 align:middle line:90%
What are you finding?

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.820 align:middle line:84%
One thing that we want
to do in this journey

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.950 align:middle line:84%
is we want to set an
intention for the journey.

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:48.840 align:middle line:84%
So as we're going out and out
and out into consciousness,

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:53.950 align:middle line:84%
we want to bring it back into
and what does this mean to you?

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:56.190 align:middle line:84%
How does this relate
to your intention.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:57.000 align:middle line:90%
So we go out.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:57.800 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.600 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.600 align:middle line:90%
Tell me more.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.560 align:middle line:90%
Tell me more.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And how does this
relate to the intention?

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:10.420 align:middle line:84%
What would you say the
intention is for our work today?

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.390 align:middle line:90%
Where do I go from here?

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:15.270 align:middle line:90%


00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:18.690 align:middle line:90%
What's the next journey?

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm wondering if my
journeys, past, present,

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.810 align:middle line:84%
the work I've been doing
with you is going to take me

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:32.200 align:middle line:90%
somewhere.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'm questioning now as
to what do I need to do next?

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.390 align:middle line:90%
Where do we go from here?

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:43.710 align:middle line:90%
Where do we go from here?

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:47.460 align:middle line:84%
>> How can I do this to
the best of my ability?

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And here's the one that I
have absolutely no idea how

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:51.750 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.495 align:middle line:84%
How do I share it
with my children?

00:11:53.495 --> 00:11:56.050 align:middle line:90%


00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think we've
got our intention.

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:01.490 align:middle line:84%
>> That's good because I sure
had no idea what it was going

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:01.960 align:middle line:90%
to be.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Me either.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:03.860 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.740 align:middle line:84%
Once Marti is settled,
I will take her

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.040 align:middle line:84%
into a state of relaxation
that will move her

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:14.850 align:middle line:84%
into a soul state of
connection to consciousness.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.670 align:middle line:90%
This is the most exciting part.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:21.210 align:middle line:84%
As a facilitator, I never
know where the client's going.

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:26.210 align:middle line:84%
It is so thrilling to have a
client experience something

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:31.370 align:middle line:84%
that they had never known, that
they had never even thought,

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:36.050 align:middle line:84%
to have them release pain
that they've been holding

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:43.610 align:middle line:84%
for years, to uncover love
that they hadn't known,

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:45.250 align:middle line:90%
and to come away calm.

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:49.760 align:middle line:90%


00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And so let me know what
ages of Marti appear.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.680 align:middle line:90%


00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.690 align:middle line:10%
>> 1, 2.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>> 21.

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:04.660 align:middle line:84%
So how does 21-year-old
Marti present?

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:09.550 align:middle line:10%
>> In that year, I married John.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Marti went first to age
21, which was a pivotal point

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.840 align:middle line:84%
for her, where she had to
make the decision of whether

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:21.010 align:middle line:84%
to choose to be married and have
children or to stay on her own

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:22.710 align:middle line:90%
path to being a dancer.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I thought I'd
had the brass ring.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:28.540 align:middle line:84%
I was going to marry this
wonderful man who was going

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.120 align:middle line:90%
to take care of me for life.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.280 align:middle line:90%
Give me an identity.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:37.780 align:middle line:10%
>> You could have
been so much more.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:42.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Completely different life.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Does she have regret?

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:50.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Is there anything that
current Marti can give

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:54.280 align:middle line:10%
to the 21-year-old Marti?

00:13:54.280 --> 00:14:00.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Sweetie, you did what
you thought was right.

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:03.040 align:middle line:10%
You couldn't have done
anything different.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.710 align:middle line:10%
You were looking for
someone to take care of you

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:10.180 align:middle line:10%
and to give you the
babies you wanted.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:16.940 align:middle line:10%
You were good enough
just like that.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:21.130 align:middle line:10%
I've always felt
like such a failure.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:25.150 align:middle line:10%
The 21-year-old feels
like I've failed.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:29.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Marti's 21-year-old self felt
like she had made choices that

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.950 align:middle line:90%
were not the best choices.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:34.900 align:middle line:84%
So my job was to help her
76-year-old self help her young

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:35.770 align:middle line:90%
self.

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:39.460 align:middle line:84%
So is she willing to accept
love and healing from you,

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.340 align:middle line:90%
from your 76-year-old self?

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.790 align:middle line:10%
>> You, sweetie girl.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:45.670 align:middle line:10%
Come here.

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:48.730 align:middle line:10%
It's OK.

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:50.440 align:middle line:10%
It's really OK.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.620 align:middle line:90%
It felt reassuring.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.500 align:middle line:90%
It felt loving.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:03.040 align:middle line:10%
It felt [BREATHES IN] to
be able to take that in.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.000 align:middle line:10%
Oh, gosh.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:04.800 align:middle line:10%
Come on, kid.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.250 align:middle line:10%
We got a journey to go on.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:07.190 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's invite
her to come along.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering if there are
any other ages of Marti who

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:20.300 align:middle line:84%
would like to come and share,
now that 21-year-old Marti has

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.250 align:middle line:90%
broken the ice.

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:24.500 align:middle line:10%
>> I think 40-year-old Marti.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.850 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:30.380 align:middle line:10%
>> That was a kind of
a defining birthday.

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:36.290 align:middle line:10%
And I was beginning to explore
life as a single woman.

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:43.160 align:middle line:84%
The child in me was given
license to open up and explore.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.720 align:middle line:90%
She was pretty outrageous.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.370 align:middle line:90%
And she had lots of fun.

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And what did she really
want or did she know?

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:52.550 align:middle line:10%
>> It's at that time that
I went back to school.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.880 align:middle line:10%
I enrolled at Lone
Mountain as a dance major

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.960 align:middle line:10%
to finish my bachelor's degree.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.770 align:middle line:84%
At 40, she had a
different perspective.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:04.220 align:middle line:84%
She was now looking at
dance therapy as a major

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:10.430 align:middle line:84%
and ran into obstacles when her
school closed and felt betrayed.

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:15.710 align:middle line:84%
What can you, current Marti,
share with 40-year-old Marti?

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:19.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Girl, I see tenacity in you.

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.780 align:middle line:10%
I see a strength
and a conviction.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:23.970 align:middle line:10%
And you were incredible.

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:26.120 align:middle line:10%
You did some fabulous things.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.510 align:middle line:10%
You had this wonderful
body that you never

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:33.090 align:middle line:10%
allowed to deteriorate.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:36.260 align:middle line:10%
You've always worked your
body ever since then.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.030 align:middle line:10%
And you took care of your kids.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.180 align:middle line:10%
And you did a goddamn good job.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.100 align:middle line:10%


00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.700 align:middle line:10%
Honey, I'm proud of you.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.310 align:middle line:10%
I'm really proud of you.

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm wondering if there are
any other ages of Marti who have

00:16:54.230 --> 00:17:01.520 align:middle line:84%
something to share,
some wisdom, some pain.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.490 align:middle line:10%
>> What's coming to
me is marrying Wayne.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.770 align:middle line:90%


00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:09.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell me more about that.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:16.589 align:middle line:10%
I was so convinced that I
was the good Christian girl,

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:21.089 align:middle line:10%
that I was going to
love this Christian man,

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:25.920 align:middle line:10%
and I would just be so
grateful that I finally found

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:33.392 align:middle line:10%
the love that I had
searched for all my life.

00:17:33.392 --> 00:17:38.210 align:middle line:10%
And I felt so goddamned
betrayed when it didn't show up.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.890 align:middle line:10%


00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:46.770 align:middle line:10%
Having an affair with a
damned woman, his stupid ass.

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:48.623 align:middle line:10%
How could you be so damn stupid?

00:17:48.623 --> 00:17:51.218 align:middle line:10%


00:17:51.218 --> 00:17:53.080 align:middle line:10%
Oh, because he didn't
know any better.

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:53.990 align:middle line:10%
He rationalized it.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.790 align:middle line:10%
Blah, blah, blah.

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:56.580 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't matter.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.310 align:middle line:10%
But damn it, it hurt.

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:03.600 align:middle line:10%
And the worst of it was,
he never apologized, ever.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:08.880 align:middle line:10%
No idea the pain he caused
me, even after I told him.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So what can current
Marti tell this Marti,

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:18.520 align:middle line:84%
who is in so much pain and so
frustrated and so betrayed?

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:26.440 align:middle line:10%
>> You will come to a day
when you will forgive him

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:32.200 align:middle line:10%
and yourself because
it wasn't your fault,

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.660 align:middle line:10%
No matter what you think.

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.620 align:middle line:10%
It's all going to be fine.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.140 align:middle line:10%
You're going to find
out how strong you are.

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.330 align:middle line:10%
You're going to find out all
kinds of things about yourself.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.410 align:middle line:90%
There's strength and character.

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:48.310 align:middle line:84%
There's strength in me
as a woman in this world.

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:51.090 align:middle line:90%
And damn it.

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.130 align:middle line:90%
It's about time.

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:55.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Your pain was your gift.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And we invite her to join us
in this journey of discovery.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.420 align:middle line:10%
>> It's like being on a bicycle
and going down a hill full

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.860 align:middle line:10%
speed.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.740 align:middle line:10%
And the rush from that.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:13.230 align:middle line:84%
I began to feel this
enormous sense of not feeling

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:18.330 align:middle line:84%
so constricted, that there
was a freedom in my life

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:21.340 align:middle line:84%
that I hadn't really
experienced before.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's exhilarating, like
riding a bike down a hill when

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.970 align:middle line:90%
you're a little kid.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:31.395 align:middle line:84%
>> And so we want to
invite all of these Martis,

00:19:31.395 --> 00:19:36.540 align:middle line:84%
and notice a Marti who's made a
different decision than current

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:37.740 align:middle line:90%
Marti.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.770 align:middle line:10%
>> She's very, very old.

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:43.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Very old.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:54.710 align:middle line:10%
>> She's touching me with
her hand, on my heart.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.550 align:middle line:10%
>> How does she feel to you?

00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:00.020 align:middle line:10%
What do you feel
from her benevolence?

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:07.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Pure, unadulterated
Benevolence.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:11.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Is she a version
that you're--

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.380 align:middle line:84%
an incarnation of your soul from
another time, another place?

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.250 align:middle line:10%
She's a soul from another time.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>> She's from another
time and another place.

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:23.310 align:middle line:90%
And she's here with you now.

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:24.530 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:26.710 align:middle line:10%
And she's not a human.

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:27.510 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:31.050 align:middle line:90%
What wisdom does she have?

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:31.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Trust.

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:35.220 align:middle line:90%


00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.590 align:middle line:10%
It will evolve.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:39.780 align:middle line:90%


00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:43.410 align:middle line:10%
No rush.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.800 align:middle line:10%
Don't worry about it.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.730 align:middle line:84%
>> She went into a realm of
interdimensional consciousness,

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:51.860 align:middle line:84%
where she was not
in a human body,

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:54.890 align:middle line:84%
but it was a time other
than this current time,

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:57.810 align:middle line:84%
that was here to share
its wisdom with her.

00:20:57.810 --> 00:20:59.810 align:middle line:10%
>> It's all going
to be OK, kiddo.

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:01.290 align:middle line:90%
I've got you.

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:02.960 align:middle line:90%
I've always had you.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.120 align:middle line:84%
I'll continue to
always have you.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And there was just this
completely open trust.

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Did she have any awareness of
your choice to move into human

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:16.760 align:middle line:90%
form?

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:20.930 align:middle line:10%
>> It was all about
finding real love.

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:26.720 align:middle line:10%
And that I became human, so
I could follow that journey

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.830 align:middle line:10%
of the life I've had as Marti.

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:33.020 align:middle line:10%
It was all to find this.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.960 align:middle line:84%
I was looking for love
in all the wrong places.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:36.870 align:middle line:90%
It's here.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:37.800 align:middle line:90%
It's now.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.670 align:middle line:90%
It's in me.

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:40.980 align:middle line:90%
It has always been there.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.470 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't have
the eyes to see.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:46.260 align:middle line:84%
But in this life,
if this was going

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.540 align:middle line:84%
to be the time when I was
finally going to find it,

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.220 align:middle line:90%
I was finally going to see it.

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:54.660 align:middle line:10%
Keep on the path.

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:56.400 align:middle line:10%
What path?

00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Are they seeking answers
to this question of the path?

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.590 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:04.330 align:middle line:10%
Nobody seems to care.

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:05.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Nobody seems to be.

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:08.640 align:middle line:10%
This seems to be a current
Marti issue, not a--

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.790 align:middle line:10%
>> No, they don't care.

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:11.080 align:middle line:10%
It's not a soul quest.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.200 align:middle line:10%
The soul knows where
the soul lives.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So they have comfort with
it while current Marti doesn't.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:19.570 align:middle line:10%
>> That's the truth.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Stay on the path is the
messaging Marti is getting.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And she's learning through
the process of this journey

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:29.220 align:middle line:84%
that it's about her
incarnation as Marti that

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.740 align:middle line:84%
is having a difficult
time staying focused

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.020 align:middle line:84%
on the direction
in this lifetime,

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:37.020 align:middle line:84%
not her soul that is totally
comfortable with the path

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:38.060 align:middle line:90%
that it's on.

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Got to be the good girl.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Got to be on the right
path, doing the right thing,

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.580 align:middle line:84%
of looking right, saying the
right stuff, appearing like you

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.130 align:middle line:90%
know what you're talking about.

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:55.340 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And the path is
unpredictable, unknown.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind
of the scary part.

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:59.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm not used to living that way.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.420 align:middle line:10%
I feel ready to move on.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's thank them and ask
them if they have any further

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:12.560 align:middle line:90%
guidance for Marti's intention.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:16.660 align:middle line:10%
>> This journey goes on and on.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.380 align:middle line:10%
>> It didn't start with Marti.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:20.260 align:middle line:10%
>> No, it sure as hell didn't.

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:22.510 align:middle line:10%
It's an old, old, ancient.

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:23.770 align:middle line:10%
It's everything.

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:25.380 align:middle line:10%
It's all.

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.460 align:middle line:10%
It is all.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:31.660 align:middle line:10%
>> You can support her in
trusting as she moves along her

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.370 align:middle line:10%
path.

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.910 align:middle line:10%
>> By being.

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:36.990 align:middle line:10%
It's simple.

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:39.980 align:middle line:10%
Just be.

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:41.930 align:middle line:10%
Just be.

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:45.870 align:middle line:10%
Oh, my god, I don't have to
be the 'Good Girl' anymore.

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:48.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Nope, you can just be you.

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:52.590 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing about being
a good girl or a good boy

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:55.370 align:middle line:84%
is about self-judgment
and self-love.

00:23:55.370 --> 00:24:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Am I good enough is something
that is, as Marti was finding,

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:02.170 align:middle line:90%
was a waste of time.

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:05.190 align:middle line:84%
It's basically irrelevant
to the journey.

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:10.350 align:middle line:10%
>> To let go of being the good
girl and doing the right thing

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:17.820 align:middle line:10%
and saying the right
thing and I'm too old.

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:18.790 align:middle line:10%
It's tiring.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.310 align:middle line:10%
It's exhausting.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:24.240 align:middle line:10%
I feel like I'm
ready to move on.

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So remembering and holding
all of this loving energy within

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:30.570 align:middle line:90%
your physical body.

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing that you
need to do to prove anything.

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:38.340 align:middle line:84%
You're simply
making choices that

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:44.400 align:middle line:84%
will support you on the path
that your soul is moving along.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Humans spend a
lot of time doing.

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:50.720 align:middle line:90%
The soul is intent on being.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:54.840 align:middle line:84%
This is a journey about
connecting with the being self,

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.070 align:middle line:90%
not the doing self.

00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And what we found
was it didn't really

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:05.020 align:middle line:84%
matter what she did
as much as who she is.

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Being is where the truth is.

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.020 align:middle line:90%
Being is where the love is.

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And I've spent all my
life doing whatever

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:19.090 align:middle line:84%
it was that I thought I needed
to do in order to get love.

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And all along, it was a
matter of, wait a minute,

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.920 align:middle line:90%
it's here right now.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Her intention was to find
out how to be on her path,

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:36.220 align:middle line:84%
how to know how to heal,
and be there for others.

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And the answer she got was about
being simply be your soul self.

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:44.090 align:middle line:90%
Be true to yourself.

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And if you're true
to yourself, you

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.590 align:middle line:84%
don't have to work
at doing for others.

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:51.370 align:middle line:90%
You simply are.

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:52.485 align:middle line:90%
>> What a journey.

00:25:52.485 --> 00:25:57.910 align:middle line:90%


00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:00.070 align:middle line:90%
I had a journey into my soul.

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And I found out there's
nothing I have to do.

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:08.690 align:middle line:90%
Just be.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:14.180 align:middle line:84%
>> This is about learning about
you and all the aspects of you.

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:16.140 align:middle line:84%
What is it you want
to know about you?

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.840 align:middle line:90%
What is it that drives you?

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And doing this work takes
you into a different realm,

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.280 align:middle line:84%
into a different
perspective that

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.760 align:middle line:84%
gives you some new
ahas about yourself

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.910 align:middle line:84%
and opens up a whole
new line of inquiry

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:34.180 align:middle line:84%
for you and about
the world around you.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:39.480 align:middle line:90%


00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:42.480 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been two weeks since
my session with Dr. Diana,

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.930 align:middle line:84%
and I feel absolutely
incredible.

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:52.500 align:middle line:84%
This was my third
session with her

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.050 align:middle line:84%
and probably the one
with the most changes

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:57.060 align:middle line:90%
that I have ever seen.

00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have this sense of peace
and love, and I feel balanced.

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:05.500 align:middle line:84%
In the session that
I did with Diana,

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:15.260 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I'd been looking
for love in all the wrong places

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.470 align:middle line:90%
all of my life.

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that the
love I was searching for

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:25.870 align:middle line:90%
had been within me all along.

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:29.830 align:middle line:90%
I am more than enough.

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And I can receive
the love for myself.

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:40.480 align:middle line:84%
If you have questions about
who you are, why you're here,

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:45.420 align:middle line:84%
