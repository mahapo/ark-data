My name is Marcela.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.745 align:middle line:84%
I'm 39 years old, and I
live in Zagreb, Croatia.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Croatia is a very
religious country.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.120 align:middle line:84%
I bumped up with some
seriously issues for me,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.320 align:middle line:84%
because, always, it was like,
the God will punish you.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.520 align:middle line:90%
You need to be good.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.360 align:middle line:90%
You need to do this or that.

And especially
because I was a girl,

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.810 align:middle line:84%
I need to be some
person that I was not.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And I started
questioning everything.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.980 align:middle line:84%
I had some thoughts in my
early age that God is love.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.520 align:middle line:90%
God is not punishing us.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.320 align:middle line:90%
God is good.

God is great.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And everybody was like,
no, you need to do this.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.790 align:middle line:90%
You need to behave like this.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.490 align:middle line:84%
If you don't do this,
you will go to hell.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.930 align:middle line:84%
There is a saying in
Croatia, [SPEAKING CROATIAN]

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.264 align:middle line:84%
That means God will punish
you if you don't behave.

I was so frightened.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.420 align:middle line:90%
I have anxiety.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And when you live in fear and
when you live in fear of god,

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.800 align:middle line:84%
it is really hard to live your
full life to be at your best.

journey, five years.

myself, to believe in myself,

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.930 align:middle line:90%
and to regain my faith.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.670 align:middle line:84%
I was really mad at God
because I was asking,

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.220 align:middle line:84%
all the time, myself, OK,
[SPEAKING CROATIAN] God

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.140 align:middle line:90%
punished me, but why?

do anything wrong,

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.140 align:middle line:84%
but I still have some
issues, big issues,

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.560 align:middle line:84%
to trust in the process in life,
to be happy, healthy person,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.690 align:middle line:90%

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.350 align:middle line:84%
I was at the bookstore and I
was looking some information.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And I found a book from Joe
Dispenza, "You Are the Placebo,"

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.060 align:middle line:90%
and that was it for me.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And I went on one of
his retreats in Zagreb,

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.240 align:middle line:90%
and I met Petra.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.750 align:middle line:84%
I was working in the press with
Petra on healing my trauma.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And then with working on my
healing journey, I had a tumor.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And now I want to
go a step further.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.610 align:middle line:84%
I want to work in a life
between live session

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.140 align:middle line:84%
to know more about my
purpose, to get rid

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.420 align:middle line:84%
of my anxiety, my fears,
and to go deep inside me

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.400 align:middle line:84%
and to find out who am
I and who I want to be.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.290 align:middle line:90%
I rise up like a Phoenix.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.550 align:middle line:90%

a beautiful process

My life was pretty much filled
with a lot of challenges

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.670 align:middle line:84%
and traumas, and that's
what actually brought me

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.620 align:middle line:84%
into this field and
into doing this work.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.600 align:middle line:84%
One of my biggest challenges
was to understand and accept

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.600 align:middle line:84%
that I'm worthy of love and
that I'm safe here and now.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.160 align:middle line:84%
You see, my father was never
accepting me as a girl,

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.220 align:middle line:84%
and my parents divorced
when I was young.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And that really left
a big mark on me

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.140 align:middle line:84%
because I was always searching
for the love outside.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:21.470 align:middle line:10%
And that really pushed
me into trying to heal

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.210 align:middle line:10%
the root cause of my problems.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.020 align:middle line:84%
One day, I found about
hypnosis and the importance

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.550 align:middle line:84%
of working with
subconscious mind

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.820 align:middle line:84%
because all root
causes of the problems

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.220 align:middle line:84%
are lying in our
subconscious minds.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.630 align:middle line:84%
I was blessed to receive
Michael Newton's book,

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.070 align:middle line:90%
"Journey of Souls."

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And that brought
me a huge relief

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.380 align:middle line:84%
and it opened a huge
new world to me.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.220 align:middle line:84%

the work that he does.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Only after I had my own
life between life session,

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.630 align:middle line:84%
I really deeply understood
my purpose and why am I

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:06.600 align:middle line:90%
actually here.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And I understood why am I
feeling this feeling of need

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.850 align:middle line:84%
to help humanity and the
planet since I was so young.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.510 align:middle line:84%
I finally managed to heal the
root causes of my problems,

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.500 align:middle line:84%
and I was ready to offer
that gift to the world.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.620 align:middle line:84%
Along the way, I became
skilled enough so

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.010 align:middle line:84%
that I am now teaching
other therapists how to do

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.850 align:middle line:90%
life between life sessions.

that's why I'm so passionate.

I met Marcela several years
ago when she asked me for help

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.480 align:middle line:84%
when she was dealing with
trauma that was coming up

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.780 align:middle line:90%
to the surface for her.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.180 align:middle line:84%
We had a beautiful
healing session.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.810 align:middle line:84%
I really loved working
with her because she's

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.770 align:middle line:84%
so dedicated to her
healing and she's aware

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.900 align:middle line:84%
that healing is not something
that you do just once

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.200 align:middle line:90%
and then you're done.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.750 align:middle line:84%
It's something
that is a journey.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.840 align:middle line:84%

for today's session.

that I'm having challenges is

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.090 align:middle line:90%
that I'm not feeling worthy--

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:10.250 align:middle line:84%
worthy of love, health,
wealth, abundance, and maybe--

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.050 align:middle line:90%
not maybe.

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:15.110 align:middle line:84%
For sure, that God doesn't
love me and he's punishing me.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I will not
say it right in English,

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:24.280 align:middle line:84%
and I really want to say it in
Croatian, [SPEAKING CROATIAN]

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:29.230 align:middle line:84%
It's something like a
curse when people tell you

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:32.260 align:middle line:84%
that God will give you
something and take it away

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.860 align:middle line:90%
because you were not good.

myself to be happy

if I will be happy,

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:49.540 align:middle line:84%
if I will be enjoying my

doesn't make any sense,

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.520 align:middle line:90%
but I'm living like that.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.770 align:middle line:84%
When I go deep inside,
I really believe

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.190 align:middle line:90%
that, that he is looking.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:05.140 align:middle line:90%
And why is he?

So always, some alpha male
checking on me, and he's like,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.730 align:middle line:90%
OK, you're not good enough.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:13.610 align:middle line:90%
You need to do this.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:14.870 align:middle line:90%
Why did you do that?

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:15.960 align:middle line:90%
Why did you do this?

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.120 align:middle line:90%
You don't deserve happiness.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.110 align:middle line:90%
I don't love you.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.510 align:middle line:84%
You need to be like this,
this, this and this,

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:25.670 align:middle line:84%
and maybe then I will
give you a chance.

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you recall anyone in this
life telling you anything about

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.550 align:middle line:84%
it in school or
your parents or--

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.735 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we live in
Croatia, so everybody.

00:09:34.735 --> 00:09:36.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>> True.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have this way of life
that we need to be victims

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.280 align:middle line:90%
and living in fear.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:49.350 align:middle line:84%
So if you want me to name
one person, it is my parents.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:50.450 align:middle line:90%
It is my grandparents.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.830 align:middle line:90%
It is my friends, everybody.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.560 align:middle line:84%
If you laugh today,
you will cry tomorrow.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.160 align:middle line:84%
If you don't-- if you
don't behave like this,

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.400 align:middle line:90%
God will punish you.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.010 align:middle line:90%
It's like a saying.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:04.490 align:middle line:84%
If I now turn over this
cup, you will say to me,

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.420 align:middle line:90%
oh, that is God punishing you.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.020 align:middle line:90%
So yes, everybody.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.130 align:middle line:90%
I was abused when I was a child.

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think that,
everything, when

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.470 align:middle line:84%
we go to the core of my
being, we go to that moment

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:21.740 align:middle line:84%
when I say, OK, god,
where are you now?

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.230 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't you stop this?

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Why do you allow these things,
not only to me, to everybody?

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:28.820 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And always, we go back
to not being loved

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.650 align:middle line:90%
and to God punishing me.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why I
have these issues,

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.160 align:middle line:90%
but it really bothers me.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.270 align:middle line:90%
>> We'll find out today.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, we will.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Even when I'm not afraid,
I'm saying that I'm afraid.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:48.890 align:middle line:90%
I cannot--

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So you identified
so much with--

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, who would I be if I
wouldn't be an anxious person?

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though we made
some kind of plan.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:58.580 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Your soul, your body, and
your subconscious mind know

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.000 align:middle line:90%
where we need to go today.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.940 align:middle line:84%
So whatever happens,
wherever it takes us,

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.530 align:middle line:84%
it's perfect journey
for you today.

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:08.820 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>> But first, we manage
to get you to feel safe.

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Then we manage to get you
to start loving yourself.

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Unless we love ourselves,
we cannot feel deserving

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.920 align:middle line:90%
of anything good in our lives.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And now it's time to start
reconnecting with universe,

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.290 align:middle line:84%
with God, and clearing that
belief that's not supporting you

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.650 align:middle line:84%
so that you can finally allow
all that love and happiness

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.785 align:middle line:90%
and joy to come into your life.

00:11:35.785 --> 00:11:43.785 align:middle line:90%


00:11:43.785 --> 00:11:47.590 align:middle line:84%
So you can tell me what is your
body experiencing right now.

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:50.770 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm feeling like
I'm going to cry.

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:53.740 align:middle line:10%
I'm a little bit frightened.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:59.620 align:middle line:10%
I'm afraid of my feelings
and what will we find.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.830 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so first of all, I want
you to remember that your body

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.830 align:middle line:84%
is so wise and that
you are in control.

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:08.260 align:middle line:90%
You decide where you want to go.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have to go anywhere
where you're not ready to go.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.240 align:middle line:90%
And have any memories come up?

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, so what's coming up?

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:24.010 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm scared of my body
sensations and my feelings.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.010 align:middle line:10%
I'm so scared right now.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:29.110 align:middle line:10%
>> So what do you feel
that would help you?

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:30.470 align:middle line:10%
>> I just want to run away.

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:31.850 align:middle line:10%
It's like I'm--

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:36.200 align:middle line:10%
I'm feeling so dizzy like I'm
on a carousel, spinning around.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you want to open
your eyes for a moment,

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.050 align:middle line:90%
it's perfectly fine.

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:43.100 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm here.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.770 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:46.570 align:middle line:10%
It's OK.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:47.130 align:middle line:10%
>> I can't do this.

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:47.930 align:middle line:10%
>> It's OK.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:49.980 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm so afraid right now.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:50.780 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm here.

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.430 align:middle line:90%
You're not alone.

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And you've been through
so many situations.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.710 align:middle line:84%
I really had this deep sense
that whatever needs to happen,

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:03.023 align:middle line:90%
it will happen today.

00:13:03.023 --> 00:13:05.190 align:middle line:84%
So even though she'll be
freaking out for two hours,

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:07.150 align:middle line:84%
that's exactly what
people need to see.

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:12.480 align:middle line:10%
>> What if we cannot do this
session and if I fail again?

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, there is no such
thing as a failure.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:17.490 align:middle line:84%
There's no such
thing as a mistake.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:19.510 align:middle line:90%
It's just an experience.

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:23.726 align:middle line:10%
>> But I'm so afraid
of my body sensations.

00:13:23.726 --> 00:13:27.300 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, so let's be with your
body sensations for start.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.520 align:middle line:10%
So what are you afraid of?

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:34.380 align:middle line:10%
>> That I will die or lose
control or that something bad is

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.666 align:middle line:10%
going to happen to me.

00:13:36.666 --> 00:13:40.932 align:middle line:10%
I have never felt
anything like this.

00:13:40.932 --> 00:13:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Remember you can open
your eyes whenever you want.

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can allow
your body to shake.

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:48.200 align:middle line:84%
What it's doing is simply
releasing something,

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.950 align:middle line:84%
and it's bringing to
the surface something

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:51.720 align:middle line:90%
that it is ready to let go.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.690 align:middle line:84%
We have to allow ourselves
to have all feelings.

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:56.940 align:middle line:10%
Otherwise, we just continue
looping in the feeling

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.950 align:middle line:10%
that we want to
avoid, and that's

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:01.560 align:middle line:10%
what makes situation worse.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.730 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm afraid to release it
because I'm afraid what will it

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:10.250 align:middle line:10%
do to me, to my body, to my
mind, to my life, you know.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so I want you to remember
that it already lives inside

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:18.845 align:middle line:84%
you, so releasing it, yeah,
will actually set you free.

00:14:18.845 --> 00:14:21.530 align:middle line:90%


00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:25.100 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's focus on breathing
now for a few moments, OK?

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Feeling every part
of your being.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:31.670 align:middle line:90%
Feeling so safe.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:34.010 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't want to feel safe.

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:38.630 align:middle line:10%
I don't believe in safe
because safe is not--

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:39.860 align:middle line:10%
it's not real.

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:40.830 align:middle line:10%
It's not real.

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:46.700 align:middle line:10%
That's just something that
people made up just to use you.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:50.990 align:middle line:10%
Like your parents, "You're
safe with us," but you're not.

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>> She cannot relax and be safe
because that person used her

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.370 align:middle line:90%
trust and hurt her.

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And that was the person that
was supposed to be there for her

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.500 align:middle line:84%
and take care of her when
she was a little child.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.110 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm looking at my abuser.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:10.460 align:middle line:10%
I'm angry.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.440 align:middle line:10%
That's the feeling.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.380 align:middle line:10%
I'm angry.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.210 align:middle line:10%
>> And tell me, how old are you?

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:15.870 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm 12.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:20.860 align:middle line:84%
When I gave myself permission
to feel, it's when I got angry.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And I really like this angry
child, because, in my home,

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:30.900 align:middle line:84%
we kids did not have
permission to be angry.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:37.440 align:middle line:10%
My dog is standing on
the front of the door.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.710 align:middle line:10%
It's early in the
morning, and she's just

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:43.180 align:middle line:10%
standing over there frightened.

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:47.160 align:middle line:10%
And she looks at me and
she's right now saying,

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.210 align:middle line:10%
you know we were wolves.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:50.280 align:middle line:10%
Come on, Marcela.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.930 align:middle line:10%
We are the wolves.

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:54.110 align:middle line:10%
Let's tear him up.

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:55.130 align:middle line:10%
You can do it.

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:56.880 align:middle line:10%
And I'm just standing.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.090 align:middle line:10%
And I cannot move my body.

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:05.610 align:middle line:10%
I'm fighting and I'm screaming.

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:09.510 align:middle line:10%
And I'm saying to God,
where are you now?

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:11.560 align:middle line:10%
Where are you when I need you?

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.470 align:middle line:10%
What did I do wrong?

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>> She regressed into that
little girl that she was.

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this work is so
important that we heal those--

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:24.820 align:middle line:84%
hurt part of us and
that we learn everything

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.350 align:middle line:90%
is happening for a reason.

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:29.560 align:middle line:10%
OK, so first, let's focus on
little Marcela first and then--

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Little Marcela is
feeling like that.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, yeah, and
you, as the big one,

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:38.650 align:middle line:84%
I want you to tell her that you
are here now as this grown-up

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:40.690 align:middle line:90%
adult person.

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:43.600 align:middle line:84%
Ask her what does she need
from you in this moment.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.200 align:middle line:10%
>> She says I need my wolf back.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I used this
Gestalt technique,

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:52.390 align:middle line:84%
inviting the adult Marcela
to ask the little one,

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:54.470 align:middle line:84%
what does she need
in this moment.

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And usually, the little one
would say, I need to feel safe

00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.830 align:middle line:90%
or I need to feel loved.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:01.100 align:middle line:90%
I need you to hug me.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.450 align:middle line:90%
I need you to love me.

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:05.510 align:middle line:84%
But the little one said,
I need my wolf back.

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:06.829 align:middle line:90%
>> I need my wolf back.

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:09.490 align:middle line:84%
The strong part of me
that is not standing,

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:12.220 align:middle line:84%
dissociated when
somebody attacks.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:15.200 align:middle line:84%
If you attack me,
please bring me my wolf

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:19.150 align:middle line:90%
back so I can be alive.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:24.670 align:middle line:10%
And now I can see just
like pictures flashing.

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:28.180 align:middle line:10%
We are not wolves but we
are thinking like wolves

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:32.500 align:middle line:10%
and we are going through
the forest and rivers.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.840 align:middle line:10%
And it's changing so fast.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.690 align:middle line:10%
And some tribe.

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:43.070 align:middle line:10%
And I just see myself as
like a chief, I think.

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:44.210 align:middle line:10%
Yes, I am a chief.

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:46.000 align:middle line:10%
I am male.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.970 align:middle line:10%
And I'm so manly man.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:54.850 align:middle line:10%
I'm beautiful, dark
skin, with long hair.

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.950 align:middle line:10%
>> So by what name
do they call you?

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:57.910 align:middle line:10%
>> Hana.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Hana, OK.

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Without me even
guiding her anywhere,

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.020 align:middle line:84%
she just ends up
in a past life as

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:11.890 align:middle line:84%
this strong, beautiful,
dark-skinned man with a wolf

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:13.010 align:middle line:90%
hairdressing.

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:16.070 align:middle line:84%
This will be interesting because
now she is experiencing herself

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.870 align:middle line:90%
as a man.

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And she's really having
issues with men in his life.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.030 align:middle line:90%
So let's see what lies here.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle line:10%
>> The fire is over there.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.180 align:middle line:10%
And the women over there.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.240 align:middle line:10%
And I'm thinking
they're all mine.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:35.370 align:middle line:90%


00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Hana is somebody
that I really don't

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.580 align:middle line:84%
want to be because I have
resentments towards men.

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:43.560 align:middle line:10%
I have so much children.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.230 align:middle line:10%
There are so many of them.

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:49.530 align:middle line:10%
I'm disgusted about this man.

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.070 align:middle line:10%
He's so beautiful.

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:52.720 align:middle line:10%
He's so powerful.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.060 align:middle line:10%
He's living with the wolves.

00:18:55.060 --> 00:19:00.090 align:middle line:10%
He's such a gentle, gentle soul.

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:03.640 align:middle line:10%
But he needs to be
like the alpha male.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.910 align:middle line:10%
And I really don't
like to be this person.

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:10.320 align:middle line:10%
This wolf embodied this Hana.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.610 align:middle line:10%
And it's saying to me like,
OK, you cannot act like that,

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:15.830 align:middle line:10%
like human.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.940 align:middle line:10%
You're not a wolf anymore.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.850 align:middle line:10%
It's so hard for me
because right now, I'm

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:22.410 align:middle line:10%
just three persons.

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:25.200 align:middle line:10%
A little Marcela-- four--

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.150 align:middle line:10%
wolf and Hana and me right now.

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:32.470 align:middle line:10%
And these images are
four parallel lives,

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:35.920 align:middle line:10%
and they're communicating
with each other.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Four parallel lives
where I didn't want

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:41.780 align:middle line:90%
to accept the bad parts of it.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:49.750 align:middle line:10%
Wolf is trying to tell me, just
take the good parts about being

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.850 align:middle line:10%
a wolf, but please be human.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:55.510 align:middle line:10%
Don't be like your abuser.

00:19:55.510 --> 00:20:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>> She is playing the role of
someone who is abusing other

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:05.710 align:middle line:84%
people, other women, in a way
that she has been abused in this

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:06.510 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:09.440 align:middle line:10%
>> I was also abuser.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:16.000 align:middle line:10%
And now I am more prone to think
that God is really punishing me

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.360 align:middle line:10%
now because I was
like that before,

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.850 align:middle line:10%
and that this is the karma.

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so just take a
deep breath in and out.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.030 align:middle line:84%
It's so great to see
how, as the souls we are,

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:30.110 align:middle line:90%
we choose different experiences.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:32.680 align:middle line:84%
We choose to be a bad
guy and a good guy

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:36.280 align:middle line:84%
so that we could learn
both sides of the coin

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.210 align:middle line:84%
because there is
no right or wrong.

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:39.700 align:middle line:90%
It's just an experience.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:43.270 align:middle line:84%
We have all been all
those different--

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:45.860 align:middle line:84%
in all those different
roles, let's say that way.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm going to count
for you from three to one.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And when I say one,
you'll just move

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.350 align:middle line:84%
to some other significant
scene in that life as Hana.

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:56.860 align:middle line:90%
3, 2, 1, and be there now.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:00.375 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm tearing apart the wolves.

00:21:00.375 --> 00:21:05.860 align:middle line:10%
Right now, I'm feeling
so much pain over here.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.040 align:middle line:10%
I'm having knife.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.980 align:middle line:10%
I don't know how to
say it in English.

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.658 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING CROATIAN]

00:21:11.658 --> 00:21:15.100 align:middle line:90%


00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.545 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so you're placing
a knife into the--

00:21:17.545 --> 00:21:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>> And it really
hurts right now.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>> --wolf's body, and you
feel the wolf's pain, OK.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:25.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, because
now I have that--

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:34.040 align:middle line:10%
knowing that I am that wolf,
I'm really mad at men, at God.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.860 align:middle line:10%
Why is God even a man?

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:39.410 align:middle line:10%
Why are we always
talking about angels?

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:42.100 align:middle line:10%
They're all men in Croatian.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.730 align:middle line:90%
They're angeli.

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:45.970 align:middle line:90%
It's angel.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:50.110 align:middle line:10%
Where are the females here?

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:51.500 align:middle line:10%
Let us live.

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:52.820 align:middle line:10%
Let us be.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:56.740 align:middle line:10%
And when I say that
with such anger,

00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:00.250 align:middle line:10%
and I'm talking to God
who looks-- of course,

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:03.470 align:middle line:10%
he looks like a manly man.

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:07.390 align:middle line:10%
He's looking like
Zeus, like a Greek god.

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:11.290 align:middle line:10%
And now I'm in ancient Greece.

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:14.980 align:middle line:10%
I don't know who am
I. I am a female.

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:17.140 align:middle line:10%
I have a white toga.

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:24.640 align:middle line:10%
And I'm standing with my
arms are in this blood.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>> She immediately falls
into some other life.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, OK, so
we have a third life now.

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And now I really need to be
super focused because there's

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:34.930 align:middle line:90%
so much information coming.

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to put
the dots together.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.260 align:middle line:90%
So now she's not a guy anymore.

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.280 align:middle line:84%
She's this beautiful
woman killing somebody

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.387 align:middle line:90%
in ancient Greece.

00:22:44.387 --> 00:22:45.720 align:middle line:90%
Do you have blood on your hands?

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.180 align:middle line:10%
>> I have blood on my hands.

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.960 align:middle line:10%
Zeus is over there
and he's saying,

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.330 align:middle line:10%
you're going to
pay for your sins.

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:53.830 align:middle line:10%
>> So what did you do?

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:55.120 align:middle line:10%
>> I killed a man.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.170 align:middle line:10%
I'm having a knife.

00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:03.070 align:middle line:10%
I'm standing and I'm having
the knife in my hands.

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:06.190 align:middle line:10%
And we are in the temple.

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:06.990 align:middle line:90%
>> It's OK.

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:07.630 align:middle line:90%
Tell me more.

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:08.480 align:middle line:90%
So what's happening?

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.980 align:middle line:10%
He's laying somewhere,
you're having

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:11.230 align:middle line:10%
a knife in your hand, and--

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:15.070 align:middle line:10%
>> And I'm stabbing him,
but in some ritual way,

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:16.870 align:middle line:10%
like I'm releasing--

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:19.340 align:middle line:10%
and I'm stabbing him right now.

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:24.570 align:middle line:10%
And I said, and now you
are free and I am free.

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:29.490 align:middle line:10%
And I'm letting go the knives
and my hands are crimson.

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:31.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Crimson, OK.

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:35.210 align:middle line:10%
>> And I said, oh, my
god, I killed a God.

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:37.803 align:middle line:10%
OK, I have to hug myself.

00:23:37.803 --> 00:23:38.720 align:middle line:10%
- OK, so hug yourself.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:43.520 align:middle line:10%
- Because I'm so
powerful and I don't want

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.370 align:middle line:10%
to be a victim anymore.

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:47.580 align:middle line:90%
OK, it's enough.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:50.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to be
a victim anymore.

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:54.650 align:middle line:84%
I have my own hands,
my own feet, my mind,

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:58.350 align:middle line:84%
and I don't need anybody
to boss me around.

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:01.140 align:middle line:84%
I can take care of
myself, my life,

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:04.280 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to end
right now, right here.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Who is this man
that you just killed?

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:08.000 align:middle line:10%
>> It's Zeus's son.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Zeus's Son?

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.450 align:middle line:90%
>> I think so.

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:13.040 align:middle line:10%
I was his muse.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.330 align:middle line:10%
He wanted to use my
intellect like a weapon.

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:22.260 align:middle line:10%
Using my abilities
to conquer the world.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:25.390 align:middle line:10%
When I see myself
standing like this

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:29.080 align:middle line:10%
and he's laying like
this and he's alive.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:36.340 align:middle line:10%
He's looking at me, and in his
eyes, I can see the approval.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:40.570 align:middle line:10%
Zeus is over there and
he's like a stone now--

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:41.510 align:middle line:10%
like a stone.

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:47.830 align:middle line:10%
And he's looking at me and
he's saying, you're so powerful

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:51.410 align:middle line:10%
and I need to demolish you.

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:54.310 align:middle line:10%
And I'm saying, I am a goddess.

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:56.060 align:middle line:10%
You cannot kill me.

00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:00.310 align:middle line:10%
And he's saying, of course,
I can't but I'm Zeus,

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:04.900 align:middle line:10%
and you will suffer
forever in every life

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.950 align:middle line:10%
because you killed my son.

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:14.770 align:middle line:10%
I'm looking at him and
saying, daddy, please love me.

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:16.850 align:middle line:10%
And now I have epiphany.

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:19.930 align:middle line:10%
I killed my brother.

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:24.368 align:middle line:10%
And that's why he didn't
kill me because I--

00:25:24.368 --> 00:25:25.410 align:middle line:10%
>> You were his daughter.

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:26.637 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:26.637 --> 00:25:27.690 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God.

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:29.100 align:middle line:90%
He's my brother.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And I sacrificed my
brother for a greater good.

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was like,
what is done is done.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to pay for my
sins but it's worth it.

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:40.790 align:middle line:84%
>> She takes the belief
and carries it in all other

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.690 align:middle line:90%
existences, in all other lives.

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:44.910 align:middle line:90%
She needs to suffer slowly.

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:48.050 align:middle line:84%
She needs to have panic
attacks all the time,

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:50.420 align:middle line:84%
that she needs to feel
anxious all the time,

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:53.270 align:middle line:84%
that she doesn't
deserve to be living

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:58.020 align:middle line:84%
an abundant, flowing, happy life
because she needs to suffer.

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:01.700 align:middle line:84%
So I knew, OK, this is something
we really need to work on.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.215 align:middle line:10%
>> Now I'm--

00:26:03.215 --> 00:26:07.610 align:middle line:10%
I just slide to my other life.

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:11.990 align:middle line:10%
And I'm a wolf again,
but not the same wolf.

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:16.640 align:middle line:10%
No, I'm a person again
but I have the coat

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.420 align:middle line:10%
that it's so much colors.

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my God, really?

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Why are all these lives
being shown to us?

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Because I know I have to
trust the higher wisdom.

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:28.190 align:middle line:84%
I know I have to trust
the information the way

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:29.130 align:middle line:90%
they're coming.

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:31.160 align:middle line:84%
But for my human
mind, this is really

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.710 align:middle line:84%
starting to feel
overwhelming because there's

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:35.220 align:middle line:90%
so much information.

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:36.650 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm so ugly.

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:38.100 align:middle line:10%
I'm so ugly.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:44.000 align:middle line:10%
And I was trying to be more
beautiful by tattooing myself

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.820 align:middle line:10%
with this coat.

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:49.430 align:middle line:10%
I have long hair again.

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:50.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Are you male or female?

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:51.600 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't know.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.780 align:middle line:10%
I'm an outcast.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.730 align:middle line:10%
>> What tells you that
you're an outcast?

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:58.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Because I live alone.

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:01.410 align:middle line:90%
She talks to nature, to animals.

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:02.430 align:middle line:90%
They are one.

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:04.770 align:middle line:90%
And she never felt lonely.

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:09.360 align:middle line:10%
I think that I'm an outcast
just because I'm being ugly.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So who kicked you out
and who pushed you away?

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:14.890 align:middle line:10%
>> My mom.

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:18.160 align:middle line:10%
I'm at this scene and
she's telling to some--

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:23.820 align:middle line:10%
we need to send her away because
she's not looking like a woman,

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.010 align:middle line:10%
and they will kill her.

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:27.570 align:middle line:10%
>> So why would they kill you?

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:32.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Because they are afraid that
I'm something supernatural.

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:34.500 align:middle line:10%
but in a bad way.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.030 align:middle line:10%
That I will harm them.

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:39.900 align:middle line:10%
And because the children
are going to be afraid of me

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.820 align:middle line:10%
because I'm really small.

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>> She was living with this
deep feeling of being unworthy,

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:52.050 align:middle line:84%
which, again, she's carrying
as a soul in other existences,

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:54.050 align:middle line:90%
including this life as Marcela.

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>> She was full of
wrinkles like a tree.

00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:00.580 align:middle line:90%
She was so old.

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:03.280 align:middle line:10%
Now I'm living in a cave.

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:07.780 align:middle line:10%
And I was always looking
at my back with this cane,

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:11.020 align:middle line:10%
and I'm like, but
I'm beautiful inside.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.030 align:middle line:10%
I'm so beautiful inside.

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:14.850 align:middle line:10%
Nature loves me.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:20.680 align:middle line:10%
And now seeing this, I die.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.280 align:middle line:90%
>> We had so many lives.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I had to lift
her above all those lives

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.980 align:middle line:84%
so that we can get into that
expanded state of consciousness

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:32.320 align:middle line:84%
to finally start understanding
what's the pattern

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.050 align:middle line:84%
and why are all those
lives being shown to her.

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:36.910 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm just seeing lights.

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:43.270 align:middle line:10%
Thousands, millions of small
lights gathered together.

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:48.400 align:middle line:10%
And they are giving me some--

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:54.070 align:middle line:10%
at the same time,
protection, cleaning.

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:57.700 align:middle line:10%
They're telling me,
it's going to be OK.

00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.980 align:middle line:10%
You're OK.

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.140 align:middle line:10%
Be you.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:05.560 align:middle line:10%
Isn't that beautiful?

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.150 align:middle line:90%
I was not in this body at all.

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:09.770 align:middle line:90%
I was in the universe.

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:13.360 align:middle line:90%
I felt so calm and safe.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So what I want you to do now
is I want you to allow yourself

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:19.150 align:middle line:84%
to be moved to some
place of higher wisdom,

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:22.450 align:middle line:84%
where you can get more
answers to your questions.

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:23.740 align:middle line:90%
Just be there now.

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:27.460 align:middle line:10%
>> It's like I'm in a
black hole or something.

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't look at a
black hole the same way

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:34.360 align:middle line:84%
like I did before because
when I was in a black hole,

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:37.780 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing the whole
universe and nothing was Black.

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:40.580 align:middle line:10%
Stars, but they're not stars.

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:41.540 align:middle line:10%
They look like stars.

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:42.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Like lights.

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Like lights, yes.

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.320 align:middle line:10%
And--

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.420 align:middle line:10%
>> How many lights
do you notice?

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.030 align:middle line:10%
>> I cannot count them.

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:48.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Too many.

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:51.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Too many, like sand.

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:53.110 align:middle line:10%
>> I understand.

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:55.450 align:middle line:10%
>> And they're going like this.

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:56.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Like synchronized.

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:58.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Synchronized like this.

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:03.085 align:middle line:10%
And they're saying
to me, come with us.

00:30:03.085 --> 00:30:04.570 align:middle line:10%
Come with us.

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:05.960 align:middle line:10%
>> So what do you do then?

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.570 align:middle line:10%
>> No, I'm not going.

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:09.040 align:middle line:10%
I'm stubborn.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.470 align:middle line:10%
>> So why don't you want to go?

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:12.880 align:middle line:10%
>> I like it here.

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.190 align:middle line:84%
I didn't like my
stubbornness there

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:17.380 align:middle line:90%
because I was like, come on.

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.320 align:middle line:90%
Beg me.

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.180 align:middle line:90%
Make me to come.

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.450 align:middle line:90%
You need me.

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:22.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't need you.

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:23.270 align:middle line:90%
You need me.

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:25.400 align:middle line:90%
And that was my ego.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.240 align:middle line:90%
Why do I need them to love me?

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't need them.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.680 align:middle line:90%
They don't need me.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.620 align:middle line:90%
So it was epiphany.

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>> What's keeping you
from not joining them?

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:38.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Because I'm
scared what's next.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you tell them
that, what do they tell you?

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:46.350 align:middle line:10%
>> It's like murmur you
know when there are thousand

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:47.150 align:middle line:10%
of voices.

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:53.030 align:middle line:10%
So I'm hearing, you can
talk to God about it.

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:56.620 align:middle line:10%
And I'm telling, well,
aren't we all that God?

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:58.690 align:middle line:10%
We are all one.

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:01.600 align:middle line:10%
And the other light
says to me, yes,

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.970 align:middle line:10%
but that's your inner conflict.

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:09.380 align:middle line:10%
You cannot go in
this place with that.

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:12.730 align:middle line:10%
You need to let it go because
it's going to weight you

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:14.590 align:middle line:10%
in your another life.

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:17.890 align:middle line:10%
And I'm telling them, well,
that's OK because I want to be

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:21.520 align:middle line:10%
a tree in another life, please.

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.230 align:middle line:10%
Can I be a tree?

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:27.580 align:middle line:84%
I tend to think that trees
are the most beautiful living

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:29.030 align:middle line:90%
beings on Earth.

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:32.720 align:middle line:84%
They give us strength and
wisdom and everything.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:36.850 align:middle line:10%
And somebody says, well, you
can be whatever you want.

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:40.600 align:middle line:10%
You need to let go of your mind.

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.000 align:middle line:10%
Just be.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.280 align:middle line:10%
It's like saying
[SPEAKING CROATIAN],,

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.960 align:middle line:10%
so give yourself a break.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:48.760 align:middle line:10%
>> A break.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.580 align:middle line:90%
Part of her wants to enjoy life.

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Part of her wants to
be abundant, be happy.

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And then there is
other part of her

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:58.770 align:middle line:84%
that says, no,
no, it's not safe.

00:31:58.770 --> 00:31:59.820 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to go there.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.450 align:middle line:10%
>> It's like I'm holding
a rock but it's not rock.

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:04.390 align:middle line:10%
And I really don't
want to put that--

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:05.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Put it away.

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:07.350 align:middle line:10%
>> No, no, I don't want to.

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:11.160 align:middle line:10%
It's like a reminder
that who are you.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:11.960 align:middle line:10%
Reminder--

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:12.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Of who you are.

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:14.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Who you are.

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:17.090 align:middle line:10%
And it's all of my sins.

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:22.550 align:middle line:10%
And it's all of my baggage.

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:25.820 align:middle line:10%
OK, I will hurt my daughter.

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:30.670 align:middle line:10%
I don't think she's safe with
me because I have anxiety

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:33.650 align:middle line:10%
and I'm broken, like I said.

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:40.110 align:middle line:10%
This rock is a reminder of
my past, how broken am I.

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:47.480 align:middle line:10%
And if I let that rock go, maybe
I will choose the wrong life.

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.860 align:middle line:90%
Look what you did in your life.

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot put that rock
down and go to the universe

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:59.040 align:middle line:84%
and become another
soul or person,

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.650 align:middle line:84%
because, if you
don't have that rock,

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:04.790 align:middle line:84%
you don't have a reminder
how bad you could be.

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:09.600 align:middle line:10%
From this point of view, it's
not God that's punishing me.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.080 align:middle line:10%
It's me.

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>> There are so many humans
still thinking that God will

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:16.750 align:middle line:84%
punish us if we do
something wrong,

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:19.260 align:middle line:90%
but this is so much deeper.

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:23.900 align:middle line:10%
>> When I was a wolf, I was
trying to be something else.

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:28.820 align:middle line:10%
When I was Hana, I was abusing
or wanted to abuse women.

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:34.770 align:middle line:10%
When I was that ugly person,
I didn't stood up for myself.

00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:38.660 align:middle line:10%
When I killed my brother, it
was like, OK, you did something

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:44.270 align:middle line:10%
good, you did, but it had so
much consequences on the world

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:47.070 align:middle line:10%
so you failed again.

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:51.510 align:middle line:10%
So you need to carry all
these memories or feelings.

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:52.590 align:middle line:10%
It's not like memories.

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:58.400 align:middle line:10%
It's like feelings and reminders
but deep, deep inside my body.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:06.320 align:middle line:10%
You had a control over your
life by conditioning yourself

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.480 align:middle line:10%
that you are not good enough.

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>> People also think that we
humans are imperfect but we

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:13.500 align:middle line:90%
as souls are super perfect.

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:14.400 align:middle line:90%
No, we're not.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.690 align:middle line:84%
We as souls are also
imperfect because we are here

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:19.699 align:middle line:84%
in this human
bodies in this life,

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:21.870 align:middle line:90%
learning like kids in school.

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And just like kids in
school aren't perfect,

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:26.260 align:middle line:90%
they are still worthy of love.

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:28.260 align:middle line:90%
So help me understand.

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:32.159 align:middle line:84%
If you would let
that rock down, you

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:34.260 align:middle line:84%
are afraid that you
would hurt again?

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:40.290 align:middle line:10%
If I let this go, what
if my true essence is

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:43.929 align:middle line:10%
that I am a bad person and I
will choose to be, I don't know,

00:34:43.929 --> 00:34:47.760 align:middle line:10%
a serial killer
and I will like it?

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.010 align:middle line:10%
If I keep this rock,
I will stay here

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:53.730 align:middle line:10%
and I will be me here
forever and ever.

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:58.440 align:middle line:10%
They are telling me, but
you can't feel loved.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:04.770 align:middle line:10%
You cannot go through
so frightened about,

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:09.030 align:middle line:10%
are you going to get hurt or
are you going to hurt somebody?

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:10.964 align:middle line:10%
It's like hell.

00:35:10.964 --> 00:35:15.490 align:middle line:10%
Something so close to me
and I can be part of that,

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:17.290 align:middle line:10%
but I'm grounded.

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:18.540 align:middle line:90%
That's my hell.

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:21.400 align:middle line:90%
Not to be able to live life--

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.020 align:middle line:90%
to live my full potential.

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.860 align:middle line:90%
That's the meaning of the rock.

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:28.290 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, so who grounded you?

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:29.132 align:middle line:90%
>> It's me.

00:35:29.132 --> 00:35:30.215 align:middle line:90%
>> So you ground yourself.

00:35:30.215 --> 00:35:33.900 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what do light
say about that?

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:39.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Stop believing in the
truth that is not true.

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>> It was just her belief
that she was blaming.

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:44.500 align:middle line:90%
She made that belief her truth.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:50.040 align:middle line:84%
She finally allows them to
help her release the rock.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:54.690 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, I don't need
to take this anymore.

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:56.080 align:middle line:10%
Let them take that.

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.250 align:middle line:10%
And they are taking it.

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:04.280 align:middle line:10%
But I have just a thin
layer on my hands,

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:07.970 align:middle line:10%
and it's like silver-ish.

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:10.760 align:middle line:10%
And I'm looking at this
and I'm saying, well,

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.060 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to keep this.

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:15.560 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to keep this
because I like me.

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:16.880 align:middle line:10%
I'm silver-ish.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:17.870 align:middle line:10%
I'm not good.

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:18.720 align:middle line:10%
I'm not bad.

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:19.730 align:middle line:10%
I'm me.

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Something silver
stays on her hands.

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And she realizes that
she has a silver lining

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:29.510 align:middle line:84%
of all the trauma she went
through as a soul and as Marcela

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:31.340 align:middle line:90%
in this life.

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:34.970 align:middle line:84%
Ask your higher
wisdom, your guides,

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:38.360 align:middle line:84%
how can you live your
purpose without the need

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:43.600 align:middle line:84%
to continue panic
attacks and fears?

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:48.490 align:middle line:10%
>> The path is not that I wait
to get rid of anxiety and panic

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:49.810 align:middle line:10%
attacks.

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:54.100 align:middle line:10%
My path is that I
need to go within.

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:57.770 align:middle line:10%
To go to the forest to
connect with nature.

00:36:57.770 --> 00:37:00.920 align:middle line:10%
And now I know
that with Hana, who

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:07.180 align:middle line:10%
was so grounded and so
powerful and with wolves.

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:10.700 align:middle line:10%
We are not wolves but we
are thinking like wolves.

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.730 align:middle line:10%
Everything takes me to nature.

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:16.190 align:middle line:10%
And nature is your savior.

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:18.200 align:middle line:10%
You need to go
back to your roots.

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:22.260 align:middle line:10%
Your wolf, it's the ocean, it's
the forest, it's the mountain.

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:25.030 align:middle line:10%
That's where I need to go.

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:27.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm not frightened anymore.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:30.220 align:middle line:90%
I can see my good and bad sides.

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And I really want to
nurture all of them.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And the bad sides really
need my love and attention.

00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it was
really a great experience

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:44.690 align:middle line:84%
because hearing all of this
coming from me, from inside me,

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:46.950 align:middle line:90%
it's a treasure.

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:50.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm so overwhelmed in a good
way right now, that I really

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:54.910 align:middle line:84%
need to process all of this
and take care of myself.

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:56.330 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:59.145 align:middle line:84%
>> How long do you
think this session was?

00:37:59.145 --> 00:38:00.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Like two hours.

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Two hours.

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:02.110 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:03.220 align:middle line:90%
Three and a half hours.

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my God.

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:05.000 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>> All those lives that were
shown to her were actually shown

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:13.580 align:middle line:84%
for her to realize how she was
pushing away and outcasting

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:16.920 align:middle line:90%
those sinful parts of her.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.980 align:middle line:84%
We need to accept
all our shadows,

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:21.770 align:middle line:84%
that we need to accept all
our parts because we are

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:23.590 align:middle line:90%
perfect just the way we are.

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:31.520 align:middle line:90%


00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.570 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been two weeks
since my session.

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And I can really say that I've
got my personal power back.

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:40.130 align:middle line:90%
I really got my wolf back.

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:43.400 align:middle line:84%
I get rid of anxiety
and panic attacks.

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And when they occur,
I'm not so afraid

00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:50.030 align:middle line:84%
anymore because I know now
that the power is within me.

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:53.480 align:middle line:84%
I've released the narrative
that God will punish me.

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And I can say that it is
some great perspective for me

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.630 align:middle line:90%
right now because I'm the wolf.

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:04.440 align:middle line:84%
The power is in me and I
can do anything I want.

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not afraid to step
out and do something new.

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not afraid
anymore to share my story,

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:15.680 align:middle line:84%
to share my insights,
and to just be me.

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.800 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Petra.

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.500 align:middle line:84%
I've had journey
into my soul and I

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:23.500 align:middle line:84%
can't wait to see what's next
in this lifetime for this wolf.

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:44.000 align:middle line:90%
