don't know how to get there.

>> My name is Brighton Dunlap.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.380 align:middle line:90%
I am 28 years old.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.370 align:middle line:84%
I live in Chandler and I work in
the education technology field.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Outside of working, I am
a performer at the Arizona

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.070 align:middle line:90%
Renaissance Festival.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And I find a lot of
great joy in just kind

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.800 align:middle line:84%
of being able to
be my goofy self

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.870 align:middle line:84%
and unleash that
character out on the world

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.000 align:middle line:84%
and let other
people enjoy it too.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Aside from that, I like
to do acting, and writing,

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.230 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of art pretty
much in any medium.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.870 align:middle line:90%
I will paint.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.870 align:middle line:84%
I will find other
people's art and kind of

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.970 align:middle line:84%
cut it up and make
it into a new collage

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.900 align:middle line:84%
all of its own mixed in with
something completely new.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.170 align:middle line:84%
I spend a lot of time with
my family and my friends.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.240 align:middle line:90%
Creativity is important to me.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.900 align:middle line:84%
It has actually been one of
the most important aspects

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.150 align:middle line:84%
of healing after the loss of my
brother in 2018 and my friend

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.320 align:middle line:90%
a few months later.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's helped carry me through
the pain of my divorce as well.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And just kind of anytime
that life gets hard,

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.590 align:middle line:84%
I find that creating
is kind of what

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.680 align:middle line:84%
helps me push it through and
find the beauty in life again

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.035 align:middle line:90%
and the gratitude of being here.

00:01:57.035 --> 00:02:00.930 align:middle line:90%


00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.570 align:middle line:84%
My spiritual journey
started about 10 years ago

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.860 align:middle line:84%
and it was more
carefree back then.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.270 align:middle line:90%

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.470 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.350 align:middle line:84%
2018 is when I lost
my brother, Rick,

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.380 align:middle line:84%
due to sudden, unexpected
death in epilepsy.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And life kind of just
lost all of its meaning.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And so the spiritual journey
and, especially, the power

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.610 align:middle line:84%
of meditation and getting
to feel his energy

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.820 align:middle line:84%
or feeling close to him
again was a big proponent

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.860 align:middle line:90%
in keeping going.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.890 align:middle line:10%
And diving down the rabbit
hole a little further,

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.680 align:middle line:10%
I found "Journey of
Souls" by Michael Newton.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.350 align:middle line:10%
And as soon as I started
to hear the stories in it,

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.420 align:middle line:10%
everything really
clicked and it just

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.130 align:middle line:10%
filled me with a sense of peace
and hopefulness and love, also.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.570 align:middle line:84%
It helps reframe the loss if
you can find the growth in it

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.460 align:middle line:90%
and the reasons to be grateful.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.530 align:middle line:84%
I think my idea of hypnosis
before was the people on stage

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.220 align:middle line:84%
and the person going, and now
you will sound like a chicken

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.460 align:middle line:90%
and people were doing it.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And then hearing the case
studies from Newton's book

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.520 align:middle line:90%
was like, ohm my gosh.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole different version
of what I thought it was.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's much more
calming and you're

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.990 align:middle line:84%
the one that's in
control of the journey.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think I
didn't really expect

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.830 align:middle line:90%
that to be a big part of it.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.450 align:middle line:84%
So when I started reading
these case studies and learning

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.650 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more, we had
a family friend, Hila--

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.150 align:middle line:84%
we've actually known
Hila for over a decade--

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.290 align:middle line:84%
and I knew that she kind
of did this type of work.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her if she would be
willing to do a session with me,

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.230 align:middle line:90%
and we did.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And my first session was
actually a past life regression

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.840 align:middle line:84%
and it changed my
life after that.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're getting ready to
do a life between lives session.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited and nervous.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.800 align:middle line:84%
I feel like there's a lot of
grief and pain inside of me

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.320 align:middle line:84%
that I'm feeling
vulnerable about.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And I know that this work
always kind of brings it

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.890 align:middle line:84%
to the surface, but also
helps you look at it

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.550 align:middle line:90%
in much more healing ways.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just excited
for a lot of the pain

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.690 align:middle line:84%
and grief I've been growing
into the last couple of years

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.705 align:middle line:84%
to be reframed and
maybe let go of.

00:04:14.705 --> 00:04:24.320 align:middle line:90%

>> My name is Hila
Kedem-Ferguson and I live

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.480 align:middle line:90%
and work in Chandler, Arizona.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And I specialize in life
between lives hypnotherapy.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.290 align:middle line:10%
I was born in Israel
and raised there.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.750 align:middle line:10%
And when I was
about 16 years old,

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.700 align:middle line:10%
I got introduced to the
book "Journey of Souls"

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.190 align:middle line:10%
that absolutely changed my life.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.690 align:middle line:84%
I remember reading the book
and actually remembering

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.600 align:middle line:90%
the stories that were in there.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.220 align:middle line:90%
It truly spoke to my soul.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that one day I'll
get to meet Dr. Michael Newton.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.440 align:middle line:84%
A few years later, I've met my
husband and moved to Arizona.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And one thing led to
another and I found myself

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.200 align:middle line:84%
training in life between
lives hypnotherapy in 2011.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.540 align:middle line:84%
We were having a
big staff meeting

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.260 align:middle line:84%
and Dr. Newton was actually
present for our training.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And we got to spend a full
week of just connecting

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.390 align:middle line:84%
outside the classroom
as well as him

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.940 align:middle line:84%
always jumping in and
helping us learn more.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.900 align:middle line:84%
What's really special and unique
in life between life sessions

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.910 align:middle line:84%
is that we get to
help our clients

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.190 align:middle line:90%
remember who they really are.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.440 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.630 align:middle line:84%
This is not information
that's being told to them.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.690 align:middle line:84%
It's information that
they themselves remember.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And when you remember the
choices that you made,

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.070 align:middle line:84%
even the hard ones, you
get to live your life

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.270 align:middle line:84%
in such a way that is so much
more uplifting and so much more

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.630 align:middle line:90%
understanding.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And instead of feeling
like it happened to you,

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.550 align:middle line:84%
you start remembering that
you chose that, to grow from,

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:20.870 align:middle line:90%
to understand from.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.500 align:middle line:84%
The choice wasn't made from
this life, from this body,

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.860 align:middle line:90%
from this consciousness.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.230 align:middle line:84%
The choice was made from your
eternal soul, the being that

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.010 align:middle line:90%
is beyond your body.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I feel like
it's work that

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.480 align:middle line:90%
completely enriches your life.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.690 align:middle line:84%
It gives you not only the tools
to understand why things happen

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.000 align:middle line:84%
the way that they
did, but also give you

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.410 align:middle line:84%
the tools on how to live your
life with a lot less fear

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.580 align:middle line:90%
and a lot more want.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.500 align:middle line:90%
You want to get this done.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.360 align:middle line:84%
You want to learn
what you came here to.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.280 align:middle line:90%
You want to expand and grow.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.160 align:middle line:90%
You want to do your purpose.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And having the
ability to remember

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.860 align:middle line:84%
that we are more than just
this life and this body,

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.940 align:middle line:84%
that this is just a tiny little
speck in the eternity of who we

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.900 align:middle line:84%
are tends to put things in
a perspective for people

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.540 align:middle line:84%
that, otherwise, talk
therapy would have never

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.190 align:middle line:90%
got them to get.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Brighton has worked
with me in the past.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.700 align:middle line:84%
We've done some work around
past life regressions

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.070 align:middle line:84%
and some of the things that she
was dealing with at that moment.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And recently, she's
reached out to me again.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.960 align:middle line:84%
She's actually had some
major, major life transitions

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.920 align:middle line:90%
and things going on for her.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And so she really, really
wanted to experience

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.590 align:middle line:84%
a life between
lives session where

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:44.970 align:middle line:84%
she gets to understand truly
the reasons for these things

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.090 align:middle line:84%
and gain insight as much
as she can from them

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:51.810 align:middle line:84%
so it can help her cope
right now in her life.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:56.100 align:middle line:84%
I love this work so much
because it connects you

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:00.180 align:middle line:84%
to who you really are and
that everything that you ever

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.750 align:middle line:90%
need to know is within you.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.430 align:middle line:90%
It's not outside of you.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.390 align:middle line:90%
It's within you.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And this knowledge is
here, and it's accessible,

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.160 align:middle line:84%
and it's here to serve
you and help you.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just so beyond
grateful to be able to do this.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:22.760 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.880 align:middle line:90%
It's so good to see you.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm so happy you're here.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:25.590 align:middle line:90%

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:26.390 align:middle line:90%
Me too.

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:29.792 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'll kind of let you
start if you have any questions.

00:08:29.792 --> 00:08:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And then, again,
share a little bit

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.580 align:middle line:84%
of your intention, any
questions you might have.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Part of the biggest intention
is to feel some closeness with

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.110 align:middle line:84%
my brother, Ricky, and
also with Josephine.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:46.190 align:middle line:84%
With Ricky, the anniversary
of his death was yesterday.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:47.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's been five years.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it feels
like a whole other lifetime

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.750 align:middle line:90%
since I've seen him.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And missing him that much
is getting really heavy.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.960 align:middle line:84%
So being able to have
some space with him

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.590 align:middle line:90%
will be really rewarding.

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And then kind of the
same with Josephine.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.080 align:middle line:84%
It's been almost five
years for her too.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.900 align:middle line:84%
It feels kind of
like divine timing.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:08.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.158 align:middle line:84%
>> Felt like the
right thing there.

00:09:10.158 --> 00:09:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for sharing that.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.270 align:middle line:84%
Anything else that
you feel like you

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:15.720 align:middle line:90%
want to bring into this space?

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.140 align:middle line:90%
Anything else that's important?

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>> My divorce and the
loss of that relationship,

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:27.020 align:middle line:84%
having invested so much of
myself into building that

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.530 align:middle line:84%
relationship and kind
of imagining the future.

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And the divorce wasn't
something that I wanted.

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And even kind of
at this time, we're

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.760 align:middle line:84%
about to do the final
part of the process

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.090 align:middle line:90%
with the court hearing.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, I'm still
not really sure that it's

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:44.030 align:middle line:90%
what's best or what I want.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:46.100 align:middle line:84%
But it just kind
of felt like, given

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.730 align:middle line:84%
the circumstances, that I didn't
really have any other option.

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.840 align:middle line:84%
He just didn't want
to try anymore.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.050 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want to be
in the relationship

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:55.940 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't want
to do the work

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.987 align:middle line:84%
to try to salvage
the relationship.

00:09:57.987 --> 00:09:59.570 align:middle line:84%
But he also didn't
want to do the work

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.660 align:middle line:90%
to end the relationship.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:02.460 align:middle line:90%
>> That's hard.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And he just wanted it to
be up in the air for an amount

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:06.590 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:09.800 align:middle line:90%
And that was too hard.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.353 align:middle line:90%
Did I make it worse?

00:10:11.353 --> 00:10:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Could I have done
different things

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.200 align:middle line:84%
to have changed it
and made it better?

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm so grateful
we're doing this today.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.850 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
pieces that I feel

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:22.440 align:middle line:84%
like your soul is kind of
ready to share with you

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.210 align:middle line:84%
and for you to remember
and connect with.

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And again, I really do
believe in divine timing

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.750 align:middle line:84%
and that today is the right
moment for this to happen.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:33.750 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely beautiful.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:38.130 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything going on
physically that you want to scan

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:39.910 align:middle line:90%
or tune into?

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything going on with
your body that you want answers?

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:49.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I do seem to always be
carrying a lot in my neck

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.210 align:middle line:90%
and in my shoulders.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And I've been a lot better
with migraines lately.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.140 align:middle line:90%
I haven't had as many.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:59.740 align:middle line:84%
But still, with the tension in
the neck and shoulders, I think.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.400 align:middle line:84%
So if it comes up, we can
definitely scan that for you.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And is there anything
career wise, anything work

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.222 align:middle line:84%
wise that you feel like
you want clarity over?

00:11:08.222 --> 00:11:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>> One of those things where
you feel like you already know

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.080 align:middle line:84%
the answer, so maybe you just
need to hear it from the higher

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:13.880 align:middle line:90%
self too.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, like when is time to jump?

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.860 align:middle line:84%
I just want you to just take a
moment, just scan anything else.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:21.820 align:middle line:90%
Just take a breath.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Just notice if
there's anything else.

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:24.280 align:middle line:90%
Your soul knows.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.860 align:middle line:84%
So even if there's
not a question

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.890 align:middle line:84%
that you're bringing
up, your divine self

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:30.130 align:middle line:90%
will guide the session.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:31.618 align:middle line:84%
Your guides will
guide the session.

00:11:31.618 --> 00:11:33.660 align:middle line:84%
I always laugh, we come
with this agenda, and all

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.340 align:middle line:84%
these questions, and
all these people,

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.290 align:middle line:84%
and then they're
like, oh, by the way,

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.630 align:middle line:90%
today is all about this.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.400 align:middle line:84%
But I laugh that I'm a
lawyer and the spirit world

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.830 align:middle line:84%
and I like to get my
clients what they came for.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And so even if they're going
to focus us on something else,

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.730 align:middle line:84%
I want to be able to
be an advocate for you

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.530 align:middle line:84%
and bring in the pieces
that are important.

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:55.740 align:middle line:84%
So just again, let's
just take a little breath

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.020 align:middle line:84%
and just scan and see if
there's anything else that

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:03.750 align:middle line:84%
feels important or any other
intention you want to bring in.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.420 align:middle line:90%
>> The boundaries.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:11.430 align:middle line:84%
How do I care for people
that I do genuinely care for

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:16.020 align:middle line:84%
and show them that and help
take care of them when I can?

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And how do I know when
that line has been crossed

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and it's not time
for me to continue

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.470 align:middle line:90%
expanding my efforts there?

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So in particular, with
people and relationships?

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.650 align:middle line:90%
OK, beautiful.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And then if we can put an
intention for today-- again,

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.790 align:middle line:84%
I know we moved into
smaller intentions--

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:37.820 align:middle line:84%
but if we can put a
general intention,

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:41.980 align:middle line:84%
what would you like to
get from this journey?

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>> I would like to feel love.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I love that, sweetheart.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.760 align:middle line:90%
That's a beautiful intention.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any questions
about the process?

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I'm just excited
and ready to get going.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:59.410 align:middle line:84%
I tell my clients, these
sessions are divinely guided.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:02.230 align:middle line:90%
So if we skip a step, it's OK.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:06.520 align:middle line:84%
If you find yourself in soul
space from the safe space,

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.790 align:middle line:90%
go for it.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be here
to anchor the process,

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.410 align:middle line:84%
but you're going
to be leading it.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And so you just let me know
if something else comes up.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Everything that we do today,
it's already inside of you.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.080 align:middle line:84%
You are moving
into your memories.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.570 align:middle line:84%
So even though our
mind really like

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.030 align:middle line:84%
this journey of going out,
and floating around, and doing

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:27.910 align:middle line:84%
these things, really,
we're moving in

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:30.160 align:middle line:84%
into your beautiful
soul self that

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.670 align:middle line:84%
remembers all of these
pieces and is ready for you

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:37.970 align:middle line:84%
to encounter again, to bring it
back into your consciousness.

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.510 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
any other questions,

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:42.080 align:middle line:90%
we're going to start our ride.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.543 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:13:43.543 --> 00:13:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, my babe.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:50.860 align:middle line:90%


00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.970 align:middle line:84%
I want you to just allow
yourself to pause on that 12th

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:55.570 align:middle line:90%
step.

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And let your bubble
just guide you

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.650 align:middle line:84%
to an experience
around that time,

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:02.010 align:middle line:84%
around that age, something
that your soul feels

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:05.040 align:middle line:84%
significant for us
to connect with.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.190 align:middle line:84%
What's the first
thing that comes?

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:11.340 align:middle line:84%
We like to open up a
staircase that represent

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.220 align:middle line:90%
each year of our client's age.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And so with Brighton,
I just felt the calling

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.780 align:middle line:90%
to pause her at 12 years old.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:22.490 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm in Morgan's backyard.

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:25.210 align:middle line:10%
The whole world is in the yard.

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.650 align:middle line:10%
We can do anything.

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:31.090 align:middle line:10%
We have all this power to
create and it's just natural.

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:35.570 align:middle line:84%
It was like the whole unlimited
scope of our imaginations

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.430 align:middle line:90%
was available to us there.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Just that power to create
anything we wanted to be.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.530 align:middle line:10%
Going through the
gate in the front yard

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:44.570 align:middle line:10%
and climbing the tree.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:47.000 align:middle line:10%
Just to be brave and
jump out of the tree

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.230 align:middle line:10%
when it's time to get down.

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.930 align:middle line:10%
It's fun and it's faster.

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, you could try to
climb down the tree,

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.640 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to take
longer and you're going

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.960 align:middle line:90%
to end up getting scraped up.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And if you just
jump, it's more fun.

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.050 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's a risk,
but so is just taking

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:09.020 align:middle line:90%
the time to climb down.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.085 align:middle line:90%
Just jump.

00:15:11.085 --> 00:15:11.885 align:middle line:90%
>> Anything else?

00:15:11.885 --> 00:15:14.440 align:middle line:90%


00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:18.310 align:middle line:84%
She found herself
wanting to jump down

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:20.140 align:middle line:84%
and really talking
about being brave

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.210 align:middle line:84%
and knowing exactly when
it's time to jump down.

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And I really felt
like it was showing us

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:29.020 align:middle line:84%
a piece that would let her show
up when it comes to taking steps

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:29.830 align:middle line:90%
in her life.

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.630 align:middle line:10%
Moving into a time
in which you've

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:34.270 align:middle line:10%
lived in a different
body, connecting

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.100 align:middle line:10%
into the most
significant lifetime

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:39.380 align:middle line:10%
that your soul would
like for us to touch on,

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:42.610 align:middle line:10%
just noticing the first
thing that comes to you.

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:44.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Water.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:49.060 align:middle line:10%
My older sister is holding
me as we go across the water.

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.970 align:middle line:10%
We went to the other
side of the river.

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.590 align:middle line:10%
I'm hungry.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:55.060 align:middle line:10%
>> You're hungry.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:56.350 align:middle line:10%
>> And tired.

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:57.730 align:middle line:10%
>> And tired.

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>> There's water
rushing over me and--

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.150 align:middle line:90%
OK, at least, I'm safe.

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:03.320 align:middle line:90%
Somebody has me.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.580 align:middle line:84%
But oh, my gosh, I
have these human needs.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:06.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm hungry.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:07.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm tired.

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:08.530 align:middle line:90%
Where are we going?

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:10.810 align:middle line:10%
It's a big group
of us all going.

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:12.510 align:middle line:10%
>> So there's others?

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:13.750 align:middle line:10%
>> We're in a jungle.

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:15.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Jungle area.

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:17.100 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a
sense of your name?

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.970 align:middle line:84%
You can just hear
it being called.

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:21.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Ashan.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:24.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Ashan?

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:26.510 align:middle line:10%
>> My sister is Neema.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:28.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Neema.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Ashan, a four-year-old
boy living in the jungle.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:37.210 align:middle line:84%
The name came so easily, which
I was kind of surprised about.

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:40.040 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to make the sound.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.710 align:middle line:10%
It was water.

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:43.370 align:middle line:10%
It was bad.

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:45.110 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people got sick.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So the water was
what made people sick?

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:51.470 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:55.630 align:middle line:84%
As we just take you towards
that last day of life,

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.690 align:middle line:90%
what's coming to you?

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:00.570 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm old.

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:04.619 align:middle line:10%
And I want to die in
the woods, so I go.

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Anything that you're
reflecting on, do you want

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:08.550 align:middle line:90%
to share?

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:11.510 align:middle line:10%
>> The love of my partner.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:14.484 align:middle line:10%
Love is the strongest
energy on the Earth.

00:17:14.484 --> 00:17:17.510 align:middle line:90%


00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:20.990 align:middle line:10%
The power of it to heal.

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:26.839 align:middle line:84%
>> I was just an old man kind
of sitting in my living space

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:27.720 align:middle line:90%
by myself.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:32.060 align:middle line:84%
I remembered thinking about my
family and my wife, my partner,

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.100 align:middle line:90%
who had passed already.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:38.960 align:middle line:10%
I'm laying down,
being pulled up.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.100 align:middle line:10%
Ashan dies slowly and
takes a long time.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:50.300 align:middle line:10%
I am above, watching him leave
the body, saying goodbye.

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>> For Brighton to connect to
a life that was very connected

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:59.300 align:middle line:84%
to loss, but also moving through
that life and reaching old age

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:02.930 align:middle line:84%
and feeling so full with
love and connection,

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:07.490 align:middle line:84%
tied so beautifully to the rest
of her session and her life now,

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:08.870 align:middle line:90%
as Brighton.

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Just let me know what
happens once you do that.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.840 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm just in space.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.410 align:middle line:10%
I don't have a body anymore.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:21.260 align:middle line:10%
>> How does it feel?

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.550 align:middle line:10%
>> Warm.

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:25.310 align:middle line:84%
I was in space and
I'm looking down.

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:27.450 align:middle line:90%
And then I don't have a body.

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:29.010 align:middle line:90%
How do I move?

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:32.540 align:middle line:84%
The freedom of movement
is this and it's also

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:35.780 align:middle line:84%
hurtling through space
at the speed of light.

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:39.100 align:middle line:90%
>> What are you experiencing?

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, they're here.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Who's here?

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Everybody.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:50.180 align:middle line:10%
Rick is wanting to
show me something.

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.270 align:middle line:10%
He just, like, moves
his hand and then,

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:56.750 align:middle line:10%
like, a portal of space opens.

00:18:56.750 --> 00:19:00.930 align:middle line:10%
And I can see Earth.

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:04.100 align:middle line:10%
Any moment, any
time, any lifetime.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.440 align:middle line:84%
When my brother was showing
me, it was kind of just

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.568 align:middle line:84%
like he would move his hand in
space and this window in space

00:19:10.568 --> 00:19:12.860 align:middle line:84%
would open up and it would
be like looking through a TV

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:13.660 align:middle line:90%
screen.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And you could see the lifetime,
or inside of the thoughts,

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.330 align:middle line:90%
or inside of the feelings.

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:19.300 align:middle line:90%
It's the 12 year old.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.050 align:middle line:84%
It's the I'm in the
backyard and the world

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:24.960 align:middle line:84%
as everything I
imagine it can be.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:30.920 align:middle line:10%
We were talking and now we're
giving each other a hug.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.120 align:middle line:10%
Enjoying this
space close to him.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:33.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.462 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take all your time
you need with that, sweetie.

00:19:36.462 --> 00:19:39.470 align:middle line:90%


00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:41.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Brighton feels
like she needs help.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:46.330 align:middle line:84%
What way does Brighton
need help with?

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:50.740 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:51.700 align:middle line:90%
>> It's OK.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:53.890 align:middle line:84%
We're here to allow that
voice to come through.

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:57.010 align:middle line:84%
Let Brighton just come
through right now.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:58.950 align:middle line:84%
Bring her into the
space for a moment.

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:01.482 align:middle line:90%


00:20:01.482 --> 00:20:03.940 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't know where I'm going
and I don't know how to get

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:04.740 align:middle line:10%
there.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:08.500 align:middle line:10%
And I don't know if
I want to be there.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>> In her earthly
life as Brighton?

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:11.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:12.610 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:13.810 align:middle line:90%
Let it all in.

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:18.670 align:middle line:84%
All of that confusion and
loss, let it through right now.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, when
clients ask for help,

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:21.790 align:middle line:84%
it just means that
they're kind of feeling

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:23.665 align:middle line:84%
pulled into their
consciousness and they just

00:20:23.665 --> 00:20:24.710 align:middle line:90%
need help connecting.

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:28.810 align:middle line:84%
But she meant it in a deeper way
that Brighton, as the person,

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:31.060 align:middle line:84%
needs help to
break through this,

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.990 align:middle line:90%
to really understand what to do.

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Her future self came through
and really showed her

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.460 align:middle line:84%
what life is going to look
like past these struggles.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.500 align:middle line:90%
What are you sensing?

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.980 align:middle line:10%
>> It just feels like me.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:49.690 align:middle line:10%
It's the me that's
already been through it.

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:51.430 align:middle line:10%
>> What is she here to tell you?

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.860 align:middle line:10%
>> She's holding her hand out.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.880 align:middle line:10%
She just looks happy
and she smiles at me.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:02.890 align:middle line:10%
She said, you are ready to keep
stepping into the vulnerability.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:08.650 align:middle line:10%
She just reminded me I can look
to any moment past, present,

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:10.552 align:middle line:10%
or future.

00:21:10.552 --> 00:21:15.160 align:middle line:10%
A reminder that it can be
done and there's something

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.310 align:middle line:10%
beautiful about doing it.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.317 align:middle line:84%
I'm always wanting this
grand, ethereal being

00:21:21.317 --> 00:21:22.900 align:middle line:84%
that's going to come
help me and knows

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.650 align:middle line:90%
me better than I know myself.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:27.040 align:middle line:84%
But it turned out
that it was just

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.790 align:middle line:84%
the me who's gone through it and
that that's my greatest asset.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>> What advice does
she have for you?

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:35.175 align:middle line:10%
>> She gave me a notebook.

00:21:35.175 --> 00:21:37.870 align:middle line:10%


00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:40.930 align:middle line:10%
Like how you gave Brighton
a notebook at the beginning

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:46.360 align:middle line:10%
and told her to sit off to
the side and take notes.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Is she showing
you writing, then?

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:52.390 align:middle line:10%
>> She wasn't showing me, but I
opened the book and I thought it

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:53.300 align:middle line:10%
would be empty.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:58.090 align:middle line:10%
But then every page,
there's, like, love letters

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:00.910 align:middle line:10%
from the people I love.

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:02.230 align:middle line:10%
>> That's beautiful.

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:04.510 align:middle line:10%
>> They're all
different lifetimes.

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's a notebook
full of love letters.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Opening that journal up and
finding that it was actually

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.420 align:middle line:84%
love notes, and I
couldn't read it.

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.250 align:middle line:90%
It was all different languages.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:15.910 align:middle line:84%
All of my soul mates from all
the lifetimes over everything

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.250 align:middle line:90%
and all those different lives.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:19.430 align:middle line:90%
I asked to feel love.

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:23.420 align:middle line:90%
And that was-- yeah.

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:25.640 align:middle line:10%
I'm in a circle.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:29.310 align:middle line:10%
Everybody and their family.

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:32.375 align:middle line:10%
But they're here this time
again because they love me.

00:22:32.375 --> 00:22:35.460 align:middle line:90%


00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>> What else?

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.060 align:middle line:90%
Open up.

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.790 align:middle line:90%


00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:44.450 align:middle line:10%
>> This is exactly how it
was supposed to go with Sam.

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:46.480 align:middle line:10%
>> What's coming
to you about that?

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Just that how we were
accidentally hurting each other.

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:53.845 align:middle line:10%
And I know he didn't mean it.

00:22:53.845 --> 00:22:54.645 align:middle line:10%
It's OK.

00:22:54.645 --> 00:22:57.180 align:middle line:90%


00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.460 align:middle line:84%
If it had continued
on what it was,

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:03.930 align:middle line:84%
the hurt would have been so much
so much deeper because we're

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:08.070 align:middle line:84%
just trapped in this spot of we
don't really know who we are.

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And the ability to separate
and become who we are

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.060 align:middle line:90%
is how it was supposed to be.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Just keep expanding.

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Just notice what other
knowings are coming to you.

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.860 align:middle line:10%
>> I am love.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I want you to
really feel that.

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:30.620 align:middle line:10%
>> It's the one
thing I always feel.

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:33.380 align:middle line:10%
>> The one thing you
always feel, and that is?

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Love.

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>> She really allowed herself to
fully merge into her soul self,

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:42.950 align:middle line:84%
experiencing this expansion,
moving fully into her vibration

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:45.920 align:middle line:84%
of love, being love,
who she really is,

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.640 align:middle line:84%
that limitless spirit as well
as seeing earthly Brighton.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Is there any advice
you want to give her?

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Any time she hears
something, or sees something,

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:59.420 align:middle line:10%
or someone does something,
creates something in a moment

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:02.940 align:middle line:10%
of vulnerability that
helps someone else.

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Talking about your life and
what you've been through is

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:11.180 align:middle line:84%
a pretty big act of
vulnerability and helps give

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:15.410 align:middle line:84%
other people that moment
of security for them to go,

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:17.110 align:middle line:90%
I feel like that, too.

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:17.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's OK.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:19.490 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not alone.

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Are we still
part of that circle?

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.390 align:middle line:10%
>> We are.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:29.020 align:middle line:10%
And I was gonna say
goodbye and they were like,

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.520 align:middle line:10%
it's not a big deal.

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And I want them to help
you understand why they're

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.990 align:middle line:90%
saying it's not a big deal.

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:41.920 align:middle line:10%
>> We forget when
we're in human body.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.540 align:middle line:10%
They're always right there.

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:45.100 align:middle line:10%
They're always there.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.930 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's not really goodbye.

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not a big deal.

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:49.730 align:middle line:90%
We're here.

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:51.220 align:middle line:84%
We were here before
you showed up.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:52.730 align:middle line:84%
We're still here
after you leave.

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:56.320 align:middle line:84%
We're here waiting on your
sidelines all the time.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Since Josephine
wasn't necessarily a part

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:03.600 align:middle line:84%
of the circle, is it a good
time for us to connect to that?

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.480 align:middle line:10%
>> She's busy.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Anything else
coming with that?

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:10.330 align:middle line:10%
>> I know where to find her.

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:12.660 align:middle line:10%
>> You know where to find her?

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:17.310 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm just giving
her an energy hug.

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:18.210 align:middle line:90%
Josephine?

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:19.210 align:middle line:90%
Josephine?

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:20.800 align:middle line:90%
Like, waiting for her to come.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, she must
be busy or something.

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:26.027 align:middle line:84%
I know where to find her
if I really do need her.

00:25:26.027 --> 00:25:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I think I
just kind of felt myself

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:31.120 align:middle line:84%
traveling through space
and swirled around her

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.300 align:middle line:84%
and then went back
up to my area.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:37.250 align:middle line:10%
Feels like I'm moving
through all of space.

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:39.120 align:middle line:10%
There's just colors.

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And as you do that, I
want you to just open up

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:44.580 align:middle line:84%
to your unique
vibration and, perhaps,

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:46.770 align:middle line:84%
even allowing a name
to come through,

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:52.080 align:middle line:84%
just the closest equivalent,
who you really are.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Iahli.

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:56.470 align:middle line:10%
>> I want you to say
that again for me.

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:58.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Iahli.

00:25:58.090 --> 00:25:59.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Iahli.

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:02.360 align:middle line:90%
Souls hold unique vibrations.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And when you bring forward that
name, something really magical

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:09.220 align:middle line:84%
happens where you anchor that
little piece of the infinite you

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.090 align:middle line:90%
into the physical you.

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that means I
know better how to connect

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.590 align:middle line:84%
specifically with that
state of being love.

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:20.170 align:middle line:90%
I can call her by her name now.

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:23.410 align:middle line:10%
She's so good at feeling.

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:24.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Brightness?

00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:26.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.930 align:middle line:10%
>> She wants boundaries.

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, let's open up to that.

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:35.500 align:middle line:10%
>> We're still
learning this one.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:36.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Tell me more.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Love has no boundary.

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:46.150 align:middle line:10%
Your love for yourself has to be
equal to your love for another.

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:48.910 align:middle line:10%
Otherwise, your
boundaries won't work.

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a need to have
the love for yourself equal

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:54.500 align:middle line:90%
for the love that you share.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.190 align:middle line:84%
By being aware of that, you can
increase the love for yourself

00:26:57.190 --> 00:27:00.760 align:middle line:84%
and therefore create
that healthy boundary.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Is there any advice we can
give her about her body?

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.747 align:middle line:10%
>> Put the stuff on a shelf.

00:27:07.747 --> 00:27:09.580 align:middle line:10%
If you're going to carry
it around with you,

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.920 align:middle line:10%
you don't have to
carry it all the time.

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And will she know when
it's time to let go of it?

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And that would help the
neck and the shoulders?

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.910 align:middle line:90%


00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:24.770 align:middle line:10%
>> She carries too much.

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:27.760 align:middle line:10%
You like to peel back those
windows and look at everything,

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.070 align:middle line:10%
but you never close them again.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:33.730 align:middle line:10%
Experience it, and observe
it, and let it happen,

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:36.130 align:middle line:10%
and let it move through.

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>> So letting it move
through versus carrying?

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Brighton came with
some physical stuff

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.230 align:middle line:90%
around her neck and shoulders.

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And she realized
that it's connecting

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:49.840 align:middle line:84%
to just carrying things around
and providing a shelf, a place

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.790 align:middle line:84%
to rest the things
when you need to.

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And then, eventually, move into
your wisdom and let things go.

00:27:56.050 --> 00:28:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything else you
want to show her or remind her

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.920 align:middle line:90%
while we're in this space?

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:08.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Just because there is a pain
doesn't mean the joy or the love

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.630 align:middle line:10%
is undone.

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:13.000 align:middle line:10%
It all serves a purpose.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:19.690 align:middle line:10%
And even though it's not happy
doesn't diminish what it was

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:21.690 align:middle line:10%
or how it felt.

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:23.400 align:middle line:84%
I think, sometimes,
it's really easy

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.580 align:middle line:84%
to get stuck on the loss of a
brother, the loss of a husband.

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:29.640 align:middle line:84%
But I had a brother
and I had a husband,

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and those things were really
beautiful while they were there.

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there anything important
that she needs to hear about her

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.280 align:middle line:90%
career?

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:41.400 align:middle line:10%
>> It'll be pretty obvious
when it's time to jump.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so she'll
know without a doubt.

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And so does it feel
like today is complete?

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt the most
overwhelmingly blessed with love

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:55.240 align:middle line:84%
that I think I have
ever felt in my life.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to tuck that
experience away and remember

00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:00.510 align:middle line:90%
that I can pull it out any time.

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>> How long do you
think this was?

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>> An hour?

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:07.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Two hours and 23 minutes.

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:11.430 align:middle line:84%
I am so grateful that she
received those messages,

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:14.550 align:middle line:84%
that she got what she
needed, that she really

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:16.420 align:middle line:90%
was able to feel love.

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Really gotten everything
that she asked for.

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:22.354 align:middle line:90%


00:29:22.354 --> 00:29:24.310 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:29.210 align:middle line:90%


00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been two weeks since
my session and I feel great.

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:35.420 align:middle line:10%
Life has been just as
busy as it was before,

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:38.850 align:middle line:10%
but I feel a lot more
calm and at peace

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:41.940 align:middle line:10%
and ready to handle anything
that life could throw at me.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:44.510 align:middle line:84%
I feel a very deep sense of
connection to my brother,

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:45.350 align:middle line:90%
especially.

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And having passed that time of
the anniversary of his death

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:54.290 align:middle line:84%
and not feeling quite so angry
or upset about it because I

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:57.710 align:middle line:84%
got to have that
connection with him.

00:29:57.710 --> 00:30:00.710 align:middle line:84%
I feel like a large
part of my journey

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:04.350 align:middle line:84%
was wanting to know
answers to how do I do this

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:05.820 align:middle line:90%
or what do I do next.

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And the answers that I got
back and the reassurance

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:12.330 align:middle line:84%
that I got back was that it's
OK if you don't know how.

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:15.480 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of what the point
of being here and doing this is.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.080 align:middle line:84%
I also feel a greater sense
of connection, and joy,

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:21.290 align:middle line:84%
and love in everything around
me and all of my relationships,

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:24.470 align:middle line:84%
and not just needing it
from a romantic partner.

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:26.910 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much,
Hila, for my session.

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:29.190 align:middle line:84%
I definitely had a
journey into my soul.

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Moving forward, I know
that I can handle anything

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:35.500 align:middle line:84%
that life throws at me
with patience and grace.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:55.000 align:middle line:90%
