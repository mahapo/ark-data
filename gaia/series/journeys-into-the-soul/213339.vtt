>> I now feel this connection
between the mind and the spirit

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.630 align:middle line:10%
and the gut.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.730 align:middle line:10%
And I think I'll know now.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.150 align:middle line:10%
I think I'll be able to listen
and trust in my own intuition

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.630 align:middle line:10%
instead of immediately
trying to turn away from it.

00:00:50.872 --> 00:00:52.960 align:middle line:90%
My name is Brandon.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm from the
Moscow-Pullman area.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.650 align:middle line:90%
It's called the Palouse.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.170 align:middle line:90%
It's in the Pacific Northwest.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.590 align:middle line:84%
When I was young, I had a lot of
questions about my upbringing.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.460 align:middle line:90%
My parents are very religious.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.610 align:middle line:84%
I was raised in an LDS
or Mormon family, very

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.160 align:middle line:90%
strict religious upbringing.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.470 align:middle line:84%
When you're a Mormon,
you're baptized

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.550 align:middle line:90%
at the age of eight years old.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And when I went in for my
Bishop's interview at seven,

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.340 align:middle line:84%
I told my bishop that I wasn't
really interested in becoming

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.190 align:middle line:84%
a member, which threw
them through a loop,

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.670 align:middle line:84%
because most seven-year-olds
just follow suit of everybody

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.940 align:middle line:84%
else, and they do exactly what
they're supposed to be doing

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.480 align:middle line:90%
and what they're told to do.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.960 align:middle line:84%
They went to my parents
and told my parents

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.610 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't going
to be baptized.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.300 align:middle line:84%
My parents freaked out, told me
that I needed to be baptized,

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.470 align:middle line:84%
and I told them I just
wasn't comfortable.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.100 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of where I was
living at for my teenage years.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.210 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really believe in
what I was being taught,

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.970 align:middle line:84%
but I was being forced
into a religious narrative.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.350 align:middle line:84%
When I finally was
able to leave home,

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.560 align:middle line:84%
then I was able to break
free and to start to think

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.009 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more on my own.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.360 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, I guess
if everybody looked

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.310 align:middle line:84%
at me from the
outside world, they

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.190 align:middle line:84%
would think that this guy
really has it all made,

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.720 align:middle line:84%
successful business owner,
beautiful family house,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.560 align:middle line:90%
second house on the lake.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.080 align:middle line:84%
But inside, I was
missing something,

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.050 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know what
that something was.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.350 align:middle line:84%
There was a piece of my
soul that I was missing.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.660 align:middle line:84%
Part of my soul
had been taken away

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.010 align:middle line:84%
from me, both from my
religious upbringing

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.790 align:middle line:84%
and from losing a brother
and a brother-in-law

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.130 align:middle line:84%
unexpectedly at a
pretty young age.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And then fast forward
about 20 years later,

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.690 align:middle line:84%
and I'm having, for
lack of better terms,

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.780 align:middle line:84%
a bit of a midlife
crisis, with those

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.460 align:middle line:84%
experiences combining with just
my own personal stuff that I was

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.760 align:middle line:84%
going through with my family,
with the struggles that it is

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.580 align:middle line:84%
to be a business owner
and an entrepreneur trying

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.240 align:middle line:90%
to start other businesses.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.680 align:middle line:84%
One day, I had this real
realization that I'm lost.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And for the first
time in my life,

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.550 align:middle line:84%
I was very scared because I
didn't know what lost meant.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.250 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know where I should go.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.290 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what I should do.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.520 align:middle line:90%
I started reading.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.140 align:middle line:90%
I started reading the Bible.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.170 align:middle line:84%
I started reading
the Book of Mormon,

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.500 align:middle line:84%
going back to what I was
taught originally as a child,

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.120 align:middle line:84%
and those narratives
just did not fit.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.550 align:middle line:84%
There were so many
problems that I

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.170 align:middle line:84%
had that were brought
up that just didn't fit.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.390 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest life-changing
books that I ever read was

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.380 align:middle line:84%
"Journey of Souls"
by Michael Newton.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And after that, it really
just took off into the journey

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:56.940 align:middle line:90%
that I'm at right now.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.040 align:middle line:84%
The last four years have
just been a lot of reading,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.900 align:middle line:84%
a lot of soul searching,
and a lot of exploring.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.340 align:middle line:90%


00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.000 align:middle line:84%
I found Kathy's website,
and I contacted her

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.060 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted
to experience what

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.020 align:middle line:84%
I was reading about
in these books,

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.700 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to have my
own personal relations

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.390 align:middle line:84%
with my own soul journey
and just some advice

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.490 align:middle line:90%
to lead me on the way.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't really have
any expectations.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm really more just
excited for the experience.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited to grow, to
learn what my journey is

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.286 align:middle line:90%
in this incarnation.

I am in Moscow, Idaho.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.480 align:middle line:84%
I've been a licensed mental
health counselor for over 30

years, and I'm a certified
LBL facilitator and quantum

consciousness facilitator.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.770 align:middle line:10%
I started moving into
the spirituality work

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.070 align:middle line:10%
to help people to access the
bigger part of themselves,

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.490 align:middle line:10%
to see who they are
beyond the trauma

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.730 align:middle line:10%
that they've experienced
in this current lifetime.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.420 align:middle line:84%
So mostly just wanting people
to recognize that there's

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.190 align:middle line:84%
so much more than this current
experience that they're living

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.860 align:middle line:84%
and to access all
of the resources

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.870 align:middle line:84%
that they have beyond
their physicalness.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Then we start
expanding out to all

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.750 align:middle line:84%
that's available
beyond that, being

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:43.200 align:middle line:84%
able to go from feeling calm
to feeling joy and excitement

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.120 align:middle line:84%
and enthusiasm for whatever more
is to come in their journey.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.520 align:middle line:90%


00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.340 align:middle line:84%
I had been a counselor
for over 20 years,

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.560 align:middle line:84%
doing the traditional
counseling work,

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.660 align:middle line:90%
working with trauma clients.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.010 align:middle line:84%
I was told about the
Newton books by a friend.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.620 align:middle line:84%
As I was reading
the book, I felt

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.940 align:middle line:84%
like I was reading
something I already knew.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.500 align:middle line:84%
It amazed me that this book
was written by somebody who

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.750 align:middle line:90%
was a licensed psychologist.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And what struck me about that is
what courage it must have taken

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.800 align:middle line:84%
him to do this kind of
research and put himself out

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.010 align:middle line:84%
there and risk his
professional career.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.110 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I saw
that it was somebody

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.220 align:middle line:84%
who took a rigorous scientific
approach to what he did,

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.660 align:middle line:90%
I was all in.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.970 align:middle line:84%
As a clinician, I wanted to see
how does this actually work?

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.130 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.660 align:middle line:10%
I had the most profound LBL
experience that I could not

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.910 align:middle line:10%
deny being true for me.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.640 align:middle line:84%

through in the experience,

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.070 align:middle line:84%
it just brings

Brandon contacted me a
couple of months ago.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.040 align:middle line:84%
He had found me on the Michael
Newton Institute website.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.680 align:middle line:90%
He had read "Journey of Souls."

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.500 align:middle line:10%
And we chatted about what he
was hoping to get out of it,

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.870 align:middle line:10%
and in the end, we decided to
do a multidimensional journey.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.860 align:middle line:10%
This is a journey in which
the client has the opportunity

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.800 align:middle line:10%
to move into the
wholeness of who they are.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.720 align:middle line:10%
So it's an opportunity
to experience

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.380 align:middle line:10%
the full multidimensional
you that you

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.300 align:middle line:10%
are in the non-physical realm.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.860 align:middle line:90%
It's a guided process.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.580 align:middle line:84%
What the person is meant
to get in that journey

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.830 align:middle line:90%
is what's going to come through.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.410 align:middle line:84%
I facilitate moving
through the portal

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:41.570 align:middle line:84%
into the multidimensional realm,
and then the rest unfolds.

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:45.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm helping people to walk
through their human journey

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.200 align:middle line:90%
from the place of their soul.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.300 align:middle line:84%
It just brings
you so much peace.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:59.010 align:middle line:90%


00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:02.160 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do the
multidimensional journey.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little
bit about what that is,

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:10.980 align:middle line:84%
and then really get very
specific about your intention

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.010 align:middle line:84%
for your journey, once
this journey is over,

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:17.430 align:middle line:84%
what you're hoping it
will provide you, right.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:21.240 align:middle line:84%
The multidimensional
journey is about you

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:26.490 align:middle line:84%
being able to access what's in
the non-physical realm that's

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:32.640 align:middle line:84%
available for you as a resource
or for healing or any of that.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.049 align:middle line:84%
It's really about
moving into the realm

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.150 align:middle line:84%
of the multi-dimensional
as a way

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:43.169 align:middle line:84%
to transcend whatever
is going on now that's

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:44.770 align:middle line:90%
feeling problematic for you.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:45.570 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>> How does that sound to you?

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.495 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:08:48.495 --> 00:08:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting?

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:51.540 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me a
little bit about how

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.000 align:middle line:90%
you're hoping that would help?

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So, I mean, I kind of feel
like where I'm at right now

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.630 align:middle line:90%
in my human journey is--

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:08.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm really looking for what
my soul is here to learn.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:13.890 align:middle line:84%
I've had some struggles in my
life, and I'm just wondering,

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.095 align:middle line:84%
what is my soul trying
to learn for this trip?

00:09:17.095 --> 00:09:18.760 align:middle line:90%
>> What am I trying to learn?

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:19.560 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.360 align:middle line:84%
Are you thinking
of multiple things

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.280 align:middle line:84%
in your life that
have happened and kind

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.610 align:middle line:90%
of wondering what that's about?

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:26.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.250 align:middle line:84%
There's been a lot of death in
my life that has been around.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:33.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I would almost
say just a lot of tragedy,

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.930 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just wondering what
exactly that is all about

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:41.760 align:middle line:84%
and what it is that, I guess,
that I'm trying to gain

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.205 align:middle line:90%
or my soul is trying to gain.

00:09:43.205 --> 00:09:45.630 align:middle line:90%
>> You've had multiple--

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:48.662 align:middle line:84%
we don't know how many
incarnations, right?

00:09:48.662 --> 00:09:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And how many different
bodies here on Earth,

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.682 align:middle line:90%
maybe in other places, right?

00:09:54.682 --> 00:09:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And so as we move into the
multidimensional realm,

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.680 align:middle line:84%
you can access
those parts of you.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.080 align:middle line:84%
How are you hoping
that would help

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.320 align:middle line:84%
as you access them,
as those parts of you

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.955 align:middle line:90%
become available to you?

00:10:08.955 --> 00:10:12.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I think that they can
help to direct me or what this

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.180 align:middle line:90%
journey actually is now.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:19.200 align:middle line:84%
So kind of getting pieces
of what the soul, what it

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.470 align:middle line:90%
learned in other lifetimes.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Then that can help
guide me to what I'm

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.728 align:middle line:90%
looking for in this lifetime.

00:10:27.728 --> 00:10:28.528 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:28.528 --> 00:10:29.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:33.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm thinking, what if
there are certain things right

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.270 align:middle line:84%
now that are holding
you back from the path

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.170 align:middle line:90%
that you were intended to take?

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Getting help with
transcending anything

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:43.020 align:middle line:84%
that might be holding
you back from the path

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.937 align:middle line:84%
that you really
intended to take.

00:10:44.937 --> 00:10:45.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:46.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Does that sound OK?

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>> It sounds like you just want
to have this knowing of, what am

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:52.900 align:middle line:90%
I meant to be doing?

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.560 align:middle line:90%
What am I here to learn?

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.470 align:middle line:90%
Does that sound good?

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:57.105 align:middle line:90%
>> That sounds good.

00:10:57.105 --> 00:10:57.905 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:57.905 --> 00:11:01.770 align:middle line:84%
So as you think about that, try
to feel into that for a minute.

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Does that feel like it
takes you to a higher

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:09.010 align:middle line:90%
vibration, that intention?

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Removing anything that's
getting in the way.

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.020 align:middle line:90%
Now, the path is clear.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.440 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're looking for?

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:19.680 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.670 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:23.100 align:middle line:90%
Well, I think we're set to go.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:29.435 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.435 --> 00:11:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you sense around you?

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:36.380 align:middle line:10%
>> A light and a tree.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Tell me more.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:44.012 align:middle line:10%
>> The tree is shading
me from the light.

00:11:44.012 --> 00:11:48.710 align:middle line:10%
The light's really strong.

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.990 align:middle line:84%
The light felt
like I was at home.

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:56.480 align:middle line:84%
The tree, I almost feel
like maybe was there

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.400 align:middle line:84%
because if it wouldn't
have been there,

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.300 align:middle line:84%
the light would
have been too much.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:04.880 align:middle line:10%
The light doesn't seem to be
coming from one direction.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:10.410 align:middle line:10%
It seems to be coming from
all around me, even below me.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>> The fact that it was coming
from all around was significant,

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.380 align:middle line:84%
so I just encouraged him to
explore that more so that we

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.300 align:middle line:90%
could learn the meaning of that.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.380 align:middle line:90%
Does the light have a color?

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:28.220 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a white-ish gold.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:33.020 align:middle line:84%
The light itself was
white, but the tips of it

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.695 align:middle line:90%
had that yellow-gold hue.

00:12:35.695 --> 00:12:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>> What form do you take?

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:43.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Kind of a ball
or orb of light.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:50.860 align:middle line:10%
Well, I looked to my hands,
and they're not human hands.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:54.330 align:middle line:10%
They're not really there.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.000 align:middle line:10%
It's just energy.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.450 align:middle line:10%
Energy seems to be
radiating from a point

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:04.170 align:middle line:10%
where it's coming from, but
then almost like a point where

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:06.762 align:middle line:10%
it stops, like a sphere.

00:13:06.762 --> 00:13:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>> He sensed into the fact that
he actually didn't have a human

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.110 align:middle line:90%
form, that he was an orb.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:17.670 align:middle line:84%
That told me that he was
truly in his fullness

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:18.970 align:middle line:90%
of his magnificence.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.490 align:middle line:90%
He had moved into his spirit.

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:23.405 align:middle line:90%
And what color is it?

00:13:23.405 --> 00:13:29.040 align:middle line:10%
>> It's almost translucent, but
there is a little bit of purple

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.470 align:middle line:10%
or blue.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:32.190 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:34.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Right around the edges.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.950 align:middle line:10%
>> When I hear a client talk
about their energy being blue

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:43.780 align:middle line:10%
or having a purple to it, to me,
that signifies a deeper wisdom

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:47.960 align:middle line:10%
that they carry within their
energy body, within their soul.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.160 align:middle line:84%
The wisdom is already there,
which is true for all of us.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:57.955 align:middle line:84%
So what is the greater purpose
of Brandon being shown this?

00:13:57.955 --> 00:14:03.740 align:middle line:10%
>> The Brandon in the chair
is just another being.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:10.120 align:middle line:10%
It's not the true essence
of who Brandon is.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.510 align:middle line:84%
The Brandon that she was
talking to in the chair,

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:16.520 align:middle line:84%
as I was referring
to, was not really me.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.650 align:middle line:90%
My true essence was there.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:19.550 align:middle line:90%
I was with it.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:22.480 align:middle line:84%
It is that sphere,
that orb, that

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:26.950 align:middle line:90%
is truly who I am in my core.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:29.800 align:middle line:10%
That this is just
a shell so that we

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.820 align:middle line:10%
can have this experience.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.730 align:middle line:10%
I can almost see a horizon.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:40.650 align:middle line:10%
The horizon is kind
of drawing me to it.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:41.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Beautiful.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.560 align:middle line:10%
Great.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.390 align:middle line:10%
>> As I go towards it, I
feel this rushing sensation,

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:49.630 align:middle line:10%
almost like the
flowing of water.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:54.010 align:middle line:10%
It's pulling me closer
and closer to the edge,

00:14:54.010 --> 00:15:00.310 align:middle line:10%
and I feel a little bit nervous
now as I start to get close.

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:03.760 align:middle line:10%
There's this great abyss.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.680 align:middle line:10%
It's not scary.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.066 align:middle line:10%
It's just really big.

00:15:08.066 --> 00:15:10.020 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not scary anymore?

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:14.260 align:middle line:84%
The pulling, I think,
is what made me nervous.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
got to the edge, it

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.920 align:middle line:84%
was almost like a
stream or a river,

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:23.740 align:middle line:84%
and everything was flowing
into this vast consciousness.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So there was nothing
to be afraid of.

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.580 align:middle line:84%
It was just me being
able to see it.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>> There might be some
anxiety at the beginning,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.890 align:middle line:84%
but then when you get there,
it just naturally fades away,

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.500 align:middle line:90%
which is what happened for him.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.750 align:middle line:84%
There he was on the precipice,
he saw the big abyss,

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:42.060 align:middle line:90%
and he was no longer afraid.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.425 align:middle line:90%
Are you alone here?

00:15:43.425 --> 00:15:49.920 align:middle line:10%
>> I feel others'
presence, but I also feel--

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.770 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I don't
feel like I'm alone,

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:57.800 align:middle line:10%
but I don't really see them.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:02.700 align:middle line:10%
I feel their closeness, but
I don't see their closeness.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.235 align:middle line:10%
So you're not alone?

00:16:06.235 --> 00:16:07.820 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>> That is something that's so
important that I want people

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.930 align:middle line:84%
to always know is that there's
always that divine support.

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:17.660 align:middle line:84%
We may not see it, but even
when we're not paying attention,

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.440 align:middle line:90%
it's there.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.850 align:middle line:84%
So what is the greater
purpose of Brandon

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:30.422 align:middle line:90%
being shown this great abyss?

00:16:30.422 --> 00:16:35.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Just how vast the
universe really is.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:39.120 align:middle line:10%
How small we really
are, but yet we still

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:44.750 align:middle line:10%
have a big part
in consciousness.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:50.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Even though I feel small,
I still feel big, meaningful.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.266 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:16:52.266 --> 00:16:55.650 align:middle line:10%
>> We are small
compared to all of this,

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:58.560 align:middle line:10%
but yet we're still
part of all of this.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.620 align:middle line:84%
When we feel small
on our human journey,

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.800 align:middle line:84%
just to know that who
we are in our truth

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.940 align:middle line:84%
is connected to all of this
vastness and this bigness,

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.040 align:middle line:90%
that that's who we really are.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:11.840 align:middle line:90%
Meaningful.

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:14.375 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.375 --> 00:17:19.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, like that
there's purpose.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.540 align:middle line:10%
And I think that
that's what Brandon's

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:27.849 align:middle line:10%
supposed to see, that there
is purpose, true purpose.

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:32.280 align:middle line:84%
That was something that I was
wondering is, why are we here?

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.070 align:middle line:90%
What is our purpose in life?

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:36.048 align:middle line:90%
Is there even a purpose?

00:17:36.048 --> 00:17:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was
one of the things that

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:42.520 align:middle line:84%
was haunting me and just really
having the overwhelming feeling

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.040 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
purpose, that we're here

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:50.145 align:middle line:84%
to try to bring and
connect everybody together.

00:17:50.145 --> 00:17:52.726 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell me more.

00:17:52.726 --> 00:17:59.400 align:middle line:10%
>> All that's coming to
me is light and exploring.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:06.900 align:middle line:10%
Exploring the light
and enjoying the light.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:13.380 align:middle line:10%
Appreciating life, really, how
lucky we are to have a life.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.280 align:middle line:84%
That light is what
felt like this life,

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:22.140 align:middle line:84%
us being able to be here, to be
able to experience joy and pain,

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.895 align:middle line:84%
to be able to have
a human experience.

00:18:25.895 --> 00:18:31.410 align:middle line:10%
>> How does this help
Brandon with his intention

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:38.130 align:middle line:10%
for today's journey to
experience all of who he is

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:43.915 align:middle line:10%
and to gain clarity about
his lessons and his path?

00:18:43.915 --> 00:18:46.996 align:middle line:10%
>> I feel like it's a
form of confirmation.

00:18:46.996 --> 00:18:49.700 align:middle line:10%


00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:54.290 align:middle line:10%
I kind of feel like
traveling right now,

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:59.900 align:middle line:10%
traveling almost
through the cosmos.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:04.160 align:middle line:10%
And I feel like that that's
part of what Brandon needs

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:10.220 align:middle line:10%
to realize, is that it's a
cosmic journey and to try

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.700 align:middle line:10%
to not take everything
so seriously

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:19.670 align:middle line:10%
and enjoy yourself
more, enjoy everything

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:23.690 align:middle line:10%
that this Earth has to give.

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:25.195 align:middle line:10%
Truly enjoy it.

00:19:25.195 --> 00:19:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Truly enjoy it.

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:27.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:30.190 align:middle line:90%


00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Tell me more about
what this is like here,

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.765 align:middle line:90%
traveling through the cosmos.

00:19:36.765 --> 00:19:38.510 align:middle line:10%
>> So free.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:39.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.040 align:middle line:10%
>> No, no fear.

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:45.940 align:middle line:10%
And I think that that's one of
the things that has been holding

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:49.450 align:middle line:10%
Brandon back is fear.

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:59.620 align:middle line:10%
So to be able to truly enjoy,
you have to release that fear.

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.290 align:middle line:84%
I would say for the
majority of my life,

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:04.750 align:middle line:90%
that I've been walking in fear.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:07.990 align:middle line:84%
I have not allowed
myself to live.

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where life
is, is outside the fear.

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Just allow that vibration
of freedom and all that it has

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.674 align:middle line:90%
to offer you in this moment.

00:20:22.674 --> 00:20:27.720 align:middle line:10%
>> The vibration is
almost overwhelming.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>> When we move
into that vibration,

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.850 align:middle line:84%
we're free of all
those lower vibrations,

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:36.750 align:middle line:84%
whether that's depression,
or fear, or anxiety.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And as Brandon experienced
that moment in which he said,

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.730 align:middle line:84%
it's almost too big, I
knew that he was fully

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:48.280 align:middle line:84%
going to start incorporating
that into his physical.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:52.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Brings me back to Brandon's
palms almost feel sweaty from

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:55.750 align:middle line:10%
the high energy.

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:57.690 align:middle line:10%
I just feel it
through my fingertips

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.635 align:middle line:10%
and every bit of my soul.

00:21:00.635 --> 00:21:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Just allow that to infuse
even Brandon's physical body,

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:11.180 align:middle line:84%
the tissues, the blood,
the bones, the organs.

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>> So as I was able to
actually release the fear,

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:20.100 align:middle line:84%
I had this really strong
vibration sense come on.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.920 align:middle line:84%
I almost felt like it was going
to come out of my fingertips

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.400 align:middle line:90%
and out of my chest.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.665 align:middle line:84%
It was just this incredibly
strong vibration.

00:21:28.665 --> 00:21:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And now, if we can, let's
check back in with that

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:36.323 align:middle line:90%
beautiful energy orb.

00:21:36.323 --> 00:21:39.900 align:middle line:10%
>> I feel like I'm
kind of pinballing,

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:49.870 align:middle line:10%
just moving through space,
enjoying the feeling of freedom.

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:51.970 align:middle line:10%
Moving without a body.

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:57.490 align:middle line:84%
To feel weightless and to feel
like you can just go anywhere

00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:59.340 align:middle line:90%
is amazing.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>> As you enjoy this freedom
out here in the cosmos,

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:10.655 align:middle line:84%
how will Brandon's life
be forever changed?

00:22:10.655 --> 00:22:14.870 align:middle line:10%
>> He will now understand
his connectedness or tie

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:18.200 align:middle line:10%
to the universe.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.856 align:middle line:10%
Consciousness.

00:22:20.856 --> 00:22:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>> How does this help with
Brandon's intention to have

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:31.610 align:middle line:84%
clarity about his
path and his lessons?

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:35.695 align:middle line:10%
>> Confirmation on what
I thought I already knew.

00:22:35.695 --> 00:22:41.210 align:middle line:10%
That now I can see and feel.

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:47.600 align:middle line:10%
I think I know for too long,
he didn't trust his feelings.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:54.720 align:middle line:10%
He was taught not to trust his
feelings because in some way,

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.480 align:middle line:10%
they were bad.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:01.620 align:middle line:10%
But knowing now that those
feelings are there to help us

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:08.010 align:middle line:10%
and to guide us and that
we have to listen to them.

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:11.800 align:middle line:84%
So when I was younger, I was
taught not to trust my feelings.

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.700 align:middle line:84%
I was taught not to trust my
intuition, that it was actually

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.430 align:middle line:84%
bad, that it could be
something that the devil

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:19.150 align:middle line:90%
was using to trick me.

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And I struggle, even now, to be
able to trust that gut feeling,

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.840 align:middle line:84%
that intuition that we
all know is guiding us,

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.490 align:middle line:90%
and that we should listen to.

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:35.880 align:middle line:84%
But I had been told and preached
to that it was not true,

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.255 align:middle line:84%
and that it was
potentially even evil.

00:23:39.255 --> 00:23:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>> As he has those
feelings to guide him,

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:46.985 align:middle line:84%
how will Brandon's life
be forever changed?

00:23:46.985 --> 00:23:49.550 align:middle line:10%
>> Because he has
been living in fear,

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:52.560 align:middle line:10%
he hasn't been
trusting the feelings.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:55.770 align:middle line:10%
I think it's the understanding
of the true intuition

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:57.960 align:middle line:10%
and the gut.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:06.460 align:middle line:10%
I had trained myself to not
listen to my gut feeling.

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:11.050 align:middle line:10%
I've been blocking it out
for so long that getting back

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:15.700 align:middle line:10%
in touch with that feeling
so that I truly can listen,

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:20.270 align:middle line:10%
and it truly can guide
me, that is essential.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I neglected my
gut for 30 years of my life,

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.680 align:middle line:90%
I had lost touch with it.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:32.260 align:middle line:84%
That is the true
essence of Brandon,

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:36.310 align:middle line:84%
who I am down to my
soul, and that is what

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:38.830 align:middle line:90%
I need to listen to guide me.

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:39.780 align:middle line:10%
It's Truly me.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:40.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:48.310 align:middle line:10%
>> But there's a disconnect
between the gut and the mind,

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:49.490 align:middle line:10%
what I'm feeling.

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:51.250 align:middle line:10%
and thinking.

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:54.240 align:middle line:10%


00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.872 align:middle line:10%
I've got to get those in line.

00:24:56.872 --> 00:25:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And what would you like
to do to get those in line

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:03.392 align:middle line:90%
for Brandon?

00:25:03.392 --> 00:25:06.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Just allow him
to trust them again.

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:08.980 align:middle line:10%


00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:12.220 align:middle line:10%
And to try to not
block them out.

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:16.500 align:middle line:10%
I now feel those
connection between the mind

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:21.030 align:middle line:10%
and the spirit and the gut.

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:23.910 align:middle line:10%
And I think I'll know now.

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:33.570 align:middle line:10%
I think I'll be able to listen
and trust in my own intuition

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:37.462 align:middle line:10%
instead of immediately
trying to turn away from it.

00:25:37.462 --> 00:25:40.920 align:middle line:84%
>> He got clearer and clearer
that the purpose of what he was

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:46.620 align:middle line:84%
being shown today was for him
to go back to trusting his gut,

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:51.540 align:middle line:84%
something that he had done early
in his life and had been told

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.140 align:middle line:90%
to not do.

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:57.420 align:middle line:84%
So how can Brandon
stay connected

00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:04.032 align:middle line:84%
to this alignment right now
of spirit, mind, and gut?

00:26:04.032 --> 00:26:06.990 align:middle line:10%
>> He has to trust himself.

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:08.670 align:middle line:10%
That has been
something that has been

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:12.035 align:middle line:10%
a huge challenge for so long.

00:26:12.035 --> 00:26:21.273 align:middle line:84%
>> Just allow that feeling,
that knowing, to deepen.

00:26:21.273 --> 00:26:24.630 align:middle line:10%
>> I feel it in the
pit of my stomach.

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:26.680 align:middle line:10%
It feels safe.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.100 align:middle line:10%
It's more than safe.

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.480 align:middle line:10%
It feels secure.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:34.480 align:middle line:10%
It feels like I
can't mess it up.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.490 align:middle line:84%
I think that I was
walking on eggshells

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:39.850 align:middle line:84%
for the majority of my life,
worrying so much about messing

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:44.800 align:middle line:84%
this life up and what's going to
happen to me in the next life,

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.170 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't allow
myself to enjoy.

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:50.720 align:middle line:84%
I didn't allow myself to
have freedom, to explore.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And that has really put
a damper on this life,

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:58.950 align:middle line:84%
and I want to try
to make that change.

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:04.472 align:middle line:84%
>> As you sense into this
now, what comes to you?

00:27:04.472 --> 00:27:07.960 align:middle line:10%
>> I feel like this domino
effect that as I affect

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:11.880 align:middle line:10%
somebody, they affect somebody
else and so forth and so on.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:12.680 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.800 align:middle line:10%
>> It's never ending, though.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.690 align:middle line:10%
Even though we're
all so individual,

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:18.730 align:middle line:10%
we're all still connected.

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:24.650 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like a domino
chain that went into infinity.

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Each one of those dominoes
was an individual person.

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:31.630 align:middle line:84%
What we do affects the
next person down the line,

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:33.780 align:middle line:84%
just like a line
of dominoes would.

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:36.610 align:middle line:84%
But also that there
is no disconnect,

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:40.540 align:middle line:84%
that the line of dominoes, are
in some way, shape and form,

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.285 align:middle line:90%
all interconnected.

00:27:42.285 --> 00:27:46.706 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there anything else
that you are feeling drawn to?

00:27:46.706 --> 00:27:51.128 align:middle line:10%
>> An overwhelming
sense of peace.

sit with a client as they come

into the presence
of their whole self,

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:04.730 align:middle line:10%
to witness the wisdom that
comes through and the shift that

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:08.090 align:middle line:10%
happens for them, just knowing
how much it will change

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:09.790 align:middle line:10%
their life moving forward.

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:10.590 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:11.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Good?

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:13.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:17.240 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I have
this connection now

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:24.355 align:middle line:84%
that I can make between
my mind and my gut.

00:28:24.355 --> 00:28:28.790 align:middle line:84%
I feel like that was something
that I had been taught

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:32.330 align:middle line:90%
to repress for a lot of years.

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And getting back in touch
with that is essential.

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:41.630 align:middle line:84%
So now the gut and the
heart can work together

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:43.080 align:middle line:90%
as you move forward.

>> It's been two weeks
since my session with Kathy,

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:59.940 align:middle line:10%
and I feel a different level of
connected than I have ever felt

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.080 align:middle line:10%
before.

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:05.610 align:middle line:10%
I can now recognize when I
have a feeling in my gut,

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:08.850 align:middle line:10%
and that makes a
positive connection

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:13.110 align:middle line:10%
with the brain, where
I'm able to understand

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:15.720 align:middle line:10%
the truth behind
it, where before, I

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:19.030 align:middle line:10%
was really having a hard
time making that connection.

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:23.430 align:middle line:84%
But I know what that feeling
is that I'm looking for.

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:27.300 align:middle line:10%
I definitely didn't
trust myself,

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:31.030 align:middle line:10%
and it was fear-based
because of my upbringing.

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:34.200 align:middle line:10%
And now that I've been able
to make that connection

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:38.500 align:middle line:10%
with my gut and my mind, that
fear has been able to dissipate,

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:43.170 align:middle line:10%
and I'm able to really be in
touch with my authentic self.

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:44.250 align:middle line:10%
Thank you, Kathy.

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:46.680 align:middle line:10%
I definitely had a
journey into my soul,

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.050 align:middle line:10%
and I know, moving
forward, that I

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:53.650 align:middle line:10%
will understand that connection
between my mind and my gut

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:56.410 align:middle line:10%
and be able to use
it to help guide me.
