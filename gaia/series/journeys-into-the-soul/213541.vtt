I am 48 years old, and I
live in Portland, Oregon.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.850 align:middle line:84%
I have had a form of leukemia
since November of 2015.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.480 align:middle line:84%
I heard that QHHT may be
able to help me with reaching

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.500 align:middle line:90%
my goal of remission.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.250 align:middle line:10%
There are video clips
on YouTube that Dolores

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.920 align:middle line:10%
talks about the healing
that takes place

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.440 align:middle line:10%
in some of her QHHT sessions and
that this was quantum healing.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And this was a modality that
I had never heard of before.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.360 align:middle line:84%
So that was what led
me to dig further.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:47.270 align:middle line:84%
Several months ago, I had my
first QHHT session with Tracie.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And in that session, I
experienced profound healing.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And I am in remission
at this time.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.090 align:middle line:84%
People have asked
me, what was it

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.610 align:middle line:90%
like going into a QHHT session?

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And I could hear myself
answering the questions.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.640 align:middle line:84%
I knew that it was me,
that it was my higher self.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.500 align:middle line:90%
I could distinguish the two.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.290 align:middle line:84%
It felt very natural
and very normal.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.040 align:middle line:84%
Yet it was also very
clear to me that it

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.330 align:middle line:84%
was a profound experience that
I needed to understand and allow

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.420 align:middle line:90%
myself to open up to to hear it.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.120 align:middle line:84%
I have other questions
that I would really

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.310 align:middle line:84%
like to understand
now, especially

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.250 align:middle line:84%
since I have experienced
so much profound healing.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm very eager to understand
what additional insights I

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.490 align:middle line:90%
can gain from this experience.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.025 align:middle line:84%
One of the questions that I had
following my remission, I never

00:02:46.025 --> 00:02:47.420 align:middle line:90%
really asked why.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.370 align:middle line:84%
I would like to
understand what it

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.330 align:middle line:84%
is that led me to get the
cancer and if there is anything

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.815 align:middle line:84%
that I still need to clear to
keep that remission status.

00:02:57.815 --> 00:03:01.950 align:middle line:84%
What's nice about going through
the QHHT session with Tracie

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.930 align:middle line:84%
is that she gives so much
time in the interview process

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.530 align:middle line:84%
to really help you feel
comfortable when she takes you

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.720 align:middle line:84%
through the first
steps and you realize

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.950 align:middle line:84%
the place that your
answers are coming from.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.450 align:middle line:84%
It makes so much sense
that the answers, when

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.920 align:middle line:84%
they come from that
space, you can pinpoint,

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.170 align:middle line:84%
yes, it's all coming
from that same space.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.010 align:middle line:84%
I know that I can
trust that answer.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.280 align:middle line:84%
I remember, in the session that
I had, I had asked for healing.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until the
next couple of days,

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.400 align:middle line:84%
even up to two weeks
after, that I really

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.770 align:middle line:84%
was able to see measurable
differences with my healing.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.380 align:middle line:84%
But I also walked away from
that feeling so much presence

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.390 align:middle line:90%
and comfort.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.070 align:middle line:84%
I would like to know if I can
get healing because I am still

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.230 align:middle line:90%
dependent on medications.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.855 align:middle line:84%
And I can't help but
feel like it was meant

00:03:54.855 --> 00:03:56.105 align:middle line:90%
for me to connect with Tracie.

00:03:56.105 --> 00:04:03.428 align:middle line:90%

>> I'm Tracie Mahan, and
I'm a level 3 practitioner

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.930 align:middle line:10%
of the quantum healing
hypnosis technique.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.990 align:middle line:10%
This was a technique
that was brought forward

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:23.490 align:middle line:10%
by Dolores Cannon.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.980 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of people, they hear
the stories of Dolores Cannon.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.300 align:middle line:84%
They see what she puts out
into the world with her videos

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.780 align:middle line:90%
and her techniques.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.080 align:middle line:10%
But a lot of people
don't know how much

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.770 align:middle line:10%
work Dolores Cannon
put into this technique

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.470 align:middle line:10%
that we're using today.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.960 align:middle line:10%
I've been doing this version
of hypnosis since 2014.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Over the years, I've taken
many different courses,

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.390 align:middle line:84%
many different exercises
to hone in these skills.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And then I found Dolores,
and it was like finding home.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.160 align:middle line:84%
I spent the last
several years of my life

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.330 align:middle line:90%
as a single mom of three boys.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.360 align:middle line:84%
I've raised them
mostly by myself.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.610 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
things to overcome,

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.400 align:middle line:84%
and I had to go through my
own obstacles to get here.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.670 align:middle line:84%
I came up in a
Catholic background.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.040 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of things
that made me the martyr.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.780 align:middle line:84%
I had abundance issues and
always put myself last.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And I had to come through that
stuff and overcome that stuff.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And as I did, I got to
grow in so many ways, not

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.160 align:middle line:84%
just spiritually, but I got
to see the world around me

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.060 align:middle line:84%
as my mirror, as the thing
that brought me information

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.770 align:middle line:84%
to help me know what
direction to go next.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And my journey has helped
me understand other people's

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.090 align:middle line:84%
stories and to help
people understand

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.890 align:middle line:84%
also that our feelings are
very important to be felt.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.610 align:middle line:84%
So much of society tells
us not to feel them.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And once we get
past that hurdle,

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.370 align:middle line:84%
once we get over
that hump, then we

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.450 align:middle line:84%
can get into the real truth
of who we are and love

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.380 align:middle line:90%
all the aspects of ourselves.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I hope to pass
on to my kids and to my clients,

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.890 align:middle line:84%
and as I move forward, continue
to give that to myself as well.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.940 align:middle line:90%


00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.360 align:middle line:84%
Sonsee contacted me
several months ago,

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.800 align:middle line:90%
and we did a session.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was an
extraordinary session.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.560 align:middle line:84%
A lot of answers and a lot of
healing came into that session.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And she contacted
me again recently

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.710 align:middle line:84%
to see if she could come back
in and get some more answers.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm just the
facilitator of this.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.170 align:middle line:90%
She is the healer.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.880 align:middle line:90%
She is the one with the answers.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.340 align:middle line:84%
The answers are
always inside of us.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.230 align:middle line:90%
We already have them.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.200 align:middle line:84%
This is just a
beautiful technique

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.860 align:middle line:84%
to get us to that place where
we can find those answers

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.105 align:middle line:84%
and get out of our own way and
let those answers come through.

00:06:45.105 --> 00:06:54.000 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.070 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for coming in.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.600 align:middle line:84%
It was so fun to
know that you're

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.060 align:middle line:84%
going to have a second session
and that the first one went well

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.860 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.180 align:middle line:84%
So what was it that you wanted
to come in for this time?

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I had so much
healing take place last time.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.800 align:middle line:84%
What I found was I did
experience my remission

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.380 align:middle line:84%
that I've worked for
years to achieve.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.120 align:middle line:90%
So I am in remission.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.030 align:middle line:90%
I am in remission.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.600 align:middle line:84%
I'd never asked the
question, why did

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.570 align:middle line:90%
I get the cancer to begin with?

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.097 align:middle line:84%
>> So we just dive
deeper into that?

00:07:31.097 --> 00:07:31.930 align:middle line:90%
>> We want to dive--

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:36.630 align:middle line:84%
I want to dive deeper into
that just so that I understand

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:41.040 align:middle line:84%
anything else that I need to
look into or work on because I

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.670 align:middle line:90%
thought I would die with this.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was on the
edge of remission,

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:48.840 align:middle line:84%
and I was there
for almost a year.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't figure
out what else to do.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, QHHT came to me,

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.260 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
brought me to you.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.540 align:middle line:90%
And here I am.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is a journey that
you've been on with the cancer

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.730 align:middle line:90%
and the tumor since 2015?

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:04.650 align:middle line:90%
>> 2015, yeah.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.950 align:middle line:84%
>> What kind of things have
been going on since your last

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:12.190 align:middle line:84%
session, and how things
have been for you?

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.200 align:middle line:90%
>> I've had a sense of peace.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.860 align:middle line:84%
So I could imagine
that people who

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:23.280 align:middle line:84%
have tendencies where they have
to hold on and control the tiger

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.440 align:middle line:84%
that they're holding,
that something like this

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.920 align:middle line:90%
would be really helpful.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.730 align:middle line:84%
>> So we'll ask for all
of it and check in where

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:33.570 align:middle line:84%
you're at with it and
see where we get with it.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:35.140 align:middle line:90%
>> So that is my big thing.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And I also have a
couple of questions

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:40.720 align:middle line:84%
that I would really
like to understand.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.669 align:middle line:90%
So I did prepare some for you.

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to go
over these in a minute.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>> There's one other story
that I have that as a kid,

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.360 align:middle line:84%
it started showing up
in the fifth grade.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen it as a repeating
pattern, even through adulthood.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.040 align:middle line:90%
I think that I am a good friend.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.350 align:middle line:84%
I think that
everything's going great.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, there's
no room at the table for me.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.140 align:middle line:84%
There's no incident
that triggers it.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And I find myself feeling
like I've been ghosted.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.960 align:middle line:90%
And I have no idea why.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And it leaves me wondering
what's wrong with me.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:16.460 align:middle line:90%
What have I done?

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And so I would really like to
understand, what part of that

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:20.300 align:middle line:90%
is it connected?

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Is there an originating
story somewhere

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.210 align:middle line:84%
I can trace back where
that story has come up,

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:27.850 align:middle line:90%
that same pattern?

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:32.240 align:middle line:84%
I can see it in subtle things
and in other taking shape,

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.950 align:middle line:90%
but it's a similar theme.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:38.700 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to just see if
there's any further there as

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:39.500 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>> So oh, I love this one.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.820 align:middle line:84%
What is my soul's
greatest, most unique gift?

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:46.850 align:middle line:90%
I'll dive into that.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:47.690 align:middle line:90%
I love those.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.455 align:middle line:84%
>> Just looking to see
if there's anything we

00:09:50.455 --> 00:09:52.670 align:middle line:84%
haven't talked about
in that question.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so that's
everything we talked about.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Anything else that
you might want to add?

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, actually.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:05.120 align:middle line:84%
I am still taking a
preventative blood thinner.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:11.050 align:middle line:84%
My goal is to no longer have
to take the blood thinner

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:16.660 align:middle line:84%
and to trust that I'm not
going to have a blood event.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Blood events are strokes,
heart attacks, aneurysms.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I often have strong
vibrations at night,

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.730 align:middle line:84%
and it keeps me awake
with the zappy twitches.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about this, the
legs, the restless legs.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Every night, say
probably six nights a week,

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:43.510 align:middle line:84%
I can feel it slowly, I can feel
the energy rise from my feet up

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:44.800 align:middle line:90%
my legs.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it'll go all
the way to my hips,

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:51.130 align:middle line:84%
like I'm standing in
some kind of radioactive

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.500 align:middle line:90%
or a pool of energy.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>> And this happens every night?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Every night.

00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually
I'll just get up,

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:03.460 align:middle line:90%
and I'll go downstairs and walk.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>> We got a lot of really
great questions here,

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.150 align:middle line:84%
follow-up stuff that's going
to add to that clarity.

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:12.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited about that.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>> You have any
questions about today?

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:15.850 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:20.590 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm more
at ease because I'm

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:22.040 align:middle line:90%
aware of the process.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:27.625 align:middle line:84%
>> But you also made it really
comfortable before as well.

00:11:27.625 --> 00:11:28.653 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, good.

00:11:28.653 --> 00:11:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Go with the first
thing that comes

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:31.930 align:middle line:90%
to mind when we get in there.

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Talk and talk a lot so that
I can get a great description

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.188 align:middle line:90%
of what you're experiencing.

00:11:36.188 --> 00:11:37.730 align:middle line:84%
If you feel like
you're making it up,

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.240 align:middle line:84%
don't worry about that
because that imagination is

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.530 align:middle line:90%
bringing that from somewhere.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.655 align:middle line:84%
And that helps you get
tapped into everything else.

00:11:43.655 --> 00:11:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And just kind of let go of
the trying and the wanting

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:48.710 align:middle line:84%
and get into the
playfulness of it.

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.820 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:49.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:50.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited.

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:51.460 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:57.180 align:middle line:90%


00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm pretty high up.

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:02.550 align:middle line:90%
It looks like aerial over land.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:05.630 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a city or a--

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.100 align:middle line:90%
but no skyscrapers.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.660 align:middle line:90%
Like, residential.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>> The first thing I want to do
with Sonsee is get her relaxed,

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:14.730 align:middle line:90%
get her very comfortable.

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:19.190 align:middle line:84%
What I noticed is as I was
bringing her into her lifetime,

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:21.960 align:middle line:84%
instead of her feet
being on the ground,

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.510 align:middle line:90%
she was actually floating.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>> It was like when you're
making a final approach in from

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:31.190 align:middle line:84%
the airplane, you can see
the grid of the streets where

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.840 align:middle line:84%
the different-- with the
different rows of houses.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.820 align:middle line:90%
So you're up at that level.

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there anything else in
that experience that you want

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:39.110 align:middle line:90%
to share?

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Looks to me like Mesa, like
where I was when I was a kid,

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.950 align:middle line:90%
born and raised.

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, and how do you
perceive yourself?

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel like I'm checking that
place out before I came down.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:57.740 align:middle line:90%
That's odd.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.430 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what it feels like
to me, what it looks like

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:05.480 align:middle line:84%
is that I'm scoping this place
out, like I'm house hunting

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.590 align:middle line:90%
or like I'm family shopping.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:08.940 align:middle line:90%
It's very weird.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.200 align:middle line:90%
But this is before I was born.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.270 align:middle line:84%
I recognize that
that is the house.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And I recognize
that is the street.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I'm there,
like that is where--

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:23.990 align:middle line:90%
like I knew I had to go there.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:27.350 align:middle line:84%
When I look at
the house, I think

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:30.770 align:middle line:84%
I was looking to
see if I could see

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:35.850 align:middle line:84%
what the family is like
without going into the house.

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:38.190 align:middle line:84%
At this point, I was
hovering over the house.

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:42.590 align:middle line:84%
What it felt like is that
I was checking it out

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:45.450 align:middle line:90%
before I was due to go there.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>> We pick our families when
we come into these lifetimes.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:52.730 align:middle line:84%
We pick the parents that
we're going to interact with

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.650 align:middle line:84%
and oftentimes
even the siblings.

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And they all play roles
for us in this life.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.200 align:middle line:90%
Family shopping.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what my--

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.470 align:middle line:90%
that's what it feels like to me.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.470 align:middle line:90%
OK, so what happens next?

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't go into the house.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:07.700 align:middle line:90%
I went back up.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:08.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell me about that.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>> I did not go up into a cloud.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm gone straight up into space.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.865 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm in the stars.

00:14:16.865 --> 00:14:18.450 align:middle line:90%
Mom wasn't ready for me yet.

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And the baby, the body
wasn't ready for my body yet.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:26.610 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't ready for me yet
to fully submerge or go in.

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:29.760 align:middle line:90%
And so I went back up to wait.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So your mother is
already pregnant with you?

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.963 align:middle line:84%
>> But you don't
hang out in the body?

00:14:35.963 --> 00:14:37.255 align:middle line:90%
>> Didn't hang out in the body.

00:14:37.255 --> 00:14:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Or maybe she
wasn't ready for me.

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So at what point do you
connect with your body?

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:49.760 align:middle line:84%
>> She wasn't ready for me all
the way because I'm not from--

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.936 align:middle line:90%
I was coming from--

00:14:51.936 --> 00:14:54.620 align:middle line:90%
oh, OK.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell me more.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.070 align:middle line:90%
You're coming from where?

00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:59.926 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm coming from Andromeda.

00:14:59.926 --> 00:15:00.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Ahh.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.380 align:middle line:84%
We hear a lot in
these sessions, how

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.690 align:middle line:84%
we come from these
other star systems

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:09.170 align:middle line:84%
and that the Earth is an
experience that we're having.

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I can't just go
straight into her body.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.200 align:middle line:84%
The frequency that I operate
as a soul into her body,

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.340 align:middle line:84%
it would be too hard
on her and the mother.

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Her little baby body as
she was preparing to come

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:25.790 align:middle line:84%
into wasn't ready for the full
integration of the soul yet.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:29.640 align:middle line:84%
We are a spiritual being
having a human experience.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And these are vehicles
that we are in.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.980 align:middle line:84%
These are containers
we're using.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.320 align:middle line:90%
And you're from Andromeda?

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And so why are you-- why are
you coming into the body?

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Ahh, I'm here
for the awakening.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you tell me about that?

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>> I heard the call.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>> You heard the call.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>> The great call that went out
to help with this big ascension.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:01.050 align:middle line:84%
The call is to bring Earth
from the third dimension

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:02.620 align:middle line:90%
to the fifth dimension.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's all of the
living beings, everything.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems to be a common
occurrence that people do

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.200 align:middle line:84%
remember coming from other
planetary systems into this

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.560 align:middle line:84%
world to help with
this ascension process.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:19.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Dolores Cannon
wrote a whole series on this.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:24.420 align:middle line:84%
OK, so how does that work when
you come into the human form

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.970 align:middle line:90%
to help with that awakening?

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:29.340 align:middle line:84%
What does that
look like for you?

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Can't remember shit.

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>> What are you
trying to remember?

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:36.640 align:middle line:90%
>> What I was supposed to do.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.970 align:middle line:90%
There's a veil.

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:42.070 align:middle line:84%
There's a curtain,
a wall between us

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:45.560 align:middle line:84%
that causes us to forget
where we come from,

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.180 align:middle line:84%
our past lives, the wisdom
of those past lives.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>> It's important to be in
the life that you're in.

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And if we were to remember
all the other lifetimes,

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:58.210 align:middle line:84%
we would constantly be in
the flow of those regrets

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:00.210 align:middle line:84%
and those things we would
have done differently,

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:02.627 align:middle line:84%
all the different things from
all the different lifetimes.

00:17:02.627 --> 00:17:03.770 align:middle line:90%
It would be overwhelming.

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>> But we have to
learn the hard way.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:10.369 align:middle line:84%
We don't get to bring all
of our-- all of our gifts.

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:13.819 align:middle line:84%
We have to discover
them in divine time.

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>> What kind of gifts did you
have before you came here?

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I know that I
work with energy.

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:25.400 align:middle line:84%
I believe that I am
traveling and defending.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you have to remember
in order for it to work?

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:31.260 align:middle line:90%
It's automatic.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a moment where you
can see Sonsee shift from being

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:40.945 align:middle line:90%
in her self, experiencing life.

00:17:40.945 --> 00:17:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
this shift where

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.210 align:middle line:84%
she starts talking about
herself in the third person.

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:48.080 align:middle line:84%
That's when you know you
are talking to the higher

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.950 align:middle line:90%
self, the subconscious mind.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:55.680 align:middle line:84%
Sonsee got-- Sonsee got
some additional help.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:59.070 align:middle line:84%
She's been able to
do a lot of clearing.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>> And her cancer.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>> That was a big block,
not just physically,

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:05.230 align:middle line:90%
not just physiologically.

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:06.740 align:middle line:90%
It opened doors for her.

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:07.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.440 align:middle line:90%
Why did she have the cancer?

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>> She knows the answer.

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:12.320 align:middle line:90%
The answer is with her.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:84%
She put herself last
for all of these years

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:18.370 align:middle line:84%
that she watched and
looked after her daughter

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:22.150 align:middle line:84%
and went through all of
her daughter's trials

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:25.750 align:middle line:84%
and tribulations and
heartaches and developments

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:29.620 align:middle line:90%
and took care of herself last.

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:34.960 align:middle line:84%
That included her wellness,
her mental health.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.680 align:middle line:90%
Everything was last for her.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:42.310 align:middle line:84%
The cancer came because she
kept ignoring the other signs.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:49.060 align:middle line:84%
She kept ignoring the warnings
to take time off, reprioritize,

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.580 align:middle line:90%
take care of yourself.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:59.150 align:middle line:84%
It helped her learn how to
let herself matter and learn

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:04.070 align:middle line:84%
to love all of the parts of
who she is, the parts that

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:06.690 align:middle line:90%
are perfectly imperfect.

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And they're not going to
be everyone's cup of tea.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.890 align:middle line:90%
But they're her.

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Is her journey with
the cancer done?

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:18.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:22.480 align:middle line:84%
Who is it that I'm
speaking with right now?

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>> You're speaking
with her higher self.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>> The higher self has explained
that the cancer was there

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:32.180 align:middle line:90%
as a block.

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:37.210 align:middle line:84%
It was there because I
always put myself last.

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:42.220 align:middle line:84%
It was there to teach
me to put myself higher.

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Anger, frustration,
hurt, pain, sadness, abuse,

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:51.040 align:middle line:84%
all those things, if they are
not processed properly and moved

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.550 align:middle line:84%
out of the body, they start
to create illness within us.

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:58.580 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious mind knows
where these illnesses came from,

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.580 align:middle line:84%
what was the hurt and
the pain behind that.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, we don't
know where these pains are

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:08.320 align:middle line:84%
coming from because they are old
or childhood or even past life.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And they get carried
over into this lifetime,

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:16.420 align:middle line:84%
or childhood gets buried and
then festers in the body.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And you don't even
realize what it is

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:21.230 align:middle line:90%
that's creating that illness.

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't advise that she
attempt to discontinue or taper

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:30.530 align:middle line:84%
back on her Topamax
at this time.

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:32.470 align:middle line:84%
She needs at least
another 60 days

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:35.560 align:middle line:84%
before we feel like she will
feel the difference when

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.120 align:middle line:90%
she's not taking that medicine.

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so she needs to be on
that for a little bit longer.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.190 align:middle line:90%
>> But there is an end to it?

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that she will feel
the difference in 60 days, yea.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So how do you go from
Andromeda to occupying the human

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:54.230 align:middle line:90%
form?

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm in a light body.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:57.750 align:middle line:90%
I travel all over the place.

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't need a craft.

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:01.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm a light warrior.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And we are working very heavily
on the pyramid grids that are

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:10.680 align:middle line:90%
located throughout the planet.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm connected to one
that is located over my home.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's not seen in third
dimension, but you can feel it.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's a pyramid, an
energy pyramid, above the home.

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:27.260 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many, many,
many, many pyramids.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And then there's 15
large pyramids and then

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:36.590 align:middle line:90%
3 magnanimous pyramids.

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>> And what do those do?

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>> They stack like this.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.190 align:middle line:90%
>> What's their purpose?

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>> They create a grid.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Think of a circuit
board, like a mother--

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.140 align:middle line:84%
like a motherboard
on a computer.

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And the energy flows
through, up and down.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.030 align:middle line:84%
We have the pyramids
that are all

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:57.520 align:middle line:84%
over the world and
the lightworkers

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.740 align:middle line:84%
that are strategically
positioned all over the world

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:03.940 align:middle line:84%
as well, supporting the grid
that these pyramids are also

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:04.940 align:middle line:90%
structured around.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:06.530 align:middle line:90%
I am working every night.

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:07.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm busy.

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And all of those
pyramids will turn

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.440 align:middle line:84%
into what is the
passageway into new Earth.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:18.200 align:middle line:84%
The role that I take as a light
warrior is that I am defending--

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm defending the light.

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:23.150 align:middle line:84%
We're going to where the dark
is, and we're alchemizing it.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:27.550 align:middle line:84%
If there are vulnerabilities on
the grid, we're protecting it.

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Sonsee talks a lot about who
she is when she's not in this

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:31.840 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.280 align:middle line:90%
And she's quite the warrior.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And she really sounds like
she loves this planet.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And she talks about
being that warrior.

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And that was really
relatable to me

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.080 align:middle line:90%
because I love this planet too.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's exciting to hear how
many people really are fighting

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:48.390 align:middle line:90%
for a better place to live.

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:51.770 align:middle line:84%
So you were talking about
Sonsee working at night.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Every night.

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, she was talking about
this energy that moves up

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:56.180 align:middle line:90%
through her feet.

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.205 align:middle line:84%
And she was wondering
what that was.

00:22:58.205 --> 00:23:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>> What she feels is
the energy rising up,

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:03.440 align:middle line:90%
all the way up to her waist.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.650 align:middle line:90%
It's the field.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm in the field.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.870 align:middle line:84%
So when she's awake and she
has to go down and walk,

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:10.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm still gone.

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.470 align:middle line:84%
But what she's feeling
is me in the field.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:16.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm working in the pyramid
grid, in the field,

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:20.160 align:middle line:84%
where there's rising all
the way up to her waist.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.270 align:middle line:90%
There is a grid.

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:22.650 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
out in the field,

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.990 align:middle line:84%
that's the space between
each of the pyramids.

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And that field is
filled with energy.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:31.820 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I'm wading in.

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So when she's
feeling that feeling,

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:37.360 align:middle line:84%
if she doesn't want that
feeling, she just wants to rest,

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.160 align:middle line:90%
it can go away.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.440 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.500 align:middle line:84%
I can arrange for
her to not feel that.

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:45.650 align:middle line:84%
She still doesn't quite
understand her role

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:46.710 align:middle line:90%
as a light warrior.

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:48.930 align:middle line:84%
She just knows that her
body is busy at night.

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:51.200 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
part of why she

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:56.670 align:middle line:84%
continues to want to participate
or feel or see on some level.

00:23:56.670 --> 00:24:00.890 align:middle line:84%
But I can help mute
the field energies.

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:02.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.200 align:middle line:90%
So she's been in the pyramids.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.290 align:middle line:90%
>> What's that like?

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:09.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Michael is the pyramid.

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:10.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Michael, her husband?

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:14.920 align:middle line:90%
What can you tell me about that?

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:19.220 align:middle line:84%
>> There are squads connected
to each pyramid around the grid,

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:20.710 align:middle line:90%
around the planet.

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Each squad is four
to five people,

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:25.170 align:middle line:90%
four to five lightworkers.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's two light workers
and two to three light warriors.

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And Michael is the light worker
that has built this pyramid.

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.390 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't know it.

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Sonsee didn't know
everything either, right?

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.760 align:middle line:90%
>> No, she didn't.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe he'll get
to remember, too.

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:49.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So why was it important
for them to be together?

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Or what brought
them together as--

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>> They came over
together from Andromeda.

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:59.670 align:middle line:84%
The lightworkers are
all ascended masters.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:00.870 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:02.070 align:middle line:90%
That sounds like a--

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:03.900 align:middle line:84%
sounds like it was
probably a good plan.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:05.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:08.220 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we have
some questions here

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.210 align:middle line:90%
that Sonsee wanted me to ask.

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:12.040 align:middle line:84%
I think we got a lot
of them answered,

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.750 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to
read them off anyway.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.510 align:middle line:84%
She had typed out
a list of questions

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:17.490 align:middle line:84%
that she was looking
for answers for.

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:20.800 align:middle line:84%
When she moved into
that subconscious mind,

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.710 align:middle line:84%
I knew I had access to
those answers for her.

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Since her last QHHT session,
she went into remission.

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>> She doesn't have to
worry about that anymore,

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.890 align:middle line:84%
I think is what you told her,
that she doesn't have to worry

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:33.270 align:middle line:90%
about it coming back.

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:37.200 align:middle line:84%
What else would be good
to tell her about that?

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>> She underwent quite a lot in
the last two years particularly,

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:47.010 align:middle line:84%
but I just want her to always
remember that her energetic bank

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:49.440 align:middle line:90%
account matters too always.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:53.490 align:middle line:84%
She does not need to put
herself last any longer.

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:56.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So what does it look like
when she's her authentic

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.840 align:middle line:90%
and true self?

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>> She's feisty.

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:00.860 align:middle line:90%
That's why she's a warrior.

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>> She's feisty, but she's
got a thirst for life.

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:06.880 align:middle line:84%
She's got a-- she's
got a funny wit.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And she's got just an
insatiable appetite to love.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Today was a big expression
of how important it was to love

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:19.120 align:middle line:84%
herself and to understand who
she is and to honor her feelings

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.400 align:middle line:84%
and how important she
is to this planet.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And we're all important
to this planet.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:28.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important to be
on that journey of self-love.

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:31.640 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what about the
gifts that she has?

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.770 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned a little
bit about it already,

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:38.500 align:middle line:84%
but could you go over her unique
gifts that she has as Sonsee?

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>> She came here as a
high-dimensional being.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And she came here to
do an amazing mission.

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And she is out there
every night traveling

00:26:53.110 --> 00:27:00.210 align:middle line:84%
across the astral plane
and defending the light.

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to the question she
has about ever since even

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:09.077 align:middle line:84%
fifth grade, she will get these
groups of friends or friends,

00:27:09.077 --> 00:27:11.160 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a sudden,
without warning, they're

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.060 align:middle line:90%
just not her friends anymore.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:14.880 align:middle line:90%
Why does that happen?

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not her fault. There is
nothing that she is doing that

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:19.500 align:middle line:90%
causes this.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:21.600 align:middle line:90%
It's her energy.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell me about that.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>> She is higher vibrational.

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:26.880 align:middle line:84%
The light that she gives
off, the positive energy

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.280 align:middle line:84%
that she gives off, is
off-putting to people

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.250 align:middle line:90%
who are struggling.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And she draws the
shadows out of people.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Ohh.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And then how do
they react to that?

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, at first,
they love her.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And then they don't feel
good about themselves.

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:43.920 align:middle line:90%
And then they start--

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.030 align:middle line:90%
they're lower self-esteem.

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:47.490 align:middle line:90%
They start to attack.

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:49.780 align:middle line:90%
She's not doing anything wrong.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:52.740 align:middle line:90%
It is that it stirs the--

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:57.060 align:middle line:84%
it stirs the insecurities
out in other people.

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there anything
there that--

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, she still
has heartache.

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:02.770 align:middle line:90%
Can we help her--

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>> She still has sadness there.

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:06.470 align:middle line:84%
It's right in the center
of the heart chakra.

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:09.500 align:middle line:84%
It's the part that keeps it
from shattering wide open.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:15.160 align:middle line:84%
It's the tiny-- it's the last,
tiniest little bit that remains,

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.470 align:middle line:90%
that keeps the lid on.

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:21.680 align:middle line:84%
So does that help--
that hurt to be heard?

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>> It does actually
feel like it's--

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:28.060 align:middle line:84%
I feel like she's more resil--
she's more receptive to it

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:29.980 align:middle line:90%
when I'm speaking through.

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:31.295 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

00:28:31.295 --> 00:28:32.095 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:28:32.095 --> 00:28:32.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Does it feel better now?

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.490 align:middle line:90%
It was an extraordinary session.

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:39.800 align:middle line:84%
She learned a lot about
herself, who she is,

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:43.000 align:middle line:84%
where she comes from, and
how to love herself and be

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.320 align:middle line:84%
her true version of
herself in this world.

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.250 align:middle line:84%
That's what I ask
for for my clients.

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:50.260 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't be happier
for her outcome.

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.010 align:middle line:84%
How long did you feel
like you're in that?

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:55.180 align:middle line:90%


00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Hour?

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>> You were in there
just over two hours.

00:28:58.780 --> 00:28:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:00.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.220 align:middle line:90%
I've had healing.

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.610 align:middle line:90%
I've had clarity that's come.

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:07.900 align:middle line:90%
I've had direction.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.980 align:middle line:84%
I've gained a sense of direction
and purpose in my life,

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:13.150 align:middle line:84%
where I felt like
I was floundering.

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:16.990 align:middle line:84%
I finally feel like I'm part
of something bigger than me.

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's not coming
from a place of ego.

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:23.160 align:middle line:84%
It's coming from a place of
importance for the greater good.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.690 align:middle line:84%
I feel this peace
that comes around me.

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:29.050 align:middle line:84%
I feel this comfort
and confidence.

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:30.460 align:middle line:90%
I know who I am.

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:33.760 align:middle line:84%
I know what direction
I'm headed in.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:37.813 align:middle line:84%
And that's a heck of a lot
better than where I was.

00:29:37.813 --> 00:29:41.250 align:middle line:90%

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:52.740 align:middle line:84%
It's been three weeks
since my QHHT session.

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that there are
quite a number of things

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:59.800 align:middle line:84%
that I have noticed that have
changed since that session.

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm at more peace with
things that I struggled

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.740 align:middle line:84%
to understand in the
past with regards

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.840 align:middle line:84%
to friendship dynamics
over the years.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.160 align:middle line:84%
What I felt in the past was that
I was left out without reason.

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like it was
answered, I have a reason,

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:19.470 align:middle line:84%
and that I'm no longer
connected emotionally

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:22.580 align:middle line:84%
to the reasoning why or the
pattern of it happening.

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:24.580 align:middle line:90%
It feels like a closed chapter.

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:26.640 align:middle line:90%
And then the vibrations.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.220 align:middle line:84%
I had so many issues
with sleeping at night

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:30.360 align:middle line:90%
with vibrations.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:33.180 align:middle line:84%
I could feel in my entire
body that kept me up.

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.860 align:middle line:84%
I am no longer feeling the
vibrations like I was before.

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:40.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's been a-- it's
been a big help for me.

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:45.070 align:middle line:84%
I definitely had a journey
into my soul, thanks to Tracie.

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And I look forward to everything
that continues to unfold for me.
