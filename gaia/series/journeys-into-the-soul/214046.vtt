that are at the same state

of consciousness.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.970 align:middle line:10%
That's why she keeps asking
questions of our futures,

things that she's seen before.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.210 align:middle line:90%
My name is Isabel Amat.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.569 align:middle line:90%
I'm 54.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:05.830 align:middle line:90%
I live in Madrid.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.760 align:middle line:84%
My expertise is marketing,
brand, and communications.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.930 align:middle line:90%


00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.060 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in Barcelona.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.030 align:middle line:90%
I was born there.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.960 align:middle line:84%
My family from ages
was born in Barcelona.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.140 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in a Catholic family
as the rest of the country.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.510 align:middle line:84%
After years of going
to mass and going

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.820 align:middle line:84%
through a lot of
religious experiences,

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.680 align:middle line:90%
I started asking me questions.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.590 align:middle line:84%
I started having these
feeling inside of me

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.700 align:middle line:84%
that I was not enough
comfortable with my religion.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.920 align:middle line:84%
I knew inside me that I had
to look for other places

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.380 align:middle line:90%
to find answers.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.400 align:middle line:84%
I started asking me questions
about where I came from,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.690 align:middle line:90%
what is the real reason of life.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.910 align:middle line:84%
So I was 30 when I
suddenly lost my mom.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And two years after
that, I lost my dad.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.564 align:middle line:10%
And I really felt
like lost in life.

00:02:08.564 --> 00:02:15.000 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.700 align:middle line:84%
One of my best friends, Arantxa,
gave me a book from Brian Weiss,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.520 align:middle line:90%
"Many Lives, Many Masters."

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And that was the moment when I
really started to understanding

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.150 align:middle line:84%
more about the reason why we
are here in this life, why

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.850 align:middle line:90%
this is part of a long journey.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.750 align:middle line:84%
From Brian Weiss, I
jumped to Michael Newton.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And wow, what a
discovery I found there.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.350 align:middle line:84%
My eyes were closed
until that moment.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, someone pulled
off a fabric from my eyes.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And I really discovered
how big the purpose

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.840 align:middle line:84%
of this life and previous
life and future lives.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know that everything
happens for a purpose.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Life is not always what you see,
what is in front of your life.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.180 align:middle line:84%
There's much more to
discover and to experience.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.270 align:middle line:90%
And this is where I am.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.340 align:middle line:90%


00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.310 align:middle line:84%
So I work with
Sanela in the past.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm super glad that
she works in Madrid.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm ready for one
new session of past life

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.360 align:middle line:90%
regressions.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.860 align:middle line:84%
All those sessions are
helping me to find out

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.670 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the answers
that I was looking

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.440 align:middle line:84%
in this life and a lot of the
reasons why things happen.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.380 align:middle line:84%
When you are in a
session, you feel it

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.500 align:middle line:84%
so deeply that when
you find a solution,

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.850 align:middle line:84%
you say, wow, how
could have I been stuck

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.230 align:middle line:84%
in this moment for
all this long time

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.900 align:middle line:84%
when having this different
approach of reading,

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.750 align:middle line:90%
I've been able to solve this.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.990 align:middle line:90%
And that was absolutely amazing.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:11.050 align:middle line:84%
My intention in this session is
to find out more about future

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.440 align:middle line:84%
and see how can I collaborate
and support others

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.705 align:middle line:90%
to grow as I'm growing.

00:04:16.705 --> 00:04:25.024 align:middle line:90%

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.230 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Sanela Covic.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.090 align:middle line:84%
I live in Madrid, Spain, and
I am a Life Between Lives

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.060 align:middle line:90%
facilitator.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.980 align:middle line:90%


00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.800 align:middle line:10%
Life Between Lives is
a regression modality

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.890 align:middle line:10%
where the clients are taken
into a deep level of trance

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.710 align:middle line:10%
with facilitators help to
reconnect with their soul

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.595 align:middle line:10%
and find the answers
they hold within.

00:05:09.595 --> 00:05:13.510 align:middle line:90%


00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.660 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in former Yugoslavia.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.660 align:middle line:84%
I lived a really happy
childhood, happy life.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.550 align:middle line:90%
And then the war broke out.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, your
friends are gone.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.380 align:middle line:84%
The war brought so much
fear when we were home

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.860 align:middle line:84%
and then we would hear
the sirens announcing

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.320 align:middle line:90%
air attack or RPG attack.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Many people still
live in that fear.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.630 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, I started
searching for a bigger

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.210 align:middle line:90%
meaning of life like, who am I?

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.060 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.520 align:middle line:84%
I started reading books,
different religions,

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.160 align:middle line:84%
to understand from
their point of view.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.590 align:middle line:84%
What's the purpose of a human
being on this planet, what

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:00.450 align:middle line:90%
are we here to do.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.177 align:middle line:90%


00:06:05.177 --> 00:06:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Right after I
finished high school,

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.020 align:middle line:84%
I applied for a
vacancy as interpreter

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.140 align:middle line:84%
in the first European
police mission in Mostar.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.260 align:middle line:84%
After 10 years as
interpreter in my country

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.610 align:middle line:84%
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, I decided
to change the course of my life

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.480 align:middle line:90%
and move to Spain.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.800 align:middle line:84%
I always wanted to help people,
so I certified as a coach.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.560 align:middle line:84%
I started exploring clinical
hypnosis, hypnotherapy,

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.450 align:middle line:84%
regression therapy,
past life regression.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.650 align:middle line:84%
I came across the title,
"Journey of Souls"

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.830 align:middle line:90%
by Matthew Newton.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.320 align:middle line:84%
I read that book, and I
said, I want to do this.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.520 align:middle line:84%
I want to help people reconnect
with their purpose, understand

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.079 align:middle line:90%
what they are here to do.

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:55.600 align:middle line:90%

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.150 align:middle line:90%
I have three children.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And we all live here with
my husband in Madrid.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.730 align:middle line:84%
We come from
different countries.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.040 align:middle line:84%
We live in a third
country, totally different

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.180 align:middle line:90%
from our own origins.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.820 align:middle line:84%
You can hear four different
languages at our home.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.060 align:middle line:84%
But everybody
understands each other.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a little
global village.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And that helps us as well
expand and understand each other

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.220 align:middle line:90%
and have more compassion.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.830 align:middle line:84%
We are connected
with the purpose

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.440 align:middle line:84%
and everybody is
here for a reason.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:36.070 align:middle line:84%
We will heal, and our healing
will help others heal.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.140 align:middle line:84%
I worked with Isabel
two years ago.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And she is back for another
Life Between Lives session

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.760 align:middle line:84%
where I can help her find the
answers she is looking for

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.700 align:middle line:84%
and reconnect with
her soul self.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:08:01.030 align:middle line:90%


00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Welcome, Isabel, and it's
such a pleasure having you

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.553 align:middle line:90%
and working with you again.

00:08:07.553 --> 00:08:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the first time that
we'll do a session together

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.130 align:middle line:90%
in English.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:16.570 align:middle line:84%
So I understand that it's
been some time since we last

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:17.770 align:middle line:90%
saw each other.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.170 align:middle line:84%
So would you like to
share a little bit, what

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:21.800 align:middle line:90%
brings you back today?

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know that I
experienced these sessions

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.950 align:middle line:90%
together as a way to grow.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:32.630 align:middle line:10%
After the session, I work on
what the sessions have brought,

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:38.080 align:middle line:10%
and I try to understand the
whys and to find answers.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.659 align:middle line:84%
And I think that I'm
now at this moment,

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:43.309 align:middle line:90%
I want to have another session.

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:46.400 align:middle line:84%
I want to know, I
have more questions.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:52.000 align:middle line:10%
And I know that you will
help me to find the answers

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.060 align:middle line:10%
and to understand what
I'm looking for today.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.620 align:middle line:84%
What would you like to
get in today's session?

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:04.640 align:middle line:84%
What is it that you would
really like to take away?

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm always
looking for guidance.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:11.150 align:middle line:84%
I know that everything
happens for a reason.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you are
stuck in a situation

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:20.870 align:middle line:84%
because you try to understand
the situation through your eyes.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And the solution is just
to take some distance

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:30.110 align:middle line:84%
and try to look at what is
happening from different eyes

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:33.770 align:middle line:84%
and from another
dimension of perspective.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:39.110 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn how to solve
the situation to move on.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>> This journey is all about
reconnecting with the soul.

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.440 align:middle line:84%
The soul already
has all the answers.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.290 align:middle line:10%
But sometimes when we
are in this human body,

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:52.440 align:middle line:10%
we are not always prepared
to receive those answers

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.880 align:middle line:10%
at the specific time.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.240 align:middle line:84%
It takes time to
settle the information,

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.720 align:middle line:84%
to ground what we
experience in the spirit

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.990 align:middle line:90%
world in this human body.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:06.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful way of
expanding and growing

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.420 align:middle line:84%
and learning and
enjoying the ride.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.040 align:middle line:90%
We are here to enjoy.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Enjoying the ride.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:14.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Enjoy the ride.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.080 align:middle line:90%
It's bumpy.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.200 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's good.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.000 align:middle line:90%
>> I like that.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:17.800 align:middle line:90%
>> It's fun.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:18.790 align:middle line:90%
It's hard.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.250 align:middle line:90%
But it's just another ride.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:24.550 align:middle line:90%
And you've been here before, so.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, there are different
questions concerning the planet.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And your role in
this whole shift

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.600 align:middle line:90%
that's happening in the future.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, there's some meaning
behind this tough moment that we

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.390 align:middle line:10%
have provoked to Mother Earth.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Is there a way
that we can release

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.620 align:middle line:84%
to help the situation
improve and we really need

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:55.720 align:middle line:90%
to fight together to solve it?

00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
the new dimension.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.940 align:middle line:90%
It's not about our egos anymore.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.720 align:middle line:10%
It's about community,
about prosperity,

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:13.780 align:middle line:10%
but in a different way, in
a way that helps us to grow.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.390 align:middle line:90%
And I think we are on the way.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm really excited to
hear the answers you will get

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.310 align:middle line:90%
to that.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Then we have a
question about where

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:31.570 align:middle line:84%
everything was born, like where
is the origin of everything.

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>> I have a curious mind.

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:37.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm always asking
a lot of questions.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm a communication person.

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:46.150 align:middle line:10%
And I think the more information
we get about where everything

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:51.250 align:middle line:10%
started, the origin of
human beings of the planet,

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.890 align:middle line:10%
if we got that
information, it can help

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:57.940 align:middle line:10%
us to think about the future.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.110 align:middle line:84%
>> So by understanding this,
what they are going to share

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:08.450 align:middle line:84%
today, how will this
help Isabel in this life?

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:13.080 align:middle line:84%
If you don't want to or
wish to add anything else,

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.620 align:middle line:84%
we can make a short
break now, and we

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.660 align:middle line:90%
will prepare for the session.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfectly.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:20.775 align:middle line:90%
Can't wait, Sanela.

00:12:20.775 --> 00:12:30.440 align:middle line:90%


00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And let me know what is
the first thing you notice.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:38.510 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm a little
baby, five years old.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:40.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Five years old?

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.560 align:middle line:10%
A girl.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:46.410 align:middle line:10%
I'm in a park and my
family's a poor family,

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:50.730 align:middle line:10%
we don't have money for food.

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:56.300 align:middle line:10%
And on I'm in this
park, playground,

00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:04.640 align:middle line:10%
looking at another beautiful
girl like me, very well-dressed.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>> She finds herself
in the playground.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And I really wanted to
get more information.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:13.310 align:middle line:10%
>> I can feel that
this girl is lucky.

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:16.850 align:middle line:10%
And she has everything
she wants and needs.

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:23.360 align:middle line:10%
My clothes are very
simple and old.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Who is there with you?

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.840 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't see anyone
from my family,

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.860 align:middle line:10%
but it's a familiar
place for me.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:37.480 align:middle line:10%
I often go there to
play, and my mom knows.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.570 align:middle line:10%
It's just that they
work all the time.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:45.480 align:middle line:10%
And they give me the freedom
to go to a nearby playground

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.190 align:middle line:10%
for kids.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Being born in
a humble family,

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:54.460 align:middle line:84%
my parents were hard
to get some money.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Feeling gratitude
to them, but also

00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:00.360 align:middle line:84%
admiring another possible
life or situation

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.110 align:middle line:90%
that I could have been born in.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:05.850 align:middle line:10%
>> I know the year.

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:08.100 align:middle line:10%
It's 1930.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>> 1930.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.310 align:middle line:90%
What do they call you?

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.310 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell me your name?

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Tea.

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:18.670 align:middle line:10%
T-E-A. Yes, Tea.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:19.795 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:14:19.795 --> 00:14:20.595 align:middle line:90%
Tea.

00:14:20.595 --> 00:14:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't remember.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:24.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't have any
friends with this name.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:29.305 align:middle line:90%
And Tea showed up, very easily.

00:14:29.305 --> 00:14:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>> I would like you to go now
to another scene in that life,

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:36.800 align:middle line:90%
to the next important event.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Wait, I know why I am
looking at the other girl.

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>> At the moment when I want
to move her forward to see what

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:46.615 align:middle line:84%
else is in that
life, she stops me.

00:14:46.615 --> 00:14:48.810 align:middle line:10%
>> This other girl is my mom.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:51.540 align:middle line:10%


00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:52.780 align:middle line:10%
I know it doesn't make sense.

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:53.680 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.230 align:middle line:10%
Just take a deep breath.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:59.270 align:middle line:10%
I recognize her mom, my grandma.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.596 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:15:00.596 --> 00:15:03.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Who will be my grandma.

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Usually, you are
brought to a place

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and you have something
to find out or to learn.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And then when Sanela asked me
to move on I said, no, wait.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.705 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at that girl
again and I recognized my mom.

00:15:15.705 --> 00:15:18.470 align:middle line:10%
I'm seeing my mom
at the playground.

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:19.270 align:middle line:10%
Whoa.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.560 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, tell me more.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:26.820 align:middle line:10%
>> My mom is always
looking at her by her side.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.540 align:middle line:10%
>> And I compare all the time.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.800 align:middle line:10%
Because I'm always there alone.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:38.290 align:middle line:10%
And because I just
like to see her happy.

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:42.160 align:middle line:10%
And I know that
she will be my mom,

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.290 align:middle line:10%
but I won't see her anymore.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Move to the next
moment in your life.

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:49.140 align:middle line:90%
Important moment.

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:51.442 align:middle line:10%
>> I have a short life.

00:15:51.442 --> 00:15:54.060 align:middle line:10%
We got ill, all the family.

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:54.860 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:58.332 align:middle line:10%
We don't have money
for medicines.

00:15:58.332 --> 00:16:02.310 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of kids died.

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>> How old are you on this day?

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:07.832 align:middle line:10%
>> Before 10, eight maybe.

00:16:07.832 --> 00:16:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Eight.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.120 align:middle line:90%
Around eight.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:16.150 align:middle line:10%
>> I always knew that I
would have a short life.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.515 align:middle line:10%
>> Tell me more about that.

00:16:18.515 --> 00:16:25.290 align:middle line:10%
>> A short experience in a human
body is the contrast of all

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:32.260 align:middle line:10%
our life experiences where
I'm dying old, very old.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>> The souls pick a
specific length of the life,

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.740 align:middle line:84%
depending on the lessons
or teachings that are about

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:40.540 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:46.780 align:middle line:84%
>> She had had other life
experiences with long, long,

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.760 align:middle line:90%
long years to come.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>> When you look back
now at that life,

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.325 align:middle line:90%
how was that life for you?

00:16:54.325 --> 00:17:00.110 align:middle line:10%
>> I was there
supporting the family.

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:03.380 align:middle line:10%
I was there helping.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:09.010 align:middle line:10%
They wanted to
experience a short life.

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:11.965 align:middle line:10%
So it was more for
them than for me.

00:17:11.965 --> 00:17:13.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.790 align:middle line:10%
>> The life experiences that
we have are not only for us,

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:21.269 align:middle line:10%
for other soul purposes.

00:17:21.269 --> 00:17:22.270 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:29.030 align:middle line:10%
>> We want to support other
souls in their journeys

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.280 align:middle line:10%
as souls.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:35.480 align:middle line:84%
We get reincarnated
within our group of souls.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.540 align:middle line:90%
They support us.

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Some others we are the ones
who support our soul mates

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:45.370 align:middle line:84%
in their decision
about the lessons

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.710 align:middle line:84%
to learn in other
life experiences.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm now going to move
her from the end of that life.

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:55.730 align:middle line:84%
I want to ask her
what happens next.

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:58.390 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm flying.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:03.180 align:middle line:10%
The light is warm, recharges me.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.640 align:middle line:10%
I wait for my masters
to pick me up.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.930 align:middle line:10%
I know my guides are
there waiting for me

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:15.280 align:middle line:10%
and they're just giving me time.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.740 align:middle line:10%
It's a recharging moment.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:20.460 align:middle line:10%
It's a moment with myself.

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:24.615 align:middle line:10%
It takes time to adapt
when you leave a body.

00:18:24.615 --> 00:18:28.770 align:middle line:10%
>> After especially difficult
life or difficult death,

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.840 align:middle line:10%
the soul needs some
time to recharge.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.150 align:middle line:84%
So the guides will
come after the soul

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:34.820 align:middle line:90%
is prepared, is recharged.

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>> You need that moment with
yourself to understand what has

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.780 align:middle line:84%
just happened, to extract the
meaning of that life and that

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.040 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.760 align:middle line:10%
My guide is with me.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.720 align:middle line:10%
Elias.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.535 align:middle line:10%
>> Elias is there.

00:18:51.535 --> 00:18:55.110 align:middle line:10%
>> And he says I was
there all the time.

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:59.370 align:middle line:10%
I was just letting
you have your moment.

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:01.380 align:middle line:10%
You're never alone.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:06.150 align:middle line:10%
And I'm here with you when you
have requested my presence.

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>> By placing attention
to something like OK,

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:15.370 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk with my guide,
or just saying their names,

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:19.920 align:middle line:84%
her guides wanted to show her
that they can always be there

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:24.030 align:middle line:84%
when she mentally connects
with them intentionally.

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:27.310 align:middle line:90%
Can you describe him?

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:31.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Elias is my angel.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:39.060 align:middle line:10%
My main angel, my
protection angel, my guide.

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:43.200 align:middle line:10%
He's super big, and giant.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:48.840 align:middle line:10%
Amazing, big, long wings.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:55.740 align:middle line:10%
He also has a body
with arms to hug me.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.710 align:middle line:10%
Always smiling.

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:02.500 align:middle line:84%
The first thing that I
perceive from him is his light.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:08.130 align:middle line:84%
He's just hugging me with these
huge wings full of feathers.

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:11.430 align:middle line:10%
He says that life was short.

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:14.885 align:middle line:10%
Is it that you wanted
to see me again soon?

00:20:14.885 --> 00:20:17.760 align:middle line:10%


00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.340 align:middle line:10%
Laughing and joking.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.000 align:middle line:10%
He says you did well.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:22.800 align:middle line:10%
Really well.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>> There is no judgment.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:27.090 align:middle line:10%
The guides are loving
beings who are just

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:31.600 align:middle line:10%
waiting for us to be ready
to move to the next level.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:37.750 align:middle line:10%
>> I just tell Elias I'm
so happy to be with him.

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:43.050 align:middle line:10%
And he says, you can contact
me every time you need someone.

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:45.660 align:middle line:10%
I'm always with you all around.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:49.290 align:middle line:10%
We are in close
communication all the time.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:52.230 align:middle line:10%
And also with the
rest of your guides.

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:54.870 align:middle line:10%
You have thousands of guides.

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:58.740 align:middle line:10%
We are always all connected.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:03.030 align:middle line:10%
He says that I'm always asking,
how can I connect with them.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:03.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.290 align:middle line:10%
>> We are energy, remember.

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:10.320 align:middle line:10%
Most of the times,
while we are humans,

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:14.790 align:middle line:10%
we make everything
difficult as humans

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:20.340 align:middle line:10%
and we completely forget
to connect with them.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:25.620 align:middle line:10%
You humans try to
complicate everything.

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:29.220 align:middle line:10%
Thoughts are powerful.

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:32.670 align:middle line:10%
Don't waste time worrying.

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:34.200 align:middle line:10%
Just enjoy.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.540 align:middle line:10%
And he laughs.

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:41.402 align:middle line:10%
He's there ha, ha,
ha, like always.

00:21:41.402 --> 00:21:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>> We as humans
complicate everything.

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes things
are really simple.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Just think about the name and
you are connected already.

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:52.880 align:middle line:90%
So this is beautiful.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.460 align:middle line:90%
It's so simple.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:59.925 align:middle line:84%
Can you ask him to explain how
to generate proper thought?

00:21:59.925 --> 00:22:06.670 align:middle line:10%
>> He says that we attract
energy through our thought

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:09.030 align:middle line:10%
vibration.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:14.130 align:middle line:10%
If we don't generate
the proper thought,

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:18.750 align:middle line:10%
we may attract
what we don't want.

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:21.600 align:middle line:10%
And he says, I know
this is not easy.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.730 align:middle line:10%
It's difficult to
change your mind

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:28.410 align:middle line:10%
and start having
positive thoughts.

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:31.740 align:middle line:10%
but that is the way it works.

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.590 align:middle line:10%
We are all lighthouses.

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:37.680 align:middle line:10%
We are energy.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:42.660 align:middle line:10%
We are also receivers
of energy, and we also

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.400 align:middle line:10%
share energy all the time.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.620 align:middle line:10%
It's about vibrations.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:50.250 align:middle line:10%
When you are
experiencing problems,

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:58.050 align:middle line:10%
try to meditate in
pure white light.

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:00.960 align:middle line:10%
Don't let a bad
situation in your life

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.710 align:middle line:10%
take you down because then
your thoughts will be negative

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:08.330 align:middle line:10%
and then you are in
this hamster wheel.

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:10.850 align:middle line:10%


00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:17.750 align:middle line:10%
Try to imagine yourself
being a lighthouse.

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:19.050 align:middle line:10%
Stay positive.

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:20.620 align:middle line:10%
Stay positive.

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>> We are all energy.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is really clear when
we are in the spirit world.

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.990 align:middle line:90%
We connect with this knowing.

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:28.060 align:middle line:90%
We connect with wisdom.

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:33.620 align:middle line:84%
>> You can be in need of energy
and you receive it to improve

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:37.910 align:middle line:84%
your knowledge, but you are also
sharing what you are learning

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:41.960 align:middle line:90%
to others in the form of energy.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.620 align:middle line:90%
So it makes a perfect system.

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Isabel came to this
session with some questions.

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:54.180 align:middle line:84%
If it's OK, if it is the
right place now to ask.

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.580 align:middle line:10%
>> They are laughing.

00:23:55.580 --> 00:24:04.270 align:middle line:10%
They say she's asking
for this for long time.

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:08.960 align:middle line:10%
And this means that she's
ready to get these answers.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>> She really wanted to know
about the origins about where

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.680 align:middle line:90%
everything was born.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.180 align:middle line:10%
>> This universe has no limit.

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:23.140 align:middle line:10%
We are tiny parts of it.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:29.050 align:middle line:10%
The source is energy and love.

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:33.850 align:middle line:10%
And from that source
was everything created.

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:39.140 align:middle line:10%
They say this is about evolution
in all levels and in all senses,

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.700 align:middle line:10%
and you are not alone.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:50.660 align:middle line:10%
There are a lot of guides
and very high energies that

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:55.740 align:middle line:10%
are helping and supporting.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.690 align:middle line:10%
They always say
you are not alone.

00:24:57.690 --> 00:24:58.570 align:middle line:10%
You are not alone.

00:24:58.570 --> 00:24:59.960 align:middle line:90%
You are not alone.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes we feel alone, but
this is just another reminder

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:05.720 align:middle line:90%
that we are not alone.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.490 align:middle line:84%
There are always guides
there to help you.

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:15.955 align:middle line:84%
>> What is Isabel's role in this
critical point in the evolution?

00:25:15.955 --> 00:25:19.140 align:middle line:10%
>> She's from the future.

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.070 align:middle line:10%
She has experienced
these other dimensions.

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:25.800 align:middle line:10%
There are a lot
of souls that are

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:29.800 align:middle line:10%
at the same state
of consciousness.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:33.990 align:middle line:10%
That's why she keeps
asking questions

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:38.900 align:middle line:10%
about future because
she can recognize things

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.520 align:middle line:10%
that she's seen before.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:47.555 align:middle line:10%
All the souls evolve from
following their curiosity.

00:25:47.555 --> 00:25:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Curiosity exists
and has always existed.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:55.230 align:middle line:84%
It's totally natural and
logical that the soul will also

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:57.720 align:middle line:90%
develop through curiosity.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Is it now a good
moment to reconnect

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:04.443 align:middle line:90%
with those beautiful souls.

00:26:04.443 --> 00:26:07.082 align:middle line:90%


00:26:07.082 --> 00:26:09.520 align:middle line:10%
>> One of my masters, Khun--

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.390 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:18.970 align:middle line:10%
>> K-H-U-N, Khun is the master
of balance, and he says,

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:21.340 align:middle line:10%
slow down, baby, slow down.

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.955 align:middle line:10%
You've been in the future,
but you live in the present.

00:26:23.955 --> 00:26:27.040 align:middle line:90%


00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.130 align:middle line:10%
Take a breath.

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:32.940 align:middle line:10%
You don't need
anybody to push you,

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:36.380 align:middle line:10%
you're pushing yourself alone.

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.240 align:middle line:10%
Also recommend me
don't go too fast.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.740 align:middle line:10%
Just enjoy the moment sometimes.

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:42.480 align:middle line:10%
Just stop and think.

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.985 align:middle line:10%
>> Enjoy the moment.

00:26:43.985 --> 00:26:47.270 align:middle line:10%
>> And live life, yeah.

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:53.330 align:middle line:84%
That was like, when somebody
stop you and remembers you

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:55.310 align:middle line:84%
that you have to
live the moment.

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:56.940 align:middle line:90%
Don't go too fast.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:00.325 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's
better to slow down.

00:27:00.325 --> 00:27:03.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The sessions are always
about the current life,

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.000 align:middle line:84%
about our learnings,
about experiences.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.930 align:middle line:84%
She is coming from the future,
but what does it mean for her?

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:13.850 align:middle line:84%
It means that she needs to slow
down because she already knows

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:16.020 align:middle line:90%
it, knows what will happen.

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.260 align:middle line:84%
But she just needs to
slow down a little bit

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:19.830 align:middle line:90%
and to enjoy the ride.

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:23.580 align:middle line:10%
>> She has too much energy.

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:30.900 align:middle line:10%
She's always ready
for what's next.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:36.650 align:middle line:10%
And it's a common trait
in the group of souls

00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:38.180 align:middle line:10%
that she is part of.

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:39.890 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:43.680 align:middle line:10%
I need to slow down
them most of the time.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.020 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you could
name the group,

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.180 align:middle line:84%
what would be the
name of the group?

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:52.250 align:middle line:10%
>> He says, the energetic group.

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:55.180 align:middle line:10%
I don't see any other
name that fits better.

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Energetic group.

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:59.000 align:middle line:90%


00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.070 align:middle line:90%
She's really pure energy.

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And then we find that she
belongs to the energetic group.

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:06.175 align:middle line:90%
So what are the odds.

00:28:06.175 --> 00:28:09.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess, that I am part
of the energetic group

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:11.310 align:middle line:90%
because it's the way I am.

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:12.600 align:middle line:90%
I never stop.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.350 align:middle line:90%
I love sport.

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:15.150 align:middle line:90%
I run.

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:18.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm very fast with my movements.

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:21.610 align:middle line:90%
I am always ready to move.

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:25.425 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you feel about
all that you have learned?

00:28:25.425 --> 00:28:27.590 align:middle line:10%
>> I feel that I'm loved.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:34.620 align:middle line:10%
That I'm lucky to be surrounded
by friends and family.

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:42.160 align:middle line:10%
I feel excited about
challenges in the future,

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:50.760 align:middle line:10%
but I feel ready to
support and help others.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:51.900 align:middle line:10%
Everything is fine.

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:54.300 align:middle line:10%
They say everything's fine.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.700 align:middle line:10%
Learning is endless.

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.555 align:middle line:10%
It never finishes.

00:28:57.555 --> 00:29:00.540 align:middle line:10%
>> This was all about balance.

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:04.845 align:middle line:84%
All about taking a moment and
slow down and enjoy the present.

00:29:04.845 --> 00:29:12.180 align:middle line:10%
>> This session today was so
helpful because it helped me

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:17.560 align:middle line:10%
make sense of a lot of the
things that I experience in this

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:18.360 align:middle line:10%
life.

Because it gives me a lot
of confidence in myself

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:25.990 align:middle line:84%
and the gratitude
that now I feel,

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:28.810 align:middle line:84%
the deep understanding
that I got.

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And I can't wait for the
next challenges of my life.

>> How long do you
think this session was?

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Two, three hours?

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:39.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Almost four, actually.

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Stop, find balance, live in the
present, and enjoy the ride.

>> So it's been two weeks from
my session, and I feel great.

00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:00.670 align:middle line:90%
I learned I'm from the future.

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can explain
a lot of things

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.850 align:middle line:90%
that are happening in my life.

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Why I feel attracted by
technology, by innovation.

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.410 align:middle line:84%
I come from an
energetic group, which

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:13.610 align:middle line:84%
means that we are
full of energy,

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:17.710 align:middle line:84%
always ready for action, always
pushing to learn and to know

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:21.070 align:middle line:84%
more about people we
cross, about everything

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:23.450 align:middle line:90%
that claims our attention.

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And it really, really, really
makes me think about me

00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:36.250 align:middle line:84%
the way I am today because it's
exactly what the Masters define.

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:41.800 align:middle line:84%
The session really showed me
how far we can go as souls,

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:47.920 align:middle line:84%
and how much we have to
grow and learn in every life

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.230 align:middle line:90%
that we are experiencing.

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And what it really,
really taught

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:58.760 align:middle line:84%
me is that we will
never, never be alone.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:02.630 align:middle line:84%
Everything happens
because of a reason.

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:03.780 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Sanela.

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.140 align:middle line:84%
I really have a
journey into my soul,

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:10.160 align:middle line:84%
and I'm excited for what
the future awaits for us.
