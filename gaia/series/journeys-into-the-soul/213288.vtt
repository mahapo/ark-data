00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.740 align:middle line:90%
My name is Scott Cowles.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm 45 years of age.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm a business owner.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.310 align:middle line:84%
I own a waste clearance
company in Bristol, UK.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>> In my 20s, I
probably lost my way.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.410 align:middle line:84%
I think I spent far too
much time in the pub.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And with that, cocaine
became involved.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.580 align:middle line:84%
So it was a place
where I certainly

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.620 align:middle line:90%
didn't feel great in myself.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.350 align:middle line:84%
I went from job to job because
I never really kept one

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.280 align:middle line:90%
for too long.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.770 align:middle line:84%
I was six months here,
six months there,

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.905 align:middle line:84%
scaffolding, roofing,
ground working.

00:01:57.905 --> 00:02:01.710 align:middle line:84%
I just was never happy and
always moaning about bosses,

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.670 align:middle line:90%
how bad they were.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And then my dad one day said
to me, well, if you're so good,

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.480 align:middle line:84%
why don't you get
your own business

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.375 align:middle line:84%
and then stop complaining
about other people,

00:02:08.375 --> 00:02:10.860 align:middle line:84%
and take a bit of
responsibility for yourself?

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.870 align:middle line:84%
which I didn't like at the
time because it was the truth.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.550 align:middle line:84%
My family owned a waste
transfer station in Bristol,

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.230 align:middle line:84%
so I always felt there was
an opening in the market.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.260 align:middle line:84%
I borrowed 2,500
pounds off my dad,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.180 align:middle line:84%
and then I bought
an old banger van.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.240 align:middle line:84%
So I went off like
a Gypo, and [LAUGHS]

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.440 align:middle line:84%
had a go to try and
make my fortune.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.520 align:middle line:90%
It was hard.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.620 align:middle line:84%
It was very, very
hard to start with.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.070 align:middle line:84%
Lots of times, I thought to
myself, should I give up?

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Because I was earning less
than what I was earning before.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.500 align:middle line:90%
I was probably working more.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.200 align:middle line:84%
It was times where things were
hard, and then you were like,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.110 align:middle line:90%
is it worth it?

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.360 align:middle line:90%
But in the back of your mind--

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.120 align:middle line:84%
I was always-- if I keep
pushing, I can be my own boss.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.185 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be
someone's slave.

00:02:56.185 --> 00:02:59.562 align:middle line:90%

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.380 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot changed
for me around when

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.110 align:middle line:84%
I started having my
business, which then gave me

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.530 align:middle line:90%
my first bit of confidence.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And then I started to
train in martial arts more.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.250 align:middle line:84%
So I started quite late in
my life where, I would say,

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.413 align:middle line:90%
seriously I took it at about 29.

00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:27.330 align:middle line:84%
Where I would have usually
been in a nightclub

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Friday, Saturday, and
Sunday, I was then

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.220 align:middle line:84%
in the gym, Friday, Saturday,
Sunday, and all the week.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.110 align:middle line:84%
It gave me confidence to
be more bold in business

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.560 align:middle line:90%
and believe in yourself.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.475 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to prove to
myself I could do it.

00:03:40.475 --> 00:03:41.850 align:middle line:84%
I could get the
best out of this.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.560 align:middle line:90%
I can be the best version of me.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.570 align:middle line:84%
That was probably a newer start
on to a newer evolution of me.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.088 align:middle line:84%
And then my business
started to flourish as well.

00:03:52.088 --> 00:03:53.880 align:middle line:10%
But one of the things
I didn't particularly

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.330 align:middle line:10%
like what I was doing was when
things were going wrong in work,

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.390 align:middle line:10%
whether it was too much
or if it was too less,

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.930 align:middle line:10%
I could get very stressed.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that didn't
bring the best out in me.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.100 align:middle line:90%


00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And then, I suppose, I started
looking more into spirituality.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.440 align:middle line:84%
The next phase was to
try to do hypnotherapy.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.720 align:middle line:10%
So on Instagram, I met a
lady called Triona Sheeran.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.060 align:middle line:10%
So then Triona
Sheeran recommended

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.660 align:middle line:10%
a lady called Ellemiek
Drucker, and she works out

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:26.620 align:middle line:10%
of Glastonbury.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.753 align:middle line:84%
And here I am for
my session today.

00:04:29.753 --> 00:04:32.170 align:middle line:84%
I've actually been quite nervous
and quite looking forward

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.650 align:middle line:90%
to working with Ellemiek.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.440 align:middle line:90%
I feel like it's the right time.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And I just feel like with work
sometimes, I get so overwhelmed.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's too busy or if
it's too quiet, I'm like,

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.880 align:middle line:90%
how am I going to get this done?

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.880 align:middle line:84%
How's the guys' wages
going to happen this week?

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And I can feel my health
deteriorating from it.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.260 align:middle line:84%
I just felt as soon as I
made contact with Ellemiek,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.150 align:middle line:84%
I instantly felt,
yeah, this is right.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.605 align:middle line:84%
And I think this could be
another change for me again.

00:04:58.605 --> 00:05:03.890 align:middle line:90%

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.385 align:middle line:84%
>> Glastonbury is
a unique place.

00:05:17.385 --> 00:05:18.760 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the
only place in UK

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.070 align:middle line:84%
where you can smell the
incense as you walk down

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.870 align:middle line:90%
the high street.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:22.750 align:middle line:90%
There's crystal shop.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.160 align:middle line:90%
There's witchy shops.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.850 align:middle line:90%
There's people having workshops.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.560 align:middle line:90%
It's a magical, beautiful place.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.400 align:middle line:84%
It attracts people
interested in spirituality,

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.250 align:middle line:84%
people interested in who they
are, why they're here, how they

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.460 align:middle line:90%
can contribute to the world.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.730 align:middle line:90%
My name is Ellemiek Druker.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm a regression therapist
based on the Isle of Wight,

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.290 align:middle line:84%
and I also work
out of Glastonbury.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.450 align:middle line:10%
In regression therapy,
we take people back

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.070 align:middle line:10%
to the source of the problem.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.770 align:middle line:10%
We use hypnosis to
relax them a little bit,

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:51.940 align:middle line:10%
and then we just go back.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.790 align:middle line:10%
We trace the problem back to
where it very first began,

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.680 align:middle line:10%
whether that's in the current
life or in a past life.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And whenever we
find that source,

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.320 align:middle line:84%
we just work to resolve
it so that problem doesn't

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.440 align:middle line:90%
have to keep coming back.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.380 align:middle line:84%
I always knew there was more
to this life, more to this life

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.095 align:middle line:84%
than we can see in
the here and now.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.598 align:middle line:90%
I used to have office jobs.

00:06:14.598 --> 00:06:15.640 align:middle line:90%
I used to work at a bank.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And I always felt
quite unfulfilled

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.530 align:middle line:84%
because I felt like I haven't
really contributed anything

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:21.790 align:middle line:90%
to this world.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.150 align:middle line:10%
So for me, when I discovered
past life regression, going back

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.220 align:middle line:10%
to the source and
where everything began,

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.500 align:middle line:10%
it just opened up my
world and has helped me

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.050 align:middle line:10%
so much in my own
personal life as well.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Regression therapy is
a beautiful modality,

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.640 align:middle line:90%
and every session is different.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And I never know beforehand
where we're going to go,

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.590 align:middle line:84%
where the problem
began for the client,

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.260 align:middle line:84%
whether it's in childhood,
whether it's in the womb,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.750 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's in a
time that some people may

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.610 align:middle line:90%
perceive as a past life.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Other people might perceive
it as a metaphor, a story.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And often, in just one
session, we can heal,

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.680 align:middle line:84%
and we can just make
people's lives so much more

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.670 align:middle line:90%
fun and so much more enjoyable.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.620 align:middle line:84%
Scott contacted me
recently, and he

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.130 align:middle line:84%
wanted to come in for a
regression therapy session.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.540 align:middle line:84%
He's a business owner,
and he's got some issues

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.430 align:middle line:84%
that he'd like to
resolve by going back

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.050 align:middle line:90%
to the source of the issue.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking forward
to working with Scott

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.100 align:middle line:84%
and helping him to
resolve these issues,

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.850 align:middle line:84%
and I never know where
we're going to go.

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm just a guide going
along on this journey,

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.250 align:middle line:84%
and we'll go wherever
he needs to go,

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.440 align:middle line:84%
whether that's his childhood
or whether it's a past life.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.587 align:middle line:84%
Wherever we go, he can
trust those answers

00:07:25.587 --> 00:07:27.170 align:middle line:84%
because they'll be
coming from within.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:37.968 align:middle line:90%


00:07:37.968 --> 00:07:40.010 align:middle line:84%
Lovely, thanks for coming
to see me today, Scott.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:40.810 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.298 align:middle line:84%
>> So what can I
do for you today?

00:07:42.298 --> 00:07:43.340 align:middle line:90%
What can I help you with?

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.340 align:middle line:84%

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.770 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty much everything
I wanted in life.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:54.070 align:middle line:84%
But I just want to make sure, as
I go along, I keep my happiness

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.250 align:middle line:90%
and I keep my health.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.660 align:middle line:84%
If I have too much work, or
if I have too much little,

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.500 align:middle line:90%
I tend to get very stressed.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.140 align:middle line:84%
I just want to live
in the moment more,

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.200 align:middle line:84%
where sometimes I'm
allowing that to take

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.340 align:middle line:84%
my happiness of a day of things
which are happening really nice.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>> You want to
live in the moment.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying when
there's too much work

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.620 align:middle line:84%
or there's not quite enough
work, you get stressed.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Can you describe that
for me a little bit?

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.960 align:middle line:84%
How does that feel
for you, that stress?

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Sometimes a bit overwhelmed.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.720 align:middle line:90%
And I can feel like--

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.970 align:middle line:84%
the inners of your
body, it feels like--

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:33.880 align:middle line:84%
you don't feel well
in yourself with it.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.742 align:middle line:84%
Say, for example, I'll
say, OK, today I'm

00:08:36.742 --> 00:08:37.950 align:middle line:90%
going to take my mind off it.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.860 align:middle line:90%
I'll go to Dunster Beach.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.297 align:middle line:84%
I'll go with my girlfriend,
and I'll go with my dog.

00:08:42.297 --> 00:08:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be there, and
then, all of a sudden, I'll

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.200 align:middle line:84%
be, you've got to
do that tomorrow.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And then for 20
minutes, half hour,

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:51.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm then thinking about work.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And what I find is like
with my mind process,

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:58.360 align:middle line:84%
it's then when you're thinking
of a negative thought,

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.340 align:middle line:84%
another negative
thought seems to come.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And instead of me,
oh, hang on a minute.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm lucky enough to
be on a beach today

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.700 align:middle line:84%
when everyone's
supposed to be at work,

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.830 align:middle line:84%
and I should be enjoying
this with the two most

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.020 align:middle line:84%
important people
in my life, I've

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.480 align:middle line:84%
now thought about
the thought of work.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.800 align:middle line:90%
What could go wrong?

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
it changes my mood.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.340 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, I'm there, but
I'm not there at that place.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And where I should
be enjoying it,

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:26.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm already thinking
of tomorrow.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And I have a tendency, when
it's too busy or too quiet,

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.410 align:middle line:90%
to go into that quite a lot.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you criticize
yourself over that?

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:37.870 align:middle line:90%
Like, come on!

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.080 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about that now.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.090 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy the moment!

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm hugely critical of
anything I do from work to train

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.240 align:middle line:90%
in, of myself.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.810 align:middle line:84%
I've really tried
to pride myself

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.450 align:middle line:90%
on standards of all of it.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I think us having a
chat beforehand is really--

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.850 align:middle line:90%
it's almost like a funnel down.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.830 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to identify what is
the most important-- the thing

00:09:58.830 --> 00:09:59.630 align:middle line:90%
that's hottest?

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.985 align:middle line:84%
What's the thing that's going
to get us the most juice?

00:10:01.985 --> 00:10:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're working on.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.777 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you've heard the
expression, "People are onions."

00:10:05.777 --> 00:10:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's never just one thing
like, oh, I'm a bit shy,

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:09.930 align:middle line:90%
or I'm a bit jealous.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.820 align:middle line:90%
It tends to be like a mish mash.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And this comes in, and there's
criticism, and that comes in.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.880 align:middle line:84%
But by really drilling it
down, actually, what is it?

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Then that is likely to get
the biggest result for us.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.570 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying you
feel overwhelmed,

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:27.470 align:middle line:84%
and then you're saying it just
doesn't feel well within you.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.840 align:middle line:84%
You're saying you're
critical of yourself.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Which of these do you
think is the bigger issue?

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.840 align:middle line:84%
Is it that you're
feeling overwhelmed?

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.360 align:middle line:90%
You're getting those thoughts?

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Or is it you actually beating
yourself up over having thoughts

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.400 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps being a
little bit too assertive?

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.595 align:middle line:84%
>> I honestly don't know,
because there's times where one

00:10:48.595 --> 00:10:50.240 align:middle line:90%
will outweigh the other.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.520 align:middle line:90%
So they can both be a hindrance.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:56.230 align:middle line:84%
You worry when there's too
much, like how am I going

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:57.355 align:middle line:90%
to cope with all this work?

00:10:57.355 --> 00:10:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And when there's
not enough, am I

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.200 align:middle line:84%
going to get other
work coming in?

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And is it, indeed,
then those thoughts

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.570 align:middle line:84%
that you think, if you're more
able to calm those thoughts

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.862 align:middle line:84%
down, you're more
in control over it

00:11:09.862 --> 00:11:11.320 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, there's
a lot of work.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.345 align:middle line:90%
OK, we put in a few extra hours.

00:11:13.345 --> 00:11:15.070 align:middle line:84%
If that's not enough,
OK, then maybe

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:16.960 align:middle line:84%
we look at how we can
attract some more.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.823 align:middle line:84%
>> I have so much to be
thankful and appreciative for.

00:11:19.823 --> 00:11:21.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to put
my foot off the gas.

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:23.740 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, that's what

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:27.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean by living for the moment
where I'm already in a place

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:28.670 align:middle line:90%
where I wanted to be.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And I believe in
five years' time I'll

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.380 align:middle line:90%
be at the place I want to be.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:34.120 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want to
just keep on clicking

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.828 align:middle line:84%
the fingers for that
five years because I

00:11:35.828 --> 00:11:37.660 align:middle line:84%
want to live in those
five years as well

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:38.840 align:middle line:84%
and not just fill it
with, there you go.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:39.640 align:middle line:90%
There's your ice.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:40.600 align:middle line:90%
There's your money.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.630 align:middle line:84%
But now you've lost
10 years of living.

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Things are going in
the right direction.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.080 align:middle line:84%
Stop looking for
what else you want.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Just look at what
you've got today.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:54.090 align:middle line:84%
>> In a minute, we'll get you
settled, get you lying down,

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.160 align:middle line:90%
and then we'll just go into it.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.707 align:middle line:84%
If you don't so much have a
picture in your mind's eye,

00:11:59.707 --> 00:12:00.540 align:middle line:90%
I don't have either.

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.560 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, it can feel
like you're making it up.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.923 align:middle line:84%
That's absolutely fine
because everything

00:12:05.923 --> 00:12:07.340 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
experience will be

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.450 align:middle line:90%
coming from you, 100% from you.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:11.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to just
ask you questions.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:12.090 align:middle line:90%
You've got the easy job.

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:13.440 align:middle line:90%
You just answer my questions.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And my questions are
geared towards helping

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:17.810 align:middle line:90%
you discover more.

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:22.880 align:middle line:84%
So whatever it is that comes in
your mind, it comes from you.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.640 align:middle line:84%
So whether you've made it
up, or whether it's real,

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.750 align:middle line:90%
just go with whatever comes.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, cool.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:29.970 align:middle line:90%
>> So let's get you settled.

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:31.860 align:middle line:84%
If you want to pop into
the loo, you can do that.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:32.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, will do.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:33.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, lovely.

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:33.850 align:middle line:90%
OK, brilliant.

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:34.678 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:12:34.678 --> 00:12:40.420 align:middle line:90%


00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.700 align:middle line:84%
When you're ready,
just tell me, what

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.270 align:middle line:84%
is the first thing
that you notice here?

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.870 align:middle line:10%
>> How dirty the streets are.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:51.160 align:middle line:10%
Feels very poor there.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you get a sense
you're alone there,

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:56.460 align:middle line:84%
or do you feel the
presence of other people?

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:57.973 align:middle line:10%
>> There's lots of other people.

00:12:57.973 --> 00:13:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>> The purpose of my questions
there are really to get him

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:03.120 align:middle line:84%
embodied, for him to feel
like he was really there,

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.540 align:middle line:84%
to really get the person
in an associated state.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>> So what about you?

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:09.900 align:middle line:90%
Just get a sense of you.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Start by looking down
at your feet for me.

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.955 align:middle line:10%
>> Broken shoes.

00:13:14.955 --> 00:13:16.780 align:middle line:10%
It's more like rags.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Rags.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Just old and dirty.

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:23.820 align:middle line:84%
They were more like wraps,
and they had holes in them.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel--
as I walked, I

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.600 align:middle line:90%
could feel the water on my feet.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.410 align:middle line:84%
It's just a very,
very weird feeling.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:33.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there anything
on your head?

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:34.470 align:middle line:10%
>> A cap.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>> A cap.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.140 align:middle line:90%
Now, how does the body feel?

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Does the body feel
young, fit healthy?

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Or does the body feel
old, perhaps tired?

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Young but weak, nine or 10.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.662 align:middle line:10%
Worried.

00:13:48.662 --> 00:13:51.510 align:middle line:10%
I'm just trying to
look for work and food.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Definitely, I think it
was in London, an era

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.480 align:middle line:90%
of, say, an Oliver Twist time.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.980 align:middle line:90%
I felt small, which I was.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:59.426 align:middle line:90%
I felt weak, which I was.

00:13:59.426 --> 00:14:00.676 align:middle line:90%
I was probably malnutritioned.

00:14:00.676 --> 00:14:03.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm just looking
for safety, really.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:07.310 align:middle line:10%
Just work at day, try to
find shelter at night.

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:08.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that what's happening now?

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:11.270 align:middle line:84%
It's dark, so you're
looking for shelter.

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:12.230 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:13.110 align:middle line:10%
>> It's raining.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:14.900 align:middle line:10%
>> It's raining.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Just trying to survive.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Trying to survive, yeah.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a bridge, and you
could see the lights at the top.

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And then underneath,
I could see--

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- maybe half
a dozen poor people, rags,

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.040 align:middle line:90%
a little fire going.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.240 align:middle line:90%
It was not like a unity.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.360 align:middle line:90%
It was everyone to themselves.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.630 align:middle line:10%
It's not a nice place.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:37.160 align:middle line:10%
It's not people
helping each other.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you feel as you're
there with those people in not

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:42.000 align:middle line:90%
a nice place?

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:42.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Lonely.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.590 align:middle line:10%
Lonely, yeah.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:48.380 align:middle line:84%
After I felt that I've got all
the information from that scene,

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:51.090 align:middle line:84%
I just moved him on to
the next significant event

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:51.980 align:middle line:90%
in that lifetime.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.730 align:middle line:84%
People instinctively will know
what the next significant event

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:55.530 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's an actual
event, and sometimes it's

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.740 align:middle line:84%
just a different atmosphere,
a different feeling.

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Just tell me what it is
that you notice here.

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:05.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Horses.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.485 align:middle line:10%
>> Horses.

00:15:06.485 --> 00:15:08.920 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm looking after them.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.510 align:middle line:10%
I have a uniform on, and
I'm much more cleaner.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.690 align:middle line:10%
>> How old are
you here, roughly?

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:16.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Twenties.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:20.380 align:middle line:10%
I feel here I'm a lot happier.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.480 align:middle line:10%
I've got away from the poverty.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.670 align:middle line:84%
Straight away, I could
feel I was cleaner,

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.297 align:middle line:90%
and I was riding a horse.

00:15:26.297 --> 00:15:27.880 align:middle line:84%
But I could feel the
horse was strong.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I had a uniform
on, like, not an army uniform,

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.660 align:middle line:84%
but something of working for
maybe a manor or an attire.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.900 align:middle line:90%
And I was definitely happier.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.450 align:middle line:90%
>> So what happens next here?

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:45.400 align:middle line:10%
>> We're going to go on a
hunt, three other men, dogs.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.250 align:middle line:10%
Here, I always feel happy
when I'm in the woods.

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:49.900 align:middle line:10%
I feel safe.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.770 align:middle line:84%
There was just packs
of dogs with us.

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:52.760 align:middle line:90%
There was horses.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.670 align:middle line:84%
So you had everything you
wanted for that moment in life.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:58.880 align:middle line:84%
So the woodland always gives
me a sense of presence,

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.170 align:middle line:84%
and it always makes me
feel safe and secure.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's move forward to the
next significant event in that

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:07.760 align:middle line:90%
same lifetime.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:11.630 align:middle line:10%
>> A big pane of window
I'm looking out of, like,

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:14.940 align:middle line:10%
a chapel of a house.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.280 align:middle line:10%
A wife and a son.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.590 align:middle line:10%
>> What's happening
here in the house?

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:25.930 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm happy because I can give
my son stuff which I never had.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>> What sort of things are you
able to give your son that you

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:30.310 align:middle line:90%
never had?

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:31.400 align:middle line:10%
>> To be a dad.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.760 align:middle line:10%
I never had one.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.800 align:middle line:10%
My wife's cooking.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.372 align:middle line:10%
We're not rich,
but we're not poor.

00:16:38.372 --> 00:16:40.510 align:middle line:10%
>> And how does that feel?

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:41.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Contentment.

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:45.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, contentment.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything we had was there.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:47.760 align:middle line:90%
So it was food.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.560 align:middle line:90%
We had love.

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:49.510 align:middle line:90%
We had shelter.

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Instead of, like, trying
to chase for something,

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.540 align:middle line:90%
I was happy in that moment.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:55.370 align:middle line:84%
I didn't need something
else in my life.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:57.760 align:middle line:10%
>> We're going to move
either forwards or backwards

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:02.230 align:middle line:10%
to the most significant
event in that lifetime.

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:07.000 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm back in the dirty clothes
outside in the dirty streets.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.650 align:middle line:10%
>> In the dirty streets.

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:10.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Cobbled stones.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.720 align:middle line:10%
People is loud drunk.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.540 align:middle line:10%
It's not a safe
place for children.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:20.130 align:middle line:10%
You try to get work
for food, for shelter.

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:23.579 align:middle line:10%
Lots of the people
are not very nice.

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:24.598 align:middle line:90%
>> It was remarkable.

00:17:24.598 --> 00:17:26.640 align:middle line:84%
Scott went back to an
event we'd already covered,

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.450 align:middle line:90%
and that does happen sometimes.

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And I knew the fact
that he went back

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:33.000 align:middle line:84%
there must mean that there was
something significant for him

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.320 align:middle line:90%
because he went back.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.710 align:middle line:90%
I didn't send him back there.

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:38.520 align:middle line:84%
I just said go to the
most significant event.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.680 align:middle line:84%
Float a little bit
above your body,

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.650 align:middle line:84%
and you're just seeing
this boy down below.

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Just tell me what happens
to him down there.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:52.070 align:middle line:10%
>> He's doing the horseshoes,
and then he can live in the barn

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:middle line:10%
with the horses.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Just tell me what's
so significant about this

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:58.670 align:middle line:90%
particular day.

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:01.400 align:middle line:10%
>> It's cleaner here
than in the city.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.930 align:middle line:10%
It's freedom.

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:04.950 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, life
started to get better.

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And then as it started
getting better, I was eating.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:08.670 align:middle line:90%
I was growing.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Things were changing very much
from the times on the streets.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>> By now we'd experienced
a few significant events.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.560 align:middle line:84%
We worked out the most
significant events.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.450 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to know
how that life ended,

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:21.900 align:middle line:84%
so I instructed him to go
to the last day of his life.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Let's just find out
what happens to you.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:29.190 align:middle line:10%
>> I die in the chapel
where I saw the window.

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:30.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Are you alone?

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:32.010 align:middle line:10%
Is there anybody with you?

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:32.910 align:middle line:10%
>> My wife.

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:34.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Your wife's there.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>> It was on an estate, which
was just a small chapel which

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:41.110 align:middle line:84%
had been in with my
wife and my child.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I could
see me dying by the window.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell me, what thoughts or
feelings are you taking with you

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.950 align:middle line:84%
from this life that
you're about to leave?

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:51.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Happy thoughts.

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.440 align:middle line:10%
Life got better.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there any thoughts about
the beginning of your life?

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:02.485 align:middle line:10%
>> Always dislike towards the
people in the start of the life.

00:19:02.485 --> 00:19:04.560 align:middle line:10%
I thought revenge a lot.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.145 align:middle line:84%
As an adult, I'd walk by
if I saw a kid like that.

00:19:07.145 --> 00:19:08.020 align:middle line:90%
You want to help him.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.440 align:middle line:84%
But because they didn't,
it just made me sad,

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.450 align:middle line:90%
and it made me angry.

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And let's now go forward in
time to the time that your heart

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:20.200 align:middle line:84%
there stops beating and
then move beyond it.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.700 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like
you to do now is

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.920 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to
travel in a meeting--

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.410 align:middle line:84%
to a meeting place
in the spirit realm.

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to, first of
all, meet your spirit guide.

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:32.780 align:middle line:84%
How does your spirit
guide appear to you today?

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.210 align:middle line:10%
>> A lot of white.

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:35.630 align:middle line:90%
>> We all have guides.

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they show
themselves as a human being.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.980 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's an angelic form.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.010 align:middle line:90%
In Scott's case, it was white.

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Ask your spirit guide, what
was the bitterness in that life

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:50.260 align:middle line:84%
as the boy was just
trying to survive?

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.750 align:middle line:10%
>> How people could have
helped and just looked away

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:56.170 align:middle line:10%
because they weren't--
it wasn't their problem.

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:58.020 align:middle line:10%
They were just nobodies.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.927 align:middle line:10%
They were just common folk.

00:19:59.927 --> 00:20:01.510 align:middle line:84%
>> But you say they
could have helped,

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:03.030 align:middle line:90%
and they didn't, didn't they?

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.750 align:middle line:90%
You were only just a boy.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:07.508 align:middle line:10%
>> When you see
them, though, now,

00:20:07.508 --> 00:20:09.550 align:middle line:10%
you realize they were
fighting their own battles.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:13.570 align:middle line:10%
They-- even though they could
have helped, none of them

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:15.070 align:middle line:10%
were in good places.

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>> But what would
that little boy say,

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.930 align:middle line:84%
that little boy that
was lonely and scared?

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:21.790 align:middle line:10%
>> You could have been better.

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:24.310 align:middle line:10%
>> How does it feel to say that?

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:26.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Just telling the truth.

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:29.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Lots of them had
similar lives before.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.360 align:middle line:10%
That's why they see
it no different.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.100 align:middle line:10%
That's why they
ended up alcoholics

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.720 align:middle line:10%
or whatever they were.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:38.030 align:middle line:84%
They had pretty much
similar lives, if not worse.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And what they've done is
they've become boys into adults,

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.470 align:middle line:84%
but they were still
being children.

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And then when I had the
chance to go back and see it,

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:46.270 align:middle line:84%
you could see how
weak they were.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:48.478 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though, of course,
a part of you understands,

00:20:48.478 --> 00:20:51.230 align:middle line:84%
there's another part of you that
still has bitterness about that.

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:53.230 align:middle line:10%
>> It's the bitterness
they carry too.

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:56.390 align:middle line:10%
When you're not happy
there's bitterness,

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:57.970 align:middle line:10%
there's usually trouble.

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:00.490 align:middle line:10%
There's jealousy.

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:03.060 align:middle line:10%
It's all a learning curve.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:07.390 align:middle line:10%
Made you stronger, survived.

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:09.840 align:middle line:10%
Happiness and
sadness is temporary.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.810 align:middle line:90%
It just came out.

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:14.010 align:middle line:84%
Because when I look at
my life in this life,

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:17.230 align:middle line:84%
I look at some really good times
and then some really hard times.

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:19.780 align:middle line:84%
But they're all temporary,
and life is temporary.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.960 align:middle line:84%
I suppose the answers
I was getting was,

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.100 align:middle line:84%
everything is temporary,
and enjoy the moment

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:25.900 align:middle line:90%
when it's there.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>> What are they saying is the
lesson that you're learning

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.350 align:middle line:90%
in this current life?

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:32.910 align:middle line:10%
>> Patience.

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:37.125 align:middle line:10%
If I want something, I'll
go after it straight away.

00:21:37.125 --> 00:21:39.570 align:middle line:10%
I don't like waiting.

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:44.200 align:middle line:10%
It clouds my judgment because
I don't think of what I've got.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.070 align:middle line:10%
I think of what I still haven't.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that, then, were
the overwhelm comes in?

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.470 align:middle line:10%
>> I think so.

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:54.590 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes you just need a
little lesson to remember it.

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:56.690 align:middle line:84%
My mom and dad would
say I had no patience.

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:59.120 align:middle line:84%
In school, I was told
I had no patience.

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.575 align:middle line:84%
For the guys who I
do work for, they

00:22:01.575 --> 00:22:03.200 align:middle line:84%
would probably have
a couple of stories

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.270 align:middle line:84%
to tell you about
my patience, also.

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:08.120 align:middle line:84%
>> What could help you to
develop that patience so you can

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.040 align:middle line:90%
be more in the moment?

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:14.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Realizing where you've
got to already in life.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:16.350 align:middle line:10%
Celebrate the small wins.

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:19.200 align:middle line:84%
If you look at where I
started in all my journeys

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.730 align:middle line:84%
to where I am to now, there's
a hell of a lot of small wins.

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think, from
this session, what

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.810 align:middle line:84%
it's made me realize
is I will actually

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.490 align:middle line:90%
celebrate the small wins more.

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So what practical advice
can your guide give you going

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:31.770 align:middle line:90%
forwards?

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:35.640 align:middle line:10%
>> It's just to
appreciate things more.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.530 align:middle line:10%
Just let go.

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:40.320 align:middle line:10%
Just-- just enjoy it.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.660 align:middle line:10%
Don't let life
worry you so much.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:46.150 align:middle line:10%
It brings out the
wrong side of you.

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:49.660 align:middle line:84%
If I let go, and I enjoy things
more, and I realize how lucky

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.810 align:middle line:84%
and how blessed I am and what
an actual beautiful world it is,

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:54.370 align:middle line:84%
I think I would
find more happiness.

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:55.340 align:middle line:90%
I just need to--

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:56.740 align:middle line:90%
I need to go with the flow more.

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>> By just letting go of
things, we can open up more.

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:02.710 align:middle line:84%
We can enjoy-- we can enjoy
the lighter side of life.

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:04.510 align:middle line:90%
Get a sense around you.

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:09.070 align:middle line:84%
See if there's still any
connections with things holding

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:13.570 align:middle line:84%
you back, when things are there,
stopping you from letting go

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:16.000 align:middle line:90%
and just enjoying things.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.360 align:middle line:10%
>> The core root of it is
always going back to that boy,

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:23.890 align:middle line:10%
being that poor and that afraid.

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:25.930 align:middle line:10%
>> What does this boy need?

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:27.070 align:middle line:10%
>> To realize it's over.

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:28.840 align:middle line:10%
It's OK.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>> What is it you feel
you need to say to him?

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:35.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Thank you for being strong
and doing everything you could.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.610 align:middle line:10%
You did great.

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, you did great.

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:42.550 align:middle line:10%
>> You were enough.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:46.420 align:middle line:84%
>> How does the boy react
when you say that to him?

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:48.190 align:middle line:10%
>> He's happy.

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, it felt like a really
good idea for them to meet

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.750 align:middle line:84%
and for Scott to talk to
that little boy directly.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:55.960 align:middle line:90%
I wonder.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:59.260 align:middle line:84%
You've both got
gifts for each other.

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:03.640 align:middle line:84%
It could be an object or it
could be a memory, or an image.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:07.900 align:middle line:84%
Think about what is it that
you like to give to this boy.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Exchanging gifts is
a powerful technique

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:13.810 align:middle line:84%
I often use because it just
expresses a feeling in a symbol

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:16.690 align:middle line:84%
that the client can then
later use to remind themselves

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:18.710 align:middle line:90%
of that feeling.

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:21.640 align:middle line:10%
>> I give him my coat.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.860 align:middle line:84%
>> What's your coat going to
bring him, going to do for him?

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:25.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Warmth.

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.576 align:middle line:10%
>> Warmth.

00:24:27.576 --> 00:24:30.500 align:middle line:10%
>> It's like he's had the world.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.625 align:middle line:10%
>> Does he say anything to you?

00:24:32.625 --> 00:24:34.970 align:middle line:10%
>> He gives me shoes.

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:35.770 align:middle line:10%
They're torn.

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:38.050 align:middle line:10%
They're tattered.

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:41.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And what's the significance
of him giving you his shoes?

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:48.320 align:middle line:10%
>> When I go into my old ways
to realize life's not so bad.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.110 align:middle line:10%
My shoes don't leak.

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:53.450 align:middle line:84%
The shoes were just
so tattered and torn,

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:56.030 align:middle line:84%
and they were-- barely
looked together,

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:58.760 align:middle line:84%
and he just took them
off and give them to me.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:02.300 align:middle line:84%
It made me feel a little bit
ashamed about myself sometimes,

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.870 align:middle line:84%
how I feel sorry for myself
when I got no need to.

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:09.050 align:middle line:84%
I have numerous pairs of
shoes, which don't leak.

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And these pairs
probably mean more to me

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:14.270 align:middle line:90%
than any pair I've got.

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Anything else you feel you want
to say to him or he to you?

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.575 align:middle line:10%
>> No, I give me a hug.

00:25:20.575 --> 00:25:23.340 align:middle line:10%
>> You give him a hug.

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And he's now got your coat,
and you've got his shoes.

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Anything else that the two of
you want to say to each other?

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:35.580 align:middle line:10%
>> He just wished me well.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.680 align:middle line:10%
>> How does that feel?

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.365 align:middle line:10%
>> It felt good, actually.

00:25:40.365 --> 00:25:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>> I wonder if the two of you
perhaps can go back to that

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:48.300 align:middle line:84%
meeting of the people
in the village,

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.010 align:middle line:90%
the people in the marketplace.

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:53.550 align:middle line:84%
See if there's anything
else we need to say to them.

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:55.380 align:middle line:84%
I knew we probably
had some more work

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:57.690 align:middle line:84%
to do, talking to the
villagers, because remember,

00:25:57.690 --> 00:26:01.200 align:middle line:84%
at the death point, he
said he felt dislike

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.230 align:middle line:90%
towards those people.

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So I knew in all
likelihood, there's still

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.970 align:middle line:84%
anger, which would
have totally made sense

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:09.610 align:middle line:84%
because this little boy, nobody
saw him, nobody helped him.

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:12.510 align:middle line:84%
So there's likely to be
some anger around that.

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:16.080 align:middle line:10%
>> My first initial thought
is to slaughter them all

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.920 align:middle line:10%
because I'm stronger,
which I know is wrong.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.950 align:middle line:10%
But it's my first
initial thought.

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:26.490 align:middle line:10%
I can see they're scared
because the other boy's a boy.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:27.340 align:middle line:10%
I'm a man.

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:30.090 align:middle line:10%
These people ain't men.

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:32.718 align:middle line:10%
They're shadows of them.

00:26:32.718 --> 00:26:34.260 align:middle line:10%
But that's one of
the lessons I think

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.390 align:middle line:10%
I've just had to learn
where just acts of violence

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:41.470 align:middle line:10%
and doing stuff like that
doesn't solve your problems

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:44.140 align:middle line:10%
and doesn't make things right.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:47.780 align:middle line:10%
You can be one or the other,
a weak boy or a strong man.

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:50.890 align:middle line:10%
But I suppose it's
the same answer.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:53.680 align:middle line:10%
And instead of chopping
those heads off,

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:58.240 align:middle line:10%
I've taught them the truth and
it's hurt them just as much.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.060 align:middle line:84%
When I actually talked to
him, and I said everything

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:03.430 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to say,
I felt relieved,

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:05.140 align:middle line:84%
and I felt like it
was off my chest.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And I felt I had
shamed him, and I've

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:10.468 align:middle line:84%
hurt him just as much, but
through words this time.

00:27:10.468 --> 00:27:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And I also felt,
then, I had stood up

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:14.860 align:middle line:84%
for the boy who had no one, who
didn't have anyone at the time

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:16.040 align:middle line:90%
to stand up for him.

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>> It felt like this wasn't so
much about acting out on that,

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:21.080 align:middle line:84%
on that I want to
slaughter them.

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.330 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually, ooh,
this is my first thought.

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:24.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to think about that.

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:27.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to process it and
actually reflect and actually

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:31.360 align:middle line:84%
think about how he wanted to
act on those feelings of anger.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.720 align:middle line:10%
>> I have to process before I--

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.580 align:middle line:10%
before I react sometimes.

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:39.470 align:middle line:10%
Not a lot of good comes
from when I don't process.

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:40.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:43.360 align:middle line:10%
Is that patience that the guide
was telling you about, isn't it?

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:46.370 align:middle line:84%
>> I think this was the
whole point of this.

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:48.050 align:middle line:84%
I think it was for
me to learn a lesson.

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
lesson was patience.

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.560 align:middle line:84%
It's something which I
haven't had in abundance a lot

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:55.180 align:middle line:90%
in my life, if I'm honest.

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.640 align:middle line:10%
It was good to hold
it for a little bit

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:01.370 align:middle line:10%
and not just want
revenge straight away.

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:05.130 align:middle line:10%
It was good to speak with words.

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Just see if there's any other
words there for them that need

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.240 align:middle line:90%
to be spoken.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.790 align:middle line:10%
>> I forgive him now
because, otherwise,

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:14.830 align:middle line:10%
it will still hold me.

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:18.520 align:middle line:10%
Whether I like him or
not, it's forgiveness.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:21.520 align:middle line:10%
I don't want to keep
holding on to the past.

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I wonder how you can use your
strength in all these different

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:29.530 align:middle line:84%
areas to help you in your life
when you feel overwhelmed.

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:34.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Usually, it's never
as bad as what it seems.

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:37.900 align:middle line:10%
Usually, overthinking kills.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.850 align:middle line:10%
If you can detach and find
somewhere, your happy place,

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:43.252 align:middle line:10%
and not make that
phone call, that email,

00:28:43.252 --> 00:28:44.710 align:middle line:10%
there's probably
a very good chance

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:46.510 align:middle line:10%
you might feel differently.

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I wonder if the gift of the
broken shoes from the boy--

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:52.490 align:middle line:84%
if they will help
in any way as well.

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:54.772 align:middle line:10%
>> I think that's
why he gave them.

00:28:54.772 --> 00:28:56.980 align:middle line:10%
Even at times when you think
you're having a bad day,

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:59.620 align:middle line:10%
or you've gone under a
certain number you wanted it

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.415 align:middle line:10%
in the bank, could you go out
and buy a new pair of shoes?

00:29:02.415 --> 00:29:05.380 align:middle line:10%


00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:07.760 align:middle line:10%
You can probably buy two.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:14.810 align:middle line:10%
And it does make me realize I
am definitely on the right path.

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:15.930 align:middle line:10%
It's all OK.

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:18.080 align:middle line:10%
It's going to be all right.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm really, really
thankful for this session

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:22.310 align:middle line:84%
because I actually
got more out of it

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:23.583 align:middle line:90%
than I ever thought I would.

00:29:23.583 --> 00:29:26.000 align:middle line:84%
It's such an important time
of my life for this to happen,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.700 align:middle line:84%
and I think what it would
do is it will take me

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.650 align:middle line:84%
to the next level
in so many ways.

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:33.895 align:middle line:84%
>> Just check with
the spirit guide.

00:29:33.895 --> 00:29:38.590 align:middle line:84%
The spirit guide has got
any other advice for you?

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:41.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Enjoy life.

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:43.120 align:middle line:10%
Enjoy the moment.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.790 align:middle line:10%
You've already come so far.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:48.382 align:middle line:10%
Enjoy the journey.

00:29:48.382 --> 00:29:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>> These sessions are
always really surprising,

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.600 align:middle line:84%
and I never know where
we're going to go.

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:57.270 align:middle line:84%
I think for Scott, it really
taught him to just enjoy life.

00:29:57.270 --> 00:30:01.450 align:middle line:84%
So how long do you
think you've been here?

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:02.455 align:middle line:90%
>> 40 minutes.

00:30:02.455 --> 00:30:03.255 align:middle line:90%
>> Two hours.

00:30:03.255 --> 00:30:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, really?

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Bloody hell.

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The shoes were really
a visual reminder to enjoy

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.350 align:middle line:84%
the little wins and
enjoy the present moment.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been two weeks
since my session,

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.030 align:middle line:84%
and so much feels
different, to be honest.

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:28.900 align:middle line:84%
As a self-employed person
or a business owner,

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:30.610 align:middle line:84%
instead of me being
overwhelmed by, like,

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:31.930 align:middle line:84%
I got to win this
contract, I got

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:34.305 align:middle line:84%
to make this much this month,
and in the following month,

00:30:34.305 --> 00:30:37.360 align:middle line:84%
I got to make a bit more,
you've got your mortgage paid.

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.590 align:middle line:90%
You've got an abundance of food.

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:42.303 align:middle line:84%
There are so many things which
I'm already grateful for, which

00:30:42.303 --> 00:30:43.720 align:middle line:84%
I've took for
granted in the past,

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:47.890 align:middle line:84%
but now I think will be a
bit more grateful because it

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:49.900 align:middle line:84%
does make you realize
what are you really

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:50.960 align:middle line:90%
worrying about sometimes.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.920 align:middle line:84%
Do you need to worry about
it today or even tomorrow?

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.710 align:middle line:84%
I think when the little
boy gave me his shoes,

00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:59.270 align:middle line:84%
it was the best he could give,
and it was all he could give.

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:01.533 align:middle line:84%
So it was really-- he
gave more than anyone.

00:31:01.533 --> 00:31:02.950 align:middle line:84%
Just in a moment,
you look and you

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:06.892 align:middle line:84%
think, I am so lucky in so,
so many ways, from my health,

00:31:06.892 --> 00:31:09.100 align:middle line:84%
from my mental health, from
my family, from the love,

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.210 align:middle line:90%
from my animals.

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:12.537 align:middle line:84%
Genuinely, things changed
in more ways than one,

00:31:12.537 --> 00:31:14.620 align:middle line:84%
and maybe I haven't got
the vocabulary to actually

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:16.150 align:middle line:90%
say all of them as now.

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:18.400 align:middle line:90%
But I'm different.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Thank you Ellemiek for
a journey into my soul.

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And when there's times I
feel overwhelmed in life

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and things ain't
going right, there'll

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.140 align:middle line:84%
be stuff I'll resonate
from that session

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.450 align:middle line:84%
and we'll use going forward
from today and probably

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:30.590 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of my life.
