I realized that the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.290 align:middle line:84%

we lived in the apartment above.

the theater and sang and danced.

a psychic and being one who
was trying to be normal.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.260 align:middle line:84%

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.640 align:middle line:84%
has already picked
where you need

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.310 align:middle line:84%
to go to find out
something more and deeper

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.620 align:middle line:84%
about yourself to
help you move forward

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.180 align:middle line:84%
in this life in the
highest and greatest way.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.890 align:middle line:84%
But in the second session, we
have a little bit more room

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:16.700 align:middle line:90%
to play.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people in
our second session

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.550 align:middle line:84%
want to specifically
go somewhere.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.290 align:middle line:84%
We can go straight
to the high self.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.260 align:middle line:84%
If you just want to
spend time there and get

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.540 align:middle line:84%
as much information from
that part of you that

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.660 align:middle line:84%
knows everything about you
and loves you unconditionally,

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.580 align:middle line:84%
you just be open,
have no expectations.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.309 align:middle line:84%
Just know that that
great part of you

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:38.070 align:middle line:84%
is going to guide you
to have exactly what you

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:39.199 align:middle line:90%
need to have today.

00:08:39.199 --> 00:08:40.809 align:middle line:90%
>> So that's important.

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:41.630 align:middle line:90%
No expectations.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.518 align:middle line:90%
>> No expectations at all.

00:08:43.518 --> 00:08:45.060 align:middle line:84%
As a reminder, the
things that you're

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.710 align:middle line:84%
going to do to help
yourself-- just

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.690 align:middle line:84%
let go and allow, and have
this amazing experience--

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:51.280 align:middle line:90%
are very, very easy.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.550 align:middle line:84%
I want you just to picture
in your mind the things

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.900 align:middle line:90%
that I'm describing to you.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.050 align:middle line:84%
When I ask a question, just
always trust and answer

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.160 align:middle line:84%
with the very first
thought that comes to mind.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.760 align:middle line:10%
>> When I ask you to see things,
picture and imagine those images

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.540 align:middle line:10%
in as much detail as you can.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.120 align:middle line:84%
The more you do that,
the easier it gets.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.390 align:middle line:90%
And then talk and talk a lot.

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.880 align:middle line:84%
The more you talk, the
deeper, you will go.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And the more you describe
to me, the more material

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.115 align:middle line:84%
I have to ask a better,
deeper question.

00:09:20.115 --> 00:09:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Any questions that you
have about those tips?

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I'm OK.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:23.670 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Most importantly,
just keep saying

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.765 align:middle line:84%
the first thing that comes
to mind is I ask a question.

00:09:26.765 --> 00:09:27.908 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't overthink it.

00:09:27.908 --> 00:09:29.075 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't overthink anything.

00:09:29.075 --> 00:09:29.875 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:29.875 --> 00:09:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there anything in your
life that seems big or feels

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.260 align:middle line:90%
like I should know about?

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.210 align:middle line:84%
What are you thinking
would be best for you?

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>> In our first session, I
was really surprised at how

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.660 align:middle line:90%
expansive I was.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:48.360 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to think that I
was made of that much love,

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.220 align:middle line:84%
but when I actually felt
it, I couldn't believe it.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'd like to
feel that again.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.850 align:middle line:84%
In my life, I tried to
teach that to people,

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:00.220 align:middle line:84%
and feeling it for myself
was very profound and moving.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.110 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to sit
with that some more.

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>> And health-wise, do you feel
like there's much going on with

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:07.250 align:middle line:90%
you right now?

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:08.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Not a thing.

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:11.145 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you feel like from that
first session we did a lot?

00:10:11.145 --> 00:10:12.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Completely healed.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Completely healed.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>> 1,000%.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:17.450 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:18.250 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:21.900 align:middle line:84%
So you say here I was
visited by some loving beings

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.220 align:middle line:90%
that I call the wish makers.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.020 align:middle line:90%
Whoa!

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>> So can I tell you about that?

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:27.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Please do.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:31.510 align:middle line:84%
>> It's probably 2:00 in the
morning, and I'm wide awake.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:35.520 align:middle line:84%
I have this feeling,
three, I'm going to say,

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.480 align:middle line:84%
beings we're walking
up behind me.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And I had this sense
that I don't want--

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.920 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't scared, but I didn't
want to look behind me.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like a love that
I cannot explain in words.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:49.780 align:middle line:90%
They said hello to me.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:51.040 align:middle line:90%
They said they love me.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And they said, hey, we
can grant you a wish.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.545 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my gosh.

00:10:54.545 --> 00:10:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So then my wish was,
I want Ed to be happy.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.640 align:middle line:90%
I didn't make a wish for myself.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.230 align:middle line:90%
I want Ed to be happy.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:05.730 align:middle line:84%
So I want to know who they
were because since then,

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.080 align:middle line:84%
the human in me is
like, can you come back.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.215 align:middle line:90%
I want to change my wish.

00:11:09.215 --> 00:11:10.960 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>> But I was thinking, when he
gets happier, I'll be happier.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:15.980 align:middle line:90%
That was my--

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:16.780 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:17.940 align:middle line:90%
>> That's very sweet.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:18.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.842 align:middle line:84%
That's a really good
question to ask.

00:11:19.842 --> 00:11:21.436 align:middle line:90%
And what an amazing experience!

00:11:21.436 --> 00:11:22.640 align:middle line:90%
>> It was amazing.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.563 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:23.563 --> 00:11:25.230 align:middle line:84%
Then you say, other
than that, I'm open,

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:27.120 align:middle line:84%
which is awesome
because that's how

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.880 align:middle line:84%
we really get some other
interesting information, just

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.100 align:middle line:90%
keeping open.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.955 align:middle line:84%
>> And last time, it felt like
I was totally making it up.

00:11:34.955 --> 00:11:35.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:40.110 align:middle line:84%
We're at this point where
in these deep experiences

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:43.920 align:middle line:84%
of hypnosis, instead of
having an amnesia experience,

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:48.150 align:middle line:84%
which is what we used to do, now
we're feeling somewhat aware.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:51.300 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to recognize
when you're asking yourself,

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.500 align:middle line:90%
what should I do?

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that was a
left-brained answer,

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.100 align:middle line:84%
and that's a
right-brained answer.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.760 align:middle line:84%
That one felt better and it
came really fast and clear.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.320 align:middle line:84%
So we're at this point
now where feeling aware

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.960 align:middle line:84%
is just something
to be mindful of.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.300 align:middle line:84%
But again, the best way to
manage that side of the brain

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.550 align:middle line:84%
is just keep saying the first
thing that comes to mind

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:16.320 align:middle line:84%
is I ask you a
question, you'll just

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.250 align:middle line:90%
fall into that nice, deep space.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's OK to be
aware of things.

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:22.555 align:middle line:90%
It's a cool thing, actually.

00:12:22.555 --> 00:12:23.355 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:23.355 --> 00:12:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:28.015 align:middle line:90%
I think we're ready.

00:12:28.015 --> 00:12:30.440 align:middle line:10%
[CRACKLING]

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.380 align:middle line:10%


00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.940 align:middle line:10%
And describe for me what
you notice around you.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.110 align:middle line:10%
What do you see?

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:38.815 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm sitting in my
rose quartz throne.

00:12:38.815 --> 00:12:40.422 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:40.422 --> 00:12:41.870 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:45.640 align:middle line:10%
Tell me all about your
rose quartz throne.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.370 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, they've built
this for me and I'm so kind,

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:51.255 align:middle line:10%
but it is just hard
on my backside.

00:12:51.255 --> 00:12:52.930 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.880 align:middle line:10%
It's just too cold to the touch.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.120 align:middle line:10%
I have to really move around
on it to create warmth.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.280 align:middle line:10%
All I really want is a pillow.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.340 align:middle line:84%
It was interesting
that I was reminded

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to be
uncomfortable in this space.

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:07.620 align:middle line:90%
I can be cozy and comfortable.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.620 align:middle line:84%
My butt doesn't have
to be uncomfortable.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.415 align:middle line:84%
So that was good
learning for me.

00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the purpose of
the throne being rose quartz,

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:14.830 align:middle line:90%
I wonder?

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:17.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, this is
a kingdom of love.

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:20.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Tell me all about
the kingdom of love.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:27.055 align:middle line:10%
>> This is a kingdom accessible
in the, let's say, ether.

00:13:27.055 --> 00:13:27.855 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:13:27.855 --> 00:13:37.400 align:middle line:10%
>> And this is in the
quantum, a place where I work.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.010 align:middle line:10%
And this is where she brings
in love to the earth's space.

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:43.680 align:middle line:10%
It's why she incarnated here.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.550 align:middle line:10%
You can ask her.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:45.350 align:middle line:10%
She knows.

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:46.816 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:13:46.816 --> 00:13:49.070 align:middle line:10%
And so that throne--

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:51.545 align:middle line:10%
>> It's where the
energy source is.

00:13:51.545 --> 00:13:52.345 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:13:52.345 --> 00:13:55.993 align:middle line:10%
And how does sitting on that
throne or being near it,

00:13:55.993 --> 00:13:57.410 align:middle line:10%
how does that
change or affect her

00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:58.660 align:middle line:10%
when she's in that experience?

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:02.060 align:middle line:10%
>> It gives her
energy in her body.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:05.340 align:middle line:10%
It gives her energy
transmissions

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.710 align:middle line:10%
she can give her clients.

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:10.220 align:middle line:10%
And her clients, therefore,
are able to give transmissions

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.370 align:middle line:10%
to their people.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:17.090 align:middle line:84%
>> What information specifically
is there for her to learn about

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:18.265 align:middle line:90%
today?

00:14:18.265 --> 00:14:23.360 align:middle line:10%
>> She is one that has been
asked to personify God.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.220 align:middle line:10%
As people hear this,
we want them to open

We are all worthy of
being one with God.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.230 align:middle line:10%
We have shut down--

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:42.030 align:middle line:10%
you have shut down
your worthiness.

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:44.130 align:middle line:10%
You are made of God.

a mother loves the daughter,

a parent loves the
child, God loves you.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.420 align:middle line:10%
You are worthy of that love.

to us are telling her that she

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.020 align:middle line:90%
is worthy of this divine love.

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is really an
important message for everybody.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And she just demonstrated
on such a high level

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:14.130 align:middle line:84%
how she is to recognize it
and work within that confine.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.100 align:middle line:84%
This information that
you're giving her,

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.310 align:middle line:84%
how does that help shift
or change things for her?

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:23.670 align:middle line:10%
>> She just wants people to
know that they are loved.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:27.070 align:middle line:10%
She wants help expressing this.

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:30.750 align:middle line:10%
She wants people--
she has asked us

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:33.750 align:middle line:10%
to support her in sharing love.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:39.640 align:middle line:10%
She asks us daily, how do I help
people know that they are loved?

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.500 align:middle line:10%
And so we are
answering her prayer.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Nice.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.436 align:middle line:10%
So give her all that
information that

00:15:45.436 --> 00:15:46.603 align:middle line:10%

does not want to talk about her.

She calls it career.

She often tries
to cocoon in what

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:14.045 align:middle line:10%
she calls her cozy cottage when
she's meant to sit on a throne.

am not an entertainer.

remember it's not about that.

And so the best way for her to
help herself on this journey

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.960 align:middle line:10%
would be, what would you say?

it to mirror back to source.

can get in the way of how that
work is supposed to come out.

in a partnership with Edward,
we show her a vision of them

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.150 align:middle line:10%
holding hands but
only at the pinkies.

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:26.480 align:middle line:10%
And that they are
two separate beings.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:31.970 align:middle line:10%
And that as she grows
her magic, it is not

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:35.075 align:middle line:10%
combined with his at all.

00:19:35.075 --> 00:19:41.210 align:middle line:10%
And that she is holding herself
back, combining with his growth

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:42.480 align:middle line:10%
too much.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Edward is my favorite person
on this Earth and beyond.

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
sometimes we are like this.

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And we were supposed to be like
this because there are times

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:02.840 align:middle line:84%
that I'm feeling my
spirit stretch and grow,

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:07.130 align:middle line:84%
and then I'll go like
this because his path is

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:08.160 align:middle line:90%
going this way.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like, well, I need
to go this way to support.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And I know he
feels the same way.

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:15.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm going this way,
and he'll say, well,

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:16.820 align:middle line:90%
how do I need to support you?

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.295 align:middle line:84%
So it's a miracle that
we are still like this.

00:20:19.295 --> 00:20:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think, well,
that's the way

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:21.878 align:middle line:90%
we're going to stay together.

00:20:21.878 --> 00:20:24.017 align:middle line:84%
Is like, OK, you go
your way, I'll go mine.

00:20:24.017 --> 00:20:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And now, how are you
doing over there?

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.090 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:28.640 align:middle line:90%
That's the way.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.950 align:middle line:10%
Love each other.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:44.730 align:middle line:10%
But remember, you're
on your own path.

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:48.840 align:middle line:10%
No one is to wait
for another person.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:52.140 align:middle line:10%
We are here on
this journey alone.

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.520 align:middle line:10%
It's not about loneliness.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.970 align:middle line:10%
It's about be free.

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that's a really
big lesson for all of us.

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:01.960 align:middle line:90%
We're not here to become one.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:07.710 align:middle line:84%
We're here to have each support
one another as we grow together.

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:10.830 align:middle line:10%
That's a really wonderful way of
looking at it-- giving everybody

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:13.350 align:middle line:10%
their own sovereignty.

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:16.260 align:middle line:84%
If I can go back just a little
bit to that first session,

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.240 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to just
scan the body and see

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.760 align:middle line:84%
how everything is looking
within her physical body.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.870 align:middle line:84%
Do you see anything
standing out that you would

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:27.820 align:middle line:90%
like to look at more deeply?

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:31.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Her human mind
can be skeptical,

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:35.100 align:middle line:10%
and she worried that she
would leave her children,

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:38.700 align:middle line:10%
that she would have cancer,
and who would take care of her

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:39.900 align:middle line:10%
children?

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:45.060 align:middle line:10%
And there is enough worry
there that the breast cancer

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:46.110 align:middle line:10%
came back.

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:50.850 align:middle line:10%
So we have two, we'll
say, "jobs" today.

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:54.780 align:middle line:10%
One is to remind her of
how powerful her mind is

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:59.100 align:middle line:10%
because all dis-ease
comes from the mind.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:04.950 align:middle line:10%
And the second is to take
out the cancer again.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:06.855 align:middle line:10%
We wish to take it out now.

00:22:06.855 --> 00:22:08.060 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And explain to her
exactly how you do that.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:12.910 align:middle line:84%
She'll find that
very interesting.

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:18.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Whether you are out of your
body because of death or if you

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:21.450 align:middle line:10%
are incarnate, it
does not matter.

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:23.520 align:middle line:10%
There is a place in
the quantum that you

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:27.840 align:middle line:10%
can go for absolute
healing, and this place

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.490 align:middle line:10%
is the highest
vibrational frequency.

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:33.570 align:middle line:10%
We will call it quantum healing.

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:39.610 align:middle line:10%
This is a platform
of crystal and light.

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:44.770 align:middle line:10%
You stand on this
round platform.

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:49.670 align:middle line:10%
It's in this big
Coliseum-looking place.

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:54.060 align:middle line:84%
All of this crystal light
shines from below up above.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.440 align:middle line:90%
I don't know where it starts.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't know where it ends.

00:22:56.990 --> 00:23:00.590 align:middle line:84%
But one can stand
on it and be healed.

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:03.290 align:middle line:10%
Rachel is on the
platform and the platform

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:07.384 align:middle line:10%
is gently moving to the right.

00:23:07.384 --> 00:23:10.920 align:middle line:10%
And the light is coming
through the bottom of her.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.190 align:middle line:10%
She's in human form right now.

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:15.650 align:middle line:10%
It's moving through her feet.

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:19.950 align:middle line:10%
It would catch any
illness or disease,

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:21.530 align:middle line:10%
and it would transmute it.

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:24.860 align:middle line:10%
It would change it from whatever

that she calls the
wish makers, and she

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:23.150 align:middle line:10%
wants to try and talk to them
and know more about that visit.

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:27.165 align:middle line:84%

We have permission to
communicate sometimes,

It's not that.

00:24:52.135 --> 00:24:55.390 align:middle line:10%
It just wasn't really time
for us to talk to you,

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:59.580 align:middle line:10%

wrapped up in your blanket.

And we love you so much.

We didn't think there
was any harm in it.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:08.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, she said that she
felt that love from you,

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.810 align:middle line:10%
and she deeply appreciated
that experience.

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:15.330 align:middle line:10%
From your perspective,
what is New Earth like?

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:19.590 align:middle line:10%
>> It is the purest
form of love.

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:22.500 align:middle line:10%
Love that doesn't expect back.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.720 align:middle line:10%
That's New Earth love.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.960 align:middle line:10%
And self-love is key.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.730 align:middle line:84%
They're saying,
we're coming over

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:33.820 align:middle line:84%
here to escort many people
to New Earth when it's time.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And in order to be
ready for that place,

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:40.390 align:middle line:84%
self-love, loving other people
being in that frequency of love

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:41.985 align:middle line:90%
is very, very important.

So the notion that she could
have a wish, from your point

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:57.642 align:middle line:10%

We wanted her to have something.

she felt that she would also
be happy because of him.

through ourselves.

We find happiness through
our relationship with God.

her process that and understand

it even deeper?

to live more into her
divinity, her sovereignty.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:21.200 align:middle line:10%
