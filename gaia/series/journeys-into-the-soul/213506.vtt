My name is Michael Giessner.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm 54 years old.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm living in Portland, Oregon.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.480 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in a small town in
Germany called NeckargemÃ¼nd,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.380 align:middle line:90%
just with 15,000 people.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm working as an
IT professional

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.160 align:middle line:84%
at a major apparel footwear
company in Portland, Oregon.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.550 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I have an accent,
but just coming to the US,

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.150 align:middle line:84%
it was really hard having
had English and French

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.260 align:middle line:84%
in school and now suddenly
being able to rely on

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.170 align:middle line:84%
to get through your day
just speaking English.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.210 align:middle line:84%
The first half year
was pretty grueling

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.910 align:middle line:84%
because you learn British
English in school,

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.590 align:middle line:84%
and then you come to America
and everybody speaks, of course,

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.710 align:middle line:84%
with a different set of
words, different accents.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's just been hard in
the initial couple of months

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.480 align:middle line:84%
to just be able to
operate and function

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.360 align:middle line:84%
because you have to follow
along what people say.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.640 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day,
you're just basically tired

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.350 align:middle line:90%
and worn out just by following.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.110 align:middle line:90%


00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.760 align:middle line:84%
I met my wife late, so
I didn't necessarily

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.500 align:middle line:90%
expect to get married anymore.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.240 align:middle line:84%
So this was an absolute
out-of-this-world experience

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.690 align:middle line:84%
to be able to meet her, go
through the initial getting

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.660 align:middle line:84%
to know each other, and
just finding that for us,

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.660 align:middle line:84%
one plus one is
three-plus, basically.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.410 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we really
harmonize so well to each other

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.960 align:middle line:84%
and just add to each
other's life experience

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.760 align:middle line:84%
was something that was
just tremendous to me.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.870 align:middle line:84%
My wife a couple of months
ago had a QHHT session

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.670 align:middle line:84%
with Tracie Mahan, and
that opened up for me just

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.770 align:middle line:90%
seeing what it did to her.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a lot of high
expectations to begin with,

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.520 align:middle line:84%
but I'm curious about
trying it out and seeing

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.910 align:middle line:90%
what happens to me.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.330 align:middle line:84%
I do have some
experiences myself

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.750 align:middle line:84%
that I'd like to see how
things are developing, that I'd

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.070 align:middle line:84%
like to understand coming
from a German background,

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.330 align:middle line:84%
living in the US to see what
I'm experiencing every day,

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.680 align:middle line:84%
how that relates to, and what's
coming up in the QHHT session.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm completely new to any
kind of hypnosis experiences.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.800 align:middle line:84%
I haven't been under
hypnosis before.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.180 align:middle line:84%
From what I'm looking
to get out of this,

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.365 align:middle line:84%
when I grew up in Germany, I
was never part of the in-crowd.

00:03:04.365 --> 00:03:06.360 align:middle line:84%
I was always kind
of on the outside

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.810 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the target of the
bullying that goes on in school.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.760 align:middle line:10%
So for me, that was always a lot
of baggage that I brought along.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Even growing up for
me, it took a long time

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.660 align:middle line:84%
to actually come out of this and
really be able to figure out,

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.650 align:middle line:84%
what am I going to
do with my life?

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.220 align:middle line:84%
I haven't really had any
such experience before,

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.210 align:middle line:84%
but I'm really just
curious and open to see

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.015 align:middle line:90%

Michael has reached
out to me because I've

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.330 align:middle line:84%
done a couple of sessions
with his wife, Sonsee.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.790 align:middle line:84%

some of his own answers.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Michael told me he
wasn't a skeptic,

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.110 align:middle line:84%
but he wasn't sure
what to expect.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.460 align:middle line:84%
I love those kind of sessions
because he has no attachments

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.730 align:middle line:90%
to those answers.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.250 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times,
people will come in

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.980 align:middle line:84%
and they've watched a lot of
videos or read a lot of books,

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.590 align:middle line:84%
and they get attached
to what their journey is

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:08.710 align:middle line:90%
going to look like.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And that is one of the areas
that is very important to leave

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.510 align:middle line:84%
all of that at the door because
you're going to have your own

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.940 align:middle line:84%
experience, and it's not going
to look like anyone else's.

I often tell people,
your experience

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.690 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
like a fingerprint.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.220 align:middle line:84%
Everyone will be
different, and your journey

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.320 align:middle line:84%
is going to be different
from anything you see here.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.220 align:middle line:84%
The first thing that's going
to happen when Michael comes in

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.720 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to
sit down and we're

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.680 align:middle line:90%
going to have a conversation.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.920 align:middle line:84%
I've asked him to put
together some questions,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.490 align:middle line:84%
and we're going
to go over those.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to interview him
and go over some of his life

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.360 align:middle line:84%
stories so that I can be a
better facilitator for him

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.770 align:middle line:90%
during the session.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And we'll find his
answers, and we'll

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.410 align:middle line:90%
find his healing within that.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, we get
really caught up in life,

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.540 align:middle line:84%
and we forget to slow down and
look at what's really going on.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to help
him find those answers

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.690 align:middle line:84%
and slow down, and
really look at that

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.525 align:middle line:84%
and get the deeper
meaning to things.

The reason we do an
interview like this

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.640 align:middle line:84%
is because it's really helpful
for me to get to know you

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.290 align:middle line:84%
so that when we're
in the hypnosis,

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.280 align:middle line:84%
I can ask some really
good questions for you.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.080 align:middle line:90%

I know you and might understand

had a session before,

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.750 align:middle line:84%
which kind of
piqued my curiosity.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm just curious what's next,
as well as some of the reasons

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.780 align:middle line:84%
that kind of things came
out the way they came out.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.063 align:middle line:84%
For me, growing up as a German
boy in a little village,

00:06:51.063 --> 00:06:52.480 align:middle line:84%
just trying to
figure out if there

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.430 align:middle line:84%
were any unresolved
items from my history

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.560 align:middle line:84%
when I grew up in
the little village.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my parents' home
was very protective.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.170 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm the only child.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:04.930 align:middle line:84%
So spending time
in school, I was

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.270 align:middle line:84%
targeted with a lot of
bullying, so this was always

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.370 align:middle line:90%
very rough for me.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.860 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it took a
long time to figure out

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.170 align:middle line:84%
what I really wanted
to do with my life,

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.940 align:middle line:84%
let alone actually go off and do
a job on a different continent.

and on when you're asked about,

what to do, and my dad

jobs that I don't

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.710 align:middle line:90%
think I really wanted to do.

feel when your dad's wanting you

00:08:01.213 --> 00:08:02.255 align:middle line:90%
to have this information?

00:08:02.255 --> 00:08:05.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's not
really a positive memory.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.850 align:middle line:84%
I was just glad that
nothing worked out.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.840 align:middle line:84%
I got as far as having
to do some interviews,

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.320 align:middle line:90%
but really was not--

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.360 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.432 align:middle line:84%
>> So he's sending you out
to all these job interviews

00:08:14.432 --> 00:08:16.140 align:middle line:84%
and you're like, I
don't want to do that.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.115 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:17.115 --> 00:08:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>> But you didn't know
what you wanted to do?

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I really did not know what
I wanted to do at that time.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up just having
good enough grades to get

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:31.050 align:middle line:90%
into another school here.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
what changed things

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.250 align:middle line:90%
for me from my perspective.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:40.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this was the time when
the first PCs were available.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I just used it for playing,
but then discovered that there

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:49.220 align:middle line:84%
was more to it, and that there
was ways to actually program

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.330 align:middle line:90%
that thing.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't effortless,
but compared to other people,

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.080 align:middle line:90%
very low effort.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:54.530 align:middle line:90%
Like, OK.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:55.470 align:middle line:90%
This makes sense.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:59.420 align:middle line:84%
I just discovered that this
can make a pretty decent living

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.020 align:middle line:90%
for me with this.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.980 align:middle line:84%
From my perspective, things
that I actually enjoyed doing.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Of course, not
just make a living,

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:08.930 align:middle line:84%
but being recognized for
actually really being

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:10.140 align:middle line:90%
pretty good at it.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>> So that then set my path.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.253 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I really liked
what I was doing.

00:09:17.253 --> 00:09:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Going back to where I started,
I was looking for something

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:23.270 align:middle line:84%
that I enjoyed doing, that I
enjoyed and I was good at it.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:28.610 align:middle line:84%
It took me till
probably around 2003,

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:33.390 align:middle line:84%
2004 where this started
to get a little bit old.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:34.860 align:middle line:90%
It's like, what am I doing?

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.420 align:middle line:84%
So I started to spend
more time in Portland.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.010 align:middle line:84%
Started to establish
friends in Portland.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.210 align:middle line:84%
This is more of a turn that
started to develop maybe--

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:45.380 align:middle line:90%
definitely not before--

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>> You're in your 30s yet, or--

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.310 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm in my 30s by now.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:49.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:52.440 align:middle line:90%
So still very work-driven.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.830 align:middle line:84%
It took me a long time
to find my soul mate.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:59.420 align:middle line:84%
For me, it was a whole
different level of connecting,

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.130 align:middle line:84%
and that's something
hard to describe.

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:04.790 align:middle line:84%
But it's never-- something
I never experienced before.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.447 align:middle line:84%
We met in 2016, and we
got married in 2018.

00:10:08.447 --> 00:10:10.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in a lot of
situations we don't even

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.850 align:middle line:90%
have to say anything.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:15.818 align:middle line:84%
We already know what the
other one is bringing up.

00:10:15.818 --> 00:10:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is just
something I've never

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.970 align:middle line:84%
experienced before in a
personal relationship.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:22.770 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
else that stands out

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.480 align:middle line:84%
to you that might be important
for me to know today.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I think we
covered quite a bit.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:33.190 align:middle line:90%
>> You covered quite a bit.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:35.205 align:middle line:84%
You said you've never
been hypnotized before.

00:10:35.205 --> 00:10:36.005 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:10:36.005 --> 00:10:36.990 align:middle line:90%
Not under hypnosis.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:37.790 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.465 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
a wonderful session,

00:10:40.465 --> 00:10:43.090 align:middle line:84%
as long as you go with the very
first thing that comes to mind,

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:43.610 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:44.590 align:middle line:90%
You're going to just--

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:47.505 align:middle line:84%
whatever's popping
in, say it, OK?

00:10:47.505 --> 00:10:49.350 align:middle line:90%
Trust that you're under.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:53.350 align:middle line:84%
Use lots of words to describe
what you're experiencing.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And then if you feel
like you're making it up,

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:57.760 align:middle line:90%
my rule is, please do.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Make it up, because making it
up comes from that imagination,

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.670 align:middle line:84%
and that imagination is
pulling it from somewhere.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:05.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:11:05.575 --> 00:11:08.785 align:middle line:84%
>> Those are going to be some
really crucial things to get

00:11:08.785 --> 00:11:10.223 align:middle line:90%
a good session.

00:11:10.223 --> 00:11:11.390 align:middle line:90%
That's all I've got for you.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:12.680 align:middle line:90%
Have any questions?

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.480 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:17.898 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking forward to
seeing what happens.

00:11:17.898 --> 00:11:21.356 align:middle line:10%
[STATIC]

00:11:21.356 --> 00:11:22.344 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.344 --> 00:11:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And what do you see
down there below you?

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:27.680 align:middle line:10%
>> My hometown comes to mind.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Looks like a winter day.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.010 align:middle line:10%
There's snow on the ground.

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I never know where
people are going to go,

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.120 align:middle line:84%
and so I always ask them,
what's the first thing you see?

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Michael's experience was
hovering over his hometown.

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:47.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Moving towards the
house I grew up with.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.060 align:middle line:10%
So I'm floating
along the street.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.500 align:middle line:10%
Looks like the door is--

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:57.710 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's closed, but not
locked, so I can open the door

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:59.960 align:middle line:10%
and go in.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:04.130 align:middle line:10%
I go up the stairs
to the floor where

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:07.100 align:middle line:10%
the room is that I grew up in.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's take a moment
and look at your body.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.400 align:middle line:90%
How do you perceive yourself?

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.200 align:middle line:10%
>> More like a
teenage boy, I guess.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.160 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a winter scene, so
it took me a little bit of time

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:21.500 align:middle line:90%
to orient.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's go ahead and go to some
of the other rooms in the house.

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:29.920 align:middle line:90%
You still aren't seeing anyone?

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, I do see
my mom outside.

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:37.125 align:middle line:84%
I think I went back there
in order to meet my mom.

00:12:37.125 --> 00:12:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>> What is she
doing in the yard?

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, it's odd because
it's cold out there.

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:42.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Hmm.

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:49.170 align:middle line:10%
>> But she's-- she's putting out
the feed seeds for the birds.

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:52.455 align:middle line:10%
We always had a bird house
where we could feed the birds

00:12:52.455 --> 00:12:54.840 align:middle line:10%
during winter when it snowed.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.980 align:middle line:84%
She was always very aware
and wanting to help,

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:02.040 align:middle line:84%
to offer them that
they find food

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.600 align:middle line:84%
and make it well
through the winter.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.310 align:middle line:84%
It was nice to actually
experience that back with her.

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's go ahead and close
that scene with you and your mom

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.990 align:middle line:84%
and move to another
important day.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:16.120 align:middle line:90%
Where does that take you?

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:22.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Looks like I'm flying
up towards the clouds.

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.360 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Trying to recognize
what I'm getting.

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:28.280 align:middle line:10%
It's just flashing, flickering.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.410 align:middle line:10%
More of an unease.

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:33.042 align:middle line:10%
Not the comfort I just had.

00:13:33.042 --> 00:13:34.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.090 align:middle line:10%
>> It feels dark.

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:40.640 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you perceive
yourself in that darkness?

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Still floating light.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>> You're floating light?

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.760 align:middle line:90%
>> So you don't have a body.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:47.590 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.880 align:middle line:10%
Not a body that I'm--

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.350 align:middle line:10%
not that I'm aware of.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, after that
scene, I was recognizing.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:59.450 align:middle line:84%
I was being able to relate
to what I was experiencing.

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:02.370 align:middle line:84%
With that sequence, I was
like, OK, this is happening.

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:05.270 align:middle line:84%
This is what's coming, but
I don't know what it means,

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:06.690 align:middle line:90%
nor do I recognize it.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Where is it
that you're going?

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:11.990 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm heading for a planet.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:13.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.740 align:middle line:10%
>> It looks purple.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:16.890 align:middle line:10%
>> The planet's purple?

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:17.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:21.270 align:middle line:10%
At least, it comes with a dark
purple hue to it, the way it

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:22.440 align:middle line:10%
kind of--

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.850 align:middle line:10%
I see it right now.

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:24.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:26.920 align:middle line:90%
He sees it was a purple planet.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.012 align:middle line:84%
That's exciting for
me because you never

00:14:29.012 --> 00:14:30.970 align:middle line:84%
know where those planets
are going to take you.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And in this line of
work, sometimes those

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.330 align:middle line:84%
can be quite
extraordinary experiences.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.512 align:middle line:90%
What happens next?

00:14:38.512 --> 00:14:44.340 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm arriving on the
planet, and it looks barren.

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.640 align:middle line:10%
Just stone formations.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.251 align:middle line:10%
>> How do you know this planet?

00:14:50.251 --> 00:14:52.110 align:middle line:10%
>> I have no idea.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:55.780 align:middle line:84%
It felt like something
I had seen before,

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.470 align:middle line:84%
even though there isn't

orange from here.

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:10.290 align:middle line:84%
So as you're looking around,
are you still an energy form,

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:12.580 align:middle line:84%
or do you have a
different form now?

>> I'm still an energy form.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:15.620 align:middle line:10%
Just light.

00:15:25.701 --> 00:15:30.400 align:middle line:10%
>> When I get up to the hill, I
see a tower in the distance with

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:36.550 align:middle line:10%
an energy light on top of
it, like a light beacon.

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:40.510 align:middle line:10%
So there's energy going
from the tower into the sky.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.372 align:middle line:10%
>> What is that for?

00:15:42.372 --> 00:15:45.490 align:middle line:10%
>> I have no idea what
the tower would be for.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:50.030 align:middle line:10%
Just as I look up,
I see the light.

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:54.310 align:middle line:10%
I feel a lot of warm comfort.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:56.180 align:middle line:10%

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:58.820 align:middle line:10%

running from the--

>> A lot of energy.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:08.840 align:middle line:10%
>> So it seems to be somehow
funneling the energy from

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.590 align:middle line:10%
the ground to the sky because
I can feel the energy going

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:14.600 align:middle line:10%
through the pipes.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.665 align:middle line:10%

from the planet and going up?

00:16:17.665 --> 00:16:18.570 align:middle line:10%

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:19.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

center that I needed to go

to in order to not just
journey to the next point,

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:32.600 align:middle line:84%
but also release additional
energies as I was traveling

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.030 align:middle line:84%
through the energy
beam, I guess.

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:38.450 align:middle line:10%

is being sent somewhere.

follow the energy?

00:16:41.356 --> 00:16:42.945 align:middle line:10%
>> I go into the pipe.

00:16:42.945 --> 00:16:46.890 align:middle line:10%
I get picked up by the
stream and kind of get

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:49.240 align:middle line:10%
the sensation of moving fast.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.580 align:middle line:10%

being transported.

Gate Bridge, and I

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.905 align:middle line:10%

I remember that.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
the recognition

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:11.760 align:middle line:84%
that I'm over the ocean, facing
Golden Gate and the Bay Area,

The birds are not flying away.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:43.520 align:middle line:10%
As I embrace my wife, the
birds are coming and landing

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.490 align:middle line:10%
on my shoulder, both of them.

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:49.920 align:middle line:10%
One to the left,
one to the right.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.860 align:middle line:10%

significance of the birds?

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:57.120 align:middle line:10%
>> What comes to mind is that
they resemble my parents.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.920 align:middle line:10%
The steller's jay
would be my dad,

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:02.370 align:middle line:10%
and the red robin
would be my mom.

So my wife and my daughter
came into the yard, joined us.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And instead of
leaving, the birds

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:14.650 align:middle line:84%
ended up joining us by sitting
on top of my shoulders.

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:17.730 align:middle line:84%
So we were one tight
group together.

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:21.125 align:middle line:84%

they're there on your shoulder?

00:21:21.125 --> 00:21:23.410 align:middle line:10%
>> They're just saying
they're looking out for me.

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:25.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:27.260 align:middle line:90%
How does that feel to you?

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:28.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Comforting.

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:29.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

his shoulders at one point,

mother and his father,

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:38.240 align:middle line:84%
which is also
indicating that this

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.700 align:middle line:84%
is in the future when
his father's no longer

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:43.760 align:middle line:84%
here embodiment
and has passed on.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.930 align:middle line:84%
It's showing him that
he will never be alone.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.820 align:middle line:84%
His parents will
always be there.

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:52.340 align:middle line:84%

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.850 align:middle line:10%
located throughout the planet.

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:52.210 align:middle line:10%
And I'm connected to one
that is located over my home.

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:56.130 align:middle line:10%
And it's not seen in third
dimension, but you can feel it.

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:59.115 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a pyramid, an
energy pyramid above the home?

00:22:59.115 --> 00:23:00.240 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:05.310 align:middle line:10%
There are squads connected to
each pyramid around the grid,

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:06.600 align:middle line:10%
around the planet.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:12.720 align:middle line:10%
Michael is the Light Worker
that has built this pyramid.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:13.840 align:middle line:10%
He doesn't know it.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Sonsee didn't know
everything either, right?

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>> No, she didn't.

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>> [LAUGHS] Maybe he'll
get to remember too.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:26.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you know what Sonsee
believes about that pyramid?

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Did my wife talk
about the pyramid?

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Because that was a picture that
I hadn't seen at all before.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.275 align:middle line:84%
We purposely did not talk about
what's happened in her session.

00:23:36.275 --> 00:23:40.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and not in her first
or in her second session.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And may I speak to
Michael's subconscious, please?

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:45.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Why did you pick that
for him to see today?

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:50.850 align:middle line:10%
>> It shows patterns.

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:53.880 align:middle line:10%
It brings patterns to life.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Can you tell me about that?

00:23:56.250 --> 00:24:00.870 align:middle line:10%
>> He should avoid trying
to please everybody.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:02.565 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:24:02.565 --> 00:24:09.270 align:middle line:84%
So how does he stop these
patterns of doing that?

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:11.830 align:middle line:10%
>> By setting boundaries.

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:15.187 align:middle line:10%
Not take everything
in that comes at him.

00:24:15.187 --> 00:24:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.790 align:middle line:84%
So how does he keep from
taking everything in?

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:23.280 align:middle line:10%
>> By using his shields.

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.380 align:middle line:10%
>> What do the shields do?

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:30.840 align:middle line:10%
>> They block the negative
sentiment from getting absorbed.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:34.170 align:middle line:10%
Make sure he actively
protects himself.

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I asked the subconscious mind
what the energy shields were

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:42.060 align:middle line:84%
for, and they were to shield him
from the traumas from earlier

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.050 align:middle line:90%
in his life.

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:46.020 align:middle line:84%
If he were to heal the
trauma within himself,

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:50.250 align:middle line:90%
would that energy go away?

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.020 align:middle line:10%
>> It would go away, yeah.

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Where does he
hold it in his body?

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.832 align:middle line:10%
>> Around his--
his left side here.

00:24:58.832 --> 00:25:00.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Uh-huh.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:04.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Feels like a glob.

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:05.300 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a glob?

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Glob in the chest.

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:10.080 align:middle line:84%
As I went through it,
it felt like this--

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.150 align:middle line:90%
this ball pulsating.

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:14.450 align:middle line:84%
It felt unhealthy,
something that definitely

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:15.810 align:middle line:90%
doesn't belong there.

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:19.490 align:middle line:10%
>> What does that glob
want Michael to know?

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:22.200 align:middle line:10%
>> It should be released.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And if that glob could talk
to Michael, what would it say?

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:30.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Being open to
the higher energies.

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:34.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So are you able to help it
open to the higher energies?

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:35.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.795 align:middle line:10%
What's happening?

00:25:37.795 --> 00:25:40.744 align:middle line:10%
>> It's slowly opening up.

00:25:40.744 --> 00:25:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:47.090 align:middle line:84%
What's that feel
like to release that?

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:50.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Very, very
soothing, relaxing,

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:52.650 align:middle line:10%
like a burden is dropping.

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:56.150 align:middle line:90%
That must feel wonderful.

00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:58.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:00.490 align:middle line:10%
>> What about the trauma?

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:02.810 align:middle line:10%
>> It's fading.

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:04.610 align:middle line:10%
>> What happens to the glob?

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:07.410 align:middle line:10%
>> It dissolves.

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And is that
completely released now?

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:12.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:13.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:17.210 align:middle line:84%
Does Michael need
shields anymore?

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:21.560 align:middle line:10%
>> No, he shouldn't
need shields anymore.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Doesn't need to
protect himself from other

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:28.460 align:middle line:84%
people's traumas because
he let go of his own?

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:29.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>> What a beautiful thing to
hear when he comes back with,

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't need the
shields anymore.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.860 align:middle line:90%
The trauma is gone.

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:40.010 align:middle line:84%
What about his
affinity to running?

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:41.660 align:middle line:90%
Where did that come from?

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:45.380 align:middle line:10%
>> It provides him with
peace and opens him up

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.780 align:middle line:10%
to the energies.

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So he's had trouble running
lately because of the--

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.490 align:middle line:90%
the problem with the knee.

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk to me about
what's going on with his knee?

00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:00.440 align:middle line:10%
>> It looked like it
was tied to the glob.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.750 align:middle line:10%
>> It was tied to the glob?

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:03.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:08.930 align:middle line:10%
Looks like there was a line
going from the knee to the glob.

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:13.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Oftentimes, our traumas can
create physical ailments within

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:16.820 align:middle line:84%
our physical body to
get our attention.

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Sure enough, the
pain was created

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:22.860 align:middle line:84%
by inflammation that was
caused by friction, which

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:24.850 align:middle line:90%
was connected to the glob.

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:28.575 align:middle line:84%
So the subconscious I know
can do anything in any moment,

00:27:28.575 --> 00:27:30.420 align:middle line:90%
heal anything instantly.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Is this something that
could be done today?

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.100 align:middle line:10%
>> It could be done today.

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:36.800 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:41.130 align:middle line:10%
>> The space that created when
the energy was there will need

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:42.870 align:middle line:10%
to close.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:45.270 align:middle line:10%
>> And is that happening now?

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:47.046 align:middle line:10%
>> It's starting to rebuild.

00:27:47.046 --> 00:27:48.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:51.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Slowly regenerating.

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I'd like to make sure
that this doesn't happen again

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:55.040 align:middle line:90%
for Michael.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't want the
injury to come back.

00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:04.670 align:middle line:84%
So what would be your advice for
making sure that doesn't happen?

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:09.810 align:middle line:10%
>> He has to do regular
exercises so that what just got

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:12.266 align:middle line:10%
rebuilt does not deteriorate.

00:28:12.266 --> 00:28:14.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:16.640 align:middle line:90%
Is he willing to do that?

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.850 align:middle line:10%
>> He should be doing that.

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:19.785 align:middle line:10%
He's not always
willing to do it.

00:28:19.785 --> 00:28:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>> [LAUGHS] But to keep a
strong knee, I bet he would be.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:26.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:29.280 align:middle line:10%
>> And is the knee repaired now?

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:32.310 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] That was
the first thing

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:36.360 align:middle line:84%
I was testing when I'd gotten
up from the bench is like, OK,

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:37.840 align:middle line:90%
there's no pain.

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.080 align:middle line:90%
It still feels tender.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:46.620 align:middle line:84%
But in the moment, there is no
knee pain on the right side.

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Anything we forgot to ask
today that you would like

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.900 align:middle line:90%
to share with him?

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.410 align:middle line:10%
>> I think this is--

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:53.810 align:middle line:10%
this is it.

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:55.670 align:middle line:10%
>> And it feels complete?

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:56.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Feels complete.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:57.715 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:28:57.715 --> 00:28:59.090 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
if they're here

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:02.840 align:middle line:84%
to work with the planet or just
the energy of their own home.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Their relationship is
going to be stronger

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.900 align:middle line:84%
from this because
they're working together.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:09.800 align:middle line:90%
All right, Michael.

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:14.726 align:middle line:84%
How long did you feel like
you were in that hypnosis?

00:29:14.726 --> 00:29:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Half an hour.

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:18.180 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, two and a half hours.

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Two and a half hours.

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Two and a half hours.

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:26.790 align:middle line:84%

was mind opening for me.

to reunite with my soul mate.

00:29:35.465 --> 00:29:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Those are just such treasures
that I'm so glad that I actually

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:40.890 align:middle line:90%
got to experience this.

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:45.150 align:middle line:84%
That makes the whole journey
absolutely priceless to me.

It's been three weeks
since my QHHT session.

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:55.470 align:middle line:84%
I had some time to digest
what I was learning.

00:29:55.470 --> 00:30:01.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm still completely
surprised and impressed

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.440 align:middle line:90%
by the discovery of the glob.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.950 align:middle line:84%
I've learned that
I had to take care

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:10.465 align:middle line:84%
more of my personal feelings,
connect with my inner self,

00:30:10.465 --> 00:30:16.840 align:middle line:84%
and really take time to meditate
and focus on really working

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.940 align:middle line:84%
on the things that
happen so that there

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.850 align:middle line:84%
is no accumulation

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:34.930 align:middle line:84%
so that's definitely on
the way to a recovery.

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:37.780 align:middle line:84%
But so far, things have
been going very well.

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:40.030 align:middle line:84%
I've definitely
become more aware

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:42.050 align:middle line:84%
of the energies
that are going on

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:45.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm exchanging with my
wife, my sensitivity

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:48.100 align:middle line:84%
to energies, what I'm
learning about energies,

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:51.080 align:middle line:90%
and how I react to energies.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.810 align:middle line:84%
This was definitely a
journey into my soul.

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much, Tracie, for
opening up that door for me,

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.300 align:middle line:84%
and I'm looking forward to
discover more in the future.
