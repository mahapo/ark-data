I am 63 years old, and I'm
living on the island of Gozo.

I am originally from Germany.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.913 align:middle line:10%
I became married very
young, had children,

00:01:12.913 --> 00:01:14.080 align:middle line:10%
and we had our own business.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.880 align:middle line:10%
We were very successful
business wise.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.260 align:middle line:10%
After my children were bigger,
I started naturopathic medicine.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.080 align:middle line:10%
And after two years I
passed the examination

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.800 align:middle line:10%
and was already asked
to work in a business.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.510 align:middle line:10%
It was really a successful time,
but I missed always something.

there is something missing,

And so I finished my marriage.

I came twice for six weeks to
Malta for studying acupuncture,

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.650 align:middle line:10%

the island of Gozo.

nine years already.

I decided to work
here a little bit.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.940 align:middle line:10%
And also, spirit wise,
I really did grow.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.770 align:middle line:10%
I met very interesting
people here.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.540 align:middle line:10%
It was really the energy of
Gozo that called me in a way.

While I am on this
island, I met Karin Laing,

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.210 align:middle line:10%
who has an amazing
property where

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.030 align:middle line:10%

I heard before about
past life retreats.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.690 align:middle line:10%
And so Karin told me
about Life Between Lives,

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.830 align:middle line:10%
what makes me more curious
and interested on her work.

to do something in this life.

state of consciousness.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.180 align:middle line:84%
During the session, I
skillfully guide them

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.190 align:middle line:84%
on a soul journey to be able to
go to the place their soul calls

design and architecture

practice for 30 years exactly.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And what really interested me is
why did my clients get cancer,

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.140 align:middle line:84%
why did they get depression,
why did they become ill,

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.320 align:middle line:84%
and why did they stay with
people that abused them.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And then something
magical happened.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.290 align:middle line:10%
One day I picked up Michael
Newton's "Journey of Souls,"

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.400 align:middle line:10%
and that changed the
course of my life.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.720 align:middle line:84%
One day I was
swimming in the sea,

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.990 align:middle line:84%
having this
conversation with God.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And the voice in my
head said, you'll

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.370 align:middle line:84%
come to Malta to be
a spiritual healer.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
looking up and saying,

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.070 align:middle line:90%
what is a spiritual healer?

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.340 align:middle line:90%
And I got out of the water.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And one of my friends, Nila, was
sitting on the side of the sea.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her, Nila,
I'm going to move to Malta,

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.065 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to be
a spiritual healer.

00:05:03.065 --> 00:05:03.940 align:middle line:90%
And she looked at me.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Karin,
you can't do that.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.130 align:middle line:84%
In Malta, it's only the priests
that are spiritual healers.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.710 align:middle line:84%
If you do that, they will
burn you at the stake.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:12.830 align:middle line:90%
I was quite mortified.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.670 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, actually I'm
on my spiritual journey,

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.250 align:middle line:84%
and I will find the answers
that are right for me.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And a month later, I was
sitting at my computer.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.460 align:middle line:90%
I lit a white candle.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.210 align:middle line:84%
I went on this
little Google search.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.530 align:middle line:84%
I found wonderful
Allison in Pietrasanta.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.130 align:middle line:84%
They facilitated this Michael
Newton hypnotherapy practitioner

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.930 align:middle line:90%
training.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Then I went back
home to South Africa.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And for two years, I
actually ran my two practices

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.460 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.680 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, I had
the interior design;

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.930 align:middle line:84%
at the other hand,
my hypnotherapy

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.460 align:middle line:90%
and healing practice.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.690 align:middle line:84%
After two years, I woke up
one morning, and I was ready.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.130 align:middle line:84%
So I closed my businesses,
paid the last taxes as one

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.360 align:middle line:90%
does, and I moved to Gozo.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Everything transpired
for me to end up

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.420 align:middle line:84%
moving into this
beautiful, magical home.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.110 align:middle line:84%

it L'Gharix, which means

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.800 align:middle line:84%

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.680 align:middle line:90%
Why did you come to Gozo?

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.260 align:middle line:84%

you came to do in Gozo?

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Why does your intuition

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:41.040 align:middle line:90%
is nearly coming to an end?

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.360 align:middle line:84%
In your career, what is it
that you should be focusing on?

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Is there something specific
that you need to focus on?

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.270 align:middle line:84%
Or are there other skills
that you need to add on?

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.260 align:middle line:84%
So these are all around
your soul purpose and for us

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.350 align:middle line:84%
to understand what it is that
you've really come to do.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And do you need to
focus more on this?

00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.950 align:middle line:90%
Is there something else?

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:05.944 align:middle line:84%
And what do they
want you to know?

00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And with your ex-husband,
you had all these children.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And what if we just
asked the questions?

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.690 align:middle line:90%
What has he come to teach you?

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:18.345 align:middle line:84%
And what have you
come to teach him?

00:08:18.345 --> 00:08:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:20.945 align:middle line:84%
I hope it's good
for many children.

00:08:20.945 --> 00:08:21.745 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:21.745 --> 00:08:22.910 align:middle line:90%
So this is important.

>> You held his back?

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:57.070 align:middle line:90%
You're his background worker.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:59.050 align:middle line:90%
He had many businesses.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And you really held
the space for him

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.126 align:middle line:84%
as he created all
these businesses.

00:09:05.126 --> 00:09:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Business wise,
we were successful.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.015 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, you were
successful business wise.

00:09:09.015 --> 00:09:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And after I did my
naturopath, I expected,

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.850 align:middle line:90%
now it's my turn.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:17.830 align:middle line:84%
I can also step back a little
bit and do minor things.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:21.080 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't accept it,
and he did even block it.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:25.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, so it's to understand
that even though you supported

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.730 align:middle line:84%
him all these years, when you
finally stepped up and said,

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be a naturopath,
he tried to block it.

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't support you
as you had supported him.

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:38.170 align:middle line:90%
So let's understand that.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:41.660 align:middle line:84%
When you said, right, I have
supported you all these years,

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.050 align:middle line:84%
now I want to do this,
he tried to undermine

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.850 align:middle line:90%
what you were trying to create.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is what also
pushed you to leave.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.650 align:middle line:84%
I think you have some
amazing questions.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:53.450 align:middle line:90%
Well done.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:57.020 align:middle line:84%
It also gives you a lot of
clarity on the whole patterns.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And we'll find out if
there's anything that you

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.540 align:middle line:90%
can do to change the patterns.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.115 align:middle line:90%
Let's see how this unfolds.

00:10:05.115 --> 00:10:06.405 align:middle line:90%
>> It sounds good.

00:10:06.405 --> 00:10:07.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, very good.

00:10:07.635 --> 00:10:10.856 align:middle line:90%


00:10:10.856 --> 00:10:13.802 align:middle line:10%
[STATIC]

00:10:13.802 --> 00:10:16.260 align:middle line:90%


00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:20.050 align:middle line:84%
First of all, tell me,
is it day or night?

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:21.355 align:middle line:10%
>> Dark.

00:10:21.355 --> 00:10:22.670 align:middle line:10%
>> It is dark.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:23.720 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.000 align:middle line:90%
And are you alone?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.745 align:middle line:90%
Or are you with someone?

00:10:26.745 --> 00:10:28.260 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm alone.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.220 align:middle line:10%
>> And are you
outside or inside?

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.045 align:middle line:10%
>> I am inside.

00:10:33.045 --> 00:10:35.445 align:middle line:10%
>> What are you wearing?

00:10:35.445 --> 00:10:40.732 align:middle line:10%
>> Very basic clothes.

00:10:40.732 --> 00:10:43.746 align:middle line:90%
>> And what is your age?

00:10:43.746 --> 00:10:47.845 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm maybe between 30, 40.

00:10:47.845 --> 00:10:48.880 align:middle line:90%
>> 30, 40.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:49.990 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:52.605 align:middle line:90%
And what is your name?

00:10:52.605 --> 00:10:55.141 align:middle line:10%
>> Theresia.

00:10:55.141 --> 00:10:58.425 align:middle line:84%
>> Describe the scene
you find yourself in.

00:10:58.425 --> 00:11:01.350 align:middle line:10%
>> It is a house
on the mountain.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the year that
you find yourself in?

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:07.730 align:middle line:10%
>> 1890.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:09.510 align:middle line:90%
>> 1890.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:10.310 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.990 align:middle line:90%
And what is your feeling?

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Which country do you
find yourself in?

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.550 align:middle line:10%
>> It's in Germany, in Bavaria.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>> She told me that when she
did her naturopathic training,

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.180 align:middle line:84%
she went into the
mountains with a group.

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
house that she

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.550 align:middle line:84%
felt very connected,
actually, a cabin that she

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:28.930 align:middle line:90%
felt very connected to.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:32.260 align:middle line:84%
In this past life,
she went to the life

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.690 align:middle line:90%
where she lived in that cabin.

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a more than
100-year-old house.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.090 align:middle line:84%
I felt very familiar
with this house.

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:39.250 align:middle line:90%
I was there before.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.220 align:middle line:90%
And it was exactly this house.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.996 align:middle line:84%
>> And help us
understand your story.

00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:49.820 align:middle line:10%
>> I am working with plants.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.720 align:middle line:10%
And I'm a healer.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.930 align:middle line:10%
I help also women to give birth.

00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, so you're a midwife.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.850 align:middle line:10%
You're a healer, and
you're a midwife.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.630 align:middle line:10%
And you work with plants.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>> It was necessary.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:09.190 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't live
without this medicine.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And I learned very
basic what plants

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:14.350 align:middle line:90%
are good for what problem.

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And I picked them, dried,
them and I used it.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.585 align:middle line:90%
>> Who is there with you?

00:12:20.585 --> 00:12:26.620 align:middle line:10%
>> There is a man, but I
don't see any children.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.615 align:middle line:10%
It is my husband.

00:12:28.615 --> 00:12:31.145 align:middle line:10%
>> Tell us your story with him.

00:12:31.145 --> 00:12:35.012 align:middle line:10%
>> It was hard times.

00:12:35.012 --> 00:12:39.120 align:middle line:10%
I did prepare food,
and it was a poor time.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.920 align:middle line:10%
And when I went out
and I come back,

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.670 align:middle line:10%
and it's not there anymore.

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:46.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Who took the food?

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:47.330 align:middle line:10%
Or what happened?

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:48.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Somebody took it.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:52.520 align:middle line:10%
Somebody who did
need it more than me.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.710 align:middle line:90%
I did prepare a few food.

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:58.110 align:middle line:90%
And it was on the cooker.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And I went out to call
my husband or whatever.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And when I came back, it
was not there anymore.

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:07.310 align:middle line:84%
It was not the time when you
could go to a supermarket.

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:09.530 align:middle line:84%
You had only the food,
what you did grow.

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:13.550 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you could buy
something in next village.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.420 align:middle line:90%
And so it was really scary.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:16.550 align:middle line:90%
And it was poor time.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:17.460 align:middle line:90%
Many people died.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And now I'm going to move you
forward to your last day in that

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.880 align:middle line:90%
life as Theresia.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:29.315 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a better time now,
but I'm still alone with him.

00:13:29.315 --> 00:13:32.525 align:middle line:84%
>> And how old were
you on this last day?

00:13:32.525 --> 00:13:36.280 align:middle line:10%
>> I was almost 78.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.370 align:middle line:10%
It feels good to go home.

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So allow yourself to
go to the last moments.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.970 align:middle line:10%
>> I move upwards.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And does the light
flow towards you,

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.240 align:middle line:84%
or is it only you floating
towards the light?

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.270 align:middle line:10%
>> It feels like we
float toward each other.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>> If you are not in this
body anymore, you can float.

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you
don't need on planet

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.120 align:middle line:90%
where you have your legs on.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.160 align:middle line:90%
And it's like a meeting space.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.300 align:middle line:10%
I was first a bit of bluish
light, but it became more.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And this light is a light
energy that has come to greet

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:17.990 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Is this being male, female,
or androgynous in appearance?

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.385 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a woman.

00:14:25.385 --> 00:14:26.185 align:middle line:10%
It's--

00:14:26.185 --> 00:14:27.630 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a woman.

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:28.770 align:middle line:10%
Very good.

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:30.595 align:middle line:10%
>> It was my granny.

00:14:30.595 --> 00:14:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>> What does she say when
she connects with you?

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:40.070 align:middle line:10%
>> The message she gave me,
not even with words, is--

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.515 align:middle line:10%
said I did right.

00:14:41.515 --> 00:14:45.140 align:middle line:10%
Said it was important.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:48.440 align:middle line:10%
>> That it is important.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.390 align:middle line:84%
She carries a lot
of guilt because she

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.310 align:middle line:84%
left her husband and her
children in this lifetime.

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:56.060 align:middle line:84%
She had a really hard
life with her husband.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.470 align:middle line:90%
She had to have these children.

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:00.360 align:middle line:90%
She had no rights as a woman.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.670 align:middle line:90%
She was just there as a slave.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:05.960 align:middle line:84%
When she decided to
study to be a naturopath,

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.770 align:middle line:84%
she changed the
course of her life.

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And by her grandmother
coming and saying,

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.010 align:middle line:84%
you did right, it's
confirming that she actually

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:14.660 align:middle line:90%
did the right thing.

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And do you feel ready
to be taken somewhere?

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:19.242 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:19.242 --> 00:15:21.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Very good.

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:23.460 align:middle line:10%
Describe to me the journey.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:26.930 align:middle line:10%
>> It feels like floating.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:29.280 align:middle line:10%
Again, this bluish light.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:37.530 align:middle line:10%
It's like open, round
place filled with energy.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.500 align:middle line:10%
>> What is the color
that you notice?

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Everything is very
light, colored white.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.730 align:middle line:10%
But it feels good.

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:48.153 align:middle line:10%
It feels it's my star home.

00:15:48.153 --> 00:15:52.190 align:middle line:10%
>> She got to experience the
light and the light beings,

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:54.370 align:middle line:10%
and she was so happy.

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.590 align:middle line:90%
And she felt at peace.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And allow yourself now
to get to the wise ones.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.940 align:middle line:10%
>> They are the elders.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.605 align:middle line:10%
They are around the round table.

00:16:07.605 --> 00:16:11.722 align:middle line:84%
>> And are you able to
count how many are there?

00:16:11.722 --> 00:16:14.335 align:middle line:10%
>> There is 14.

00:16:14.335 --> 00:16:15.590 align:middle line:10%
>> 14.

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:16.475 align:middle line:10%
Very good.

00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:18.415 align:middle line:10%
>> Some look like people.

00:16:18.415 --> 00:16:21.581 align:middle line:90%


00:16:21.581 --> 00:16:24.780 align:middle line:10%
And some look like other beings.

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:28.060 align:middle line:84%
It's a huge table, and they're
sitting around the table.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Old, very friendly people,
men and women, and looks

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:38.720 align:middle line:84%
like also spacey beings,
different spacey beings also.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.110 align:middle line:10%
There is a moderator.

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:43.225 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the name that
you call the moderator?

00:16:43.225 --> 00:16:44.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Mano.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Mano.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>> He was not so old, friendly,
maybe between 40 and 50, man.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:53.700 align:middle line:90%
He was a human being.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And what is the first thing
you hear in your mind as Mano

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:58.930 align:middle line:90%
addresses you?

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:03.380 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a telepathic
communication.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:09.650 align:middle line:10%
First, it felt like tension
and worries about mother earth.

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:12.450 align:middle line:10%
And now it became very calm.

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:14.869 align:middle line:10%
Now it feels really--

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:21.349 align:middle line:10%
like they did take away all
my worries and my tension.

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:22.565 align:middle line:10%
And I feel really calm.

00:17:22.565 --> 00:17:24.540 align:middle line:10%
>> And you feel really calm.

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:25.849 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:17:25.849 --> 00:17:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Whenever she watches the news
or she reads the newspaper,

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:32.150 align:middle line:84%
she is always caught
in the grip of what

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:33.440 align:middle line:90%
is happening in the world.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.470 align:middle line:84%
She's concerned about
people, about the earth.

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And she did not expect
the answer that she got.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>> When I watch
the news nowadays,

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:47.410 align:middle line:84%
I become very
uncomfortable, even afraid.

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And the elder did change
it in this moment for me.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.640 align:middle line:90%
It disappeared fully.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.410 align:middle line:90%
And it felt really good.

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:56.770 align:middle line:90%
I felt good in my body.

00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:00.245 align:middle line:84%
And so I do know it
will become good.

00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you address your counsel
and ask Mano if you would be

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:10.770 align:middle line:84%
able to answer some of the
questions that you have in this

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:12.125 align:middle line:90%
moment?

00:18:12.125 --> 00:18:13.420 align:middle line:10%
>> We can try.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Ask him around the situation
with your ex-husband.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Why did he not support you
on your naturopath journey?

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:29.060 align:middle line:10%
>> It was fear to lose me.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.830 align:middle line:10%
I guess fear to have me strong.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And did you break this
patriarchal pattern when you

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:42.520 align:middle line:84%
left, or did you leave an open
space for him to continue this

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.605 align:middle line:90%
pattern?

00:18:43.605 --> 00:18:47.550 align:middle line:10%
>> I did break it, but
there is still a space.

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:49.400 align:middle line:10%
It's not fully gone.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Why did you have to
have those experiences?

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.040 align:middle line:90%
What was your learning?

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And what can other people
learn from your experience?

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:02.660 align:middle line:10%
>> I had to have this
experience, to feel it,

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:08.090 align:middle line:10%
to feel the love, to feel the
suffering, to feel everything.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:12.462 align:middle line:84%
>> And are you ready to do
what you came to do in Gozo?

00:19:12.462 --> 00:19:14.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Nearly.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:18.110 align:middle line:90%
And what is your sole purpose?

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:20.715 align:middle line:10%
>> Healing and helping.

00:19:20.715 --> 00:19:22.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:27.400 align:middle line:84%
What do you need to know
that will best support you

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.145 align:middle line:90%
on your journey going forward?

00:19:30.145 --> 00:19:37.956 align:middle line:10%
>> Trust in myself and the
support in the universe.

00:19:37.956 --> 00:19:39.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:43.630 align:middle line:84%
To trust in yourself and
the support of the universe.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:45.230 align:middle line:84%
This is what people
are looking for.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:48.250 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for
connection and clarification,

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:52.720 align:middle line:84%
that the path is
as it should be.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:57.670 align:middle line:84%
I know you're now ready
to move to the next place.

00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And describe the path
you go or the way

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.555 align:middle line:84%
you go to get to the
next place you go to.

00:20:04.555 --> 00:20:13.480 align:middle line:10%
>> It's delightful, the
temple thousands of years ago,

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.395 align:middle line:10%
looking at Gozo.

00:20:16.395 --> 00:20:20.920 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the questions in our
life has been, why is she here?

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.790 align:middle line:90%
And what is she come to do?

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:25.730 align:middle line:90%
So to understand that it's fine.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:29.040 align:middle line:84%
It's just a confirmation
that she should be here.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.500 align:middle line:10%
>> I do see myself.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:40.562 align:middle line:10%
We have a fireplace, lots
of dried flowers and weeds.

00:20:40.562 --> 00:20:47.310 align:middle line:10%
It's shortly before
the spring equinox.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:50.825 align:middle line:10%
I see myself as
priestess or whatever.

00:20:50.825 --> 00:20:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, you see
yourself as a priestess.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:59.670 align:middle line:10%
>> And I am in a kind of
meditative status to connect

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:03.030 align:middle line:10%
with other beings.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:07.380 align:middle line:10%
During the days, there
are nice, beautiful girls

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:14.010 align:middle line:10%
in long, white dresses,
collecting flowers,

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:16.110 align:middle line:10%
dancing around.

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:21.330 align:middle line:10%
Everybody is excited,
waiting for the evening.

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:26.340 align:middle line:10%
There is music
floating in the air.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:30.690 align:middle line:10%
There is a statue of a goddess.

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:36.540 align:middle line:10%
We have to bring a
huge crystal and fix it

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:44.822 align:middle line:10%
in this goddess statue
to activate energy field.

00:21:44.822 --> 00:21:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Help us understand what
was happening on the earth.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:52.670 align:middle line:10%
>> The temples are
important because of Sirius.

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:55.080 align:middle line:90%
Sirius is a planet.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:22:00.930 align:middle line:84%
It is very important in
connection with Maltese temples.

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:05.370 align:middle line:84%
All of them were built with
the entrance to Sirius.

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So let us understand the
connection that the temples have

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:11.590 align:middle line:90%
to planet Sirius.

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:16.250 align:middle line:10%
>> We have to keep the
knowledge to protect the earth

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:19.000 align:middle line:10%
and the people who
are living on earth.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Many of the people that come
to me for their Life Between

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:25.460 align:middle line:10%
Lives session feel a
strong connection to Sirius

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:27.030 align:middle line:10%
or to the Pleiades.

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:30.080 align:middle line:84%
These are star systems
that we can see from earth,

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:34.170 align:middle line:84%
and they just have a very
strong connection to the stars.

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:36.960 align:middle line:84%
I always say, there's no
right, there's no wrong,

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.530 align:middle line:90%
and there's no judgment.

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:42.080 align:middle line:84%
So each client that comes
for a Life Between Lives

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.510 align:middle line:84%
will have the experience
that they need.

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And that will benefit
them in that day.

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:52.680 align:middle line:84%
So help us understand what
creates this protective energy

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.532 align:middle line:90%
shield.

00:22:54.532 --> 00:23:00.840 align:middle line:10%
>> It is the crystal
and this goddess.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.940 align:middle line:10%
It's a clear quartz crystal.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:07.100 align:middle line:10%
It looks like a pyramid.

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:13.520 align:middle line:10%
And it was even used in
Egypt on top of the pyramids.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:17.130 align:middle line:84%
The crystal is in the
shape of a pyramid,

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:24.010 align:middle line:84%
and light energy did
shoot out of the goddess.

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:27.085 align:middle line:84%
>> And help us
understand the function.

00:23:27.085 --> 00:23:34.730 align:middle line:10%
>> It's like a shield
function, a protection shield.

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:39.560 align:middle line:10%
Light beams are going
out and do meet together

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:42.992 align:middle line:10%
from different temples
at the same time.

00:23:42.992 --> 00:23:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So this was happening at
different temples at the same

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:46.350 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:48.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:56.749 align:middle line:10%
It could protect when
there was a comet coming.

00:23:56.749 --> 00:24:01.680 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, so this could protect
if there's a comet coming.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.924 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:24:02.924 --> 00:24:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Was it the goddesses that
were able to connect when they

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:13.440 align:middle line:84%
were in meditation
telepathically to each other?

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.356 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:24:15.356 --> 00:24:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>> By doing this, this creates
an energy shield or an energy

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:23.245 align:middle line:90%
that can protect against comets.

00:24:23.245 --> 00:24:24.685 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:24.685 --> 00:24:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And let us understand the
difference between meditation

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:32.081 align:middle line:90%
and prayer.

00:24:32.081 --> 00:24:34.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Prayer can work also.

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:36.760 align:middle line:10%
But if you go in a
deep meditation state,

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:43.110 align:middle line:10%
you activate your own
energies into your heart.

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:49.290 align:middle line:10%
You can connect directly with
energy force of the goddess.

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>> What meditation does is it
allows one to connect to what is

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:59.650 align:middle line:84%
really right for you without
asking anyone else's opinion.

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:03.390 align:middle line:84%
So many of us were
told that someone else

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:04.870 align:middle line:90%
has the answers for you.

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And what we are finding now
is that if you meditate,

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:12.970 align:middle line:84%
you can actually find the
answers within yourself.

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And hypnotherapy is a great
way to find those answers.

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:21.120 align:middle line:10%
>> We don't have to go
back to the temple time,

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:26.730 align:middle line:10%
but we have to believe
in our own power.

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:30.420 align:middle line:10%
We have to activate
our own power.

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:37.450 align:middle line:10%
We are already on the journey,
and we are already in a better

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:39.660 align:middle line:10%
space than it looks.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And what is the wisdom that
you need to share with mankind

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:47.630 align:middle line:84%
of what the experiences
that you just had?

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:54.010 align:middle line:10%
>> We have to go out of
the fear in trusting,

00:25:54.010 --> 00:26:01.330 align:middle line:10%
connecting with our higher self,
not allowing bad news to take

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:06.670 align:middle line:10%
away our trust in
a positive future.

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:09.110 align:middle line:10%
Everything will be fine.

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:12.260 align:middle line:10%
The light will win the fight.

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:15.380 align:middle line:84%
We have to focus on
the positive things,

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:17.180 align:middle line:90%
not on the negative things.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:18.630 align:middle line:90%
That's very important.

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Focus on the positive
things and say

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:25.410 align:middle line:84%
thank you for every
positive thing.

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>> When Theresia came
in to see me today,

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.350 align:middle line:84%
she had questions
about her family.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:33.180 align:middle line:84%
She had questions about
personal relationships.

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:37.040 align:middle line:84%
She had questions about
her career as a naturopath

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.360 align:middle line:90%
and about her living in Gozo.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And what was amazing
in the session

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:45.960 align:middle line:84%
is that she got clarity that
she was in the right place.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And the message for her was,
the light will win the fight.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And is there anything else
that you need to experience?

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:57.120 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't think so.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.420 align:middle line:84%
I really liked this Life
Between Lives episode

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:04.180 align:middle line:84%
because I got a lot of
information out of it.

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And it did deepen my belief
in that light wins this fight.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:23.150 align:middle line:10%
It's been two weeks
since my session.

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:24.780 align:middle line:10%
And I feel good.

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:28.700 align:middle line:10%
I got a lot of information
about my past life

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:32.090 align:middle line:10%
and it helped me
to understand why

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:35.370 align:middle line:10%
I landed in Gozo,
what's my connection,

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:38.090 align:middle line:10%
and also that I'm
on the right path.

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:40.255 align:middle line:10%
Getting to see my
granny was, for me,

00:27:40.255 --> 00:27:42.260 align:middle line:10%
a confirmation for
my life, what I

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:45.050 align:middle line:10%
have now because it's a
little bit like she gave me

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:48.270 align:middle line:10%
the feeling, yes, it's
right what you do.

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:49.410 align:middle line:90%
It's right.

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:52.430 align:middle line:90%
And you did a good job.

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:53.660 align:middle line:10%
Thank you, Karin.

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:57.530 align:middle line:10%
I had a journey into my
soul, and I look now forward

00:27:57.530 --> 00:27:59.350 align:middle line:10%
to my future.

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:19.000 align:middle line:90%
