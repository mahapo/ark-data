My name is Ryan.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm 31 years old, and I'm from
Belfast in Northern Ireland.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.850 align:middle line:90%
Pretty much a boy's boy.

Really into my rugby,
playing sports.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:90%
Went to an all-boys school.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.080 align:middle line:84%
All that boisterous energy at
the university in Liverpool.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.150 align:middle line:84%
It was the first time I
really questioned what

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.380 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to do with my life.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.570 align:middle line:84%
I was there doing an
engineering degree.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.650 align:middle line:10%
And I was like, OK, if
you do this degree, that

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.670 align:middle line:10%
means you're going to
have to be an engineer.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.628 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I don't
want to be an engineer.

00:02:44.628 --> 00:02:48.340 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't see myself being an
engineer for the next 30 years

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.140 align:middle line:90%
of my life.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Probably the first
time I really had

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.920 align:middle line:84%
to ask myself these
bigger questions.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.220 align:middle line:90%


00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.200 align:middle line:90%
I stopped going to classes.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.900 align:middle line:84%
There was a Royal Navy
building just on the street.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.220 align:middle line:84%
So I went in and I applied
for the Royal Marines.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.467 align:middle line:90%
And while I was still--

00:03:06.467 --> 00:03:07.800 align:middle line:90%
while I was still at university.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.120 align:middle line:90%
My mom rang me one day.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'd reached that
point of no return,

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.580 align:middle line:84%
and I had to let her know that
I hadn't been going to class

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.775 align:middle line:90%
for the last few months.

00:03:16.775 --> 00:03:18.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually not going to
be staying on university.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And my mom really pushed
education when I was a kid.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.660 align:middle line:90%
It was a big--

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.868 align:middle line:84%
I was the first one in my
family to go to university,

00:03:26.868 --> 00:03:28.680 align:middle line:90%
so it was a very big deal.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.780 align:middle line:84%
That really broke
her heart a bit

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.480 align:middle line:84%
that I was leaving
this education.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.573 align:middle line:84%
Because in her model, to
be successful in life,

00:03:36.573 --> 00:03:38.490 align:middle line:84%
you needed a good education
that would get you

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.245 align:middle line:84%
a good job, that
would get you money

00:03:40.245 --> 00:03:41.370 align:middle line:90%
and you'd have a good life.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And that really
upset her that I was

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:49.000 align:middle line:84%
leaving that to go on a boat
with a gun, that sort of thing.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.820 align:middle line:84%
So that was my
first big attachment

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.760 align:middle line:84%
of trying to keep
my parents happy.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.530 align:middle line:84%
What they thought I
should do in life,

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.438 align:middle line:84%
and then that was my initiation
into being my own person.

00:04:12.358 --> 00:04:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I went on to have
a successful career

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.950 align:middle line:90%
in the Marines.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.050 align:middle line:90%
Was there for five years.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.140 align:middle line:10%
And, again, that
niggle of, is this

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.269 align:middle line:10%
what you want to do for
the rest of your life,

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.470 align:middle line:10%
again, just started to creep in.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.750 align:middle line:90%
So I decided to leave.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.850 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't see myself staying
in there for the next 12 years

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:27.650 align:middle line:90%
plus.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.460 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, then I left the
military when I was about 25

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.210 align:middle line:84%
and I had to move back
in with my parents.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And you go from being up here
one day, this Royal Marine

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.330 align:middle line:84%
commando, this big
shot type of thing.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Because it does
feed your ego a bit

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.230 align:middle line:90%
when you're in that environment.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.743 align:middle line:84%
And coming out,
you feel very lost.

00:04:45.743 --> 00:04:47.660 align:middle line:84%
You've went up here, and
now you're down here.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.800 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the first jobs
that I did was drive trucks.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.320 align:middle line:84%
So I went from
being this hotshot.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.140 align:middle line:84%
I was driving a truck, and it
was like torture for my ego,

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.980 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.530 align:middle line:84%
The Marines is a very
specific skill set.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.560 align:middle line:84%
There's no civilian application,
if you want to call it that.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.140 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to find your
meaning in the outside

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.610 align:middle line:90%
of yourself in these jobs.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:08.750 align:middle line:90%
And that wasn't working.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, OK, I need to
start looking inside myself

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.050 align:middle line:90%
for these answers instead.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.110 align:middle line:84%
So I actually came
across Dolores Cannon.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.818 align:middle line:84%
I think it was on
Instagram or something,

00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:19.230 align:middle line:90%
just watching a few videos.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.760 align:middle line:84%
It just really
piqued my interest.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.260 align:middle line:84%
She was basically
a hypnotherapist,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.530 align:middle line:84%
and all these clients
had very similar feelings

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.430 align:middle line:90%
that I was having.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.847 align:middle line:84%
Why am I here, and there has
to be more to life than this,

00:05:28.847 --> 00:05:30.570 align:middle line:90%
and I feel I'm not fitting in.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I should
look into this

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.200 align:middle line:84%
because if these people are
having very similar issues

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.220 align:middle line:90%
that I'm having.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And they're finding
out all these things

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.070 align:middle line:84%
about themselves from past
lives and where they come from.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's making them
realize why they're feeling

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.950 align:middle line:90%
like this in this lifetime.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.330 align:middle line:84%
That was something I
really wanted to look into.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.360 align:middle line:84%
So, she has her own
website, and she

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.770 align:middle line:84%
has a list of practitioners
across the world.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.190 align:middle line:84%
I noticed there's a
woman in Dublin, Triona.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.630 align:middle line:90%
So I just booked a session.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.840 align:middle line:90%
No expectations.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.060 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea what to expect.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was mind-blowing
to say the least.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.538 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm back for
my second session.

00:06:07.538 --> 00:06:09.580 align:middle line:10%
And I think it's going to
be very, very powerful.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.604 align:middle line:10%
So we're looking forward to it.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:58.070 align:middle line:10%
I always felt drawn to doing

enough, or maybe a nurse.

drew in my mind.

this is what I call,

I came off my path a little bit.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.720 align:middle line:84%

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:50.190 align:middle line:84%
I was still working in
the corporate world,

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.510 align:middle line:90%
working 90-hour weeks.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And my kidneys stopped working
and I started dialysis.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Tough journey being on
dialysis for 11 years.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And the week I got
my kidney transplant,

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:03.850 align:middle line:90%
I struggled with the medication.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.750 align:middle line:84%
I was in ICU for
a good few days.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.340 align:middle line:90%
It's a time I can't remember.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.350 align:middle line:90%
I can't recall at all.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:13.080 align:middle line:84%
I do recall the day
I got out of ICU.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you're
going to be OK.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And then I got a call from
my son, saying, he's dead.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:23.070 align:middle line:90%
I said, who's dead?

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.460 align:middle line:90%
And he said, Barry.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:25.260 align:middle line:90%
Barry's dead.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:29.670 align:middle line:90%


00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.260 align:middle line:90%
It was a real shock.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.894 align:middle line:90%
I thought I was going to die.

00:08:32.894 --> 00:08:39.320 align:middle line:90%


00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.890 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in Ireland, which
is primarily Roman Catholic.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.990 align:middle line:84%
So I always had a
belief of something,

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:46.970 align:middle line:90%
but I wasn't religious.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And I suppose I was
searching for answers.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.280 align:middle line:90%


00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.540 align:middle line:84%
So I was on my laptop, with
this lady talking about angels.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.290 align:middle line:84%
I started exploring Dolores
during the level 1 online.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:05.460 align:middle line:84%
I came back to my level 2
as a practitioner in Dublin.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.360 align:middle line:90%
I thought I had it.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.360 align:middle line:84%
I thought, I got it now,
I got it now, I'm great,

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm the best in the world.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And then my guide said,
we want you to do level 3.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was challenging because
they were like, all of that

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.660 align:middle line:84%
you thought you were doing
right, it's all wrong.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.630 align:middle line:84%
Do all of this again,
and do it this way.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.570 align:middle line:84%
This is the longest job I've
ever been in, eight years.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And that is because
it's interesting.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Every single person has
within their own mind,

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.450 align:middle line:84%
their own ability to get
the information they need.

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:38.740 align:middle line:90%
And, in fact, it's better.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Then I'm giving you
information that's processing

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:42.750 align:middle line:90%
through my own conscious mind.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to filter it
in a way I understand it.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Whereas when you
get that information

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.310 align:middle line:84%
through your own mind in
QHHT, you don't need filters.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.306 align:middle line:84%
It's coming as
you understand it.

00:09:52.306 --> 00:09:55.568 align:middle line:90%

00:09:55.568 --> 00:09:57.440 align:middle line:90%


00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.660 align:middle line:84%
Ryan contacted me about
a month or two ago.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And he came in for
a QHHT session.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And Ryan, again, spontaneously
contacted me for this session

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.510 align:middle line:90%
that we're going to have.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:12.110 align:middle line:84%
He has one very clear
intention, and that is he

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:14.990 align:middle line:84%
wants to access any
and all information

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:18.410 align:middle line:84%
from his memories
and his past in order

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.910 align:middle line:90%
to use it for the present.

[WAVE CRASHING]

00:10:23.263 --> 00:10:29.500 align:middle line:90%


00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.010 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Ryan, for being here.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And I know you've had
a session previously.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.180 align:middle line:84%
I know you've had two
sessions, but one QHHT session,

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:37.990 align:middle line:90%
isn't that right?

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>> What was your main
intention for that session,

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.150 align:middle line:84%
and what did you get
after the session?

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.938 align:middle line:84%
And that's important
because we'll

00:10:44.938 --> 00:10:47.230 align:middle line:84%
be able to go deeper, a little
bit deeper if we need to

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.030 align:middle line:90%
in today's session.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I just came in
really open-minded.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.560 align:middle line:90%
I had big questions.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:57.413 align:middle line:84%
I think my main one was why was
I here, what my purpose was.

00:10:57.413 --> 00:10:59.205 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you get an answer
to that question--

00:10:59.205 --> 00:10:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>> I did.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.310 align:middle line:90%
>> --why am I here?

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:01.150 align:middle line:90%
What was my purpose?

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so it said that my
purpose was to be a guide

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:08.828 align:middle line:84%
in this life for people to
live their life to the fullest

00:11:08.828 --> 00:11:09.745 align:middle line:90%
of their capabilities.

00:11:09.745 --> 00:11:10.705 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:11:10.705 --> 00:11:13.330 align:middle line:84%
That's so wonderful, and you're
going to get all of that today.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.260 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
so easy for you.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.720 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to go through
the structure of the session.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.340 align:middle line:84%
I know you've had
a session before,

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.100 align:middle line:84%
but I'm still going
to go through just

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.608 align:middle line:90%
in case you have any questions.

00:11:22.608 --> 00:11:24.400 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have a
lovely interview now,

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.275 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to talk
about your life again

00:11:26.275 --> 00:11:28.150 align:middle line:84%
and what you want
moving forward.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Every session is different
every time for everybody.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And in my experience,
people go so much deeper,

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.170 align:middle line:90%
even with their second session.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:38.495 align:middle line:84%
It's really
profoundly beautiful.

00:11:38.495 --> 00:11:40.370 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day,
this is all about you.

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:42.080 align:middle line:84%
This is your session
so whatever you

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.820 align:middle line:84%
need to have this
best experience today.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's really going
to help you, Ryan.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:50.690 align:middle line:90%
So, did you enjoy school?

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I was doing an
engineering degree,

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.280 align:middle line:84%
and I just could not see
myself as an engineer.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.030 align:middle line:84%
For me to want to leave
that was a big thing.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:01.520 align:middle line:84%
It was like going
against everything

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:06.590 align:middle line:84%
that I'd been drilled into
me from my mom, from school.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Everyone I knew
went to university.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:11.150 align:middle line:84%
No one else had really
broken off from that.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:12.740 align:middle line:84%
I was waking up
every day miserable.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.728 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, you need
to make yourself happy.

00:12:14.728 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:84%
You need to do whatever you need
to do to make yourself happy

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.080 align:middle line:90%
every day.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.007 align:middle line:84%
So I just wrote a
list of the things

00:12:20.007 --> 00:12:22.340 align:middle line:84%
that I was interested in, the
things that I was good at.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.342 align:middle line:84%
The military was
a good fit for it.

00:12:24.342 --> 00:12:26.300 align:middle line:84%
Sounds like a better
success rate for happiness

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.160 align:middle line:90%
than what I'm currently doing.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.110 align:middle line:84%
The Marines gave me so
much, and I wouldn't

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:31.340 align:middle line:90%
change a thing about it.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.110 align:middle line:84%
It really shaped who
I am as a person.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:34.740 align:middle line:90%
It was a huge part of my life.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>> So if we jump ahead
a little bit in time,

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.030 align:middle line:90%
what made you leave that?

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:40.580 align:middle line:90%
What made you leave the Marines?

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess it was just the same,
that niggling feeling that I got

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:50.600 align:middle line:84%
when I was 18, 19, of like, this
isn't what you're meant to be

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.510 align:middle line:90%
doing.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:53.477 align:middle line:90%
There's more to life.

00:12:53.477 --> 00:12:54.560 align:middle line:90%
And I decided to trust it.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.720 align:middle line:84%
But I was like,
the next thing, it

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.433 align:middle line:84%
needs to work out because you're
leaving something good here.

00:13:00.433 --> 00:13:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Again, you could be potentially
messing your life up

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.450 align:middle line:84%
if this doesn't work
out in the next thing.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you need to see yourself
in something in order for it

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.050 align:middle line:90%
to feel right for you?

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>> For me, yeah.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.250 align:middle line:84%
If I can't see myself
doing something

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:16.220 align:middle line:84%
for any length of time, I don't
see the point in doing it.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:17.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why it
affects me so much.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.420 align:middle line:84%
I know you start to feel
like you're broken a bit.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:23.510 align:middle line:84%
You start to feel like,
what is wrong with me?

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone else
seems to be OK with just

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.200 align:middle line:90%
working these jobs.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And they're really happy
doing the 9 to 5 thing.

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm starting
to think, am I broken?

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
wrong with me?

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:34.970 align:middle line:90%
Am I destined to feel like this?

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Am I destined to
feeling miserable?

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Am I broken?

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that feeling of
like, why is everyone else OK

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.125 align:middle line:84%
and I'm the one who's
feeling I can never be happy.

00:13:45.125 --> 00:13:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>> You're feeling lost, feeling
different, feeling alone.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.570 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people feel like that
for different kind of reasons.

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Did you get clarity or
an answer around all

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.525 align:middle line:90%
of that in your first session?

00:13:58.525 --> 00:14:00.650 align:middle line:84%
If not, it will be important
to look at that today.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah I didn't really get any
answers to why I felt that way.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I don't think so, no.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>> You said at the very
beginning of our talk,

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:13.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to help myself,
and I'm here to help others.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Maybe how that looks like,
or how you're visualizing

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:16.910 align:middle line:90%
that moving into your future?

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I've always had a really keen
interest in holistic health.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Health is not a one
dimensional thing.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:26.678 align:middle line:84%
It's like your spiritual
health, your mental well-being,

00:14:26.678 --> 00:14:28.220 align:middle line:84%
your physical
well-being, what you're

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.250 align:middle line:84%
putting in your body, what
you're consuming, not just food

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:33.540 align:middle line:90%
but like content and everything.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's my path that I
want to go down, show people

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:40.520 align:middle line:84%
how to live in a holistic
way, and to really

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.040 align:middle line:90%
find their true self.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.380 align:middle line:84%
They say you find your
purpose in your pain,

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:48.320 align:middle line:84%
and my pain has been
trying to find my purpose.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.510 align:middle line:84%
I would love to help others
who feel the same as me

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:51.815 align:middle line:90%
or feel lost.

00:14:51.815 --> 00:14:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems to me like you're
helping people find the answers

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:57.210 align:middle line:84%
and then put actions
into the answers.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:58.010 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:14:58.010 --> 00:14:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>> 100% yeah.

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for sharing
this journey with me.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.440 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate, Ryan,
opening up and sharing

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.340 align:middle line:90%
all of this with me.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.140 align:middle line:90%
>> It's all good

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's get
into your session.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.260 align:middle line:90%
Let's get that computer rolling.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's get all of those programs,
all of those downloads,

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:15.600 align:middle line:84%
and all the answer clarity, and
whatever healing you need today.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.400 align:middle line:90%
Sound good?

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sounds great.

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:17.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you excited?

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>> I am.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:18.960 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:25.380 align:middle line:90%


00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.180 align:middle line:10%
Very dry.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.630 align:middle line:10%
Not like sand but like dust.

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.110 align:middle line:10%
Really sort of like hard.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.520 align:middle line:10%
I'm wearing like sandals.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And let's just see
your sensor energy.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:38.705 align:middle line:84%
What are you wearing
on your body?

00:15:38.705 --> 00:15:44.265 align:middle line:10%
>> Just like a material, sor of
fashioned into a tunic almost.

00:15:44.265 --> 00:15:46.270 align:middle line:10%
>> What color is this?

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:48.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Like a faded type of white.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.930 align:middle line:10%
>> How does that
feel on your body?

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:52.540 align:middle line:10%
>> It's quite like rough.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not really
looking for the story,

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:57.580 align:middle line:84%
it's just about allowing
the story to unfold.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.480 align:middle line:84%
It's about looking
for embodying him.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Does it feel male or female?

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:04.050 align:middle line:10%
>> It feels male.

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:06.150 align:middle line:10%
Sort of like in the 30s.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:08.220 align:middle line:10%
Quite skinny.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.640 align:middle line:10%
There's a donkey, or
something with me.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Just felt like a
very normal guy.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Very skinny, very--
not frail, but not

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:19.170 align:middle line:84%
like really strong or
anything, so just very normal,

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:20.430 align:middle line:90%
very average.

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:23.820 align:middle line:10%
Looks like there's like
a small town ahead.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.970 align:middle line:10%
I'm walking a mule,
looks like a mule.

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:29.210 align:middle line:10%
Got some stuff on its back.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:35.340 align:middle line:10%
A funny feeling like going
to trade stuff in this town.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.480 align:middle line:10%
I don't think I
live in the town.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.230 align:middle line:10%
I think I'm going there
to like get stuff.

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:42.540 align:middle line:10%
I'm walking into the town.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:43.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Walking into that town,

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.195 align:middle line:90%
>> What happens next?

00:16:46.195 --> 00:16:46.995 align:middle line:10%
>> Busy, very busy.

00:16:46.995 --> 00:16:51.600 align:middle line:10%
It's like a lot of people,
like an outdoor market.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.300 align:middle line:84%
I went to the market and
I knew a couple of people,

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.710 align:middle line:90%
and they sort of knew me.

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:57.360 align:middle line:90%
I was obviously a regular there.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.470 align:middle line:10%
Just asking me how I am.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:01.800 align:middle line:10%
How're your family and stuff.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.710 align:middle line:10%
I'm like yeah, all good.

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:06.180 align:middle line:10%
I'm giving him
some stuff and then

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:08.339 align:middle line:10%
he's gaving me back some stuff.

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:11.010 align:middle line:10%
I think I grew like a
certain type of food or fruit

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:12.930 align:middle line:10%
or something.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:15.990 align:middle line:10%
And then I'll exchange
it for this other food.

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:18.569 align:middle line:84%
>> Anything else of
significance in this place,

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:22.140 align:middle line:84%
in this market place you wish
to explore before we move on?

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.008 align:middle line:90%


00:17:25.008 --> 00:17:26.550 align:middle line:84%
I want you to move
to the place where

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:29.580 align:middle line:84%
you live in that life
as that man wearing

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.890 align:middle line:90%
the sandals and the tunic.

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:34.210 align:middle line:84%
You can see in
senses very clearly.

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:36.460 align:middle line:84%
So you're now standing
outside the place

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:38.185 align:middle line:90%
where you eat and sleep.

00:17:38.185 --> 00:17:40.240 align:middle line:10%
>> It's like a clay hut.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.690 align:middle line:10%
It's kind of like a house.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:43.430 align:middle line:10%
It's really small.

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:46.510 align:middle line:10%
There's a woman there,
I'm assuming it's my wife.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:49.840 align:middle line:10%
Just like some
bread, like a fish

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.400 align:middle line:10%
is in the center of the table.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.955 align:middle line:10%
>> And who's joining you for
the meal, or do you eat alone?

00:17:54.955 --> 00:17:59.230 align:middle line:10%
>> No, it's me, my
wife, and my son.

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:00.780 align:middle line:10%
Got like a little boy.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.362 align:middle line:90%
>> Describe the little boy.

00:18:02.362 --> 00:18:03.320 align:middle line:90%
What does he look like?

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.540 align:middle line:90%
How do you sense him?

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Very tan skin.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.280 align:middle line:10%
Brown eyes and dark hair.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.650 align:middle line:10%
Six or seven.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:13.568 align:middle line:10%
Looks pretty happy.

00:18:13.568 --> 00:18:14.860 align:middle line:90%
It was a very simple existence.

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:17.690 align:middle line:84%
We lived in this
little mud house.

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:18.530 align:middle line:90%
It's just beautiful.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.250 align:middle line:84%
It was just, I was so
content with what we had.

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:23.982 align:middle line:84%
And our little son, and
she was cooking the food,

00:18:23.982 --> 00:18:26.440 align:middle line:84%
and she just loved me and I
loved her and we loved our life

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.820 align:middle line:90%
together, and it was so simple.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So at first I
just feel or sensing,

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:32.950 align:middle line:84%
what's going on, this
is an ordinary story.

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:36.460 align:middle line:84%
An ordinary past life,
and then all of a sudden

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:37.770 align:middle line:90%
in come the soldiers.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:41.890 align:middle line:10%
>> There's like soldiers who've
walked up on like horses.

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:44.860 align:middle line:10%
Roman centurion type,
wearing red cloaks

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.210 align:middle line:10%
with like armor on them.

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.540 align:middle line:10%
>> What happens next?

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.690 align:middle line:10%
>> I kind of tell my wife
just to stay in the house.

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:54.180 align:middle line:10%
It's like not good
that they're here.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.580 align:middle line:10%
Like I'm quite nervous.

00:18:56.580 --> 00:19:00.750 align:middle line:10%
Just asking me like how long
I've lived here, like what I do.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.430 align:middle line:10%
I said, grow things.

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:06.510 align:middle line:10%
Then one of them starts
kicking stuff in my garden.

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:08.940 align:middle line:10%
>> What happens next?

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.520 align:middle line:10%
>> He wants to go in
my house to see what--

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.360 align:middle line:10%
it's almost like he's checking
to see if I'm hiding something.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>> In come those Roman soldiers
that he perceives on the horses,

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:23.020 align:middle line:84%
and you know something really
bad is going to happen here

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:23.820 align:middle line:90%
in this past life.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.940 align:middle line:84%
You can tell by his body,
you can tell with the pause,

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.160 align:middle line:90%
you just know, here it comes.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Searching, searching
for something.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:32.438 align:middle line:90%
What happens next?

00:19:32.438 --> 00:19:33.480 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't know if they--

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.022 align:middle line:10%
I don't think they
speak my language.

00:19:35.022 --> 00:19:37.970 align:middle line:10%
I think one of them does, but
the rest of them don't seem to.

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:39.970 align:middle line:10%
Because they are like
talking amongst themselves

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:42.405 align:middle line:10%
and I don't seem to understand
what they're saying.

00:19:42.405 --> 00:19:44.280 align:middle line:10%
I just want them to
leave as soon as possible

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.790 align:middle line:10%
'cause I'm starting to like
get a bit scared that--

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:50.500 align:middle line:10%
for my wife and
my kid and stuff.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.260 align:middle line:10%
Because there's no way I can
defend them against these guys,

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:56.157 align:middle line:10%
they're pretty scary.

00:19:56.157 --> 00:19:57.490 align:middle line:10%
I'm trying to like appease them.

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:00.030 align:middle line:10%
Trying to be nice to
them, and show them

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:02.556 align:middle line:10%
that I'm not doing
anything wrong.

00:20:02.556 --> 00:20:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>> They're searching,
they are here.

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:06.190 align:middle line:90%
You're feeling helpless, scared.

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:07.642 align:middle line:90%
What happens next?

00:20:07.642 --> 00:20:09.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Start getting
really aggressive.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.050 align:middle line:10%
He like flips the table over.

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:13.900 align:middle line:10%
Starts screaming at me,
screaming at my wife.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.540 align:middle line:10%
Grabs her by the hair.

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:18.370 align:middle line:10%
Starts dragging her.

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:22.480 align:middle line:10%
I'm chasing after him,
grabbing his arm, get off her.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.690 align:middle line:10%
He hits me in the
face with his elbow.

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:28.820 align:middle line:84%
These soldiers came, and
took her outside basically,

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.950 align:middle line:84%
and wanted something from
me that I had no idea what

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:32.950 align:middle line:90%
they were talking about.

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:36.520 align:middle line:84%
This woman's life is on the
line who's my entire being.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.760 align:middle line:84%
I felt so helpless in that
moment, felt so helpless.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.350 align:middle line:84%
How I could save her,
I just did not know.

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:45.410 align:middle line:10%
Said you better tell
me what I want to know

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.250 align:middle line:10%
or I'm going to kill your wife.

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:53.110 align:middle line:10%
Takes the sword out of his
sheath, puts it to her neck.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:56.770 align:middle line:10%
I scream at him, I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:58.450 align:middle line:10%
Someone in the
market has told them

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:04.030 align:middle line:10%
that I'm the person that knows
where it is or knows who it is.

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.130 align:middle line:10%
Actually I think they're
going to kill her.

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:08.290 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what to do.

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:12.700 align:middle line:10%
My little boy's like
watching us, crying.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.680 align:middle line:10%
Just keeps saying, I'm going
to do it, I'm going to do it.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.530 align:middle line:10%
I'm like, I can't tell
you stuff I don't know.

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:23.590 align:middle line:10%
The other guys are telling
the other one like come on,

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:26.440 align:middle line:10%
there's like nothing here.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:31.330 align:middle line:10%
There's just this one guy who
just seems to not want to leave.

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.310 align:middle line:10%
Still got my wife.

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:37.270 align:middle line:10%
Just got that look of a guy
who doesn't give a shit.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.980 align:middle line:10%
>> What do you
sense happens next?

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.090 align:middle line:10%
>> He cuts her throat.

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:45.470 align:middle line:90%


00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:51.530 align:middle line:10%
She's just like choking
on her own blood.

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:56.000 align:middle line:10%
All the dirt has just
turned like black--

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.830 align:middle line:10%
blood like.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:02.840 align:middle line:10%
Son's crying in the
background, screaming.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.940 align:middle line:10%
I actually can't believe what
the fuck's just happened there.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:09.200 align:middle line:84%
So that love I was talking
about before, this woman is

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:15.093 align:middle line:84%
like my world, and she's my
life, and I just was like,

00:22:15.093 --> 00:22:17.010 align:middle line:84%
It actually didn't even
feel real, I was like,

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:18.230 align:middle line:90%
how has this just happened?

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:20.810 align:middle line:84%
One minute she's here,
one minute she's not.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:24.200 align:middle line:90%
She's just bleeding in the dirt.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.140 align:middle line:84%
How has my whole life been
ripped apart in minutes?

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.400 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:32.010 align:middle line:90%


00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:32.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Ryan is not a father or
a husband in this lifetime.

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:38.750 align:middle line:84%
He had no conscious
awareness of carrying

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:41.520 align:middle line:84%
that emotion, and that guilt,
and that deep, deep levels

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.320 align:middle line:90%
of grief.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.445 align:middle line:84%
He'd never experienced that
grief in this lifetime,

00:22:44.445 --> 00:22:45.320 align:middle line:90%
and there you go.

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.920 align:middle line:84%
He'd been carrying this trauma
and that emotion unconsciously

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.460 align:middle line:84%
from that lifetime, from that
past life, all the way affecting

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:54.140 align:middle line:84%
him probably in
his everyday life

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.580 align:middle line:90%
without even knowing about it.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:59.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, I just keep
saying I'm sorry.

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:01.420 align:middle line:10%
So, so sorry.

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's move away
from that day.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And you're drifting and floating
to another important day

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:10.372 align:middle line:90%
in that life as that man.

00:23:10.372 --> 00:23:14.040 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm in a crowd of
people at the market town.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:17.460 align:middle line:10%
Sort of like a riot, or like
a protest, or something.

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:20.790 align:middle line:10%
Everyone's shouting
and screaming.

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:23.040 align:middle line:10%
I think it's something
to do with money,

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:27.270 align:middle line:10%
maybe some sort of tax.

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:28.350 align:middle line:10%
I hate them so much.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:29.975 align:middle line:10%
>> You hate them?

00:23:29.975 --> 00:23:31.500 align:middle line:10%
>> There's not much I could do.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:34.650 align:middle line:10%
These guys are like strong,
and they're trained,

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:37.850 align:middle line:10%
and they've got weapons,
and like not a hope.

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:39.810 align:middle line:10%
It would be like
a suicide mission.

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>> You want to kill them
but they have an army.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.240 align:middle line:84%
They have training,
and they have swords.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>> What happens next?

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:50.335 align:middle line:10%
>> Someone starts
throwing rocks at them.

00:23:50.335 --> 00:23:51.135 align:middle line:10%
>> Rocks?

00:23:51.135 --> 00:23:53.670 align:middle line:10%
>> That really pisses them off.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:59.250 align:middle line:10%
And like all these soldiers
come out of nowhere.

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:01.710 align:middle line:10%
They have shields and stuff.

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:05.530 align:middle line:10%
To be honest, I have a sense of
like I don't even care anymore.

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:06.520 align:middle line:10%
They're just like a--

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:11.500 align:middle line:10%
they've done so much to me like
I'm-- fucking hate them so much

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.560 align:middle line:10%
and like life has
just been so hard.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.920 align:middle line:10%
If they're going to kill me,
I don't really even care.

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.605 align:middle line:84%
A feeling of like,
I just, I hate this.

00:24:20.605 --> 00:24:23.160 align:middle line:90%
We can't do anything.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Straight onto your stomach
in the dirt, like an animal,

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:29.630 align:middle line:84%
like a dog, and they
just picked up the,

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:32.243 align:middle line:84%
I think it was like the fighting
age males, dragged them out

00:24:32.243 --> 00:24:33.910 align:middle line:84%
of there, and God
knows where they went.

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And they left like
the weak and the old.

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:38.950 align:middle line:84%
So that made you feel
even more worthless,

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:40.825 align:middle line:90%
and it was just horrendous.

00:24:40.825 --> 00:24:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's drift and float
away from that day.

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to move to the
most important day in that life

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.306 align:middle line:84%
you're viewing, the
most important day.

00:24:50.306 --> 00:24:53.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Like a really old man now.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.690 align:middle line:10%
I've got like a walking stick
and kind of hunched over.

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:58.600 align:middle line:84%
>> What's your
understanding of your son?

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.360 align:middle line:84%
Is he here with you now in this
town, or is he somewhere else?

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:04.630 align:middle line:10%
>> No, I think
he's gone, he left.

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:07.960 align:middle line:10%
He just hated the
place too much,

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.170 align:middle line:10%
because of what happened
with his mom, Everything--

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:13.990 align:middle line:10%
he moved on somewhere else.

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:21.020 align:middle line:10%
My life just seems so like
hard and what's the point?

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.803 align:middle line:84%
Life had really taken a toll
on me, used me like a punchbag,

00:25:23.803 --> 00:25:25.220 align:middle line:84%
and this was the
end result of it.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:28.490 align:middle line:84%
This old man who
was just ruined.

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:33.800 align:middle line:84%
He hated life, he hated these
foreign invaders, just hated

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.120 align:middle line:90%
what they'd done to him.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:39.170 align:middle line:84%
Not a lot of love left in that
guy's heart, and it was hard.

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>> This pain has come up for
Ryan in the interview several

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.180 align:middle line:90%
times, about what's the poin?

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.920 align:middle line:90%
I feel this need to unplug.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:46.770 align:middle line:90%
What's the point?

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:50.210 align:middle line:10%
>> I just feel so angry
at like the world,

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:53.180 align:middle line:10%
and like angry at the way
my life has turned out,

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:56.435 align:middle line:10%
and such a miserable existence.

00:25:56.435 --> 00:25:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>> I now move Ryan on to
the last day of his life.

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:01.880 align:middle line:90%
He's fearful of dying alone.

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:06.420 align:middle line:10%
I'm lying in bed,
and actually my son

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:11.793 align:middle line:10%
is actually here to say goodbye,
which actually means a lot.

00:26:11.793 --> 00:26:13.710 align:middle line:10%
I thought I was going
to die alone for a while

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:15.420 align:middle line:10%
there, to be honest.

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:19.310 align:middle line:10%
Gives me a lot of comfort.

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:21.850 align:middle line:10%
He's a lot bigger
than what I was.

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:26.200 align:middle line:10%
He's quite handsome as
well, good looking guy.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.720 align:middle line:10%
He doesn't look as
angry anymore either.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:35.140 align:middle line:10%
Quite happy and I think he's
found what I had with his mom.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.010 align:middle line:84%
I was really ready to
let go at that point.

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:38.468 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel
that, and that was

00:26:38.468 --> 00:26:41.380 align:middle line:84%
my final it's a gift of "hey
dad, I'm going to be OK.

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:45.115 align:middle line:84%
I've turned into this man
that I was supposed to be."

00:26:45.115 --> 00:26:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Your job is done type of
thing, and it was great.

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>> The son goes on to
explain how he's not bitter.

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:53.470 align:middle line:84%
He's not angry anymore,
because he found happiness.

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And that gave Ryan so
much peace and fulfillment

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:59.140 align:middle line:84%
knowing that his son
found what he couldn't

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:00.700 align:middle line:90%
seem to find in that lifetime.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Do you communicate
anything with each other

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:06.290 align:middle line:84%
now, before you take your
last breath in that life?

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:10.090 align:middle line:10%
>> I just tell him like I love
him and don't make the mistakes

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:11.590 align:middle line:10%
that I did.

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:15.235 align:middle line:10%
Don't have any regrets,
don't hold on to--

00:27:15.235 --> 00:27:19.810 align:middle line:10%
don't let that anger like
consume you and that bitterness.

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:21.910 align:middle line:10%
Don't waste your life.

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:24.160 align:middle line:84%
That was my final
parting message

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:27.740 align:middle line:84%
from that lifetime was,
don't waste your time.

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:30.400 align:middle line:90%
Don't suffer and wither away.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So many people spend their
entire lives after abuse,

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:36.320 align:middle line:84%
or tragedy, or
some instant grief,

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.330 align:middle line:84%
wasting their life
in that lifetime.

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Acknowledge it, move on,
allow it, accept it, whatever.

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:42.140 align:middle line:90%
But don't be stagnant.

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.340 align:middle line:90%
Don't be in limbo.

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:45.050 align:middle line:90%
Don't waste your life.

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:47.970 align:middle line:84%
May I speak to Ryan's
subconscious, please?

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:48.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:52.080 align:middle line:10%
>> So the subconscious is the
part of the mind that holds all

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:52.880 align:middle line:10%
of these reasons.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.940 align:middle line:84%
That's now why has it brought
Ryan to that lifetime,

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.770 align:middle line:84%
and why it was so
important for him to see

00:27:57.770 --> 00:27:59.750 align:middle line:90%
that lifetime at this moment.

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Is there any
similarities in that life

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:05.060 align:middle line:84%
he's just lived, and his
current lifetime as Ryan?

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.230 align:middle line:90%
Any similarities at all?

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:10.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, there is.

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:14.190 align:middle line:10%
Ryan really struggles with why
does life have to be so hard?

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:18.245 align:middle line:10%
Why can't it just be easy
like some people have it?

00:28:18.245 --> 00:28:21.035 align:middle line:10%
>> How'd you feel he
did in that past life?

00:28:21.035 --> 00:28:23.870 align:middle line:10%
>> A lot of people would have
taken their own life in that

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:25.490 align:middle line:10%
situation.

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:28.010 align:middle line:10%
He was actually a
lot stronger than he

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:30.900 align:middle line:10%
thought he was in that life.

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:35.580 align:middle line:10%
It takes a very strong person to
take up every day of their life,

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:39.210 align:middle line:10%
still walk about, still even
take care of themselves.

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:41.880 align:middle line:10%
The fact that he
even got up every day

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:47.025 align:middle line:10%
to take care of himself,
to eat, to wash,

00:28:47.025 --> 00:28:49.260 align:middle line:10%
that takes a lot of
strength within itself.

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:51.780 align:middle line:84%
>> What would you suggest he
could have done differently

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:55.460 align:middle line:84%
in that life in order for him
to be very well and happy?

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:59.340 align:middle line:10%
>> He could have moved
away with his son.

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:04.710 align:middle line:10%
He could have found another
wife and try to find love again.

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:12.520 align:middle line:10%
Practice detachment, and instead
of grieving and letting her go,

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:15.833 align:middle line:10%
he let that consume him.

00:29:15.833 --> 00:29:17.500 align:middle line:10%
But he could have
found happiness again,

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.115 align:middle line:10%
he could have found love again.

00:29:19.115 --> 00:29:20.740 align:middle line:84%
There was plenty of
choices that I had,

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:24.700 align:middle line:84%
but I decided to stay with the
grief, and stay with the pain,

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.350 align:middle line:90%
and just let it consume my life.

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Acknowledge it,
accept it, and move on.

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.310 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Because this is something
we all can do sometimes,

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:34.180 align:middle line:90%
is hang on to that trauma.

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And it can eat us alive,
it can destroy our lives.

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:41.240 align:middle line:10%
>> He feels that he has a lot to
offer the world, which he does.

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:45.220 align:middle line:10%
But that adds a lot of pressure.

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:48.310 align:middle line:10%
Certain people are going to
be drawn to him, especially

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:51.502 align:middle line:10%
like ex-soldiers and
things like that.

00:29:51.502 --> 00:29:52.960 align:middle line:10%
They're going to
be attracted to go

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.570 align:middle line:10%
to him for certain
types of healing

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:58.932 align:middle line:10%
because he's a very normal guy.

00:29:58.932 --> 00:30:01.390 align:middle line:10%
When he's not doing that, when
he's not progressing towards

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:05.860 align:middle line:10%
that, that's where this whole
"what is the point" comes from.

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:07.690 align:middle line:84%
When we're actually
on our path, when

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:10.600 align:middle line:84%
we're living her purpose, what
we're here to actually do,

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.900 align:middle line:84%
our whole energy shifts
and that becomes our fuel.

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Instead of the
frustration and the,

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:18.070 align:middle line:90%
why am I here, what's the point?

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:20.440 align:middle line:84%
We use that fuel, that
motivation of our purpose,

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:22.330 align:middle line:84%
it makes us happy
because we're actually

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:23.430 align:middle line:90%
here making a difference.

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:27.275 align:middle line:84%
>> What would you like to say
to Ryan, before we finish up?

00:30:27.275 --> 00:30:29.180 align:middle line:10%
>> We love you.

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:30.540 align:middle line:10%
We're proud of you.

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.290 align:middle line:10%
We can see, we know
the things that you're

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:35.710 align:middle line:10%
going to do in this life,
and we just love you.

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:37.220 align:middle line:90%
The future is what you make it.

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm going at it
from a negative perspective

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:42.770 align:middle line:84%
with a negative inner
dialogue, that's

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:44.270 align:middle line:84%
the future that I'm
going to create,

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:46.700 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to narrow
my possibilities just

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.310 align:middle line:84%
like in that previous
life where he only chose

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:51.320 align:middle line:84%
one path because
he was engrossed

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.600 align:middle line:90%
with grief and negativity.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Really powerful session for me,
and I will carry that forward

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:56.990 align:middle line:90%
into my life.

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:58.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Did it feel long?

00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.460 align:middle line:90%
Did it feel short, Ryan?

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Two hours?

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So it was two hours and
45 minutes by my clock,

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:05.840 align:middle line:90%
approximately 2:45.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.900 align:middle line:84%
I loved that he came today
with this block about what's

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.870 align:middle line:84%
next, what's next,
and being stuck again.

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:13.880 align:middle line:84%
It's a powerful
reminder for all of us

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.490 align:middle line:84%
that we all have this
innate power within us,

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:17.450 align:middle line:90%
and we do matter.

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And the actions and
thoughts that we

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:22.670 align:middle line:84%
do as individuals matter,
matter on a global collective.

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:26.128 align:middle line:90%

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's been two weeks since
my session, and I feel great.

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:44.170 align:middle line:84%
What I took from it was
about taking action and not

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:47.890 align:middle line:84%
letting your circumstances
dictate the rest of your life.

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:51.340 align:middle line:10%
I have now found a
place to do my business,

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:54.820 align:middle line:10%
and that session really made
it clear what I need to do.

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:56.950 align:middle line:84%
I've really noticed
when you're on your path

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:57.940 align:middle line:84%
and you're doing the
thing that you're

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.040 align:middle line:84%
supposed to do in this
life that things just

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:03.310 align:middle line:84%
flow, things flow
really, really easily,

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:05.140 align:middle line:90%
and everything's very cohesive.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'm finding flow
with the universe

00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:10.520 align:middle line:84%
and what I'm supposed
to be doing here.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:12.415 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I'm really
enjoying myself.

00:32:12.415 --> 00:32:14.290 align:middle line:84%
So the big thing that
came up with my session

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:15.940 align:middle line:90%
was, don't waste your life.

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.670 align:middle line:84%
In my past life,
circumstances happened to me

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:21.160 align:middle line:84%
in a negative way,
and I let that dictate

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.770 align:middle line:84%
the rest of my life, and I
chose not to take any action

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:25.520 align:middle line:90%
to better my circumstances.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Even though your
circumstances aren't what

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:30.700 align:middle line:84%
you want them to be right
now, let's take some action

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.800 align:middle line:84%
and put yourself out there
and see what happens,

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.860 align:middle line:84%
and that's exactly
what's happened for me.

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.100 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to say a
big thank you to Triona.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.305 align:middle line:84%
I definitely had a big
journey into my soul.

00:32:39.305 --> 00:32:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really looking forward
to this next chapter of my life.
