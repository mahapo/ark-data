started looking furthermore

was very difficult.

down to those deeper
levels where is it for you,

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.570 align:middle line:84%
is it sometimes that your
conscious mind is there

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:03.112 align:middle line:84%
and other times it's
completely gone?

00:09:03.112 --> 00:09:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, yeah, because I
have that control thing.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of
those fears that you

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.470 align:middle line:90%
helped me release myself from.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:14.330 align:middle line:84%
But there's always a little
bit of something left.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.370 align:middle line:90%
But of course I trust you.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So tell me
about that element,

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.360 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of
element like control.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.130 align:middle line:84%
You said I felt the
need to feel protected.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.470 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, growing up, there
was a lot of issues around

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.240 align:middle line:84%
in the family, and there was
a former family of seven.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think my parents got
together and immediately

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.740 align:middle line:90%
had a child.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.000 align:middle line:90%
And that's the way it was.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.510 align:middle line:90%
And then six followed after.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Seven children to a woman
who didn't want children.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:45.350 align:middle line:84%
You know people say about
don't cry over spilled milk?

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, there'll be a hell
of a war if milk spilled.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:53.430 align:middle line:84%
So the tension, the
tension, the tension.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And also within that space,
I was sexually abused.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.030 align:middle line:90%
So that's the fear.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.000 align:middle line:90%
That's what do you want?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.430 align:middle line:84%
If someone compliments,
well, what do you want?

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:10.430 align:middle line:84%
I know this scar that has left--
has affected how I see myself

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.970 align:middle line:84%
and my capabilities, I
suppose my confidence

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:18.230 align:middle line:84%
because always not being
good enough or well,

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:19.820 align:middle line:90%
nobody cares anyway.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.560 align:middle line:90%
That fed my independence.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.210 align:middle line:84%
So in essence, I'm kind
of figuring in my mind,

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:30.380 align:middle line:84%
if we are put on this earth
having figured our challenges

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.300 align:middle line:90%
before we arrive.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.350 align:middle line:84%
I kind of go, well, yeah,
I'm figuring them out.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.720 align:middle line:84%
But if that's the
case, what's next?

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.170 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean I can have
an easy ride now, please?

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:40.580 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Why has it been difficult
to or perceive what we perceive

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:45.740 align:middle line:90%
to be difficult?

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, Triona, I've
worked really hard on not being

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:52.610 align:middle line:90%
a controlist.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.160 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a part
of me that if it went,

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.990 align:middle line:90%
I'd be going, where is that?

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.990 align:middle line:84%
I'd miss it because that's the
thing that helped me think about

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.140 align:middle line:90%
have to do a, b, c, and d.

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And to do that, I have
to learn how to do that.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:13.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's part of my makeup and
my organizing skills and things.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.260 align:middle line:90%
So not to be lax.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And I have found when I've
tried not to be that controller,

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:24.480 align:middle line:84%
things don't work sometimes
or I miss something.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.180 align:middle line:90%
How could I have missed that?

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.700 align:middle line:90%
So that's a bit--

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:29.730 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:30.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>> What guidance-- because
you're going to get all that

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:33.500 align:middle line:90%
guidance for you today.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>> What guidance do you want to
know for you that you can't seem

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:37.460 align:middle line:90%
to somehow--

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:38.877 align:middle line:84%
that you can get
for other people,

00:11:38.877 --> 00:11:41.120 align:middle line:90%
but you can't get for yourself?

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>> To have my childhood in
that way, so frightening.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Why should a child
be so frightened?

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Why did I have to be so
frightened as a child?

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do we choose these things
knowing it's going to take

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:53.790 align:middle line:90%
decades.

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:56.010 align:middle line:84%
Is this something that
we're really picking?

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:58.370 align:middle line:84%
So that's going to be
really important question.

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Why did I choose
to be frightened

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:02.600 align:middle line:90%
or to be put in a situation?

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.320 align:middle line:84%
Or did I choose this to be
put into a situation where I'm

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.550 align:middle line:90%
going to have a lot of fear?

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:10.095 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take me a long
time to clear that fear.

00:12:10.095 --> 00:12:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's a good one.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's a good question.

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, wonderful.

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:18.500 align:middle line:84%
It's so hard to put in
words because it's this,

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.930 align:middle line:84%
it's emptiness but it's
not completely empty.

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:25.180 align:middle line:84%
It's a sadness, but
I'm not unhappy.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:29.120 align:middle line:84%
There's something just--
a little link is missing.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.150 align:middle line:90%
A little link of me is missing.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's back to the
man on the mountain.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:34.970 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's where I want to be.

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm here in this,
going through all this.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And he's gone, why did
you choose to do that?

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.670 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, I don't know.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:44.920 align:middle line:90%
Let's find out.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So many people have
this, especially what I call

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.130 align:middle line:90%
mission-based souls.

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:52.120 align:middle line:84%
But this heaviness,
this missing something,

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.690 align:middle line:84%
you really need an
answer for that.

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:58.330 align:middle line:90%
For me, knowledge dispels fear.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:02.740 align:middle line:84%
If I know it, if I understand
it, I'll work with it.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So how this works is in
order to embody you into this

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:11.800 align:middle line:84%
beautiful place of relaxation,
we go down through some

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.950 align:middle line:84%
childhood memories,
generally start at about 12,

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.830 align:middle line:90%
down into the womb.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:19.820 align:middle line:84%
So when you're in this
lovely, relaxed place,

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.670 align:middle line:84%
your other part of your
mind, your subconscious mind,

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:24.900 align:middle line:84%
just takes you very gently
into these memories.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.310 align:middle line:90%
It's very easy to do.

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:29.660 align:middle line:84%
So you will be accessing
your memories that are

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.080 align:middle line:90%
held in your subconscious mind.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.730 align:middle line:84%
So these are places and
memories of your soul

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.260 align:middle line:84%
and your soul imprint
where you've been before.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.490 align:middle line:84%
If you're feeling sad,
this is a good reason why.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:45.230 align:middle line:84%
The soul is journeying and
evolving and understanding.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And we live and incarnate for
experiences on top of that,

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.690 align:middle line:90%
not the other way around.

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything else you
feel you'd like to know

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.132 align:middle line:90%
or that's come to your mind now?

00:13:55.132 --> 00:13:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>> I think that's good.

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:56.923 align:middle line:90%
I think that's good.

00:13:56.923 --> 00:14:04.270 align:middle line:90%


00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, see yourself, imagine
yourself walking, moving,

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:13.490 align:middle line:84%
floating, going towards
a beautiful long tunnel.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm soon going to
count from 10 down to one.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Cannot tell you how excited
I was going down that tunnel.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And I was running down
it and she was too slow.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.860 align:middle line:90%
Three, I'm moving five.

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And I got there, and
I was just emotionally

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.110 align:middle line:90%
filled with love and joy.

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:36.290 align:middle line:90%
And I am home.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:38.600 align:middle line:10%
I'm home.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.305 align:middle line:10%
Just light.

00:14:40.305 --> 00:14:42.820 align:middle line:10%
It's like a blanket.

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:45.700 align:middle line:10%
>> What color is the light?

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.110 align:middle line:10%
>> White.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:48.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you look down beneath you?

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.515 align:middle line:90%
How'd you sense where you are?

00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:52.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Have to go meet people.

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:55.250 align:middle line:10%
>> You need to go meet people.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:57.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Have to go sit down and talk.

00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, let's go there now.

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:00.580 align:middle line:10%
Who's here with me?

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Four.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:02.680 align:middle line:10%
>> Four.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Five.

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:05.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Four, five.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:07.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Globes.

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:08.930 align:middle line:10%
Gold globes.

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:10.550 align:middle line:90%
It's not just a globe.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.260 align:middle line:90%
It was a universe.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:13.190 align:middle line:90%
It was a power.

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:17.540 align:middle line:84%
It was, it was just so much
more that couldn't be described.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:21.430 align:middle line:10%
Different understanding.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.800 align:middle line:10%
Different places.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you sense a body or
no body here with them?

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:28.690 align:middle line:10%
>> No body.

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:29.960 align:middle line:90%
I loved being home.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.790 align:middle line:90%
I loved being with my friends.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:33.822 align:middle line:84%
To make it really
simple, it's like us

00:15:33.822 --> 00:15:35.530 align:middle line:84%
going out with our
buddies and say, well,

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:38.020 align:middle line:90%
how did that journey go for you?

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>> You look at your
inner core, your energy.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:43.120 align:middle line:90%
Did you sense that?

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:50.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Light, bright,
moving, powerful.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.890 align:middle line:10%
Has layers.

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:55.420 align:middle line:10%
Layers and layers.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>> It's so healing
for Susan to be here.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:01.440 align:middle line:84%
There's an awful lot of people
obviously sometimes feel

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:05.530 align:middle line:84%
and sense and miss their soul,
family, their best friends.

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly
the case for Susan.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:12.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Light pouring down,
but it's not light.

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:18.660 align:middle line:10%
It's diamonds creating
a mountain of diamonds.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:19.605 align:middle line:10%
It's my job.

00:16:19.605 --> 00:16:20.405 align:middle line:90%
>> It's your job.

00:16:20.405 --> 00:16:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell me more about your job.

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:26.250 align:middle line:10%
>> It's my job to
make the diamonds.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:28.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Your job to
make the diamonds.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.100 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a good job.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.500 align:middle line:10%
I like it.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.110 align:middle line:10%
>> What's the purpose
of this diamond?

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:36.340 align:middle line:10%
>> To bring light.

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm ensuring that there's
chips of diamonds,

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:44.580 align:middle line:84%
small diamonds moving
into Earth in the bodies

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.180 align:middle line:90%
of those incarnated.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And it is their connection to
the God source, the divine,

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:53.140 align:middle line:84%
their own soul,
whichever way it works.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's my job to ensure that
everybody has their diamond.

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:03.500 align:middle line:10%
>> They are just chips.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.430 align:middle line:10%
They're cut from a big diamond.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.369 align:middle line:10%
The big diamond
never gets smaller.

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:13.069 align:middle line:84%
>> This is how she spends
the majority of her time

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:14.319 align:middle line:90%
in the afterlife.

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:15.450 align:middle line:90%
This is what she does.

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:17.150 align:middle line:90%
This is who she is.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Breaking up these large diamond
or this powerful source energy

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:25.990 align:middle line:84%
of some kind into these smaller
diamonds that everyone gets one.

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know my
spiritual name is Diadem,

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.280 align:middle line:84%
which actually is crown,
the princess's crown.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:40.430 align:middle line:84%
But, again, because I even had
it tattooed onto my arm, Diadem.

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:44.760 align:middle line:84%
It's not a brilliant tattoo,
but it's imprinted on me.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.650 align:middle line:90%
So that is my spiritual name.

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:51.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, you're moving on.

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:52.440 align:middle line:90%
What happens next?

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.400 align:middle line:90%
Where do you go to next?

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.260 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't know this place.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Does it feel new?

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:00.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:05.480 align:middle line:10%
The ground is yellow.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.690 align:middle line:10%
Those mountains are yellow.

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:10.950 align:middle line:10%
I'm not sure about this.

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:13.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's stay with
this experience now.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:14.870 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:16.440 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't like it.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.490 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I got there,
I didn't like it.

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:19.300 align:middle line:90%
Don't want it.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.840 align:middle line:90%
Not working for me.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you alone here?

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.510 align:middle line:84%
As you look around,
is there anyone else

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:26.730 align:middle line:90%
or any other beings with you?

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:29.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Just those people over there.

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:32.400 align:middle line:10%
But--

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.400 align:middle line:10%
>> About the people, how'd
you sense the people?

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.016 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm waiting for my momma.

00:18:36.016 --> 00:18:39.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, for your momma.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Maybe at home, what
do you look like?

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.320 align:middle line:84%
How'd you sense
someone in this place?

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.750 align:middle line:10%
>> It's just a space.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>> How would you spend your
time here in this space?

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Numbers.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:54.440 align:middle line:10%
Solving numbers.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.200 align:middle line:10%
It's quite cold.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.570 align:middle line:10%
It's like it's not finished.

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Give me about
your sense of momma.

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:03.760 align:middle line:84%
What does she do
here in this place?

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.860 align:middle line:90%


00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:09.770 align:middle line:10%
>> She makes sure
I don't escape.

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:10.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Where did you go?

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:12.230 align:middle line:10%
Where did you escape to?

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.930 align:middle line:10%
Momma was not there?

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:17.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Get off this planet.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>> You'd get off the
planet if you could.

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:22.642 align:middle line:90%
Do you like where you are?

00:19:22.642 --> 00:19:23.600 align:middle line:10%
Do you like this place?

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.400 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Instantly, she does
not like this place.

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:28.500 align:middle line:84%
She's saying, get
me out of here.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.820 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be here.

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:30.690 align:middle line:90%
It's alone.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:31.920 align:middle line:90%
It's cold.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.000 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.730 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why I'm here.

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:37.530 align:middle line:84%
This is a very heavy
emotion for Susan.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:39.560 align:middle line:90%
She's desperate to get out.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And for you to escape
you get off that planet.

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:42.870 align:middle line:90%
Where would you go to?

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Just not there.

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:46.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you not like being
here in this planet?

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:47.750 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.200 align:middle line:90%
It was half done.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.750 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't ready for
anything to live on.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, it wasn't
ready for me to live on it.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:57.050 align:middle line:90%
It's just-- wasn't nice.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:58.300 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't wait to get off it.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Wherever that is,
I ain't going back.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.625 align:middle line:10%
I'm still trying to
get off the planet.

00:20:02.625 --> 00:20:05.130 align:middle line:10%


00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:08.460 align:middle line:10%
I make myself small.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.920 align:middle line:10%
That's it and I'm done.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.420 align:middle line:10%
It's job-- job done.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.967 align:middle line:84%
Once I had learned that
was it, I'd learned.

00:20:15.967 --> 00:20:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>> What's the significance
or purpose of making yourself

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.350 align:middle line:90%
smaller?

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:21.810 align:middle line:10%
>> So I could get
off the planet.

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:22.840 align:middle line:90%
Look, my job's done.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:23.230 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:23.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm going.

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:25.050 align:middle line:84%
How many times you
want me to tell you,

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:26.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going back
to that planet.

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.856 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you experience
of what happens next?

00:20:29.856 --> 00:20:33.590 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm so happy to
be off that planet.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:38.580 align:middle line:10%
I feel like at the moment,
I'm in no man's land.

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:44.160 align:middle line:10%
I'm in the naughty
corner of the universe.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.580 align:middle line:10%
I've not been punished.

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.790 align:middle line:10%
I don't feel being punished.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:50.110 align:middle line:10%
But just time out.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:54.030 align:middle line:10%
Just relaxed and thoughtful.

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:56.252 align:middle line:10%
Writing a lot.

00:20:56.252 --> 00:20:57.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Have you been here before?

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.430 align:middle line:90%
Is this the first time?

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:03.180 align:middle line:10%
>> No, I know this place.

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:07.180 align:middle line:84%
I was sent to the universal
naughty corner, basically.

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And I loved it because
it was time out

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:11.140 align:middle line:90%
space for me to think it was.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.530 align:middle line:84%
It didn't feel pressured
or I had been naughty,

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:19.500 align:middle line:84%
but I liked having time to
be retrospective, to be--

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:24.190 align:middle line:84%
really try and bring deeper
understanding to my experiences.

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>> In this place of
time or reflection,

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:29.320 align:middle line:90%
she learns to grow as a soul.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:33.340 align:middle line:84%
She describes how my soul is
getting all of this information.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm understanding more.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:36.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm writing.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm reflecting back.

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:40.140 align:middle line:10%
>> I return to the group.

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>> You returned to the group.

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:42.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:43.630 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about the group.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.440 align:middle line:84%
How are you sensing
this group now?

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.582 align:middle line:10%
>> We just talk.

00:21:48.582 --> 00:21:55.300 align:middle line:10%
We talk about
advancement, progression.

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.000 align:middle line:10%
We have a lot of joy.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.960 align:middle line:10%
We share a lot of joy.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot of joy.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>> We go out and experience
different adventures,

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.680 align:middle line:84%
different aspects, and
different lifestyles.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And then we draw back
together and discuss

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:14.140 align:middle line:84%
about these
experiences, I suppose,

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.760 align:middle line:84%
to progress the soul space
and the knowledge and the joy.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.030 align:middle line:84%
It's all about joy
and love, really.

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>> You're now moving on to
the place where you meet

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:26.890 align:middle line:84%
your elders, your
council, your guides.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.820 align:middle line:10%
Would you to tell me
about how you see them,

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.180 align:middle line:10%
how you sense them?

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Light.

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>> One?

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.490 align:middle line:90%
Is it more?

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Many.

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:37.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Many lights.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Separate but together.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:42.880 align:middle line:10%
I like it here.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Michael Newton talks
about this journey of souls,

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.490 align:middle line:84%
how soul groups can come
and clusters of light.

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:50.790 align:middle line:84%
How does it feel to be
here with them now again?

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:52.030 align:middle line:10%
>> It's good.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:54.188 align:middle line:90%
>> How did they greet you?

00:22:54.188 --> 00:22:55.230 align:middle line:90%
What did they say to you?

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:56.080 align:middle line:10%
>> With love.

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.480 align:middle line:10%
>> With love.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:02.360 align:middle line:84%
How do they call
you in this place?

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.812 align:middle line:10%
>> Sharia.

00:23:03.812 --> 00:23:05.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, Sharia.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.650 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:07.450 align:middle line:90%
Sharia.

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:11.200 align:middle line:10%
For Sharia, what do
they wish to tell you?

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.070 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm talking to Jane.

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:14.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh!

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:16.370 align:middle line:90%
Jane is your good, good friend.

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:17.270 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:18.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's wonderful.

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:21.150 align:middle line:84%
What does Jane wish
to say to you, Sharia?

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Just welcome home.

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:26.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Since you've been gone a
long time or a short time?

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:27.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Gone a long time.

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:29.770 align:middle line:10%
>> A long time.

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Does Jane wish to advise now
about your next incarnation

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:35.860 align:middle line:90%
that you're planning, Susan?

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:39.420 align:middle line:10%
>> She doesn't want me to go.

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, she doesn't
want you to go.

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:42.700 align:middle line:10%
Why not?

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.250 align:middle line:10%
Why didn't she want you to go?

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:45.347 align:middle line:10%
>> I've done enough.

00:23:45.347 --> 00:23:47.680 align:middle line:10%
>> Did she want you to stay
there with her and the other

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.560 align:middle line:10%
beings and work
with the diamonds?

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:50.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:52.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Jane steps forward.

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:53.320 align:middle line:90%
Her best, best friend.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.240 align:middle line:84%
She goes, I'm telling
her not to do it.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.190 align:middle line:90%
She's already done a lot.

00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:59.440 align:middle line:90%
She's already done this.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.193 align:middle line:84%
Why does she want to go in
again and incarnate again.

00:24:02.193 --> 00:24:03.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling her
she's done enough.

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>> How does she feel about you
planning your next incarnation

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:08.320 align:middle line:90%
of Susan?

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.650 align:middle line:10%
>> She would support me.

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:13.350 align:middle line:10%
It's going to help me think.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:17.220 align:middle line:10%
Uplift negative thoughts.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>> No, she doesn't want you to
go because she said you've done

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:21.600 align:middle line:90%
enough work already.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.460 align:middle line:84%
What advice can Jane give
you now about your next?

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:25.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Be truthful.

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:27.270 align:middle line:10%
Tell the truth.

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:28.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Tell the truth.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Share the truth.

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.230 align:middle line:84%
She's telling me
I've done enough.

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:32.030 align:middle line:90%
I've done enough.

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:33.160 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to do this.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:36.640 align:middle line:84%
But if you are going to do it,
stay in the light of truth.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.840 align:middle line:90%
Stay with truth.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.250 align:middle line:90%
Tell people about the truth.

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Interesting because that's
what I would consider myself

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:46.800 align:middle line:84%
in this human existence
to be akin to.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm asking for the highest
source of wisdom that can

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:53.360 align:middle line:84%
communicate with you and
act today to step forward.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.930 align:middle line:90%
Describe his stepping forward.

00:24:55.930 --> 00:25:09.920 align:middle line:10%
>> It's male, tall, strong,
ancient, an Egyptian head piece.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Have you met
this being before?

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:13.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.120 align:middle line:10%
He's like my father.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.020 align:middle line:84%
>> What advice and information
does he wish to share with you

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:22.242 align:middle line:84%
now today that's
going to help you?

00:25:22.242 --> 00:25:28.200 align:middle line:10%
>> He puts a crown on my head
and says "don't forget who you

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.560 align:middle line:10%
are."

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.520 align:middle line:90%
>> And the crown.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Describe the crown
that's on your head.

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:37.000 align:middle line:10%
>> It's just interwoven metal.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.380 align:middle line:10%
Light.

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.090 align:middle line:10%
Not heavy.

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>> He put it on my
head and he said,

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:45.340 align:middle line:90%
"Don't you forget who you are."

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:46.140 align:middle line:90%
Again.

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:50.610 align:middle line:84%
If I've to go back to diadem,
it is a princess's crown.

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:54.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be
going, I am a princess

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:55.830 align:middle line:90%
and all of that kind of thing.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:58.070 align:middle line:84%
But it has followed me
through my life, which

00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:03.220 align:middle line:84%
of course, is what I try to help
people and myself understand.

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:06.516 align:middle line:84%
>> Do I have permission to
speak directly with him now?

00:26:06.516 --> 00:26:08.531 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:26:08.531 --> 00:26:10.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm, thank you.

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:13.770 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't Jane want her to go?

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:20.925 align:middle line:10%
>> Because she would have
to re-learn what she knows.

00:26:20.925 --> 00:26:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>> What relearn everything?

00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:27.088 align:middle line:10%
>> She thinks she didn't
learn it well enough.

00:26:27.088 --> 00:26:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>> What's your
understanding of that?

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:30.790 align:middle line:90%
Tell me more, please.

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:33.940 align:middle line:10%
>> She can choose
what she chooses.

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:34.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, she can choose.

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:36.450 align:middle line:90%
Is this a sense of free will?

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:38.440 align:middle line:90%
What we humans call free will?

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Why is Susan going to
choose or Sharias that's going

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:45.370 align:middle line:90%
to choose to incarnate as Susan?

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:46.210 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:47.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Because that's who she is.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.930 align:middle line:90%
>> That's who she is.

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:51.730 align:middle line:84%
Had she had many
incarnations before?

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:52.530 align:middle line:10%
>> She has.

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:54.240 align:middle line:10%
>> She has.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell me, please,
about that place,

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.020 align:middle line:90%
that planet with the yellow.

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:03.460 align:middle line:10%
>> That's not fully finished.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And she really
wanted to get off.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Why is it so important for her
not to get off, to stay there?

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:12.750 align:middle line:10%
>> She could have
assisted in progression.

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:14.950 align:middle line:10%
>> So was she there to
assist in progression?

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:16.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>> You sent this sense of
free will and free choice.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.885 align:middle line:90%
So for free will, she left.

00:27:20.885 --> 00:27:22.470 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:23.310 align:middle line:10%
>> It's true.

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.798 align:middle line:10%
How do you feel about her
leaving that planet when

00:27:27.798 --> 00:27:28.840 align:middle line:10%
she was there to assist--

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:29.680 align:middle line:10%
>> It's her choice.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.400 align:middle line:90%
>> You have free will.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.080 align:middle line:90%
You choose everything.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.970 align:middle line:84%
She chose to go to
the yellow planet.

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:37.190 align:middle line:84%
She chose to leave
the yellow planet.

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:39.430 align:middle line:84%
She chose-- it
encouraged, but she

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:41.840 align:middle line:84%
chose to go to the place
of self-reflection.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:45.740 align:middle line:84%
She chose then to incarnate
again into this lifetime.

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:48.590 align:middle line:84%
So all of this is
free will and choice.

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:50.570 align:middle line:84%
We are never made
to do anything.

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:54.550 align:middle line:84%
It is our soul's journey
to want to do this.

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Susan, the soul of Susan chose
to incarnate into this body.

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, Susan, did you
choose to incarnate

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:04.600 align:middle line:84%
into that family of mom,
dad, brother, or sisters?

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:05.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Of course.

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:07.480 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.970 align:middle line:84%
Why did she choose
to incarnate knowing

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:11.770 align:middle line:84%
that it's going to
be somewhat what

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:13.510 align:middle line:90%
we perceive to be difficult.

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:15.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Because that's what she does.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.098 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, why is that?

00:28:17.098 --> 00:28:18.640 align:middle line:10%
Why does she choose
these difficult--

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.210 align:middle line:10%
>> She challenges.

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Challenges.

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:23.340 align:middle line:90%
Is she so who likes challenges.

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:26.470 align:middle line:10%
>> She challenges constantly.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Why is that?

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:29.560 align:middle line:84%
Why does she
challenge constantly?

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:35.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Her desire to learn and
understand is profound.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>> What I'm really
getting from this,

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:42.430 align:middle line:84%
as we're going back over the
session is deeper, Susan,

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:44.950 align:middle line:90%
you're doing a good job.

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Susan senses
sadness within her,

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:51.790 align:middle line:84%
although her life can be very
happy, a deep sense of sadness,

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:52.820 align:middle line:90%
not unhappiness.

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And she's always felt
like something is missing.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.340 align:middle line:90%
What is that feeling?

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:57.140 align:middle line:10%
>> Us.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.410 align:middle line:10%
Home.

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Did she miss you?

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:05.650 align:middle line:84%
>> What advice can you give
us now to help Susan in order

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:08.530 align:middle line:84%
for her to not
feel that sadness?

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:09.580 align:middle line:10%
>> She knows.

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.950 align:middle line:10%
Go within.

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:16.010 align:middle line:10%
We agreed that tie
will never break.

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:17.480 align:middle line:90%
>> You're never forgotten.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.030 align:middle line:90%
You're never alone.

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.400 align:middle line:84%
Their strength, their
love, their support

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.410 align:middle line:84%
continues on even if
we make that free will

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:26.590 align:middle line:90%
choice to incarnate.

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>> So I thank you
for this information.

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:30.450 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate
you sharing it.

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:31.515 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:29:31.515 --> 00:29:34.660 align:middle line:84%
What do you like
to tell Susan now?

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:37.600 align:middle line:10%

It really touches me
to know that I know it

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.950 align:middle line:90%
and to know that I forget it.

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And so it's so great
to be reminded.

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:47.342 align:middle line:90%
>> How are you feeling?

00:29:47.342 --> 00:29:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Ugh.

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:49.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Take your time.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:50.870 align:middle line:90%
Very discombobulating.

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:52.210 align:middle line:90%
How long did it feel?

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Two hours.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Just shy of three.

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:56.830 align:middle line:90%
Three hours.

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:58.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Three hours.

It was very powerful
to remind her

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:03.100 align:middle line:84%
that that feeling of
missing home is OK,

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.920 align:middle line:84%
but in fact, it's free
will choosing to come.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.210 align:middle line:90%
That she is never alone.

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:10.160 align:middle line:84%
That we are always
connected, and she

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:13.446 align:middle line:90%
will be connected forever.

>> Two weeks now
since my session,

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:28.850 align:middle line:90%
and I'm still intrigued with it.

I'm still fascinated with it.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.260 align:middle line:90%
So I felt so comforted.

I felt so at peace,
I think, which

is part of love and comfort.

00:30:37.585 --> 00:30:39.230 align:middle line:90%
I was very much at peace.

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:41.830 align:middle line:90%
I knew who I was in that moment.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:43.680 align:middle line:90%
The next day I was very joyful.

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.480 align:middle line:90%
I was very light.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.310 align:middle line:90%
My energy was very light.

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:49.750 align:middle line:84%

still reflecting on it.

Things pop into my mind, but
the remembering who you are.

I just kind of went,
yeah, I forget.

00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:57.440 align:middle line:90%
I forget.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's not about I'm
all the way up there.

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:04.270 align:middle line:84%
It's about the soul of me
and my purpose and my ability

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:06.550 align:middle line:90%
to share with others in my work.

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:10.040 align:middle line:84%

Thank you, Triona so much for
