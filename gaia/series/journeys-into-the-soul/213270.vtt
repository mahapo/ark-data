00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Prior to that, I was a music
professor at Drake University.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.410 align:middle line:84%
I am a former opera singer,
a musical theater singer,

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.620 align:middle line:84%
and taught voice lessons for a
long time, and was a musician.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.810 align:middle line:84%
That was kind of my
path into college.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.550 align:middle line:84%
I got a music
scholarship and that's

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.230 align:middle line:90%
what got me out of my hometown.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Because I think for a long
time, the need to be on stage

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.800 align:middle line:84%
and to act and to sing, a lot
of that came from the need

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.760 align:middle line:90%
to hear the applause.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.083 align:middle line:84%
People telling me how
great of a singer I am

00:01:32.083 --> 00:01:33.750 align:middle line:84%
and that made me feel
good about myself.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.167 align:middle line:84%
And then at some
point, it started

00:01:35.167 --> 00:01:39.360 align:middle line:84%
to mean less and less until
it meant almost nothing.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And then when I got on
stage, I kind of just

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.040 align:middle line:90%
didn't want to be there anymore.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, that worked
its way into my teaching.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.150 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was pretty
good at teaching as well.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.940 align:middle line:84%
I really enjoyed
that, but it just

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.475 align:middle line:84%
felt disingenuous
to try to teach

00:01:52.475 --> 00:01:54.600 align:middle line:84%
others to do a thing that
I no longer really wanted

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.600 align:middle line:90%
to do myself.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And so at that point,
I decided I needed

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.920 align:middle line:90%
to find something else to do.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure
I've found it yet,

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.760 align:middle line:84%
but that's been a nice
transition for me,

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.910 align:middle line:84%
moving out of music and
finding my next thing that I'm

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.546 align:middle line:90%
going to do.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.290 align:middle line:10%
My wife had her own QHHT
session with Suzanne Spooner

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.220 align:middle line:10%
and she recommended
that I have my own.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.240 align:middle line:84%
I am under the
presupposition that we

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.420 align:middle line:84%
are spiritual beings
having a human experience,

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.492 align:middle line:84%
and I'm really interested in
something called angel numbers,

00:02:31.492 --> 00:02:32.950 align:middle line:84%
that when you get
specific numbers,

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.890 align:middle line:84%
it's supposed to have a
certain message that's

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:36.890 align:middle line:90%
being relayed to you.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.860 align:middle line:90%
So I had a dream.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And in that dream,
I felt like a voice

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.130 align:middle line:84%
was shouting this number
at me over and over again.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm really interested
in finding out

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.450 align:middle line:84%
what this specific number
means and why it's often

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.030 align:middle line:84%
repeated in my life because
I'll see it almost every day

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.335 align:middle line:84%
on a license plate or on the
clock or something like that.

00:02:55.335 --> 00:02:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also interested
in finding out

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.470 align:middle line:90%
some things about past lives.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.380 align:middle line:84%
So maybe what purpose
or what lessons

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm supposed to gather from this
particular lifetime, maybe just

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.840 align:middle line:84%
next steps, maybe just the
path and how it unfolds for me,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.850 align:middle line:84%
and maybe if there's
something that I need to do

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.808 align:middle line:84%
or some kind of sign that
I need to look out for so I

00:03:19.808 --> 00:03:21.100 align:middle line:90%
can be ready, ready for change.

we tend to think

it's just over and over again.

And the things that
happen during a life

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.300 align:middle line:84%
where we want more
understanding and why

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.320 align:middle line:90%
does life have to be like this?

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And I guess I just have
to do what I'm told.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Although, there's a
yearning inside of us

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.760 align:middle line:90%
that seems to want to know more.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we
will think of things

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.910 align:middle line:84%
like our gut, our
intuition, the part of us

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.490 align:middle line:84%
that is helping to
guide us, helping

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.020 align:middle line:84%
to make our paths on our
lifetime easier and more

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.670 align:middle line:84%
satisfying, then that's when
the pathways start opening up

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.200 align:middle line:84%
and the clarity starts to
come, and the feeling of peace

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.390 align:middle line:84%
is felt more so than when
we're on that hamster wheel.

lifetime or the story

of their consciousness.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And from there, we can really
find some very interesting

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.170 align:middle line:84%
avenues to pursue in that
lifetime that in amazing ways

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.930 align:middle line:84%
always ends up tying back
to this current lifetime.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.210 align:middle line:10%
They're more connected.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.700 align:middle line:10%
They understand themselves on
a much deeper level than when

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.310 align:middle line:10%
they arrived for their
session, and it is

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.350 align:middle line:10%

And I don't know what it is that
he is searching for in regards

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.100 align:middle line:90%
to this session.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.850 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the discovery
that we'll uncover.

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.300 align:middle line:84%
He might have a
lot of questions.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.740 align:middle line:90%
He might have very few.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.430 align:middle line:84%
But just to get to
know him well and see

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.480 align:middle line:84%
how he works, how he likes
to think about his life

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.990 align:middle line:90%
will be a lot of fun.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Helping him dive deep
into his consciousness

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.990 align:middle line:84%
to find all of his answers and
explore the infinite knowledge

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.290 align:middle line:84%
that he has walked around
with every second of his life

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.580 align:middle line:84%
will be the most amazing
experience of all.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.282 align:middle line:84%
I am so happy that
you are here, Ed.

00:06:36.282 --> 00:06:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Let's start at the
beginning of your life

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.640 align:middle line:90%
and work up to the current time.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.610 align:middle line:84%
That helps me keep times,
events, people in place,

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.620 align:middle line:84%
and then keep going
with those key events

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.270 align:middle line:90%
until we get up to the current.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.030 align:middle line:84%
So in the beginning,
there was Ed.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I grew up
in Elgin, Illinois,

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.100 align:middle line:90%
a Northwest suburb of Chicago.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Eighth grade, the
high school choir

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.920 align:middle line:84%
came to visit my
eighth grade choir room

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.200 align:middle line:84%
and my jaw dropped
and I was like, I've

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.850 align:middle line:84%
got to be a part of that
once I get to high school.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.610 align:middle line:84%
But then one day,
my choir director

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.260 align:middle line:84%
kind of pulled me aside,
and another fellow as well,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.780 align:middle line:84%
and he said, the two of
you sing particularly well

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.190 align:middle line:90%
for high schoolers.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.770 align:middle line:84%
You've both got a gift
for opera singing.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh wow.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So he suggested I
take voice lessons.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.900 align:middle line:90%
And so I did that.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And then that kind of moved
me into a different direction.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.940 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up going to college
for music undergraduate,

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.030 align:middle line:84%
master's degree, finished the
coursework for a doctorate,

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.360 align:middle line:84%
but I ended up finding
my way into teaching.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:41.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I did
for a pretty long time.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:47.090 align:middle line:84%
I taught voice lessons for about
20 years as a college professor.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.360 align:middle line:90%
When I met Rachel, I mean, wow.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was just no
way to not be with her,

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.040 align:middle line:90%
and she felt the same.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.590 align:middle line:90%
And that was over 20 years ago.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:00.420 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Tried really hard to
write that dissertation,

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:07.260 align:middle line:84%
but I just never really
settled on a topic for it,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.720 align:middle line:84%
on anything that
really interested me.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up getting
a teaching job anyway

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.580 align:middle line:84%
without actually
finishing the doctorate.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:18.450 align:middle line:84%
Not finishing the doctorate
or just not writing

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.720 align:middle line:84%
the dissertation kind of
hung over me for a while

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.840 align:middle line:84%
too, maybe the next
10 years, because I

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.640 align:middle line:84%
felt like it was something
that I should have finished.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And then I got a
phone call or an email

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:33.210 align:middle line:84%
from someone that I
had done my doctorate

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.539 align:middle line:84%
work with who had been
teaching at Drake University.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:38.130 align:middle line:90%
I got the job.

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:41.679 align:middle line:84%
It felt really good to say,
I'm a college professor.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:43.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm a music professor.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.190 align:middle line:90%
I teach at Drake.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.870 align:middle line:90%
I had a beautiful office.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.530 align:middle line:90%
My name was on the door.

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.310 align:middle line:84%
All these sort of ego-based
things that I really

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:54.250 align:middle line:84%
latched onto that probably
kept me there for way too long.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:09:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And then one day I developed
performance anxiety,

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.250 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't want
to do it anymore.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.410 align:middle line:90%
And then COVID hit.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:08.380 align:middle line:84%
We had to start teaching our
students remotely over Zoom.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was that at that
point that I thought,

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:11.860 align:middle line:90%
I really hate this.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.190 align:middle line:84%
So I resigned from
that job not knowing

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.820 align:middle line:90%
exactly what I was doing.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.290 align:middle line:84%
It was a pretty big
leap of faith for me.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:22.230 align:middle line:84%
So then I started looking for
other jobs, which brings me

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.650 align:middle line:84%
to where I am currently,
working for the State of Iowa's

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:29.100 align:middle line:90%
Unemployment Insurance agency.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.710 align:middle line:84%
I can just go to
this job that doesn't

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:36.660 align:middle line:84%
have to define me, clock
in, clock out, come home, be

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:37.690 align:middle line:90%
with my family.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.100 align:middle line:90%
I think that was the appeal.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.390 align:middle line:90%
That was the appeal.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:44.470 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, the job
itself is very difficult.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:48.340 align:middle line:84%
I see people at their worst
when they've got money concerns.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:53.070 align:middle line:84%
My next move is I just started
reading "Rich Dad, Poor Dad"

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:55.920 align:middle line:84%
because I've always had
this feeling that wealth,

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.160 align:middle line:84%
like great financial wealth,
was just outside of my reach.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I guess for
me, my next move

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:07.240 align:middle line:84%
is to learn more about
mastering my finances.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.980 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of
where I'm at right now

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.810 align:middle line:90%
as far as bringing me current.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Got the day job that
I go to, but I'm

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:19.860 align:middle line:84%
thinking that there's got to
be something more that I'm just

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.762 align:middle line:90%
not seeing the big picture yet.

00:10:21.762 --> 00:10:22.562 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:22.562 --> 00:10:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And how has your
physical body been?

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.802 align:middle line:84%
Any challenges that you've had
to go through in your lifetime?

00:10:27.802 --> 00:10:29.760 align:middle line:84%
Anything that you're
working through right now?

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I do have a knee issue
that I got from taekwondo.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.200 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.242 align:middle line:90%
>> About three years ago.

00:10:36.242 --> 00:10:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Just one day I was
just doing some

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:42.460 align:middle line:84%
kicks and heard something snap,
and I tore my lateral meniscus.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:46.470 align:middle line:84%
So now here I am kicking
a bag as hard as I can.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:47.740 align:middle line:90%
And then what happens?

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.110 align:middle line:90%
I get injured.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>> What Dolores Cannon found
in her great work is that

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:55.120 align:middle line:90%
our bodies are messengers.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.807 align:middle line:90%
Symptoms are the message.

00:10:56.807 --> 00:10:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And if we can understand
what that language means,

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:01.450 align:middle line:84%
we can understand why
we have the issue.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:02.410 align:middle line:90%
That's the fun part.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.710 align:middle line:84%
We're going to find out,
for example, with your knee,

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:06.293 align:middle line:84%
what were you trying
to teach yourself

00:11:06.293 --> 00:11:07.450 align:middle line:90%
through that experience?

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Your knee should be feeling
very good afterwards.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think you're
going to be needing a cane.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.250 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm excited about that.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:13.380 align:middle line:90%
>> That's pretty cool, isn't it?

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:13.875 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:13.875 --> 00:11:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, you did such a good
job with your life story.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.945 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything else that
you can think of that's

00:11:17.945 --> 00:11:19.037 align:middle line:90%
important for me to know?

00:11:19.037 --> 00:11:19.870 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't think so.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:20.350 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:21.767 align:middle line:84%
Just trust and say
the first thing

00:11:21.767 --> 00:11:24.165 align:middle line:84%
that comes to mind when
I ask you a question.

00:11:24.165 --> 00:11:24.965 align:middle line:90%
I think we're good.

00:11:24.965 --> 00:11:31.800 align:middle line:90%


00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.570 align:middle line:84%
What's the very first
thing that you notice?

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:41.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Small hotel on the beach.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.950 align:middle line:10%
I think it's a place I
used to go with my family

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.765 align:middle line:10%
when I was younger.

00:11:46.765 --> 00:11:48.525 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I know exactly
where I'm at because we

00:11:48.525 --> 00:11:49.900 align:middle line:84%
used to go to the
Wisconsin Dells

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.410 align:middle line:84%
almost every summer
when I was a kid.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:56.040 align:middle line:84%
I recognized the dirty brown
sand and the brown lake.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.140 align:middle line:10%
I feel like a child.

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:57.940 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.130 align:middle line:90%
You're doing so good.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.330 align:middle line:84%
Does this feel like
you in the current life

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:03.760 align:middle line:90%
but in a younger time?

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Go to the room where you're
staying, and now you're there,

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.650 align:middle line:84%
and describe for me
what that's like.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:13.540 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a motel, I suppose.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.820 align:middle line:10%
Brown shag carpet.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.600 align:middle line:10%
Parents are getting ready.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.850 align:middle line:10%
Their suitcases on the bed.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:27.490 align:middle line:10%
I see my dad's getting ready
and his dress shoes wing tips.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:30.780 align:middle line:10%
My mom looks much younger.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:34.080 align:middle line:10%
Going to go off and
explore a little bit.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:39.030 align:middle line:10%
It feels like a vacation,
like a summer vacation.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>> He was at a hotel on
vacation with his family.

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I think he
really enjoyed from that scene

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.970 align:middle line:84%
was the seeing his father, his
late father, who has passed now.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.300 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's do this.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Let's leave that scene
that you're looking at.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:58.350 align:middle line:84%
We're going to drift and float
to another appropriate time

00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:59.640 align:middle line:90%
and place.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And what's the first
thing that you notice?

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:04.880 align:middle line:10%
>> It's another hotel.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.280 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Numerous floors.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:08.290 align:middle line:10%
Fancy.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.130 align:middle line:10%
We call it a fancy hotel.

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:11.320 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Old cars parked.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.470 align:middle line:10%
Lots of well-dressed people
going in and out of the hotel.

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>> We leave that scene from his
childhood hotel and he drifts

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.320 align:middle line:90%
and floats to another hotel.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, that's
pretty interesting.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.360 align:middle line:84%
But as we get more
details, he's describing

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.340 align:middle line:84%
the cars there as
very, very old,

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.820 align:middle line:84%
which gives me the knowing that
he's in a different lifetime.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm wearing a gray suit.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.640 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.530 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm a large man.

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:39.410 align:middle line:10%
It's exciting.

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:41.110 align:middle line:10%
I'm excited to be there.

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:43.810 align:middle line:10%
>> And why are you so
excited to be there?

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:45.640 align:middle line:10%
>> I think I'm meeting someone.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.240 align:middle line:10%
It's romantic in nature.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.220 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:52.090 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a party
going on at the hotel.

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:56.110 align:middle line:10%
Something to do with show
business, wrapping up a movie.

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:57.880 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:01.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Lots of people are
excited to see me.

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.940 align:middle line:10%
We don't stay at
the ball very long.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Why not?

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.860 align:middle line:10%
>> We move upstairs
to a hotel room.

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.170 align:middle line:10%
We already had a room.

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:12.890 align:middle line:10%
It feels like a new romance.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.231 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:14:14.231 --> 00:14:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And now you've got this private
time with her in the hotel room?

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:20.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:24.430 align:middle line:10%
I think she met
me on a movie set.

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:28.070 align:middle line:84%
She was someone that I had
known from show business.

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:32.320 align:middle line:84%
I just wasn't really sure
if she was really into me

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.020 align:middle line:84%
or was just trying to
get her foot in the door.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.720 align:middle line:10%
Maybe we do go to my
room, but I can't quite

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.550 align:middle line:10%
play out that scenario.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, that's OK.

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:42.380 align:middle line:84%
You're doing
really, really good.

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:43.400 align:middle line:90%
Let's do this.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Let's leave that scene
that you're looking at.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:46.687 align:middle line:84%
Let's drift and float
to where it is you

00:14:46.687 --> 00:14:49.640 align:middle line:84%
live in that time, that
lifetime you're viewing,

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.350 align:middle line:84%
and describe for me
what that is like.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.940 align:middle line:10%
>> It feels like an
apartment building,

00:14:54.940 --> 00:15:01.480 align:middle line:10%
all the many things that someone
of wealth would have early

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.210 align:middle line:10%
'20s, early '10s.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:08.710 align:middle line:10%
I'm not entirely sure,
but it feels lonely.

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Why does it feel so lonely?

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:14.621 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm all alone.

00:15:14.621 --> 00:15:16.990 align:middle line:10%
And I feel like there's
a knock at the door.

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>> We explore that scene of
being in the hotel and all

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.080 align:middle line:84%
the activity that's going on
with the pretty girl and his

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:29.100 align:middle line:84%
fame, and I just move him to
where he lives in that lifetime.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.560 align:middle line:84%
I want to find out
more information

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.460 align:middle line:90%
about what his life is like.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
knock at the door.

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:40.730 align:middle line:10%
>> I go to the door and
it's me greeting me.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:41.790 align:middle line:90%
>> That's so interesting.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.910 align:middle line:90%
Tell me more about that.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:50.780 align:middle line:10%
>> I am trying to knock
on Fatty Arbuckle's door.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.540 align:middle line:10%
I know what it feels
like to be him.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Immediately I knew,
oh, it's Fatty.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:59.450 align:middle line:84%
I felt like him in my
body because I looked down

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:04.350 align:middle line:84%
and I saw the belly and I saw
my fancy shoes, and I thought,

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.240 align:middle line:84%
this is the place
where it happened.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And the you that's
knocking on the door,

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.220 align:middle line:84%
describe what you're
like at that time.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.960 align:middle line:10%
>> That feels like
present day me.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:18.490 align:middle line:84%
Present day you knocking on
past door of your other life.

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:19.290 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:19.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Correct.

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:20.690 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:21.550 align:middle line:90%
So interesting.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Tell me more about what
occurs from that experience.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:33.360 align:middle line:10%
>> We look at one another and
present day me says, I am you.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.720 align:middle line:10%
Fatty says, I know.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.435 align:middle line:10%
And he says, I
was expecting you.

00:16:39.435 --> 00:16:40.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh my goodness.

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:43.470 align:middle line:10%
>> I've been so lonely.

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:47.250 align:middle line:84%
Fatty Arbuckle was a
silent film star comedian

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:48.660 align:middle line:90%
around the turn of the century.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.990 align:middle line:84%
He was involved in one
of Hollywood's earliest,

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:53.890 align:middle line:90%
if not the first major scandal.

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:57.120 align:middle line:84%
He was involved with a woman, an
incident happened in their hotel

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.140 align:middle line:90%
room, and she died.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.110 align:middle line:84%
He was accused of
murdering her and he never

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:05.536 align:middle line:84%
really bounced back from that as
far as his career was concerned.

00:17:05.536 --> 00:17:06.619 align:middle line:90%
>> And then what happened?

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:09.280 align:middle line:10%
>> People expect so much of me.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.900 align:middle line:10%
They want me to do things,
like fall down stairs

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.349 align:middle line:10%
and smash pies in my face.

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:20.220 align:middle line:10%
I don't want to do those things.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.140 align:middle line:10%
And I say, I know
what that feels

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.829 align:middle line:10%
like to have people
expect things from you.

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:30.700 align:middle line:10%
To be caught up in an
identity that you've

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:36.390 align:middle line:10%
built for yourself only to
realize it means nothing.

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:41.930 align:middle line:10%
Fatty says, My career was ruined
and I've got nothing left.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:45.372 align:middle line:10%
And I feel like
I've made mistakes.

00:17:45.372 --> 00:17:48.390 align:middle line:10%
And I tell him that
it's going to be OK,

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:54.360 align:middle line:10%
that he's a good person,
that it wasn't his fault.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.704 align:middle line:10%
He didn't do the things
that they said he did.

00:17:58.704 --> 00:18:01.401 align:middle line:10%
He weeps.

00:18:01.401 --> 00:18:05.420 align:middle line:10%
And then I don't think he
makes it to the next morning.

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:07.430 align:middle line:10%
He needed someone to tell
him that he was good.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.500 align:middle line:90%
Such an important journey.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.420 align:middle line:10%
>> He feels broken.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.690 align:middle line:10%
I think he dies from heartbreak.

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:20.770 align:middle line:84%
I just felt like I had
to tell him something.

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:23.580 align:middle line:84%
He was good and that
look at all the joy

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.080 align:middle line:90%
that he brought to people.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:29.910 align:middle line:84%
>> What were some of the lessons
that you learned in that life?

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:31.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Trust your intuition.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.670 align:middle line:10%
Trust your gut.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:37.500 align:middle line:10%
He knew he was getting himself
into something that he shouldn't

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:42.000 align:middle line:10%
have, but he ignored
his instincts

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.400 align:middle line:10%
and perhaps followed more
of his animalistic instincts

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:49.500 align:middle line:10%
or was desperate for love.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, and I'm wondering,
why did you decide

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.730 align:middle line:90%
to show him that life today?

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.195 align:middle line:10%
>> He felt like he was bad.

00:18:59.195 --> 00:19:04.350 align:middle line:10%
He needed someone to tell
him that he was good.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And how does that life of
Fatty Arbuckle relate to his

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.400 align:middle line:90%
current life as Ed?

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.060 align:middle line:10%
>> I need reminding that I'm
good, that those were mistakes.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.410 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know any better.

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:19.290 align:middle line:10%
And what I knew
better, I did better.

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:25.050 align:middle line:84%
The message that I was giving
him was really one for myself,

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:26.890 align:middle line:84%
the modern day
version of myself.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:27.900 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.260 align:middle line:90%
You are good.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.450 align:middle line:90%
You are forgiven.

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:35.070 align:middle line:84%
You have not done
anything wrong to make

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.920 align:middle line:84%
that connection
with my past self

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.230 align:middle line:84%
in order to heal
my present self.

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>> May I speak to Ed's
higher self, please?

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:43.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:44.910 align:middle line:10%
We like Ed.

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:47.040 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.380 align:middle line:84%
Why was it important for
him to see that lifetime?

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.890 align:middle line:10%
>> So he wouldn't carry
that weight with him.

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:59.220 align:middle line:10%
So he wouldn't feel accused,
to let go of the anger.

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:02.760 align:middle line:10%
At his current job, he has
conversations with himself

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:06.580 align:middle line:10%
on the way to work,
where he gets angry.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:07.720 align:middle line:10%
It's in his body.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.770 align:middle line:10%
It's in his chest.

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:11.430 align:middle line:10%
It's in his knee.

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:16.512 align:middle line:84%
Sadness, depression, anger,
that sense of feeling indignant.

00:20:16.512 --> 00:20:17.970 align:middle line:84%
You're doing the
best that you can,

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:19.170 align:middle line:84%
but you've got people
saying that you

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:20.230 align:middle line:90%
could be doing it better.

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:22.052 align:middle line:90%
I've got the knee pain.

00:20:22.052 --> 00:20:23.760 align:middle line:84%
These are all real
physical symptoms that

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.380 align:middle line:90%
are manifesting themselves.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So what do you want him
to understand about that?

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.880 align:middle line:10%
>> We just want
him to let it go.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.760 align:middle line:10%
Just let it go.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.700 align:middle line:10%
He doesn't know
how to let it go.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Help him to understand
how he can let it go.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.290 align:middle line:10%
>> We say go inside.

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:43.500 align:middle line:10%
Go inside.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And when he does
that, what will he find?

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:49.330 align:middle line:10%
>> He will find himself.

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:52.770 align:middle line:10%
He will find peace.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:54.900 align:middle line:10%
He'll find his path.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:55.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Find his path.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:59.160 align:middle line:90%
And tell him about his path.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:20:59.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Forward.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:00.700 align:middle line:10%
It's forward.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:01.270 align:middle line:10%
It's movement.

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.070 align:middle line:10%
It's forward.

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:04.260 align:middle line:10%
It's not looking back.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.990 align:middle line:10%
It's always moving forward.

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:08.910 align:middle line:10%
Don't live in the past.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not uncommon to see
males digesting and ingesting

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.970 align:middle line:84%
anger in a different
way than a female will.

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Females always think
it's their fault and men,

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:22.930 align:middle line:84%
they kind of stuff it down and
they don't want to look at it,

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:26.550 align:middle line:84%
and they just want to keep
going on with their day,

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:27.370 align:middle line:90%
with their life.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:31.410 align:middle line:84%
Those deep anger issues
create all sorts of chaos

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:32.740 align:middle line:90%
within the body.

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think he tends
to live in the past?

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Always caught up in mistakes.

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:44.750 align:middle line:10%
He has mistakes, choices he
feels were wrong choices.

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:49.260 align:middle line:10%
He views them harshly, like
they were mistakes rather than

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.060 align:middle line:10%
just choices.

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:54.030 align:middle line:10%
He made the choice
he made at the time,

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:57.450 align:middle line:10%
then he blames the
choice on the outcome.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:00.210 align:middle line:10%
And it's not that serious.

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Guilt is that one
emotion where you

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.150 align:middle line:90%
say, "I could have done better.

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:06.770 align:middle line:84%
I should have done
better, but I didn't."

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And I've been viewing
my choices as mistakes.

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:12.940 align:middle line:10%
>> So when he can
let go of the past--

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:16.050 align:middle line:10%
>> He is free.

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:18.690 align:middle line:10%
There's fear.

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:20.380 align:middle line:10%
Just needs to keep
moving forward.

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.980 align:middle line:10%
He needs to break off
the rear view mirror.

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.740 align:middle line:10%
He keeps looking in
the rear view mirror

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:29.400 align:middle line:10%
like something's going
to sneak up on him.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, my higher self told
me to break off the rear view

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:36.528 align:middle line:84%
mirror because that's
affecting my daily life

00:22:36.528 --> 00:22:38.070 align:middle line:84%
and my daily choices,
and it's really

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:39.900 align:middle line:90%
keeping me from moving forward.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.580 align:middle line:90%
>> There really are no mistakes.

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:43.810 align:middle line:90%
Human life is about choices.

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:46.740 align:middle line:84%
We are much, much
harder on ourselves

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:49.470 align:middle line:84%
than the parts of us
that know everything,

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.400 align:middle line:84%
like the subconscious
or the high self.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.020 align:middle line:90%
They see no mistakes.

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:56.080 align:middle line:84%
They just see it as a path
that we chose to take.

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:59.520 align:middle line:10%
>> His knee is
hurting quite a bit.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>> What message is his knee
trying to give him with that

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:04.730 align:middle line:90%
discomfort?

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:06.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Fear of mobility.

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:10.700 align:middle line:10%
Fear of being able
to move forward.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Why did that event
have to happen that day?

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:16.730 align:middle line:84%
What were you
trying to tell him?

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:21.130 align:middle line:10%
>> It was important to him to
finish the course of training

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:28.220 align:middle line:10%
to reach the black belt. He
carries with him weight of guilt

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.780 align:middle line:10%
of not finishing
things for a long time.

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.650 align:middle line:10%
He didn't finish his
doctorate at the university.

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:37.640 align:middle line:10%
He wanted to finish
the black belt just

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.730 align:middle line:10%
to get to that point to
say he had done something

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:42.260 align:middle line:10%
and finished it.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:46.040 align:middle line:10%
He felt something, but it
wasn't until later the next day.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.650 align:middle line:10%
He felt the excruciating
pain and then

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:52.010 align:middle line:10%
he couldn't move down
the stairs for months.

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, now that he understands
all of that background,

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.215 align:middle line:84%
what are you doing to completely
heal that knee for him today?

00:23:59.215 --> 00:24:05.510 align:middle line:90%


00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:09.350 align:middle line:10%
You can let him know
that he is safe,

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:13.450 align:middle line:10%
that it is time to let it go.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:17.340 align:middle line:10%
He can move forward now.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:20.140 align:middle line:10%
It will not hurt
anymore after this.

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.700 align:middle line:10%
It will not hurt anymore.

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.160 align:middle line:10%
We make that promise to him.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.600 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I think if you can make
the acknowledgment to let go

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:32.720 align:middle line:84%
of your past, it can
really free up your future,

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:36.160 align:middle line:84%
which then allows me to
focus on what's ahead.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>> The job that he's in,
he feels it's fulfilling,

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:44.490 align:middle line:84%
ticking off a few boxes,
but not satisfying him.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:47.920 align:middle line:10%
>> He will die if
he stays there.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.400 align:middle line:10%
It is slowly killing him.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.580 align:middle line:10%
He knows this.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.720 align:middle line:10%
And he is burned out.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.470 align:middle line:10%
He is cynical.

00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:00.550 align:middle line:10%
He is not even searching
for joy anymore.

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:02.980 align:middle line:10%
He's searching for the
thing that will cause

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.360 align:middle line:10%
him the least amount of pain.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:05.660 align:middle line:90%
I work in a call center.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.600 align:middle line:84%
By the time I get
somebody on the phone,

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm usually catching
them on their worst day.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.990 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to a guy who is
living in his car with his kids.

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:15.760 align:middle line:84%
I talked to a lady who, as she
was speaking to me on the phone,

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.620 align:middle line:84%
the electric guy was
knocking at her door

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.040 align:middle line:90%
to come turn off her lights.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.850 align:middle line:84%
It can really wear on you to
take these phone calls one

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:22.670 align:middle line:90%
after the other.

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's starting to
affect me physically.

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you want him
to understand about that?

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:33.160 align:middle line:10%
>> He has some money that he
has been sitting on and he needs

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.230 align:middle line:10%
to make his investment soon.

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's his
way out of the job,

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:41.950 align:middle line:84%
in part is start making
investments and not letting

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:45.580 align:middle line:84%
the current job affect his
heart to the point of it causing

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:47.000 align:middle line:90%
physical harm.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:47.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Correct.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.600 align:middle line:10%
He can stay there
for a limited time.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:54.330 align:middle line:10%
Other than that, there is not
much more that he can do there.

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:55.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:56.340 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:59.330 align:middle line:84%
He would like to know what's
the significance of angel number

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:00.130 align:middle line:90%
856?

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:02.480 align:middle line:90%


00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.330 align:middle line:10%
>> As we dissect the numbers,
we hear the word 8 and we think

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:06.530 align:middle line:10%
octave.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.570 align:middle line:10%
Two things that go
by the same name

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.850 align:middle line:10%
but are not the same frequency.

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:13.010 align:middle line:10%
One tone sounds
like the other tone,

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:16.070 align:middle line:10%
but you can tell they're
different because one is higher.

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:20.690 align:middle line:10%
One is the lower self and
one is the higher self.

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:25.520 align:middle line:10%
One is the Earth self and
one is the higher self.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:29.930 align:middle line:10%
And we are reminding
him of that because he

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:34.640 align:middle line:10%
feels separated from
us with his doubt.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And what do you want him to
know so that he can feel that

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:39.140 align:middle line:90%
connection with you?

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.140 align:middle line:10%
>> We are not separate.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:41.630 align:middle line:10%
We are the same.

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:43.460 align:middle line:10%
We are one.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:45.330 align:middle line:84%
It was speaking a
musical language.

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:49.380 align:middle line:84%
So it said, here's the 8,
which represents the octave.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.320 align:middle line:90%
One is lower, one is higher.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.010 align:middle line:84%
We are the higher
version of you.

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:54.720 align:middle line:84%
You are the earthbound
version of you.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.570 align:middle line:90%
It was really mind-blowing.

00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:58.650 align:middle line:10%
The 5 and the 6, they make 11.

00:26:58.650 --> 00:26:59.970 align:middle line:10%
They do not make two.

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:04.460 align:middle line:10%
You cannot add 1 and 1 together
to become the 2 because the 2 is

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.670 align:middle line:10%
not your frequency.

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:07.260 align:middle line:10%
You are at the 11 frequency.

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.160 align:middle line:10%
That is your 11.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.110 align:middle line:10%
You are 11.

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>> 11 is a perfect number, and
it wanted him to understand his

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:16.910 align:middle line:90%
role in his own perfection.

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:21.950 align:middle line:10%
>> When you see the 856, we are
desperately reminding you that

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:23.700 align:middle line:10%
you are not separate.

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:26.346 align:middle line:10%


00:27:26.346 --> 00:27:30.305 align:middle line:10%
And we have to say to you
over and over and over again.

00:27:30.305 --> 00:27:32.910 align:middle line:10%


00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:33.800 align:middle line:10%
Do you get it now?

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.960 align:middle line:90%


00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for that.

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:41.820 align:middle line:84%
When he decided to have
this session today,

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:45.220 align:middle line:84%
what were you hoping that
he'd receive from it?

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:50.570 align:middle line:10%
>> We say move forward,
but you can only ever live

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:52.400 align:middle line:10%
in the present moment.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.190 align:middle line:10%
He cannot live in the past.

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:58.260 align:middle line:10%
No more rear view mirrors.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:27:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.830 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Can we just take a last
look at the body just

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:06.830 align:middle line:84%
to make sure healing
is complete for him?

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:08.350 align:middle line:84%
How is the right
knee looking now?

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:11.090 align:middle line:90%


00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:13.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Even we are surprised.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Once I actually made that
connection with the higher self

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:19.460 align:middle line:84%
about, we're going
to heal it, we're

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:22.280 align:middle line:84%
going to heal that for
you, then it really

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.990 align:middle line:90%
did start to feel better.

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:middle line:90%
Right now it doesn't hurt.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome back, rock star.

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:31.850 align:middle line:84%
How long does it feel like
that you've been laying there?

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>> About two hours.

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>> It's actually been three.

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:37.560 align:middle line:90%
We all hold all answers within.

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.880 align:middle line:84%
We all can heal ourselves and
we can all understand ourselves

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.040 align:middle line:84%
on a much deeper
level than we've ever

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.490 align:middle line:90%
given ourselves credit for.

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:49.775 align:middle line:90%
You have all answers inside you.

session, and I got to tell you,

00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:57.620 align:middle line:90%
I feel good.

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:58.550 align:middle line:90%
I feel peaceful.

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:00.560 align:middle line:90%
I feel relaxed.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:05.230 align:middle line:84%
I had torn my lateral
meniscus in a taekwondo injury

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:09.610 align:middle line:84%
and I have not had any knee
pain in the last two weeks.

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:13.550 align:middle line:84%
So I would call it a
miracle, to be quite frank.

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:17.020 align:middle line:84%
My day job, which
is pretty stressful,

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:20.830 align:middle line:84%
both mentally and physically,
it had come up in my session

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:24.160 align:middle line:84%
that I might just
very well die because

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.820 align:middle line:90%
of the stress of that job.

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:28.690 align:middle line:84%
I've gotten a lot of insight
about what my next step should

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:30.910 align:middle line:84%
be, some investment
opportunities,

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:32.570 align:middle line:84%
and I'm really
excited about that.

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:34.880 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to
say thank you, Suzanne.

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.040 align:middle line:84%
I definitely had a
journey into my soul

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.680 align:middle line:90%
and I'm excited for my future.
