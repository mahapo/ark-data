studied the Shisha Mecca nomads

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.510 align:middle line:10%
and Toltec culture, he
found that a specific cactus

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:36.540 align:middle line:10%
was venerated through rituals
from almost 2,500 years ago.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.940 align:middle line:10%
And she's been lost in the
desert for about four days,

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.330 align:middle line:10%
and so she hasn't
had food or water.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.600 align:middle line:84%
She hears this singing,
these voices singing,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.450 align:middle line:84%
telling her that she
is surrounded by water.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And that, if she would only eat
this medicine, that she could

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.610 align:middle line:84%
find her people, and that
she could deliver the child

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.970 align:middle line:90%
and be able to breastfeed.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.370 align:middle line:84%
She's dried out,
she has no milk,

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.730 align:middle line:90%
and she's about to give birth.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And so they tell her that
she can have an easy birth,

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:90%
and that her milk will flow.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.040 align:middle line:90%
So she asks, "Where are you?"

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And they said, "We're
this plant at your feet."

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.365 align:middle line:84%
And so she bites it off
the ground, like the deer.

00:03:29.365 --> 00:03:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And so she had learned
those original songs

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.940 align:middle line:90%

de Huántar, Peru, the oldest
archaeological evidence

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.580 align:middle line:84%

the Huachuma cactus.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.960 align:middle line:84%
Huachuma is a psychedelic
cactus containing

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.200 align:middle line:84%
the phenethylamine
alkaloid called mescaline,

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.930 align:middle line:84%
the same psychedelic
compound found in Peyote.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.660 align:middle line:84%
However, each of them
have several species

from different locations
with different sub-alkaloids

complements to the
effects of mescaline.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.540 align:middle line:84%
These psychoactive differences
create the plant's signature

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.510 align:middle line:84%
will produce different
percentages of alkaloids,

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.210 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, a different
entourage effect,

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.640 align:middle line:84%
making every plant unique
in effect and story.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Some are even believed to
have MAO inhibitors, which

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.010 align:middle line:84%
would keep the enzyme
that breaks down mescaline

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.400 align:middle line:84%
from being produced, accounting
for the long 8 to 12 hour

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.280 align:middle line:84%
and tell what the

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.280 align:middle line:84%
Is it even possible to
know what the plants want?

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.290 align:middle line:10%
>> One reason why cactus grow
needles is to prevent you from

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.270 align:middle line:10%
touching them.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is this really
ingenious method of protection,

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.210 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Cactus protect themselves
by covering themselves

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.430 align:middle line:90%
with needles.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.590 align:middle line:84%
But some cactus grow
needles in a way

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.500 align:middle line:90%
that allows you to touch them.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, the
cactus medicine

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:14.110 align:middle line:84%
has told me that this is
the cactus telling us,

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.250 align:middle line:90%
"Come in contact with me."

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.830 align:middle line:10%
And something that I've
observed is, the less

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.920 align:middle line:10%
the needle structure there is,
and the more blue that there

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.520 align:middle line:10%
is, the combination of those
things, the more medicine

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.970 align:middle line:10%
content that there is.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.030 align:middle line:84%
But this grew this
much in one year.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.920 align:middle line:84%
I can tell because this pinch
is when it grew the next year.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Then the head was somehow cut
off here or got knocked over,

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.090 align:middle line:84%
and it started growing fresh
new nodes out of this point.

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And these fresher nodes
that are newer, actually

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.730 align:middle line:84%
have more mescaline
content in them.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that from
the blue that they express,

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.150 align:middle line:90%
that kind of blue power.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Huachuma likely used
this kind of language

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.980 align:middle line:84%
to speak to the old Huachumeras
and Huachumeros, the medicine

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.300 align:middle line:84%
workers of this
particular plant.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:09.004 align:middle line:84%
This shamanic heritage dates
back into the ancient world.

00:07:09.004 --> 00:07:13.040 align:middle line:84%
The Huachuma carving found
at Chavin de Huántar is said

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.700 align:middle line:84%
to date back to
at least 1,500 BC.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.650 align:middle line:84%
It should be remembered
that though this

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.540 align:middle line:84%
is the earliest remnant pointing
to a psychedelic society

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.340 align:middle line:90%
in Peru--

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.500 align:middle line:90%
over 3,500 years ago--

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.050 align:middle line:84%
it is unlikely that the
use of this plant sacrament

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.380 align:middle line:84%
started right at the time that
the carving was constructed.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.430 align:middle line:10%
The sacred use of Huachuma could
date back considerably farther.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And like the kykeon beverage
in the Eleusinian Mysteries

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.690 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Greece, the temple
grounds of Chavin de Huántar

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:45.650 align:middle line:84%
was likely a spiritual mecca and
was equipped with a public area

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.620 align:middle line:84%
above the ground,
while the initiates--

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.830 align:middle line:84%
seeking universal mysteries--
were ushered into secret

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.560 align:middle line:90%
underground galleries.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.810 align:middle line:84%
They would likely
imbibe the Huachuma brew

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.420 align:middle line:84%
and undergo a transformational
psychedelic journey

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.870 align:middle line:90%
in these dimly lit halls.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Acoustic studies-- with the
help of Stanford University--

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.420 align:middle line:84%
were conducted and determined
that this underground labyrinth

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.090 align:middle line:84%
must have been constructed
for mind-altering sonic

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:14.570 align:middle line:84%
experiences, causing
the environment

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.240 align:middle line:84%
to come alive and play
tricks on the senses,

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.120 align:middle line:84%
as well as transport sound
to other areas of the temple

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.740 align:middle line:90%

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.950 align:middle line:84%

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.160 align:middle line:84%
into Central America
and present day

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Mexico, similar
artistic styles were

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.010 align:middle line:84%
found amongst ancient
cultures, including headdresses

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.050 align:middle line:84%
that plume from
the wearer's head,

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.940 align:middle line:84%
like the Indian
belief where the crown

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:12.770 align:middle line:84%
chakra is depicted with 1,000
petals of different colors.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:17.690 align:middle line:84%
This represents what is known
as the rising of the kundalini.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.360 align:middle line:10%
The origin myths of
psychedelic plants, as well as

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.190 align:middle line:10%
the art that
surrounded them, are

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:25.040 align:middle line:10%
too similar to dismiss
as coincidence.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Are these similarities
across time and geography

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.200 align:middle line:84%
from a common
origin of humankind

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.290 align:middle line:84%
or did the plants
impart the messages?

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>> People discovered how to
combine these plants through--

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:42.560 align:middle line:84%
basically with divination
with other plants.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, they
asked the plants--

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.440 align:middle line:84%
or through the plant
they ask the spirits--

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.050 align:middle line:90%
what are these other plants for?

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And as a group, it would be
shown different things, what

00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:00.380 align:middle line:90%
to do through our subconscious.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:04.460 align:middle line:84%
That's the datura
tree, tree datura.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.190 align:middle line:84%
So, that was the
plant, I believe,

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:12.290 align:middle line:84%
that showed how to make
these other concoctions.

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:17.660 align:middle line:84%
The datura taught people all
kinds of incredible things,

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.830 align:middle line:84%
like how to turn into
animals and how to fly.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:23.350 align:middle line:84%
In Middle East,
they flew on carpets

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:25.070 align:middle line:90%
and the witches flew on brooms.

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And that was the same exact
recipe with that plant.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And even in this
area, people would fly

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:35.000 align:middle line:90%
in baskets the very same way.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And also the story of
the werewolves too,

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:44.690 align:middle line:84%
that was the same plant and
pretty much the same recipe.

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:48.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Psychoactives like Datura,
and psychedelics like peyote,

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:52.250 align:middle line:10%
and even shamanic rituals may
be the common denominator behind

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.860 align:middle line:10%
the legends of
shapeshifting, flying,

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.440 align:middle line:10%
and other miraculous feats.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So, what that medicine is is,
it's medically turning the fork

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:09.590 align:middle line:84%
in your brain that allows
you to perceive sound, light,

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:15.790 align:middle line:84%
vibration, energy,
spirits, those things.

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:16.590 align:middle line:90%
It's a bridge.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:20.080 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the difference
between what we call

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:28.380 align:middle line:84%
hallucinating and
increased perception.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.870 align:middle line:10%
Hallucinating is when you're
seeing things that don't exist,

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:34.870 align:middle line:10%
which is also fun.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.990 align:middle line:10%
I think it's like imagining.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:41.860 align:middle line:84%
But increased perception allows
you to see things that exist

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:45.000 align:middle line:84%
but because your mind is
not trained to see them

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.150 align:middle line:84%
in normal activity,
the peyote helps you

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:49.530 align:middle line:90%
to see what's already there.

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:52.500 align:middle line:10%
Some of this is
this energetic body.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if anybody
studies the energetic body,

00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:00.450 align:middle line:84%
you know that there's a
magnetic design to it.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Just like if you put a magnet
underneath some iron filings,

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:10.960 align:middle line:84%
you'll see how the magnetic
force creates a pattern.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, every human being
has an energetic pattern.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes these
patterns are disrupted

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.540 align:middle line:84%
through what we
call diseases, which

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:26.580 align:middle line:84%
are imbalances or malfunctions
in the cellular structure.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.690 align:middle line:84%
So, peyote helps
you to see this.

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:33.990 align:middle line:10%
>> With peyote, I would be able
to see people's sicknesses.

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:37.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, if somebody was
clogged in their uterus,

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.610 align:middle line:84%
or clogged in their intestines,
or if they had spinal issues,

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:45.650 align:middle line:84%
or if their circulatory--
like, I would see these things.

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And in seeing them, it's
like I looked at the person

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.170 align:middle line:84%
and the thought would
come to my mind.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Seeing illness in people is
just one of the phenomena that

00:12:55.410 --> 00:13:01.290 align:middle line:84%
these peyoteros or huachumeras
claim to be capable of.

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Some even claim that peyote can
put you in touch with ancestors

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:09.600 align:middle line:84%
or give glimpses into the
raw nature of world issues

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.650 align:middle line:84%
without transporting you
to a foreign dimension.

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Daniel McQueen from
Medicinal Mindfulness

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:19.140 align:middle line:84%
recounts his experience with the
Native American Church peyote

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:20.670 align:middle line:90%
ceremonies.

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:23.340 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, while peyote
is a classic psychedelic,

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.460 align:middle line:10%
mescaline is a little different
than other psychedelics.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.010 align:middle line:10%
And you can have
visuals, you can

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:33.060 align:middle line:10%
have experiences of
engaging with spirits

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.950 align:middle line:10%
and communicating with
entities beyond this world.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:38.670 align:middle line:84%
But it's a little
different in that

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:42.780 align:middle line:84%
you can feel more lucid,
more clear, more present

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.390 align:middle line:90%
than you've ever felt before.

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:46.950 align:middle line:90%
And so it's kind of a paradox.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.230 align:middle line:84%
You can be incredibly
altered in the experience

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:54.810 align:middle line:84%
but also feel very, very
present in this world

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:58.206 align:middle line:90%
and engaged in this reality.

00:13:58.206 --> 00:13:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to
have the capacity

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:04.950 align:middle line:84%
to open up our frontal cortex,
our capacity to think clearly.

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:08.850 align:middle line:10%
And so instead of having
to sort through something,

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:11.310 align:middle line:10%
figure something out,
a complex problem

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:14.430 align:middle line:10%
out, or looking
for understanding,

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:15.480 align:middle line:10%
it's just right there.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.390 align:middle line:90%
It's just revealed to you.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:22.220 align:middle line:84%
>> The issues peyote or huachuma
introduced to those who drink

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:25.500 align:middle line:84%
are said to usually come
from our own subconscious,

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.260 align:middle line:84%
even if that issue is an
outer phenomena that we are

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.540 align:middle line:84%
struggling to come
to terms with,

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.660 align:middle line:84%
coming from the angle that
all events in the universe are

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:37.210 align:middle line:84%
intimately linked to
human consciousness.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And though the traditional use
of these plants cannot be put

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:43.390 align:middle line:84%
into one simple explanation,
the commonalities tend to be

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:46.660 align:middle line:84%
involved in community bonding
rather than isolated healing

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.250 align:middle line:90%
procedures.

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:54.355 align:middle line:84%
>> The use of this medicine has
always been a community event.

00:14:54.355 --> 00:14:58.540 align:middle line:84%
But if somebody needed healing
and they came to a road man,

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:04.780 align:middle line:84%
they could do it individually,
but that's more rare.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:09.100 align:middle line:84%
It's almost always done
in a community setting.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Clearly there were
ways in which the use

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:15.010 align:middle line:10%
of the psychedelics augmented
our ability to be moral

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:17.320 align:middle line:10%
individuals, to have
compassion for others,

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.560 align:middle line:10%
and to take action on behalf
of others that were not

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.120 align:middle line:10%
our immediate family members.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.000 align:middle line:84%
What we see in traditional
societies around the world

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.640 align:middle line:84%
is that they were
used for augmenting

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.610 align:middle line:84%
the effects of ritual,
enhancing bonding

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:33.040 align:middle line:84%
among members of the
community, and using

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.840 align:middle line:90%
these dynamics for healing.

of expanded or flow states

of consciousness brought
about by psychedelic plants,

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:44.170 align:middle line:10%
shamanic drumming and dancing,
or other methods seems to be

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.730 align:middle line:10%
the release of several
neurotransmitters,

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:50.890 align:middle line:10%
such as anandamide,
oxytocin, serotonin,

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:54.940 align:middle line:10%
and dopamine in varying amounts
depending on the method.

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.980 align:middle line:84%
These chemicals
on their own lend

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:01.450 align:middle line:84%
to feelings of closeness,
sensuality, relational bonding,

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:03.580 align:middle line:90%
and security.

hugging, and even eye contact.

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Even single-celled organisms
that had grouped together

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.950 align:middle line:84%
to become more
complex creatures had

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:19.390 align:middle line:84%
the impulse towards community
bonding for a higher cause.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:22.300 align:middle line:10%
And in this way, the
real shamanic medicine

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.550 align:middle line:10%
was understood to
be relationships,

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:27.220 align:middle line:10%
and the strength of the
group, and a great remembering

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:29.940 align:middle line:10%
of the deeper purposes of life.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And the relationships begin not
only with the human community,

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.400 align:middle line:84%
but the plant community
used to guide and protect

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.160 align:middle line:90%

they pray with cedar.

But most often, people
pray with tobacco,

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.790 align:middle line:84%
and then the medicine
would come around.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And everybody will have four
portions of the medicine,

00:16:55.150 --> 00:17:00.990 align:middle line:84%
and that would go around at
least four times in the night.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:03.690 align:middle line:84%
After we have the
medicine, then we

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.630 align:middle line:84%
get to sing with the

rather than trying to
show their individuality,

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:44.900 align:middle line:84%

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.030 align:middle line:10%
has shown that heart
rhythms in humans

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:15.180 align:middle line:10%
sync their pace to music,
showing that the heart listens

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.560 align:middle line:10%
to and responds to music.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Together this would cause
a group's nervous system

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:23.040 align:middle line:84%
and cardiac rhythms
to come into harmony.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.770 align:middle line:84%
Even in Silicon Valley,
startup companies

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:28.920 align:middle line:84%
have been toying with the idea
of using music and binaural

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.280 align:middle line:84%
beats in headphones to a group
while electrodes are scanning

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.110 align:middle line:84%
their brainwave
patterns, finding

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:37.290 align:middle line:84%
that the music brings their
mental states into synchrony.

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:38.880 align:middle line:90%
Why are they doing this?

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Because they find that
groups perform better

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.620 align:middle line:84%
when there's a form of
mental cohesion or a hive

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.090 align:middle line:90%
mind happening.

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Even high-level
military intelligence

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:51.120 align:middle line:84%
sees the importance of thinking
as a group with no leader

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.740 align:middle line:84%
except the one who
knows what to do next.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.460 align:middle line:84%
This may be the basis of all
human history's community

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.110 align:middle line:90%
rituals.

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:01.170 align:middle line:84%
But even though the medicine
is useful for community bonding

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:05.310 align:middle line:84%
and cultivating a hive-like
mind, the spirit of the cactus

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:09.180 align:middle line:84%
is differentiated from other
plant medicines like ayahuasca

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:12.240 align:middle line:84%
and sings a message from a
very particular and masculine

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.310 align:middle line:90%
standpoint.

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Ayahuasca has this
very feminine energy,

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:21.060 align:middle line:84%
where it's kind of
like she basically

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:25.560 align:middle line:84%
allows you to feel, and
have emotions, and be very

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.430 align:middle line:84%
watery in how you're
experiencing it,

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.690 align:middle line:84%
while peyote has a
very masculine energy.

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:35.750 align:middle line:84%
It's more like you're doing,
and you're making it happen.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And you know, even
in the prayer,

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.950 align:middle line:84%
because with ayahuasca the
songs are more romantic.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:42.830 align:middle line:90%
They're more organic.

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:47.412 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're both organic,
but they're more feminine.

00:19:47.412 --> 00:19:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And then with peyote,
the songs are more like--

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:49.725 align:middle line:90%
[VOCALIZING BEAT]

00:19:49.725 --> 00:19:52.020 align:middle line:84%
- because you're with
the drum the whole night.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.585 align:middle line:90%
So, it's literally a drum.

00:19:53.585 --> 00:19:57.260 align:middle line:84%
So, that sound is more masculine
sound, more physical sound.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:01.017 align:middle line:84%
And as a woman, it
definitely taught

00:20:01.017 --> 00:20:02.850 align:middle line:84%
me a lot of what it
means to be a woman when

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.710 align:middle line:84%
I was faced with so much
masculinity in that tee-pee.

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:08.470 align:middle line:84%
It taught me more
than I ever thought

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:13.440 align:middle line:84%
I would ever think I would be
taught by a masculine entity.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>> It is a belief among modern
psychonauts and neo-shamans

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:19.560 align:middle line:84%
that the planet has a
family tree of psychedelic

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.900 align:middle line:90%
and psychoactive plants.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.560 align:middle line:84%
Each one is here with a
specific message for us.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Plant medicine's role has
been the same for thousands

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:29.110 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:30.880 align:middle line:90%
It's to teach us.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And so these are
different teachers

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:37.440 align:middle line:84%
that are put here to give
us different lessons.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Earth has designed these
plants that are curing humanity

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:48.600 align:middle line:84%
because humanity is affecting
the functioning of the Earth

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.380 align:middle line:90%
as a living organism.

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.580 align:middle line:84%
So, the Earth needs
to protect itself.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:58.434 align:middle line:84%
So through these chemicals that
are contained in the peyote,

00:20:58.434 --> 00:21:01.040 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness of
the spirit of peyote

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:05.010 align:middle line:84%
is helping human
beings to cure and heal

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:08.920 align:middle line:90%
all of these society ailments.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Together, these plants
alter perception differently

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.670 align:middle line:84%
and offer deeply unique
and profound teachings,

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.250 align:middle line:84%
all to protect the
balance of life.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And this family tree of
psychedelic plant medicines

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:24.480 align:middle line:84%
is thought to tell a complete
story of human history,

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:28.020 align:middle line:84%
potential future, and
life's purpose to assist us

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.450 align:middle line:90%
in the coming turbulent days.

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is why medicine
spreads due to plant migration

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.750 align:middle line:90%
or human intervention.

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>> This medicine spread from
tribe to tribe all across North

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:43.770 align:middle line:84%
America, all the
way up into Canada,

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:47.970 align:middle line:84%
because people were
really desperate for help.

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And so some people
would say that it

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:52.860 align:middle line:84%
was prophesied
that it would come

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.650 align:middle line:90%
to them to help the people.

00:21:55.650 --> 00:22:00.810 align:middle line:84%
So, I believe that this medicine
is here to help the people.

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And just as in the
past, it helped

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:08.580 align:middle line:84%
us to integrate into European
culture and academic way

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.500 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Now it's also a way of
connecting back to your roots

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:20.970 align:middle line:84%
and connecting back to the
ancient ways of all people.

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>> But these cultures did more
than simply reconnect with

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:24.940 align:middle line:90%
the past.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.660 align:middle line:90%
They also foresaw the future.

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:30.570 align:middle line:84%
The fact that Western society
is becoming increasingly

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:32.820 align:middle line:84%
interested in
psychedelic substances

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.910 align:middle line:84%
and their historical
shamanic application

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:39.750 align:middle line:84%
is said by some to be signs of
an ancient prophecy believed

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:42.660 align:middle line:84%
to have stemmed from
Andean Quechua, New Mexican

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Hopi, Guatemalan,
Honduran, Ecuadorian Shuar,

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:48.930 align:middle line:90%
and Mexican Mayan cultures.

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:51.870 align:middle line:90%


00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The ancients foresaw
the coming of the Europeans

00:22:55.770 --> 00:23:00.000 align:middle line:84%
and the destruction of
civilization as we know it.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.740 align:middle line:84%
But they also
foresaw the time when

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:12.120 align:middle line:84%
the culture of the indigenous
people was going to reemerge.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And part of the culture of
native people inherent in all

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:22.470 align:middle line:84%
of this is the use
of plants to create

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:27.390 align:middle line:84%
a higher level of consciousness
for the human societies.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was also
predicted that 500 years

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:39.630 align:middle line:84%
after the initial
onslaught of Christianity

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:44.910 align:middle line:84%
and European colonization, a
new time was going to come,

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:48.840 align:middle line:84%
which is the time
we are living now.

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And this was referred
to as the Prophecy

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:57.260 align:middle line:90%
of the Condor and the Eagle.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:01.940 align:middle line:10%
>> And a lot of people see
it as a spiritual thing

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.490 align:middle line:10%
that's happening, which is
definitely what's happening

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:09.950 align:middle line:10%
with the Native American Church
because it's just as strong

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:13.010 align:middle line:10%
in South America as it
is in North America now.

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:14.840 align:middle line:84%
But another part
of that prophecy,

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.060 align:middle line:84%
the next part of
that, is that they

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:20.270 align:middle line:84%
would soar as one, that
the eagle and condor would

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:22.960 align:middle line:90%
soar as one.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And that can be interpreted
in many different ways.

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:33.400 align:middle line:84%
But I think amongst most
people in spiritual circles,

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:37.240 align:middle line:84%
they see that as a spiritual
unification of the people.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.910 align:middle line:90%


00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:42.700 align:middle line:84%
The prophecy is said to
foretell of a pachacuti,

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:46.450 align:middle line:84%
or 500-year period, in which
the eagle, which represents

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:48.900 align:middle line:84%
the people of the northern
hemisphere that walked

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:52.150 align:middle line:84%
the industrial, mental,
and masculine path,

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:54.970 align:middle line:84%
would bring about a
near-extinction of the condor,

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.640 align:middle line:84%
representing the people of
the southern hemisphere that

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.110 align:middle line:84%
follow the heart
and are connected

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:01.390 align:middle line:84%
with traditional
ways of the Earth.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Followers of the
prophecy see this

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:06.280 align:middle line:84%
as having come true at the
time of the Spanish conquest

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.290 align:middle line:84%
of the New World
shamanic and indigenous

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:10.810 align:middle line:90%
cultures around 1490.

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:12.730 align:middle line:84%
However, the prophecy
also foretold

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:15.580 align:middle line:84%
of a reunification of
the eagle and condor,

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:21.090 align:middle line:84%
starting at the end of
the pachacuti in 1990.

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:23.670 align:middle line:84%
A striking development in
the unification of people

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:28.000 align:middle line:84%
globally is the exchange
of ideas and values.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.760 align:middle line:84%
This has never been
as prevalent as it

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.800 align:middle line:84%
was with the advent
of the internet,

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:34.350 align:middle line:84%
and this revolutionary
communication technology

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:38.970 align:middle line:84%
became publicly available
on August 6th of 1991.

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:41.220 align:middle line:10%
Many skeptics have
disregarded and debunked

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:47.330 align:middle line:10%
the details of this prophecy,
while all along, the remaining

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:49.370 align:middle line:10%
indigenous of the
original tribes

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:51.290 align:middle line:10%
carry on the belief
that regardless

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:54.620 align:middle line:10%
of the skepticism, the
prophecy is in motion

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.950 align:middle line:10%
and a revival of
shamanic traditions

00:25:56.950 --> 00:26:02.390 align:middle line:10%
and interest among even the
Western world is growing.

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And signs of this
shift in consciousness

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:07.550 align:middle line:84%
may also be appearing in pop
cultural trends returning

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:09.500 align:middle line:90%
to nature-based activities.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:12.080 align:middle line:10%
Exercise rituals of
just a few decades ago

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.630 align:middle line:10%
are being revisioned
in a natural setting,

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:18.110 align:middle line:10%
linking the body and mind
back to these spaces.

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Dietary trends are looking
back into ancestral traditions

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:24.830 align:middle line:84%
that predate colonial
grain-based diets.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Workshops are popping up around
the world with catchwords

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:31.850 align:middle line:84%
like rewilding, primal,
ancestral, and shamanic.

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Could this be a
sign of the times,

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:36.590 align:middle line:84%
that the innate balancing
intelligence of the collective

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:41.060 align:middle line:84%
senses the need for uniting
with our roots once more?

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>> We're reaching the point
where human beings are really

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:50.800 align:middle line:84%
changing drastically, and we're
becoming more intelligent.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:55.320 align:middle line:84%
We're learning more, but we're
also becoming very conditioned

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.860 align:middle line:84%
and becoming domesticated,
very literally.

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the difference
between a domesticated animal

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:06.550 align:middle line:84%
and a wild animal, even
how different medicines

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:12.280 align:middle line:84%
and substances can have a
very different effect on both.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And one of my
concerns has always

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:19.260 align:middle line:84%
been that we're losing
touch with our wild selves.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:23.430 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very important that
the human race in the future

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:28.530 align:middle line:84%
stay in touch with our roots,
and where we come from,

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:32.580 align:middle line:84%
and what we really are rather
than thinking that we're just

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:35.820 align:middle line:90%
some kind of biological robots.

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's very
important, the role

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:45.120 align:middle line:84%
of the sacred sacrament
of the herb peyote

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.000 align:middle line:84%
and also these
other medicines that

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.680 align:middle line:84%
come from different traditions
to understand who they really

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:56.139 align:middle line:84%
are and where they come
from, that we are animals

00:27:56.139 --> 00:27:57.180 align:middle line:90%
that come from the Earth.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:00.480 align:middle line:90%


00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.720 align:middle line:84%
What if the missing puzzle
piece to harmony on this planet

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.510 align:middle line:84%
is missing because of the
civilized, cultural concept

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:08.580 align:middle line:90%
we're fed from birth?

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:10.650 align:middle line:10%
The trend in the
West has unmistakably

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.950 align:middle line:10%
been a focus on technology
and human innovation that

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:17.940 align:middle line:10%
tends to alter nature, push
it out, subdue and enslave

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:21.300 align:middle line:10%
the natural world, and
bend it to our human will,

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:24.600 align:middle line:10%
The same will that believes
animals living in factory farms

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.910 align:middle line:10%
will yield the same
quality meat as those

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:30.240 align:middle line:10%
that live in their
natural, thriving habitat.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.480 align:middle line:84%
The same will that believes that
monocultured and low-dynamic

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.380 align:middle line:84%
environments will yield
the same quality crops as

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:38.040 align:middle line:84%
would appear in
their native homes

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.980 align:middle line:84%
in connection with
all other life forms.

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:44.250 align:middle line:84%
Does this medicine illuminate
the social sickness of amnesia

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:46.830 align:middle line:84%
towards our past
and hypnotic awe

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:49.950 align:middle line:84%
at our flashy and
convenience-driven future?

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:53.220 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps this is why peyote
ceremonies still to this day

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.440 align:middle line:10%
are typically conducted
in tee-pees, which

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.690 align:middle line:10%
seat the participants
on the earth,

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.300 align:middle line:10%
with fire, and prayer,
and community holding

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:03.510 align:middle line:10%
intentions of healing
rather than the sterilized,

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:06.360 align:middle line:10%
nature-free clinics and
hospitals with synthetic

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.150 align:middle line:10%
and compound isolated
meds intended to be

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:11.850 align:middle line:10%
taken and forgotten about.

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:15.810 align:middle line:84%
Healing practices have
never before been that way.

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Psychedelic plants, like
peyote and huachuma,

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:21.480 align:middle line:84%
are impossible to forget
about after ingesting

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:24.180 align:middle line:84%
because the relationship
between their chemical makeup

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:28.110 align:middle line:84%
and our neurochemistry causes
a journey of engagement,

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:31.980 align:middle line:84%
attention, processing, and
coming to terms with all

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:36.390 align:middle line:84%
that we are and all that
is no longer serving us.

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:39.090 align:middle line:84%
There is no tuning out or
ignoring your subconscious

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:42.360 align:middle line:90%
under these shamanic states.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps if we engage
with these medicines

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:48.900 align:middle line:84%
or other natural methods of
expanding one's conscious state

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.270 align:middle line:84%
and honor and respect the
cultures that have long

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:56.880 align:middle line:84%
done this good work to integrate
and bond with our community,

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.820 align:middle line:84%
then maybe, just
maybe, the prophecy

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:03.450 align:middle line:84%
of the eagle and condor will be
seen as more than lofty hopes

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:07.140 align:middle line:84%
and dreams but as a
return to the sanity

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:11.220 align:middle line:90%
of wild, ancestral nature.

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Up next, join us as we
investigate human's history

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:19.650 align:middle line:84%
with cannabis, humanity's oldest
cultivated crop, providing food

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:22.800 align:middle line:84%
medicine, and even
connection with the divine.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:27.600 align:middle line:90%
