biblical scholars,

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.260 align:middle line:90%
he visited the New World.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.330 align:middle line:84%
Anthropological
evidence suggests

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.150 align:middle line:84%
that our ancestors possessed
a much deeper knowledge

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.790 align:middle line:84%
of these plants
and integrated them

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.310 align:middle line:90%
into their spiritual lives.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:16.100 align:middle line:10%
>> From what we know, starting
with all the way back with cave

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.700 align:middle line:10%
paintings, psychedelics
have been used really since

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:24.410 align:middle line:10%
the beginning of humanity all
over the world by indigenous

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.870 align:middle line:10%
peoples everywhere.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>> To better understand the
effects of these plants,

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.840 align:middle line:84%
these cultures relied on a
teacher to guide them through

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.310 align:middle line:84%
these healing
experiences, a shaman.

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.860 align:middle line:84%
In the Western world,
the word conjures

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.470 align:middle line:84%
images of wizards
or witch doctors

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.140 align:middle line:84%
casting magic spells
in a Hollywood movie.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.930 align:middle line:84%
But the very real
practice of shamanism

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.620 align:middle line:84%
exists in different cultures
and belief systems dating back

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.100 align:middle line:90%
thousands of years.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Though some say that
shamanism goes back as far

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.210 align:middle line:10%
as the Stone Age and that
Siberia was the origin

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.880 align:middle line:10%
of the practice,
but throughout time,

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.780 align:middle line:10%
they have served the role of
connecting humans to the spirit

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:10.240 align:middle line:10%
world and for
healing individuals

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.860 align:middle line:10%
and the communities.

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Often, the shaman will
use plant medicine

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.890 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate their
opening of consciousness,

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:22.165 align:middle line:84%
to be the intermediary of
this energy and information.

00:10:22.165 --> 00:10:25.510 align:middle line:10%
>> But I believe at
the end, it's an art,

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:30.010 align:middle line:10%
a philosophy that works with
the two most powerful tools that

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:31.480 align:middle line:10%
impact human consciousness.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.740 align:middle line:10%
And these two tools are
chemicals in plants, compounds,

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:39.700 align:middle line:10%
and music or sound
in general to reveal

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:44.860 align:middle line:10%
the nature of our consciousness,
to create therapy, healing,

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.790 align:middle line:10%
inner education,
rehabilitation, empowerment,

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.100 align:middle line:10%
and being part of the
collective harmony

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.490 align:middle line:10%
that is on Earth and part
of the intelligence that

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:55.450 align:middle line:10%
is part of Earth.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:59.470 align:middle line:10%
>> The role of the shaman is
actually something unique.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:03.310 align:middle line:10%
It's different than, let's
say, just a medicine person.

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:05.590 align:middle line:84%
The role of the
shaman is to have

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:08.800 align:middle line:84%
one foot in each world,
the visible world

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.790 align:middle line:90%
and the invisible world.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And in doing that,
there is journeying.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:18.670 align:middle line:84%
There is negotiating
with spirits

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:23.200 align:middle line:84%
and there is healing, bringing
people's soul fragments back.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.700 align:middle line:84%
There's retrieving
information that the community

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:31.390 align:middle line:84%
needs for hunts
or for preparation

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.920 align:middle line:90%
or for healing the community.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:37.303 align:middle line:90%


00:11:37.303 --> 00:11:41.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible that ancient
people knew the intelligence

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.280 align:middle line:90%
of these plants?

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Plants predate humans by
hundreds of millions of years.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And to many ancient
people, they are

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:52.010 align:middle line:84%
considered the very
foundation of our survival

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:53.930 align:middle line:90%
as a human race.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Simply put, the
ancients understood

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:00.080 align:middle line:84%
that humans need them
more than they need us.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And this understanding
drove many ancient cultures

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:06.140 align:middle line:84%
to make medicines
from certain plants.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Lists of herbs have been
found on Sumerian clay tablets

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.890 align:middle line:90%
dating back to 1550 BCE.

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.410 align:middle line:84%
Opium is among
the plants listed,

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:18.470 align:middle line:84%
confirming that early
civilizations already

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:20.600 align:middle line:84%
had a deep
understanding of plants'

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.590 align:middle line:90%
various medicinal capabilities.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:25.910 align:middle line:84%
There is even a
special class of plants

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:28.430 align:middle line:84%
that produce psychedelic
compounds, which

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:32.900 align:middle line:84%
reliably provide visionary
moments of awakening.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Today, one particular
region has become ubiquitous

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:40.370 align:middle line:90%
with ceremonial use, the Amazon.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Winding through nine
South American countries,

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.500 align:middle line:84%
this mighty river
is the heart of one

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.790 align:middle line:84%
of the most diverse and complex
ecosystems on the planet.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:53.930 align:middle line:84%
It is here that indigenous
people harvest chacruna leaf,

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:58.640 align:middle line:84%
chagropanga vine, and ayahuasca
vine to make a ceremonial

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.750 align:middle line:84%
psychedelic brew called
yagé, better known today

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:05.120 align:middle line:90%
as ayahuasca.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.220 align:middle line:84%
The effects of
ayahuasca are often

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:12.110 align:middle line:84%
described as visual and auditory
hallucinations and periods

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:14.990 align:middle line:84%
of deep psychological
introspection.

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And they are often left
with a sense of illumination

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:22.340 align:middle line:84%
that they experienced something
revelatory about the world

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.280 align:middle line:90%
and about themselves.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.840 align:middle line:84%
The primary active ingredient in
ayahuasca is a compound called

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:35.480 align:middle line:84%
N,N-dimethyltryptamine, more
commonly referred to as DMT.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Although DMT is the
primary psychoactive

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.700 align:middle line:84%
compound in the
brew, the ayahuasca

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.430 align:middle line:84%
vine itself does
not contain any.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:46.310 align:middle line:84%
Rather, it contains
enzymes that act

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:49.670 align:middle line:84%
as MAO inhibitors,
which make the DMT found

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:52.520 align:middle line:90%
in chacruna orally active.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.100 align:middle line:84%
The ayahuasca vine is
mixed with the leaves

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:59.780 align:middle line:84%
of the other psychoactive plants
that prolong the DMT's effects,

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:03.290 align:middle line:84%
stretching the associated
hallucinations from a mere 20

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:06.050 align:middle line:90%
minutes to several hours.

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:08.240 align:middle line:84%
According to the
shamans and adepts,

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.850 align:middle line:84%
this beverage allows
someone without the training

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.610 align:middle line:84%
of a shaman to journey
into spirit realms

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:18.480 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with ancients
or to heal personal trauma.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.720 align:middle line:84%
Although a lot of people have
tried a psychedelic journey,

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.000 align:middle line:84%
there are only a few
that are able to connect

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.310 align:middle line:90%
to their ancient past.

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:29.460 align:middle line:84%
Located along the
Ucayali River in Peru,

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:33.850 align:middle line:84%
an indigenous Amazonian group
still engages in this practice.

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:36.840 align:middle line:84%
They are called
the Shipibo-Conibo.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.790 align:middle line:84%
They have maintained
deep connections

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:40.920 align:middle line:84%
to their traditional
past despite

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.350 align:middle line:84%
the ongoing encroachment
of modern society.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.080 align:middle line:84%
It is this group
that feels they were

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:49.860 align:middle line:84%
told by the gods in their
dreams to find these plants

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.420 align:middle line:90%
and share them in the community.

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:54.930 align:middle line:10%
>> There are many different
legends and versions of how

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:56.670 align:middle line:10%
ayahuasca was discovered.

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.710 align:middle line:10%
And the Shipibo culture,
through the people

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:01.050 align:middle line:10%
that I've interacted
with, they talk

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:03.900 align:middle line:10%
about that they received
instructions in dreams

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.080 align:middle line:10%
about how to go and seek
these particular plants out,

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.840 align:middle line:10%
how to hook them together,
and how to utilize them so

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.780 align:middle line:10%
that the ideas that through
their direct connection

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:17.730 align:middle line:10%
living in nature, that they
received information, possibly

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:18.972 align:middle line:10%
through dreams.

00:15:18.972 --> 00:15:20.430 align:middle line:10%
And that's what
guided the process.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:23.490 align:middle line:10%
>> When they ingested them and
teaching them many survival

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:27.570 align:middle line:10%
skills, not only to
improve their health

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:31.020 align:middle line:10%
or their connection with
nature but also rituals to bond

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:34.770 align:middle line:10%
the community together and to
facilitate their communion with

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:38.575 align:middle line:10%
expanded states of awareness.

00:15:38.575 --> 00:15:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Although the ayahuasca
plant might be connected with

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.790 align:middle line:84%
an ancient practice and
possibly to the gods,

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:49.000 align:middle line:84%
modern-day doctors are taking
up studies and practices

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.170 align:middle line:84%
of their own, on not only
ayahuasca but other forms

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:54.910 align:middle line:90%
of these plant medicines.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:57.430 align:middle line:10%
Could it be possible
that science can open up

00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:01.510 align:middle line:10%
what is really happening to us
while ingesting these plants?

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Doctor Rick Strassman
of the University

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:07.540 align:middle line:84%
of New Mexico School
of Medicine speculated

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:12.310 align:middle line:84%
that DMT is created
endogenously by the pineal gland

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:17.650 align:middle line:84%
and reliably destabilizes the
patterning in the brain, thus

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:21.675 align:middle line:84%
opening the mind to deeper
realities and possibilities.

00:16:21.675 --> 00:16:26.140 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the things that's
unique about DMT is that it

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:30.910 align:middle line:10%
seems to get one into a state
where there's an intelligence.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And so there's been a lot of
speculation as to what that

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:36.550 align:middle line:84%
might be, might it
be extradimensional

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:39.820 align:middle line:84%
beings or might it
just be the activation

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.460 align:middle line:90%
of certain areas of the brain.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:46.090 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a mystery why
most plants, human beings,

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:51.760 align:middle line:10%
animals have endogenous
DMT and MAOI,

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.010 align:middle line:10%
monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:57.640 align:middle line:84%
These are chemicals that would
inhibit these enzymes that

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.090 align:middle line:90%
break down DMT.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:04.390 align:middle line:84%
I think that's possibly to
inform us of what reality is,

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:08.170 align:middle line:84%
and maybe they're
involved in our dreams

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:12.490 align:middle line:84%
in the mystical state
but also healing

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.040 align:middle line:84%
different aspects of
the self and keeping

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.410 align:middle line:84%
us tied to the spiritual
aspect of being.

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:20.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Research conducted
by Jimo Borjigin,

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:24.250 align:middle line:10%
a pineal gland researcher at
the University of Michigan

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:28.910 align:middle line:10%
discovered the presence of DMT
in the pineal gland as well

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:31.880 align:middle line:10%
as in the hippocampus
and neocortex,

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.250 align:middle line:10%
involved in higher
order brain function,

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:36.380 align:middle line:10%
like learning and memory.

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.510 align:middle line:84%
But DMT levels
were believed to be

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:41.400 align:middle line:84%
too low to have a
discernible effect.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.120 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.880 align:middle line:84%
Those that have
studied DMT speculate

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.340 align:middle line:84%
that our ancestors may
have naturally produced

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.950 align:middle line:84%
higher levels of
DMT, which could

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:55.970 align:middle line:84%
have helped them maintain a
deeper connection with nature.

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Today, we may be unintentionally
inhibiting our body's ability

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:01.630 align:middle line:90%
to produce DMT.

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Unlike our ancestors,
we subject ourselves

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:08.630 align:middle line:84%
to a slew of unnatural
processes and substances.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.440 align:middle line:84%
One possible
culprit is fluoride,

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.440 align:middle line:84%
which has been added to some
towns' and cities' drinking

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.210 align:middle line:90%
water for decades.

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:18.880 align:middle line:10%
Ostensibly used to
protect our teeth,

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.790 align:middle line:10%
this fluoride may be
calcifying within our body.

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:25.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Our modern diets definitely
have an effect on our health

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.130 align:middle line:10%
and our state of mind.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:31.690 align:middle line:10%
And we have found that
fluoride has a calcifying

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.760 align:middle line:10%
effect on the pineal gland.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.210 align:middle line:84%
Pineal gland is associated
with the production and release

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:39.970 align:middle line:84%
of serotonin, which
helps us feel good;

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:44.380 align:middle line:84%
melatonin, which helps us
sleep; and dimethyltryptamine,

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.080 align:middle line:84%
which is associated with
mystical or expanded states

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.110 align:middle line:90%
of awareness.

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:51.310 align:middle line:84%
So the calcification of
this gland, that one factor

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:56.581 align:middle line:84%
alone can inhibit our
experience of mystical states.

00:18:56.581 --> 00:18:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>> It doesn't end there.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Other obstacles stand in the
way of the pineal gland's

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.890 align:middle line:90%
abilities.

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:06.970 align:middle line:84%
Wi-Fi radiation is also on
the rise across the planet.

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:10.180 align:middle line:84%
These frequencies can cause
inflammatory responses

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.760 align:middle line:84%
and abnormal
development in the body.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>> We're surrounded with
wireless frequencies that have

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:20.360 align:middle line:84%
been shown to affect negatively
many things in the body

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:24.070 align:middle line:84%
including pineal function,
so we face many challenges.

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:26.890 align:middle line:84%
But with the assistance
of plant medicines,

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:30.580 align:middle line:84%
we can hopefully get all of
these endocrine glands flowing

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:35.560 align:middle line:84%
again, so we can have naturally
occurring mystical experiences.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Despite all of the
advancements in technology

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:42.640 align:middle line:84%
and modern science, do we
actually live in a world that

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.660 align:middle line:84%
has become less optimal for
human health and connection?

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.090 align:middle line:10%
>> We're getting too
immersed in our technology,

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:52.960 align:middle line:10%
and what we sacrifice is the
closer connection with nature.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:57.970 align:middle line:84%
I think the shamans are
very attuned to the effects

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:00.220 align:middle line:84%
that the people of
the merchandise,

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:04.270 align:middle line:84%
they call us sometimes,
are having on the planet,

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:06.280 align:middle line:84%
that we're decimating
the resources,

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.890 align:middle line:84%
we're overharvesting
even ayahuasca.

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:10.850 align:middle line:90%
So there are a lot of pressure.

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.660 align:middle line:84%
So I think their
intuition is certainly

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:18.490 align:middle line:84%
that there is a planetary
ecological crisis going on.

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:22.120 align:middle line:10%
>> On one hand, we have
the technology that we live

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:25.990 align:middle line:10%
in our Western society that
we use on a daily basis.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And that technology
separates us from connecting.

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And in the natural world,
we have technology.

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.900 align:middle line:84%
We have these powerful
morphogenic fields all

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.780 align:middle line:90%
around us that we can tap into.

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:43.420 align:middle line:84%
We can also use
ceremony, ritual,

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:48.950 align:middle line:84%
invocation to access certain
levels of intelligence.

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:51.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's through the
use of plant medicines

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:54.580 align:middle line:84%
and through the study of
ancestral technologies

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.700 align:middle line:84%
that we're able to get
all of those things

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:02.020 align:middle line:84%
without actually having to use
these devices that cause us

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.458 align:middle line:90%
to seek outside of ourselves.

00:21:05.458 --> 00:21:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though most are
derived from plants,

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:12.340 align:middle line:84%
our medicines can also
contribute to our disconnection

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:13.915 align:middle line:90%
from consciousness.

00:21:13.915 --> 00:21:17.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Most pharmaceuticals
are derived from plants.

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:22.450 align:middle line:10%
And typically, what happens is
that the researchers will zero

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:26.410 align:middle line:10%
in on the one most
potent compounds that

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:30.640 align:middle line:10%
has the action that they
want physiologically.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.280 align:middle line:84%
But plants have
thousands and thousands

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.870 align:middle line:90%
of compounds that are complex.

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And what that complexity
means is that the side effects

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.150 align:middle line:84%
are less, that our bodies
have evolved to have this very

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:44.950 align:middle line:90%
profound kind of healing.

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:49.360 align:middle line:84%
When we just try to focus
in on the one compound

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.760 align:middle line:84%
and sort of sledgehammer
ourselves with that,

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.060 align:middle line:84%
then we end up causing
a lot of side effects.

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:58.434 align:middle line:90%


00:21:58.434 --> 00:22:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>> How did we wind up here?

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:04.320 align:middle line:84%
How have we allowed
technology to intrude

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.290 align:middle line:90%
so much on our spirituality?

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps warnings
were there, waiting

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.720 align:middle line:90%
to be discovered all along.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:17.040 align:middle line:90%


00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Nag Hammadi, Egypt,
1945, a collection

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:27.210 align:middle line:84%
of ancient papyrus texts are
discovered in an earthen jar.

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:30.240 align:middle line:84%
The writings were poetic
reflections and poems

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.830 align:middle line:84%
covering philosophy, personal
spiritual knowledge, mysticism,

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:37.500 align:middle line:90%
and the origins of the universe.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:41.070 align:middle line:10%
Treated as heresy by the
Orthodox Christian Church,

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:45.330 align:middle line:10%
these texts came to be known
as the Gnostic Gospels.

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:48.990 align:middle line:84%
The Gospels speak of archons,
malevolent and powerful

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:52.020 align:middle line:84%
demonic beings that could
control the thoughts

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.270 align:middle line:90%
and actions of humans.

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:58.350 align:middle line:84%
The archons were deeply feared
by the ancients for the chaos

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:00.390 align:middle line:90%
and suffering they could bring.

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:03.690 align:middle line:84%
Could they represent some of
the oppressive systems that

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:06.480 align:middle line:90%
influence modern-day society?

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.120 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the Gnostic
Gospels were actually

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.360 align:middle line:84%
warning us of forces that
are now pushing us away

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.340 align:middle line:90%
from spiritual consciousness.

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>> If you go beyond
the realms of form,

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:21.300 align:middle line:84%
you're dealing with different
states of consciousness.

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:25.380 align:middle line:10%
One of the names
given to this force

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:31.860 align:middle line:10%
is archons or archontic, which
comes from the Gnostic belief

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.880 align:middle line:10%
system.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And this archontic awareness
is extremely psychopathic,

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:46.310 align:middle line:84%
extremely distorting, and
it's distorting the reality

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.330 align:middle line:90%
that we are living in.

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't hold your
consciousness, awareness

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:56.690 align:middle line:84%
in that balanced state and
therefore, not get pulled in,

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:59.060 align:middle line:90%
it will pull you in.

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.160 align:middle line:84%
That's what's happened
in this world.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:06.440 align:middle line:10%
>> We collectively have
accrued, amassed so much trauma.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And that trauma
has caused us to,

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:12.940 align:middle line:84%
in general, be
very disassociated.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Because we are disconnected,
we give our power away

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.270 align:middle line:90%
unknowingly.

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And this power has been so
readily taken and received

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:27.670 align:middle line:84%
by other forces that
are utilizing it.

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:31.090 align:middle line:84%
It is a collective
consciousness that

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:35.350 align:middle line:84%
has been empowered
through our own choices

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:39.012 align:middle line:90%
and our own ignorance.

00:24:39.012 --> 00:24:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this an external
battle between good and evil,

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:46.520 align:middle line:84%
or rather, an internal
war between our thoughts

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:49.730 align:middle line:84%
and our perceptions
of separation?

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Do origin stories such
as the expulsion of Eden

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:57.290 align:middle line:84%
suggest the loss of oneness at
the expense of higher cognitive

00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:59.050 align:middle line:90%
function?

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Ethnobotanist Terence
McKenna posited

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:04.420 align:middle line:84%
that our departure
from primate to human

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:06.820 align:middle line:84%
began with the
consumption of fungi.

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:10.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Terence McKenna in his
book "Food of the Gods"

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:14.860 align:middle line:10%
talks about the descent
of humans from the trees

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:18.550 align:middle line:10%
into foraging on the ground
below and discovering

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:22.270 align:middle line:10%
psilocybin mushrooms growing
out of bovine patties.

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:25.720 align:middle line:84%
These mushrooms sharpen
eyesight and hearing,

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.060 align:middle line:84%
and they also facilitate
expanded awareness

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.430 align:middle line:84%
that he believes were
instrumental in the development

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:32.230 align:middle line:90%
of language.

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:36.520 align:middle line:10%
>> The mushrooms grow in
the manure of the cattle.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:42.370 align:middle line:10%
When the hunting packs of
early primates followed along

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:45.340 align:middle line:10%
behind the cattle,
they inevitably

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:48.640 align:middle line:10%
encountered the
mushroom, ate it,

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.480 align:middle line:10%
had their visual skills
thereby increased.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:57.460 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many other cultures
that refer to plant medicine,

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:02.410 align:middle line:84%
such as ayahuasca or psilocybin,
as communicating with them when

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:05.740 align:middle line:84%
they ingested them and teaching
them many survival skills,

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:11.380 align:middle line:84%
not only to improve their health
or their connection with nature

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.410 align:middle line:84%
but also rituals to bond
the community together

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:17.560 align:middle line:84%
and to facilitate their
communion with expanded states

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.480 align:middle line:90%
of awareness.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:23.470 align:middle line:84%
>> These alternative theories
of human evolution additionally

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:27.400 align:middle line:84%
call into question the theory
of natural selection and how we

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.250 align:middle line:84%
see ourselves in the
evolutionary story.

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:35.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Symbiosis, this relationship
between species for mutual

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.740 align:middle line:10%
benefit, this is what
drives evolution.

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:43.930 align:middle line:84%
It's what drives life on
the planet, a cooperation

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:47.410 align:middle line:84%
rather than competition
and survival of the fittest

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:49.810 align:middle line:90%
of that whole Darwinian model.

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:52.600 align:middle line:84%
That's an older way
of looking at things.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:57.160 align:middle line:84%
Competition happens for sure,
but it's much less important

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.270 align:middle line:90%
in the grand scheme of things.

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:03.520 align:middle line:84%
We've got to wake up to the
fact that we are out of harmony

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.840 align:middle line:90%
with nature.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And then we have to
wise up in the sense

again?

00:27:39.745 --> 00:27:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Ayahuasca has potentially
many physiological benefits,

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:48.060 align:middle line:84%
and DMT is only a
part of the picture.

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.450 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the ayahuasca
vine itself contains

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:54.290 align:middle line:10%
the beta-Carbolines, which
recent research shows

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:59.390 align:middle line:10%
that these beta-Carbolines, they
seem to stimulate neurogenesis.

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:03.470 align:middle line:84%
They actually stimulate
production of new neurons

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:07.200 align:middle line:84%
and formation of new
connections in the brain,

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.770 align:middle line:84%
particularly with the
hippocampus, which of course,

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:12.560 align:middle line:90%
is where memory is and trained.

the healing that so
many experience suggests

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:31.880 align:middle line:84%
ayahuasca's potential is worth
exploring, especially for cases

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:35.180 align:middle line:84%
where traditional treatments
have been ineffective.

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:37.880 align:middle line:84%
With legal roadblocks
slowing progress,

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:41.360 align:middle line:84%
only a few clinical
studies have taken place.

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:44.720 align:middle line:10%
One completed study found that
for participants suffering

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:48.440 align:middle line:10%
from reoccurring depression,
a single dose of ayahuasca

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:52.190 align:middle line:10%
provided long-lasting
antidepressant effects.

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:55.790 align:middle line:84%
Another study tracked the
effect ayahuasca had on patients

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:57.590 align:middle line:90%
during a six-month period.

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:59.810 align:middle line:84%
According to the
study, they displayed

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:02.360 align:middle line:84%
improved mental health
and an acceptance

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.860 align:middle line:90%
of emotional independence.

>> Psychedelics, I feel, could
be an emergency dispensation

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:18.770 align:middle line:84%
to get us to wake up and take
better care of this Earth

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:21.335 align:middle line:84%
and learn to find
ways to harmonize.

00:29:21.335 --> 00:29:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Psychedelics can
enhance this awakening,

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:27.770 align:middle line:84%
but we need to learn to use
them as a tool without expecting

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:30.740 align:middle line:84%
them to heal us because
it's about a rehabilitation.

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:32.990 align:middle line:84%
It's about an alchemical
transformation.

connect to the medicines,

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:40.380 align:middle line:90%
we start to merge with nature.

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
over time, we start

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:47.900 align:middle line:84%
to dissolve that
separation between us

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.210 align:middle line:90%
and our natural surroundings.

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:52.500 align:middle line:84%
The truth is we
are part of nature.

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.990 align:middle line:90%

levels of consciousness that
are already inside of us.
