a team led by Dr.
Robin Carhart-Harris

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.390 align:middle line:84%
observed the default

go offline when the

that this is maybe
what the ego is,

the mysteries and abilities
of the human brain continue

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.720 align:middle line:90%
to confound and inspire us.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.760 align:middle line:84%
It is believed that
the default mode

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.060 align:middle line:84%
network is where our
sense of self and memories

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.050 align:middle line:84%
are created, where we
construct mental models

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.780 align:middle line:90%
or simulated realities.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.230 align:middle line:84%
But those simulations seem
to lock the subjects deeper

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.930 align:middle line:84%
into the consensus
reality rather than

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.110 align:middle line:90%
create otherworldly realities.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.570 align:middle line:84%
Could our default
mode network actually

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.600 align:middle line:84%
be part of an ancient
psychic technology,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.870 align:middle line:84%
a matrix capable of
locking our minds deeper

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.870 align:middle line:84%
into material reality,
blocking access

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.630 align:middle line:84%
to our spirituality
and alternate planes

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.998 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness?

00:02:33.998 --> 00:02:40.550 align:middle line:90%


00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.820 align:middle line:10%
While decades of research led
to our current understanding

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.400 align:middle line:10%
of the default mode
network, the term

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.220 align:middle line:10%
itself was coined by
Washington University

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.110 align:middle line:10%
of Medicine neurologist
Marcus Raichle in 2001.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.760 align:middle line:10%
>> The default mode network--

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.220 align:middle line:10%
it's a network in
the brain that is

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.480 align:middle line:10%
involved in our autobiographical
story of ourselves.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.983 align:middle line:84%
That's when we're thinking
about ourselves, when

00:03:04.983 --> 00:03:06.650 align:middle line:84%
we're thinking about
somebody else, when

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.290 align:middle line:84%
we're wandering in our
minds into the past

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.520 align:middle line:90%
or into the future.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.100 align:middle line:10%
>> The network is comprised of
different areas of the brain,

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.380 align:middle line:10%
including the posterior
cingulate cortex, precuneus,

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.210 align:middle line:10%
medial prefrontal, and
inferior parietal cortices.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.970 align:middle line:84%
It's less active when the
person is engaged in more

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.580 align:middle line:90%
goal-oriented activities.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.560 align:middle line:10%
>> The Robin
Carhart-Harris group--

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.290 align:middle line:10%
they brought forth a lot
of interesting ideas about,

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.420 align:middle line:10%
what is this default
mode network?

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.760 align:middle line:84%
So they were
studying the entropy

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.170 align:middle line:84%
of the brain, how chaotic is the
brain's activity at any given

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.822 align:middle line:84%
time, with the idea that it's
the entropy of the universe,

00:03:45.822 --> 00:03:47.780 align:middle line:84%
that they're ultimately--
like, things are just

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.580 align:middle line:84%
in such a chaos and that,
when people are asleep,

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.280 align:middle line:84%
or in a coma, or anesthetized,
they saw decreased

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.600 align:middle line:90%
entropy of the brain activity.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And then, when they're awake,
they see increased entropy.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And then, when they get
into their dream state--

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.340 align:middle line:90%
more entropy.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.560 align:middle line:10%
And then they go
into further states,

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.275 align:middle line:10%
which could be really
enlightened states,

00:04:09.275 --> 00:04:11.630 align:middle line:10%
most people might
describe, or even madness,

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.390 align:middle line:10%
going into full-blown
schizophrenic, psychosis,

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.230 align:middle line:10%
or mania, where people are
just overwhelmed by the chaos

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.093 align:middle line:10%
that they're exposed to.

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:22.010 align:middle line:84%
So then they talked about
how the default mode

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.240 align:middle line:84%
network and its activity
was altering that entropy,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.640 align:middle line:84%
that it was somehow suppressing
the entropy of consciousness

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.740 align:middle line:84%
down to a level
that, for the human,

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.050 align:middle line:90%
would be more manageable.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.380 align:middle line:90%


00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Their research also shows us
that, under normal conditions,

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.510 align:middle line:84%
when people are simply resting
and not focusing on a task,

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.340 align:middle line:84%
the DMN is not only active
but consuming roughly 80%

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.380 align:middle line:90%
of the brain's energy.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Why does a resting
state of consciousness

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.300 align:middle line:90%
consume so much of our energy?

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.140 align:middle line:10%
>> When the default mode
network is too active, which,

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.790 align:middle line:10%
for many of us, it is,
then rather than being

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.430 align:middle line:10%
in a daydreaming
place sometimes,

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.495 align:middle line:10%
we go to a ruminating place
or a high-anxiety place.

00:05:14.495 --> 00:05:17.030 align:middle line:90%


00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.550 align:middle line:84%
It can lead to disorders
like OCD, eating disorders,

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.180 align:middle line:84%
severe anxiety,
intractable depression,

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.300 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the conditions that
we are dealing with in society

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.100 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.370 align:middle line:90%


00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Recent studies also show
that the default mode network

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.835 align:middle line:10%
activation is correlated with
drug craving and withdrawal.

00:05:42.835 --> 00:05:44.960 align:middle line:10%
>> So the default mode
network is a functional part

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.510 align:middle line:10%
of the human brain
and physiology.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.670 align:middle line:10%
It's important for
how we function.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.920 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, when
it's stuck in a rut,

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.380 align:middle line:84%
let's say, by
destabilizing it, we

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.830 align:middle line:84%
allow for ourselves to come
into a higher functioning

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.830 align:middle line:84%
version of the default
mode network in the sense

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.260 align:middle line:84%
that, let's say, improvements
in mental health,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.720 align:middle line:84%
as they're measured,
could be observed.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.470 align:middle line:84%
So we're not just trying
to go up, up and away.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.050 align:middle line:90%
That's not useful either.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.470 align:middle line:84%
The ungrounded
optimism, the naivete--

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.820 align:middle line:90%
that puts people in danger.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.060 align:middle line:84%
That's reckless
sometimes, so it needs

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.470 align:middle line:90%
to be grounded in some way.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.580 align:middle line:84%
>> What is it that is keeping
human consciousness locked

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.710 align:middle line:84%
so firmly in this
mental model of reality,

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.980 align:middle line:90%
this default mode network?

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's a
protective mechanism,

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.010 align:middle line:84%
trying to predict scenarios
based on our experience.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.360 align:middle line:90%
And so that's useful.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.590 align:middle line:84%
However, if it's overly active,
and we suppress consciousness

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.610 align:middle line:84%
further and further, like
they say, then we become,

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.830 align:middle line:84%
you could say,
more narrow-minded.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Narrow-mindedness
leads to pessimism

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.010 align:middle line:84%
just like open-mindedness
leads to optimism.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.330 align:middle line:10%
>> What psychedelics can do is
they temporarily disable that

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.280 align:middle line:10%
default mode network.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.710 align:middle line:84%
They let you step out
of your reference frame

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:11.540 align:middle line:84%
temporarily and look at
your existential situation

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.890 align:middle line:84%
kind of at arm's length, kind
of, you're not caught up in it.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.600 align:middle line:84%
You can look at
it from a distance

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.460 align:middle line:90%
a little more objectively.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Psychedelics suppress
the default mode network

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.870 align:middle line:10%
for a period of time.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And that allows us to let go
of all of those protections

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.580 align:middle line:84%
that we've placed around these
compartmentalized traumas

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:41.250 align:middle line:84%
and memories and face
them in an honest way,

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.630 align:middle line:84%
maybe for the first
time for some people.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.975 align:middle line:84%
>> We're trying to understand
how these substances can help

00:07:46.975 --> 00:07:48.600 align:middle line:84%
alter default mode
network functioning,

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.910 align:middle line:84%
just like phsycotherapy
can and other things can.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:54.850 align:middle line:90%


00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:58.810 align:middle line:84%
>> What if reality is
not what we think it is?

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.540 align:middle line:84%
What if one's daily
mental state was

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:06.580 align:middle line:84%
built to keep us distracted
while energy is harvested?

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And how can psychedelics help us
escape this default labyrinth?

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.630 align:middle line:84%
As we strive to better
understand how our brain works

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:20.800 align:middle line:84%
and how psychedelics can affect
the default mode network,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.995 align:middle line:84%
can we look to the wisdom of
our ancestors for more clues?

00:08:23.995 --> 00:08:26.680 align:middle line:90%


00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that they already
understood what the default

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.679 align:middle line:90%
mode matrix was capable of?

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:37.490 align:middle line:90%
Archons in the Gnostic Gospels--

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:41.150 align:middle line:84%
these demonic entities
suppressed human's ability

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:44.480 align:middle line:84%
to transcend out of
the material realm.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.930 align:middle line:84%
Some believe that they
built a matrix construct

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.810 align:middle line:84%
into the minds of the
human race in order

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:55.440 align:middle line:84%
to harvest their psychic
energy, like parasites.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Could this be related to
the default mode network?

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.270 align:middle line:10%
>> As a biologist, I kind of
see the reference of the Gnostic

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:08.430 align:middle line:10%
Gospels to the Archons as kind
of like a virus on this planet

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.350 align:middle line:10%
or in the cosmos.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And the way that viruses work
is they inject their programming

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.740 align:middle line:84%
or DNA into the
host, which could

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.680 align:middle line:90%
be a human or an organism.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And by a sneaky mechanism,
they get the host

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.980 align:middle line:90%
to replicate more of the virus.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.770 align:middle line:84%
This might have been
occurring all down

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.800 align:middle line:84%
the line of our evolution,
and these beings probably

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.100 align:middle line:84%
would understand
genetics and engineering.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And they could implant something
like the default mode network

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.370 align:middle line:84%
to keep us from being
aware of our divine origins

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:45.180 align:middle line:84%
and keeping us more focused on
the physical level of reality

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.610 align:middle line:84%
because that seems to be the
purpose of the default mode

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:48.410 align:middle line:90%
network.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:52.660 align:middle line:90%


00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.840 align:middle line:10%
>> When I first learned about
the idea of a parasitic force

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.230 align:middle line:10%
affecting human beings, that
seemed to me, like, woo.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm skeptical in
nature, but not doubtful.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.110 align:middle line:10%
But when I started
connecting the dots,

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:08.230 align:middle line:10%
then I started realizing
that what the Gnostics called

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:12.910 align:middle line:10%
the Archons, and what the Native
Americans called [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:16.150 align:middle line:10%
or Native Hawaiians
called [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:20.170 align:middle line:10%
what Gurdjieff called the
"evil magician," and in Sufism,

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:23.380 align:middle line:10%
it's called Shaitan,
same in kabbalah,

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.710 align:middle line:10%
what Sri Aurobindo called
"occult hostile forces,"

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:30.470 align:middle line:10%
what Carlos Castaneda called
the "flyers," the "predators."

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:34.010 align:middle line:84%
So you see, there are many
different names for it.

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:38.380 align:middle line:84%
There seem to be some invisible
force that is acting on us

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:42.220 align:middle line:84%
and causing us to go through
this misguided perception,

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.880 align:middle line:84%
where we use our faculties
to create negativity.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Hinduism tell us
that this is Maya,

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.920 align:middle line:84%
a state of infatuation
with the material world,

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.840 align:middle line:90%
where we lose the self.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:56.000 align:middle line:84%
We lose the self in the dream,
and we become the dream.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And so why
would they do this?

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Some say, well, they feed
off of our suffering.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Or some say, they are just aside
from the spiritual evolutionary

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.995 align:middle line:84%
ladder, and they just want
to feel powerful and have

00:11:09.995 --> 00:11:10.795 align:middle line:90%
beings to control.

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:15.450 align:middle line:90%


00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Today, mankind struggles
with a daily onslaught of media

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:25.590 align:middle line:84%
influence, social unrest, and
day-to-day stressors that can

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:29.040 align:middle line:84%
contribute to a feeling of being
locked in that default mode

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.090 align:middle line:90%
feedback loop.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:33.930 align:middle line:10%
>> There's less of that free
time for people to explore

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:35.365 align:middle line:10%
their lives.

00:11:35.365 --> 00:11:38.370 align:middle line:10%
And their lives are
becoming dominated, not

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:41.820 align:middle line:10%
leaving space for doing the
things that people do more,

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.370 align:middle line:10%
I would say, all over the world.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.025 align:middle line:84%
In a village, they
have a local cuisine.

00:11:47.025 --> 00:11:48.150 align:middle line:90%
They know about the plants.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.930 align:middle line:90%
They play a lot.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:50.070 align:middle line:90%
They have a lot of festivals.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.112 align:middle line:90%
They have a lot of music.

00:11:51.112 --> 00:11:53.250 align:middle line:84%
They have a local
dance, what the humans

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:55.600 align:middle line:90%
do all over the world.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.810 align:middle line:84%
But when you beat
it out of them,

00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:59.958 align:middle line:90%
they stop doing that stuff.

00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Then the culture just becomes
what they tell you on TV,

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.530 align:middle line:90%
on the screen, on the phone.

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:07.262 align:middle line:84%
We're going, oh, well,
everyone's watching this.

00:12:07.262 --> 00:12:08.220 align:middle line:90%
Let's all I watch that.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.512 align:middle line:90%
What about what you want to do?

00:12:09.512 --> 00:12:12.910 align:middle line:84%
What about what you would do
if you had more free time?

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:13.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:17.640 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's certainly true that
preliterate and Aboriginal

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.590 align:middle line:10%
peoples have had an
obsession with time.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.800 align:middle line:10%
However, it's an
obsession shared

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.280 align:middle line:10%
by the historical
societies as well.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Time seems to be the
dimension about which we

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.060 align:middle line:84%
have the greatest anxiety,
perhaps because it's

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:38.190 align:middle line:84%
the dimension into which we
see with the least clarity.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.980 align:middle line:10%
The point we're
trying to make here

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.160 align:middle line:10%
that I have been involved
with over the past few years

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:10%
is that a revisioning
of time would assuage

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.890 align:middle line:10%
much of what is
called modern anxiety

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:56.640 align:middle line:10%
and that we have limited
the categories we

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:01.410 align:middle line:10%
were willing to entertain in
dealing with this problem.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there ways to
regulate the default mode?

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:08.620 align:middle line:10%
Researchers have observed
meditation and exercise

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:12.370 align:middle line:10%
having an effect on the
default mode network.

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:15.510 align:middle line:84%
Additionally, plant
medicines, once again,

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:17.297 align:middle line:90%
offer a possible breakthrough.

00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:19.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Robin Carhart-Harris and the
people in the Imperial College

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.338 align:middle line:10%
of London-- they did a lot of
research exploring the effect

00:13:22.338 --> 00:13:26.180 align:middle line:10%
of psychedelics on the default
mode network and suggested that

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.030 align:middle line:10%
maybe this is a neural
correlate of the ego.

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:30.648 align:middle line:84%
And it was psilocybin
in this case

00:13:30.648 --> 00:13:32.940 align:middle line:84%
that really altered the
functioning of the default mode

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.100 align:middle line:90%
network.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, decreasing certain
parts of the activity,

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:42.590 align:middle line:84%
the default mode network
decreased possibly this ego,

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:46.490 align:middle line:84%
this self-thinking
part of ourselves.

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:49.760 align:middle line:10%
>> The default mode network
modulates something called

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.230 align:middle line:10%
predictive coding.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:54.290 align:middle line:10%
And what predictive
coding is, is

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:56.570 align:middle line:10%
when we come to
any new situation,

00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:00.530 align:middle line:10%
we're actually not
integrating all the details

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:04.010 align:middle line:10%
and building the whole situation
for ourselves every time.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.110 align:middle line:84%
We take a few
details, and then we

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:09.080 align:middle line:84%
fill in the rest based on
things that have happened to us

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.370 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.050 align:middle line:84%
When we shut down
the default mode

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:16.070 align:middle line:84%
network for a period of time,
we shut down predictive coding.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And what that allows us to do
is to release these old stories

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:23.270 align:middle line:84%
that we keep imposing
again, and again,

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:26.000 align:middle line:84%
and again on each
new situation that we

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.148 align:middle line:84%
encounter so that we can build
new stories for ourselves.

00:14:31.148 --> 00:14:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's
basically how we dream.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:35.270 align:middle line:84%
We become the dream,
and consensual reality

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:36.560 align:middle line:90%
is no longer accessible.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.260 align:middle line:84%
We only realize that it's
a dream when we wake up.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.380 align:middle line:84%
So this reality seems to
be working in the same way.

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:46.460 align:middle line:10%
But it's very important to
realize that to wake the self

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:52.100 align:middle line:10%
up in a dream requires
judicious handling, awareness,

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.850 align:middle line:10%
steadfastness, resilience,
going toward the fear

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.610 align:middle line:10%
that we created
in the first place

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:02.030 align:middle line:10%
to not apply the
unhealthy attachment,

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:05.150 align:middle line:10%
to learn how to snap out
of the unhealthy baseline.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:09.550 align:middle line:90%


00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>> If humans are locked in this
limited perception of reality,

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.990 align:middle line:84%
unable to wake from the dream,
does it make them easier

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:19.720 align:middle line:90%
to manipulate and control?

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.910 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps this is why
psychedelics have

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:25.240 align:middle line:84%
been demonized and
prohibited by the government,

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.910 align:middle line:84%
while other harmful and
addictive substances are

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:30.160 align:middle line:90%
sanctioned.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Recent research also
shows increased activity

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:36.910 align:middle line:84%
in the default mode network is
linked with mental disorders

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:41.740 align:middle line:84%
like depression, anxiety,
and schizophrenia.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:46.910 align:middle line:10%
>> In some extreme cases, it
can lead to severe anxiety,

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:52.300 align:middle line:10%
eating disorders, OCD, and many
of the mental disorders that we

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.100 align:middle line:10%
see going on in
society right now.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.720 align:middle line:90%


00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>> In modern times, the Greek
myth of Pandora's box has been

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:06.270 align:middle line:84%
boiled down to an idiom, warning
against starting new things

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:09.540 align:middle line:84%
that may have
unforeseen consequences.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:12.900 align:middle line:84%
In the original story,
Epimetheus was gifted a wife

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.480 align:middle line:90%
from Zeus, named Pandora.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Along with her comes a sealed
vase and explicit instructions

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:22.110 align:middle line:90%
not to open it.

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Curiosity gets the
best of Pandora,

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:30.060 align:middle line:84%
and she opens it, releasing
all of the evil that

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.820 align:middle line:90%
now plagues the world.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:36.870 align:middle line:84%
One item remains in
that container, Elpis.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:41.490 align:middle line:84%
This roughly translates
to hope or expectation.

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Reserving expectation
is a shamanic discipline

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:49.500 align:middle line:84%
to avoid distraction in a
world of illusion, our material

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.900 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:56.190 align:middle line:84%
One can easily draw parallels
from this story to Eve

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:58.830 align:middle line:84%
eating the forbidden
fruit, leading to her

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and Adam being exiled
from the Garden of Eden.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that these
are both shamanic stories

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:08.819 align:middle line:84%
or forbidden
psychedelic awakenings?

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:12.960 align:middle line:10%
>> In Bwiti, which is the
tradition from equatorial

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:17.890 align:middle line:10%
Africa, we talk about
this idea of mabondo.

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:22.319 align:middle line:84%
So you go into a ceremony
praying for mabondo.

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And mabondo means
grace or benediction.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.480 align:middle line:84%
We approach the medicine with
humility because it's a chance.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.500 align:middle line:90%
It's an opportunity.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a time for great luck.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And so the less we have
our own ideas projected

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:42.750 align:middle line:84%
onto that experience, the more
the medicine can do for us.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:45.870 align:middle line:84%
When we have too many
preconceived notions,

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:48.570 align:middle line:84%
it can also be disrespectful
to the medicine

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:52.110 align:middle line:84%
because this medicine is
here with its own gifts,

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:53.700 align:middle line:90%
with its own teachings.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:18:01.230 align:middle line:84%
It is a master, and it has a
transmission unique for you.

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Long ago, shamans
and priesthoods,

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:08.430 align:middle line:84%
well aware of the powers that
psychedelic plants possessed,

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:11.700 align:middle line:90%
closely guarded access to them.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:17.760 align:middle line:84%
Today, interest in and access
to psychedelics is on the rise.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.920 align:middle line:84%
This has led to
an increased focus

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.790 align:middle line:84%
on creating safe and
effective settings, optimized

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:26.850 align:middle line:90%
to individual's needs.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:28.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Everybody's different.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:32.460 align:middle line:10%
I think that some people can go
through these transformative,

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.320 align:middle line:10%
challenging
experiences, and they

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.180 align:middle line:10%
don't find them like an ordeal.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.660 align:middle line:10%
They can experience them as
though it was a revelation

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.210 align:middle line:10%
almost to salvation.

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:48.930 align:middle line:84%
They can experience a dramatic
reduction in anxiety and fear,

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:52.710 align:middle line:84%
and it's not a
challenging experience.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.470 align:middle line:84%
For other people,
it is an ordeal.

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of it has
to do with the inability

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:00.570 align:middle line:90%
to surrender.

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:05.100 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the keys
to psychedelic therapy.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Once you have the set
optimized and the setting,

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:13.000 align:middle line:84%
and the medicine, and the
dose, the responsibility,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.840 align:middle line:84%
if you will, or the
job of the patient

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.600 align:middle line:90%
is to trust the process.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.660 align:middle line:10%
>> I certainly know people who
have gone into the psychedelic

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:26.380 align:middle line:10%
experience with the intention
of getting some answers.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:32.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's totally possible
that you can lift the veils,

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:36.220 align:middle line:84%
open the doors of perception,
and get an idea of what really

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.680 align:middle line:84%
would be good for
you, especially if you

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.240 align:middle line:90%
set your intentions on that.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.810 align:middle line:90%


00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:46.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Many of the thousands
of journey reports shared

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:51.160 align:middle line:10%
and cataloged online over the
past two decades report that

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:55.055 align:middle line:10%
DMT pushed participants'
consciousness outside of normal

00:19:55.055 --> 00:19:55.855 align:middle line:10%
reality.

00:19:55.855 --> 00:20:00.000 align:middle line:90%


00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.980 align:middle line:84%
The other side is described
as a structured dimension

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and that it felt more
real than what we commonly

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:07.610 align:middle line:90%
accept as reality.

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:10.240 align:middle line:90%


00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Former UFC champion Rashad
Evan's own personal journey

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:18.020 align:middle line:90%
lines up with these accounts.

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.420 align:middle line:10%
>> So when I came
back to my body,

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.480 align:middle line:10%
I remember the
feeling of just loss.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:26.200 align:middle line:10%
It felt as if I just
lost the love of my life,

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.743 align:middle line:10%
and I remember just crying.

00:20:28.743 --> 00:20:30.910 align:middle line:84%
I remember just saying like,
please don't go, please

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:34.090 align:middle line:90%
don't go, please don't go.

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And then I slowly
started to open my eyes,

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:38.890 align:middle line:90%
and I just feel my face.

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And I have tears running down
my face, and my heart's racing.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still mumbling the
words, please don't go, please

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:45.050 align:middle line:90%
don't go.

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:47.133 align:middle line:84%
And I really don't understand
why I'm saying that,

00:20:47.133 --> 00:20:48.420 align:middle line:90%
but I feel it.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And as I open my
eyes, I just start

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:54.650 align:middle line:84%
to see reality just
very pixelated.

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And as I open my eyes longer, it
starts to come into focus more.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And it just slowly starts
just to piece together,

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:05.390 align:middle line:90%
like a video game.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:08.990 align:middle line:84%
It let me know that reality
was far more vast than I

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:11.270 align:middle line:90%
could have ever imagined.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.010 align:middle line:84%
I just stayed in awe
for the longest time,

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:17.390 align:middle line:84%
and then I couldn't
stop thinking about it.

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And whenever I
had a free moment,

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:21.950 align:middle line:84%
I would just think about
that, just the magnificence

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:24.800 align:middle line:84%
of this consciousness
and just the magnificence

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.040 align:middle line:90%
of what was inside of me.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.030 align:middle line:90%
And I had no idea.

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:31.910 align:middle line:84%
It was really hard to
understand, for the most part.

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:37.400 align:middle line:84%
But as I continue on my journey,
more understanding about it

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.535 align:middle line:90%
starts to reveal itself.

00:21:38.535 --> 00:21:44.210 align:middle line:90%


00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:47.420 align:middle line:10%
>> In the ancient myths
of lost civilizations,

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:53.600 align:middle line:10%
Atlantis and Lemuria, humanity
was divided primarily amongst

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.710 align:middle line:10%
the technologically advanced
and spiritually advanced.

00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:01.110 align:middle line:84%
With technologies growing
influence on our lives,

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:03.260 align:middle line:84%
more people are
seeking to reconnect

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:05.330 align:middle line:90%
with their spirituality.

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:08.570 align:middle line:84%
Could this pattern
be emerging again?

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Today, mankind has come to rely
on internet technology for just

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:14.600 align:middle line:90%
about everything.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:19.970 align:middle line:84%
It's how we learn, entertain
ourselves, and communicate.

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:23.420 align:middle line:84%
But all of this convenience
and interconnectedness

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:26.030 align:middle line:90%
may come at a cost.

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:29.150 align:middle line:84%
These networks rely on
radio frequency signals

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:33.170 align:middle line:84%
to relay information, creating
their own electromagnetic

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:35.210 align:middle line:90%
fields.

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:37.880 align:middle line:10%
Some believe that
these EMFs not only

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:41.990 align:middle line:10%
pose a risk as a carcinogen,
but that they can also interfere

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:44.370 align:middle line:10%
with pineal gland activity.

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is the part
of the brain associated

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.180 align:middle line:84%
with self realization,
enlightenment,

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:53.150 align:middle line:90%
and higher and expanded states.

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:56.360 align:middle line:10%
>> EMFs or Electromagnetic
Frequencies--

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.270 align:middle line:10%
they have a kind of
sameness of the pattern

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:02.030 align:middle line:10%
that they broadcast,
and this lacks

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:04.760 align:middle line:10%
the signature of living forms.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.830 align:middle line:84%
We have also found
that they happen

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:12.570 align:middle line:84%
to be broadcast in the same
frequency range as our biology.

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:15.320 align:middle line:84%
So they actually interact
with our biology.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And they cause a lot
of negative effects,

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:21.055 align:middle line:84%
including affecting
the pineal gland.

00:23:21.055 --> 00:23:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
the pineal gland

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:25.790 align:middle line:84%
is extremely important for
higher states of awareness,

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:30.510 align:middle line:84%
for how good we sleep, our
mood, all of these things.

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So the electromagnetic
frequencies are not necessarily

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:38.390 align:middle line:90%
helping humanity.

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>> If true, could these
EMF-producing technologies lock

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:46.720 align:middle line:84%
people's brains into the
default mode network?

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.060 align:middle line:84%
With a new
technological obstacle,

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:52.330 align:middle line:84%
what are the ramifications
for the future of psychedelics

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:55.270 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness exploration?

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:57.400 align:middle line:84%
The use of these
medicinal plants

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.640 align:middle line:84%
can help turn off the
default mode network,

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.220 align:middle line:84%
but this kind of
awakening is not a simple

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.890 align:middle line:90%
"one size fits all" solution.

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:09.460 align:middle line:84%
Integrating these experiences
into our everyday lives

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.450 align:middle line:90%
remains a challenge.

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.560 align:middle line:10%
>> We know that these sacred
plant medicines have an effect

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.230 align:middle line:10%
on the default mode
network in the brain,

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:22.140 align:middle line:10%
and they seem to render it
quiet for some period of time.

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And when this kind of monotonous
drone of self-limiting programs

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.600 align:middle line:84%
is silenced, we
have these glimpses

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:34.160 align:middle line:84%
of the higher worlds of expanded
states of awareness of, really,

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.280 align:middle line:84%
a more real reality than
we normally exist in

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.950 align:middle line:90%
in our baseline consciousness.

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And then, when we're not in
the influence of the medicine,

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:47.210 align:middle line:84%
we come back to what
we call normal reality.

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And the challenge is
always to integrate

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:54.400 align:middle line:84%
the gifts of what we have
seen into our everyday life.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And it does seem that
they do get integrated,

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.710 align:middle line:84%
but it takes a
little bit of work

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:04.660 align:middle line:84%
because the reality seems so
different and so far apart.

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:10.530 align:middle line:84%
But actually, they're just
layers of the one reality.

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And so that is the gift
of the plant medicines,

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:16.130 align:middle line:84%
is to bring back these
gifts and these glimpses

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:19.580 align:middle line:84%
into the higher worlds
and to actually live them.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:22.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Whenever we are
catapulted out of normal,

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:25.040 align:middle line:10%
we're being sent
into the unknown.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.580 align:middle line:90%
We're being sent into mystery.

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:30.130 align:middle line:84%
That is incredibly
fertile ground

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:34.630 align:middle line:84%
for completely new and
unexpected possibilities

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:39.430 align:middle line:84%
for healing to happen,
if we're willing to take

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:40.300 align:middle line:90%
advantage of that.

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:46.620 align:middle line:90%

Gospels are truly harvesting

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:55.350 align:middle line:84%
human energy, using the default
mode network to keep us blaming

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:58.650 align:middle line:84%
the simulation, could this
unique class of the plant

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:03.180 align:middle line:84%
kingdom be here to serve as
the key to escape this matrix

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:04.920 align:middle line:90%
before it's too late?

>> Sacred psychoactive plants
can serve humanity at this

time, as they always have,
to see beyond the program

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:18.600 align:middle line:10%
of the matrix of the physical
world and remember that we are

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:23.160 align:middle line:10%
actually divine cosmic beings
and that there is nothing

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.340 align:middle line:10%
beyond that that can control
us, that we are actually all

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:27.990 align:middle line:10%
the one creator.

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:31.140 align:middle line:84%

provided by our dear planet

>> These sacred plant medicines
and psychedelic renaissance are

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:41.850 align:middle line:10%
pointing to the need for
us to open our hearts.

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:44.280 align:middle line:10%
And opening and
healing our hearts

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:49.950 align:middle line:10%
is going to help illuminate
our mental health problems.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.570 align:middle line:10%
open, we would see things
as they really are--

00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:59.260 align:middle line:10%
infinite.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:03.120 align:middle line:84%
So my hope is that the
psychedelic experience

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:10.150 align:middle line:84%
helps us to see the oneness, how
our actions can affect others.

Anything that can
help lift the veils so

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.340 align:middle line:90%
that we can see more clearly--

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.480 align:middle line:84%
I think the planet really
needs that right now.
