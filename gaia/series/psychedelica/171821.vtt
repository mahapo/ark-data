00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>> In the course of evolution
in which life on Earth passed

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.990 align:middle line:84%
through stages of single-celled
organisms to eukaryotes

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.120 align:middle line:84%
to multicelled and
complex organisms,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.470 align:middle line:84%
one ever-present force has
guided all of it to where we

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.270 align:middle line:90%
are now--

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.100 align:middle line:90%
integration.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.690 align:middle line:84%
That underlying
principle that is

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.530 align:middle line:84%
seen in all arenas
of intelligent life.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.020 align:middle line:10%
Individual organisms
utilize anything

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.460 align:middle line:10%
in their environment to ensure
life and postpone death.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.880 align:middle line:84%
By far, the most advantageous
way for this to happen

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.690 align:middle line:84%
is for peaceful and intelligent
coexistence to take place.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.770 align:middle line:84%
The flora feeds the fauna, which
in turn digests and returns

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.290 align:middle line:90%
the food back to the flora.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.830 align:middle line:84%
The flowers attract the bees,
which in turn spreads the seeds

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.380 align:middle line:90%
and plants more flowers.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.760 align:middle line:84%
The weather patterns, seasonal
cycles, birds, bees, plants,

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.000 align:middle line:84%
and trees all live
within a greater organism

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.280 align:middle line:90%
that many now call Gaia--

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.340 align:middle line:90%
the living Earth.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And upon this Earth, there
is no such thing as waste.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Each part feeds the next
and eventually cycles back

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.440 align:middle line:90%
into itself.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.270 align:middle line:84%
All these intelligent
moving parts

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.540 align:middle line:84%
fit together in an
integrated system.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.540 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of integration
is for many individuals

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.410 align:middle line:84%
to work towards one higher cause
that no one individual could

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.350 align:middle line:90%
achieve alone.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.440 align:middle line:84%
In the world of computers,
software and hardware

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.440 align:middle line:84%
are upgraded perpetually
for one purpose--

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.730 align:middle line:84%
to better integrate the rest of
the endless web of technology.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.370 align:middle line:84%
These upgrades not only add
new features to the system,

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.470 align:middle line:84%
but they remove disruptive
or obsolete features as well.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.960 align:middle line:84%
In the world of
psychedelic plants,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.810 align:middle line:84%
we find their effect
on human consciousness

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.420 align:middle line:84%
not only adds
insights and visions,

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.410 align:middle line:84%
but dismantles unproductive
or harmful patterns.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.860 align:middle line:84%
But when a deep psychedelic
experience has completed,

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.470 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes, the seeker is
left with more questions

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.980 align:middle line:90%
than answers.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.750 align:middle line:84%
It is precisely
these moments that

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.000 align:middle line:84%
call upon us to take time in
peace, silence, and reflective

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.570 align:middle line:84%
contemplation in order to pick
up the shattered pieces of who

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.860 align:middle line:84%
we believe we were, discard
what no longer serves us,

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.560 align:middle line:84%
and hold on to that
which may still teach us.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And to reintegrate back into
the dynamic system from which we

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.380 align:middle line:90%
were momentarily departed.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Probably just as important
as the psychedelic experience is

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.800 align:middle line:10%
the process of integration.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.960 align:middle line:10%
When you have a
psychedelic experience, all

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.400 align:middle line:10%
your preconceived notions
of the world melt down--

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.250 align:middle line:10%
gone.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.083 align:middle line:84%
You could develop all
this new information--

00:03:02.083 --> 00:03:03.730 align:middle line:90%
floods of new information.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And with all this
new information,

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.960 align:middle line:84%
you have to integrate it into
your life when you come back.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the physical
body has been taxed.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.770 align:middle line:10%
The brain, in some
ways, has been taxed.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.490 align:middle line:10%
Our psychology has
been taxed in that we

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.150 align:middle line:10%
have to re-evaluate some
pretty fundamental assumptions

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.980 align:middle line:10%
about ourselves.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And energetically, our spiritual
body has been blasted open

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.050 align:middle line:84%
and is reforming, and that's
what's happening energetically

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.370 align:middle line:90%
with psychedelics.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And like anything, it takes
time for that to happen.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.880 align:middle line:90%
It's a process.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.800 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't happen over a few
hours, or even a few days.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it can take many,
many weeks or months to return

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.945 align:middle line:90%
to a different baseline--

00:03:49.945 --> 00:03:54.190 align:middle line:84%
a baseline that's
more holistic, maybe.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Overwhelming experiences
often call us to take breaks

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.870 align:middle line:84%
in order to process
what just happened.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.890 align:middle line:84%
After the death of a loved
one, there's a grieving period.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.910 align:middle line:84%
After running a marathon,
a recovery phase.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And after the fabric of
reality is unwoven and stitched

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.350 align:middle line:84%
back together, after people's
old habits are dismantled,

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.360 align:middle line:84%
there is also a period
in which the tissues

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.570 align:middle line:84%
of the body and the patterns
of the mind need to begin anew.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.250 align:middle line:90%


00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.080 align:middle line:84%
In the daily grind of
economically-driven society

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.620 align:middle line:84%
and survivalism all
around, the moments

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.100 align:middle line:84%
we give ourselves to reflect
upon our lifestyles and choices

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.010 align:middle line:90%
are few and far between.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And this happens even
after psychedelic journeys

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.560 align:middle line:84%
that beg for us to slow down
and integrate the messages they

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.000 align:middle line:90%
hold.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's a mistake when
people rush off to their job

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.930 align:middle line:84%
or rush off to do something
that re-establishes all the old

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.320 align:middle line:84%
patterns, because there's this
amazing opportunity that people

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.410 align:middle line:84%
have when, after the
psychedelic experience ends,

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.740 align:middle line:84%
when things are fresh, when
their brain is almost like

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.070 align:middle line:84%
a newborn baby, and they have
this ability to establish new

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.609 align:middle line:84%
patterns, you want to strengthen
those new patterns and this

00:05:06.609 --> 00:05:08.900 align:middle line:84%
process of integration instead
of going back to the old

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.010 align:middle line:90%
patterns.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.287 align:middle line:10%
>> A lot of people I hear
from say that they believe

00:05:13.287 --> 00:05:14.870 align:middle line:10%
ayahuasca's going
to be very damaging,

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.880 align:middle line:10%
because people who come back
to society find it very,

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.320 align:middle line:10%
very difficult to cope after
they come back to society.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Gee, I knew this guy,
and he wasn't the same

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.810 align:middle line:90%
after he came back.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.140 align:middle line:84%
It can be that way for people,
because we live in a very, very

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.265 align:middle line:90%
dysfunctional society.

00:05:29.265 --> 00:05:30.890 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's so
important for people

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.860 align:middle line:84%
to integrate their
experience after ceremony.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.810 align:middle line:84%
You've got to sit down
with the people you

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.610 align:middle line:84%
had the ceremony with
and talk about it,

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.890 align:middle line:84%
and realize what
you've experienced

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.245 align:middle line:84%
and realize what the world
is that you've now opened up.

00:05:43.245 --> 00:05:45.453 align:middle line:84%
And realize what you're
going to be coming back into.

00:05:45.453 --> 00:05:47.750 align:middle line:84%
See, there's the
problem with ayahuasca,

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.510 align:middle line:84%
is that it does reconnect
people to the earth

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.710 align:middle line:84%
so much that when they come
back to somewhere like New York,

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.560 align:middle line:90%
they just go, oh, my God.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.510 align:middle line:90%
What am I swimming in?

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.850 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this anymore.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Many of those who have
traveled to the Amazon jungle

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.670 align:middle line:84%
to try ayahuasca in its
traditional surroundings

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.310 align:middle line:90%
experience culture shock.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.260 align:middle line:84%
The language, the environment,
the customs, and of course,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.660 align:middle line:84%
the medicine become a
whirlwind of new experience

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.870 align:middle line:84%
that can be stressful
on the body and mind.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.510 align:middle line:84%
This is what is called
a peak experience,

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.870 align:middle line:84%
and now these experiences
are so easily attainable

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.780 align:middle line:84%
that people with no
preparation and no context

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.150 align:middle line:84%
for the life-altering
journey to come

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.110 align:middle line:84%
are flooding the Amazon
in search of this brew.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.860 align:middle line:10%
In the 1960s, the youth were
increasingly experimenting

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.170 align:middle line:10%
with psychedelics and
ripping apart their most

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.560 align:middle line:10%
cherished belief systems,
but with little education

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.540 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of ambition.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.700 align:middle line:84%
So even if they were
waking the sleeping mind

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.720 align:middle line:84%
to new information,
were they truly ready?

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Just as the gut is equipped
to break down complex food

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.520 align:middle line:84%
into basic building
blocks for energy,

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.190 align:middle line:84%
the nervous system
must switch from

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.150 align:middle line:84%
sympathetic, or activity-based,
to parasympathetic, which

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.580 align:middle line:90%
is the rest and digest state.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Without this switch,
without the resting state,

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.210 align:middle line:90%
the food struggles to digest.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.280 align:middle line:84%
So what is the result
of moving from one

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.920 align:middle line:84%
peak psychedelic
experience to the next

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.530 align:middle line:84%
without fully digesting
the previous insights that

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.420 align:middle line:90%
were gained?

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.570 align:middle line:84%
What happens when people
do ceremony after ceremony

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.940 align:middle line:90%
without time for integration?

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>> If you take another medicine
before the integration is done,

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.950 align:middle line:84%
you start to stack those
big realizations and big

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:37.320 align:middle line:84%
understandings without
fully integrating them.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, it can create
its own psychic burden.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.240 align:middle line:90%
And it shows up like anxiety.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.620 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, I'm just
overwhelmed by the concepts

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:50.900 align:middle line:84%
that I've received from my
medicine work experiences.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.830 align:middle line:84%
So there are times
when doing regular work

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.710 align:middle line:84%
repeatedly is healthy and
important, particularly

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.870 align:middle line:84%
in healing a trauma or
something like that.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:03.800 align:middle line:84%
You're doing some real clinical
work and it's a period.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.240 align:middle line:84%
But then after
that, there should

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.860 align:middle line:84%
be long, extended periods
of non-medicine use,

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:14.180 align:middle line:84%
just to really, fully
receive and embody

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.310 align:middle line:90%
the lessons of the medicine.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>> In most ayahuasca circles,
after each night of ceremony,

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.670 align:middle line:84%
the group will sit together
and share their experiences

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:26.150 align:middle line:84%
or insights in order to allow
the group to reflect upon what

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.550 align:middle line:90%
they experienced and why.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:31.520 align:middle line:84%
Some speak about what
they saw or felt.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.590 align:middle line:84%
Others realize that
they need to be better

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.350 align:middle line:84%
to the people around them,
or spend more time laughing

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.270 align:middle line:90%
and enjoying life.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And others find themselves still
in the throes of the journey.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.970 align:middle line:84%
Many of them have
similar reasons

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:46.680 align:middle line:84%
for attending the ceremony
in the first place,

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and it's nearly always because
the life that they were leading

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.340 align:middle line:84%
seemed off-track, and
now they're desperately

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.140 align:middle line:84%
looking for the
trail of breadcrumbs

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.500 align:middle line:84%
to lead them back to
the familiar world.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:02.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Many people say, I am
here because I lost myself.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.970 align:middle line:10%
It's interesting to hear,
because, hey, I'm here.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.430 align:middle line:10%
How can I lose myself?

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.880 align:middle line:84%
So what they are reporting is
that their spiritual awareness

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.980 align:middle line:90%
knows that they're not complete.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere on their highway of
life, they took the wrong exit,

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:18.780 align:middle line:84%
and then nasty
things have happened,

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.680 align:middle line:84%
experiences happen, and they
want to go back on the highway.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:28.280 align:middle line:84%
So the beauty is, when
you hear 40 people share,

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.290 align:middle line:84%
you lose your modesty or
shyness, or even shame,

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:35.250 align:middle line:90%
and you just share.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I share, and I
hear myself say something

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:41.570 align:middle line:90%
that I did not prepare.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.920 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say
something different,

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.780 align:middle line:84%
but because of the whole group
and the sphere, the atmosphere,

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.770 align:middle line:84%
the vibration, the resonance--
because it's a dynamic field

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.870 align:middle line:90%
that we're all in--

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.090 align:middle line:84%
I hear myself say
a different thing.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think, where
does that come from?

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.310 align:middle line:84%
It's, of course, my own
subconscious speaking.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.440 align:middle line:10%
>> The ability for these
medicines to reveal

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.560 align:middle line:10%
our subconscious mind to us
might be the hallmark of how

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.070 align:middle line:10%
psychedelic plants can offer
us life-changing moments.

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And out of all the
plant medicines,

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.840 align:middle line:84%
ayahuasca ceremonies
in modern contexts

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.380 align:middle line:84%
are held in a slightly different
manner from other ceremonies.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.510 align:middle line:84%
There's usually an emphasis
on the sharing circle.

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not
everyone speaks is

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:26.870 align:middle line:84%
second to the priority of all
being present for the sharing.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.020 align:middle line:84%
These moments highlight the
need for such peak experiences

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:33.800 align:middle line:84%
to be spoken about,
listened to, and respected.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.500 align:middle line:84%
This allows for the
nervous system to settle,

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.320 align:middle line:84%
for the mind to evaluate
the experiences,

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.360 align:middle line:84%
and to integrate the
lessons of the medicine

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.410 align:middle line:90%
into the tissues of the body.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.190 align:middle line:84%
There are very real shifts
taking place internally--

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:47.870 align:middle line:84%
and even externally--
around those

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:50.030 align:middle line:90%
who partake in the ceremony.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.520 align:middle line:84%
To illustrate the effects of
what psychedelic plants are

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.830 align:middle line:84%
truly doing to the human
body and the energy field,

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:59.620 align:middle line:84%
a professor at St. Petersburg
University, Dr. Konstantin

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.330 align:middle line:84%
Korotkov, has developed
the technology

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.370 align:middle line:84%
to measure the biofield
of the human body

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.530 align:middle line:90%
during ayahuasca ceremonies.

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:11.040 align:middle line:10%
>> My main background is
quantum physics and biophysics.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.675 align:middle line:10%
And at some time, I
developed instruments.

00:11:14.675 --> 00:11:18.590 align:middle line:10%
Their overall name
is [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And this instrument allows us
to detect, measure, and analyze

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:29.690 align:middle line:84%
human energy field, and we
work in predictive integrative

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:30.680 align:middle line:90%
medicine.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:34.160 align:middle line:84%
It is measuring so-named
stimulated electrophoton

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.300 align:middle line:90%
emission.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.980 align:middle line:84%
We apply very short electrical
impulses to our fingers,

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:44.330 align:middle line:84%
and we have response in the
form of photons and electrons

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:45.920 align:middle line:90%
from the skin.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.440 align:middle line:84%
So we are measuring
people before, during,

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.870 align:middle line:84%
after ceremonies,
and this allows

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:52.970 align:middle line:84%
to understand how
people transform,

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:54.770 align:middle line:90%
how they experience this.

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And typically, of
course, it takes--

00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:03.180 align:middle line:84%
ayahuasca is very
energy-consuming process.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:06.710 align:middle line:90%
It opens up human chakras.

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:09.080 align:middle line:90%
It opens up your energy field.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.570 align:middle line:84%
That is why people
become vulnerable.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they lose energy
in the process of ayahuasca.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:18.590 align:middle line:84%
That's why, later on,
they need to be closed--

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:21.560 align:middle line:84%
energy fields should be closed--
and they need to be re-charged.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And we see this in
our measurements.

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:28.930 align:middle line:84%
We can see that initial
energy field was quite strong,

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:30.680 align:middle line:90%
80 Joules.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.920 align:middle line:90%
And it's uniform, very good.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And after ayahuasca, it is 61
Joules, so it dropped down.

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:39.030 align:middle line:90%
It shrinked, as we discussed.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And we need to take it down
so it is practically one day

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.970 align:middle line:90%
after.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:44.680 align:middle line:90%
Same as on level of stress.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Level of stress drop down,
you see, from 07 to 91,

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:51.820 align:middle line:90%
so it's very positive effect.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:56.060 align:middle line:84%
But energy dropped down
as well, quite strongly.

00:12:56.060 --> 00:13:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And we see dramatic
effect on chakras as well.

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Chakras was very disoriented,
and after ayahuasca ceremony,

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.720 align:middle line:90%
they became very well-aligned.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.030 align:middle line:90%
Not ideal, of course.

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:12.940 align:middle line:84%
This is not meditation process,
this is different process.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:16.030 align:middle line:84%
But they're much more
aligned than before.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Korotkov mentions
that meditation puts the body

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.030 align:middle line:84%
and mind into a different
process than an ayahuasca

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:23.020 align:middle line:90%
ceremony.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.930 align:middle line:84%
The greatest difference is
that the meditative insights

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:30.130 align:middle line:84%
are arrived at by an inner
process of relaxing, breathing,

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:32.170 align:middle line:90%
focusing, and observing.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:36.830 align:middle line:84%
By its very nature, meditation
is the process of integration.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:40.030 align:middle line:10%
This is why every spiritual
tradition uses meditation

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:43.270 align:middle line:10%
to integrate our concepts
of life with real life

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:45.650 align:middle line:10%
at the end of each day.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Even in the Amazonian
ayahuasca ceremonies,

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:54.220 align:middle line:84%
after each icaro, or song, a
moment of silence is observed.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.050 align:middle line:10%
In order to close
the photon field

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:58.330 align:middle line:10%
around the body
before the ceremony,

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:02.260 align:middle line:10%
the shaman blows mapacho smoke
over the crown of the head,

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.560 align:middle line:10%
and several traditions also
include a flower-infused bath

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.200 align:middle line:10%
after ceremony
specifically to close

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.510 align:middle line:10%
any rip or hole in
that field after it

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.940 align:middle line:10%
is weakened by the medicine.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.660 align:middle line:84%
This phenomena is also
seen after receiving news.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.790 align:middle line:84%
If the news is not
shocking or destructive

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.370 align:middle line:84%
to the current mindframe,
not much energy

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:24.040 align:middle line:84%
is required to digest
the new information.

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.760 align:middle line:84%
But if the news is intense and
the person is not prepared,

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.600 align:middle line:84%
it can cause such an awakening,
such a transformation,

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.400 align:middle line:84%
that the energy
field around the body

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.190 align:middle line:84%
is diminished as it
moves inward to digest

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:39.850 align:middle line:90%
the earthshaking information.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:43.000 align:middle line:84%
So what if a psychedelic
journey reveals the inadequacies

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.390 align:middle line:84%
and shadow sides of the modern
society we identify ourselves

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.830 align:middle line:90%
with?

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:49.994 align:middle line:84%
>> Enlightenment is a
very destructive process.

00:14:49.994 --> 00:14:51.910 align:middle line:84%
Enlightenment is a
breaking down of everything

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:55.840 align:middle line:84%
you thought was real, and
none of this society is real.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.709 align:middle line:90%
Becoming aware of that is key.

00:14:57.709 --> 00:14:59.500 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way
we're going to heal it.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.150 align:middle line:90%
But that's why I say to people--

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.750 align:middle line:84%
I suggest they do not
undertake this path lightly.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:08.410 align:middle line:84%
The path to enlightenment and
the path to spiritual awakening

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:10.599 align:middle line:90%
is very, very uncomfortable.

00:15:10.599 --> 00:15:12.640 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to go
there and drink on Sunday,

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.625 align:middle line:84%
become this new age
guru who's shining light

00:15:15.625 --> 00:15:18.220 align:middle line:84%
and is going to go out
and be warm and fuzzy

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.617 align:middle line:90%
and speak the truth everywhere.

00:15:19.617 --> 00:15:21.700 align:middle line:84%
You're going to wake up
and look back at the world

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:22.690 align:middle line:90%
and go, oh, my God.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.180 align:middle line:84%
What have I been doing for
the last 30 or 40 years,

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:28.750 align:middle line:84%
and what am I doing, and what
is this world I'm living in?

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And it can be very,
very confrontational.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:35.200 align:middle line:84%
So if you're not ready for that,
maybe don't do the medicine.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.260 align:middle line:10%
>> And so psychedelics can often
bring up a variety of different

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.860 align:middle line:10%
kinds of material that's very
difficult for people to accept

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.090 align:middle line:10%
and to figure out how
to move forward with.

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.300 align:middle line:84%
But that's also the gift
of the psychedelics--

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:49.090 align:middle line:84%
is that it forced us to
deal with these issues

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:52.720 align:middle line:84%
that we were otherwise able
to bury into our unconscious.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.120 align:middle line:84%
So people often have
difficult experiences,

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.420 align:middle line:84%
because they don't have the
support necessary to help them

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:01.270 align:middle line:84%
move through the new
information and to find

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:03.640 align:middle line:84%
a different level of
integration regarding

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.910 align:middle line:84%
the traumatic experiences
that they had in the past.

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>> If it truly is a lack of
support that keeps us from

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:12.460 align:middle line:84%
integrating new and
useful information,

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.270 align:middle line:84%
what kind of support
are we in need of?

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.530 align:middle line:84%
By looking to the experts
who have been researching

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:21.230 align:middle line:84%
psychedelics in both modern
and ancestral contexts,

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.860 align:middle line:84%
we can begin to acknowledge
how shamanic cultures use

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:27.490 align:middle line:84%
psychedelic plants to strengthen
and expand the community,

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:29.920 align:middle line:90%
and even raise their youth.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.400 align:middle line:10%
>> The major problem is, how
to integrate this into a larger

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.020 align:middle line:10%
culture?

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:38.170 align:middle line:10%
If you were a [? witch ?]
living in Mexico

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:41.680 align:middle line:10%
or in one of these cultures
where everybody is part

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.890 align:middle line:10%
of rites of passage and so on--

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:48.100 align:middle line:10%
these experiences-- then it's
actually helping the culture,

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:54.640 align:middle line:10%
because the way of living, the
life strategy, the philosophy,

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.300 align:middle line:10%
the mythology, the
spirituality of the culture

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.740 align:middle line:10%
comes out of these experiences.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:03.610 align:middle line:84%
So they actually
initiate the young people

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:07.089 align:middle line:84%
into their way of living
and their way of thinking.

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:08.089 align:middle line:90%
This is very different.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:10.150 align:middle line:84%
We see what happened
in the '60s.

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:12.609 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, you had
a young generation

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:18.444 align:middle line:84%
that started creating a totally
different hierarchy of values.

00:17:18.444 --> 00:17:23.349 align:middle line:84%
Make love, not war--
very pacifistic feeling.

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:26.589 align:middle line:84%
Very much concerned about
the environment, and so on.

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:30.370 align:middle line:84%
They started differentiating
themselves in the way

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:31.810 align:middle line:90%
they looked--

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:37.680 align:middle line:84%
beards and long hair and
beads and funny uniforms.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.900 align:middle line:84%
They're painting their cars
with psychedelic colors

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.080 align:middle line:84%
so every cop knows there's
grass to be found there.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.960 align:middle line:90%
Not very skillful revolution.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.140 align:middle line:10%
>> A rite of passage is
something that many traditional

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:55.070 align:middle line:10%
cultures do value, where young
people maybe go through some

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.870 align:middle line:10%
rite.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:59.830 align:middle line:10%
It could be something
like your first hunt,

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:03.730 align:middle line:10%
or it might be something like
getting your first tattoo.

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:07.060 align:middle line:10%
It might also be your
first ayahuasca ceremony,

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:09.280 align:middle line:10%
or your first peyote ceremony.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Of course, in our
modern culture,

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:16.060 align:middle line:84%
we have ceremonies, which all
too few people have nowadays--

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:19.750 align:middle line:84%
like a confirmation, a bat
mitzvah, a bar mitzvah.

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:24.310 align:middle line:84%
But I think that we need
some sort of rite of passage,

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:26.020 align:middle line:84%
because young people--
they want to show

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.910 align:middle line:90%
that they're more grown up.

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:31.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how it is
in various cultures,

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:35.020 align:middle line:84%
but I do know that
young people are going

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.790 align:middle line:90%
to come up with some pretty--

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:40.000 align:middle line:84%
sometimes dangerous--
rites of passage.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And very often, it also
entails not being truthful

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.310 align:middle line:90%
with their parents.

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And wouldn't you
want your teenagers

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:51.010 align:middle line:84%
to tell you they were
thinking about doing something

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:52.840 align:middle line:84%
of this nature,
they were thinking

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.090 align:middle line:84%
about doing psilocybin,
and that they

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:56.800 align:middle line:90%
could talk to you about it?

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.740 align:middle line:84%
That you knew where they were,
who they were with, and maybe

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.770 align:middle line:84%
you could even give them some
guidance, like you should

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.260 align:middle line:90%
have an intention, a prayer.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.360 align:middle line:90%
Be in a safe set and setting.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Current forms of rites of
passage are seen at age 16 when

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.750 align:middle line:84%
children in the US
can legally drive,

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:17.500 align:middle line:84%
at age 18 when they can vote,
and 21 when they can legally

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.640 align:middle line:90%
drink.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.380 align:middle line:10%
But these achievements
are not earned

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:23.170 align:middle line:10%
by bravery,
intelligence, or honor,

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:25.960 align:middle line:10%
but simply by being alive
through enough solar cycles

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.500 align:middle line:10%
to be considered an adult.
Because it is only natural

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.830 align:middle line:84%
that youth crave to perform
more mature tasks in order

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:35.500 align:middle line:84%
to prove themselves,
ancestral tribes

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.290 align:middle line:84%
have traditionally crafted
cultural passage ways

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:40.780 align:middle line:90%
for children to become adults.

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.450 align:middle line:10%
In the small island
nation of Vanuatu,

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:47.460 align:middle line:10%
boys at the age of 7 or 8 begin
bungee jumping, oftentimes

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:51.850 align:middle line:10%
off a 98-foot tall tower with
a vine tied to their ankles,

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:56.240 align:middle line:10%
to symbolize their bravery and
their ascent into adulthood.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Among the Apache
of North America,

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:01.040 align:middle line:84%
the young girls must
complete the sunrise ceremony

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.520 align:middle line:84%
after their first menstruation,
in which they paint themselves

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:08.390 align:middle line:84%
and reenact the Apache origin
myth of the first woman.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:11.210 align:middle line:84%
For four days, they are
not to touch their skin

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.910 align:middle line:90%
and can only drink water.

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:17.180 align:middle line:84%
The Inuit youth are brought
into the harsh arctic weather

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.260 align:middle line:84%
to learn to speak
with animals and hunt.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:23.740 align:middle line:10%
At age 13, the boys of
the Sateré-Mawé tribe

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.520 align:middle line:10%
in the Brazilian jungle wear
gloves filled with bullet ants,

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:30.430 align:middle line:10%
which cause extreme
throbbing pain.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:33.160 align:middle line:10%
All of these rites of
passage call upon the youth

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.710 align:middle line:10%
to engage with their
community and perform

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:38.290 align:middle line:10%
some sacrificial ritual
in order to become

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:41.140 align:middle line:10%
an adult in that
particular tribe.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.810 align:middle line:84%
But these communities weren't
simply initiating people

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:45.430 align:middle line:90%
into adulthood.

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:48.100 align:middle line:84%
They were integrating them
into a healing tradition,

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.040 align:middle line:84%
in order to serve others
and the planet at large.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.670 align:middle line:84%
For the hallmark of
a functional society

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:58.130 align:middle line:84%
is peaceful and intelligent
community goals.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the classic
features of shamanism was that

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:05.050 align:middle line:84%
the neophyte who was trying to
develop shamanic skills would

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:08.740 align:middle line:84%
have to go through a very
arduous ritual ordeal,

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:12.820 align:middle line:84%
often spending weeks or more
alone in the wilderness,

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.640 align:middle line:84%
and often with the expectation
that they were going to have

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:19.180 align:middle line:84%
to encounter and deal
with the animals--

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:21.370 align:middle line:84%
the beasts-- that
came to kill them.

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think that this reflects
a primordial human concern.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Once we become conscious, we
realize we're going to die.

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:30.970 align:middle line:84%
Your dog doesn't know
he's going to die.

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:33.442 align:middle line:84%
The antelope out on the
plains doesn't worry about

00:21:33.442 --> 00:21:35.650 align:middle line:84%
whether or not the tiger or
lion's going to eat him--

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:36.660 align:middle line:90%
unless it's right there.

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:39.550 align:middle line:84%
But we have a consciousness
to project into the future

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.170 align:middle line:84%
and say, eventually,
it's my turn.

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:43.975 align:middle line:84%
So how do we deal
with this angst,

00:21:43.975 --> 00:21:46.050 align:middle line:90%
this anxiety about death?

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, shamanic
practices had a variety

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.740 align:middle line:84%
of different ways of
addressing this death concern,

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:53.980 align:middle line:84%
and one was that you
acquired an understanding

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.360 align:middle line:90%
of your spiritual nature--

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.510 align:middle line:84%
that the body dies,
but the spirit doesn't.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And so people move
beyond the concern

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.690 align:middle line:84%
about their physical demise to
understanding this continuity

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:06.700 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual existence.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>> The realization
that someone comes to--

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.020 align:middle line:90%
that one day they will die--

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:13.570 align:middle line:90%
doesn't sink in all at once.

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:16.300 align:middle line:84%
It takes many moments of
considering the implications

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.780 align:middle line:84%
of this final event to truly
make an impact on that person's

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:21.700 align:middle line:90%
daily life.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Some people, perhaps, never
come to this realization.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.890 align:middle line:84%
So to fully integrate
the knowledge

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:30.340 align:middle line:84%
that one day this body will
die and return to the earth,

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.580 align:middle line:84%
tribes have traditionally
used extreme rites of passage,

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:36.670 align:middle line:84%
as well as psychedelic
plant ceremonies.

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Without dedicated moments
of focusing on mortality,

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.070 align:middle line:84%
we may never fully
realize the importance

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:46.840 align:middle line:84%
of living life as if we truly
know it will one day end.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.360 align:middle line:84%
Those who have gone through
near-death experiences

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.130 align:middle line:84%
have reported much
of the same phenomena

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.140 align:middle line:90%
as psychedelic journeys.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:57.610 align:middle line:84%
Portals of light, other-worldly
beings and ancestors,

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:00.280 align:middle line:84%
timelessness, and
even the total life

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.380 align:middle line:84%
reviews that cause
them to re-evaluate

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.580 align:middle line:90%
what matters to them.

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.480 align:middle line:84%
They often report that they
felt every harsh word or action

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.030 align:middle line:84%
that they've ever given,
but from the other person's

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:11.650 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:14.320 align:middle line:84%
Another commonality between
near-death experiences

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.380 align:middle line:84%
and deep psychedelic
ceremonies is the realization

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.390 align:middle line:84%
of how we truly use
the precious time

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:22.780 align:middle line:84%
that we're given in this body,
and that this fleeting moment

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.690 align:middle line:84%
of life between birth and
death should be devoted

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:27.670 align:middle line:90%
to the people around us.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:31.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, all of life seeks
to integrate and support

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:33.940 align:middle line:84%
each other as one
living organism.

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>> You couldn't develop
consciousness in a vacuum.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:40.120 align:middle line:84%
It takes an
interaction of things.

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And all of life is really
an interaction of things.

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:47.755 align:middle line:90%
The body you see before you--

00:23:47.755 --> 00:23:50.020 align:middle line:84%
they say every seven
years, I've completely

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:55.910 align:middle line:84%
gone through all my cellular
matter and reproduce new cells.

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:57.250 align:middle line:90%
My old cells have died off.

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:58.150 align:middle line:90%
Hair's fallen off.

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:00.940 align:middle line:84%
Skin's fallen off, and
I'm completely rebuilt.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.290 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with consciousness.

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:05.830 align:middle line:10%
I was on my 30th birthday,
and I was kind of depressed.

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:07.720 align:middle line:10%
My first book hadn't
been published yet,

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.940 align:middle line:10%
and I was feeling like
kind of a failure.

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And I did some mushrooms,
and I was just like--

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.378 align:middle line:84%
I started out with a friend,
but I was being such a bummer,

00:24:14.378 --> 00:24:15.970 align:middle line:90%
I think he just went home.

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was lying in this
bathtub, having a bath,

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:22.690 align:middle line:90%
feeling sorry for myself.

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And there was this spider plant
hanging above the bath tub.

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:28.990 align:middle line:10%
And it was just
dry as dry, and I

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:31.390 align:middle line:10%
could see its
roots and tentacles

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:36.370 align:middle line:10%
vibrating, sensing the wealth
of water that I was in,

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:37.720 align:middle line:10%
just going like this.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And I cupped my hand and I
put the water up to his roots,

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.780 align:middle line:84%
and it just went
[WHOOSH OF AIR] limp,

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.600 align:middle line:84%
and just started sucking the
water right out of my hands.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And it just totally brought
the whole thing to life for me

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.550 align:middle line:84%
in a fascinating
way that I don't

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:56.590 align:middle line:84%
think I would have
ever noticed had it not

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:58.480 align:middle line:84%
been for the effects
of the mushrooms.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I think that
it makes us realize

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:05.650 align:middle line:90%
that we are on Mother Earth.

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:07.240 align:middle line:90%
That's what these plants offer.

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the message.

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:12.370 align:middle line:84%
We have to re-understand
that we are part of nature.

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:15.540 align:middle line:10%
We're not in control of it.

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:23.320 align:middle line:10%
And we are potentially capable
of damaging it very severely

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:27.370 align:middle line:10%
by upsetting and
destabilizing all

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:33.280 align:middle line:10%
of these homeostatic
processes that keep Gaia--

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.160 align:middle line:10%
the Gaia organism--
in equilibrium.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.420 align:middle line:90%
We need to wake up.

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.930 align:middle line:84%
I think the plant teachers
have been urging us

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:44.680 align:middle line:84%
to wake up as long as we've
been associated with them,

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.020 align:middle line:90%
but we're not very--

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:50.350 align:middle line:84%
we don't listen very well, and
it's getting even more urgent.

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:51.890 align:middle line:90%
First you have to wake up.

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:53.540 align:middle line:90%
Then you have to wise up.

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.460 align:middle line:84%
You have to have the
realization, then

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:57.560 align:middle line:90%
what do you do about it?

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.300 align:middle line:90%
That is trickier.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:04.100 align:middle line:90%
But I think it's inevitable.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>> According to many
conversations surrounding this

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:10.760 align:middle line:84%
topic, the most important thing
we can wake up to is the nature

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.500 align:middle line:90%
of our individual egos--

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.910 align:middle line:84%
the collection of beliefs
and behavioral patterns

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:18.170 align:middle line:90%
we have about ourselves.

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:21.770 align:middle line:84%
The ego often wants to
know all and control all

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:25.280 align:middle line:84%
in order to ensure no one
else can take what is ours.

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.860 align:middle line:84%
But this violent cycle
of fighting for our place

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:32.280 align:middle line:84%
at the expense of others
is fantasy, not reality.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:35.240 align:middle line:84%
The web of life is already
functional without our desire

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:38.330 align:middle line:84%
to exploit it and milk
it for everything we can.

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:40.790 align:middle line:84%
This is called
scarcity mentality--

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:43.110 align:middle line:84%
the belief that there
isn't enough for everyone,

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.310 align:middle line:90%
so I better get mine.

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, when
someone is in this mode,

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:51.460 align:middle line:84%
it is difficult to wake
up to its inadequacy,

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.980 align:middle line:84%
especially when surrounded
by others that are also

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:57.130 align:middle line:90%
stuck in scarcity mentality.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:01.210 align:middle line:84%
So the process of waking up is
a surrender and the letting go

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:03.910 align:middle line:84%
of our ambition to have
more than others and more

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:05.620 align:middle line:90%
than we need.

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:08.500 align:middle line:84%
From there, the
wising up process

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:12.130 align:middle line:84%
consists only of peacefully
and intelligently integrating

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:16.090 align:middle line:84%
with the one dynamic web of life
that we are all dancing upon,

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:19.420 align:middle line:84%
a surrender to the
flowing river of life.

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And the punchline at the
end of this divine comedy

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.630 align:middle line:84%
is that one way or
another, through intention

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:29.830 align:middle line:84%
or exhaustion, the
river will win.

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:33.250 align:middle line:84%
But why, then, does the ego
seem so afraid of surrendering

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.061 align:middle line:90%
to the ways of the universe?

00:27:35.061 --> 00:27:38.290 align:middle line:90%


00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:39.860 align:middle line:90%
>> The ego wants closure.

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.190 align:middle line:90%
It wants a complete explanation.

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:46.090 align:middle line:84%
The beginning of
wisdom, I believe,

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:50.950 align:middle line:84%
is the ability to accept
an inherent messiness

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:54.850 align:middle line:84%
in your explanation
of what's going on,

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:59.080 align:middle line:84%
because nowhere is it writ
that human minds should

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:02.430 align:middle line:84%
be able to give a full
accounting of creation

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:04.510 align:middle line:84%
in all dimensions
and on all levels.

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:07.100 align:middle line:90%


00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:13.010 align:middle line:10%
The universe, at this moment,
is a tremendously complicated,

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:17.240 align:middle line:10%
integrated, multi-level thing.

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:21.650 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps what the universe
is is a kind of system

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:26.180 align:middle line:10%
in which more advanced
forms of order

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:32.120 align:middle line:10%
actually influence previous
states of organization.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.310 align:middle line:10%
They are attractors.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:37.370 align:middle line:10%
That means that
they exert influence

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:41.210 align:middle line:10%
on less-organized
states, and pull them

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:45.500 align:middle line:10%
toward some kind of end state.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:50.420 align:middle line:84%
The attractor is at the bottom
of a very deep pit into which

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:55.450 align:middle line:90%
all phenomena is cascading.

00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>> All life is truly a lesson,
and the attractor that Terence

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:02.890 align:middle line:84%
speaks of is that invisible
compelling force that calls us

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:05.500 align:middle line:90%
to continue learning in life.

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:08.050 align:middle line:84%
The increasing complexity
of the universe

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:11.470 align:middle line:84%
may be exactly what calls us to
abandon the ambition of knowing

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:14.230 align:middle line:84%
everything, or
playing every role,

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:18.340 align:middle line:84%
and to simply play our own role,
to keep observing and engaging

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:21.160 align:middle line:84%
reality in order to use
the information that we

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:23.470 align:middle line:90%
do have more wisely.

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the evolution of
complexity in the universe

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.530 align:middle line:84%
is a reflection of our capacity
to understand and utilize

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:31.850 align:middle line:90%
more complex information.

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most complex and
malleable instruments we use

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:39.260 align:middle line:84%
is the mysterious and
ever-evolving human brain.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.530 align:middle line:10%
>> The brain is a
product of evolution,

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:49.660 align:middle line:10%
and the brain evolved as a
profound information generator.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:53.660 align:middle line:84%
It generates an inordinate
amount of complex information,

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.230 align:middle line:84%
but also to receive and
process information.

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And the environment is also
an information generator.

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:00.520 align:middle line:90%
The environment is full.

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.277 align:middle line:84%
The external world is
full of information,

00:30:02.277 --> 00:30:04.360 align:middle line:84%
and this information is
always entering the brain.

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.590 align:middle line:84%
But the brain needs to learn
to sample information that is

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:11.040 align:middle line:90%
useful and to learn from that.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, sensory
information sculpts the brain.

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:19.510 align:middle line:84%
It's sculpts the connectivity--
the patterns of connectivity.

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:21.760 align:middle line:90%
All of these neurons--

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.420 align:middle line:90%
these cells in the brain--

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:25.810 align:middle line:84%
they are connected in
an extremely complex,

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:26.670 align:middle line:90%
intricate pattern.

00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:29.080 align:middle line:84%
As sensory information
enters the brain,

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.070 align:middle line:90%
it changes the structure.

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Perhaps the universe
itself is one single phenomena

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:38.590 align:middle line:84%
overflowing with information,
and our brains are the part

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:41.710 align:middle line:84%
of that phenomena that
collects, processes,

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:45.310 align:middle line:84%
and generates new combinations
and patterns in service

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:49.300 align:middle line:84%
to an ever-evolving relationship
between creation itself

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:52.550 align:middle line:84%
and that which is
continually creating it.

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:55.630 align:middle line:10%
If psychedelic plants truly
break down old beliefs

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:58.690 align:middle line:10%
and thought patterns to make
way for the new, the way

a wildfire clears the
debris from a forest

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:04.390 align:middle line:10%
so new life can grow,
then maybe the process

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:06.730 align:middle line:10%
of integrating into
the cosmos is not

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:11.490 align:middle line:10%
a dilemma to be solved,
but a dance to be danced.

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:13.530 align:middle line:84%
The idea of solving
problems only

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:17.760 align:middle line:84%
allows for win, lose,
or draw scenarios.

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.280 align:middle line:84%
If life were viewed more as a
relationship of moving parts--

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.480 align:middle line:84%
a cosmic dance do
engage with, learn from,

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.370 align:middle line:90%
and perpetually refine--

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:27.900 align:middle line:84%
then the outcome
wouldn't be limited

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:33.240 align:middle line:84%
by who gets what in the end, but
by how deeply we've connected.

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the point
of living is not

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:37.050 align:middle line:84%
a measure of the
individual puzzle

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:40.660 align:middle line:84%
pieces, but how they integrate
into the full picture of life

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:41.460 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:44.040 align:middle line:90%
