00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Those who have navigated
the rabbit hole of strange

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.860 align:middle line:84%
experiences that psychedelic
plants illicit have probably

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.640 align:middle line:84%
asked themselves at one
point, what is reality?

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.340 align:middle line:84%
How do we know
this world is real

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.350 align:middle line:84%
and the strange
world of psychedelics

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.120 align:middle line:90%
is just a distortion?

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And there is no better candidate
to evoke this kind of response

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.310 align:middle line:84%
than dimethyltryptamine, or
more commonly known as DMT.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.560 align:middle line:10%
N, N-dimethyltryptamine
was first

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.590 align:middle line:10%
synthesized in 1931
by chemist Richard

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.900 align:middle line:10%
Manske in Berlin, Germany.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.000 align:middle line:84%
The psychedelic effects
and its connection

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.970 align:middle line:84%
with Amazonian snuffs
like yopo and beverages

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.900 align:middle line:84%
like yage and ayahuasca
were unknown at this time.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.230 align:middle line:10%
It would be another 25 years
until Hungarian chemist

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.696 align:middle line:10%
and psychiatrist Stephen
Szara synthesized DMT in 1956,

00:01:12.696 --> 00:01:14.070 align:middle line:10%
because he couldn't
get his hands

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.680 align:middle line:10%
on psilocybin or mescaline.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.540 align:middle line:84%
He read a paper
about South American

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.060 align:middle line:84%
hallucinogens
containing this compound

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and wanted to see if
this was, in fact,

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.580 align:middle line:84%
the compound responsible
for these strange visions.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Oral doses were
administered to no avail.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.920 align:middle line:84%
But he intuited that
another method might

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.640 align:middle line:90%
provide different results.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.650 align:middle line:84%
So he injected himself
N, N-dimethyltryptamine

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.710 align:middle line:84%
and was the first to publicize
this new psychedelic substance.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.750 align:middle line:84%
But was this the
first time humanity

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.890 align:middle line:84%
had discovered the visionary
properties of this compound?

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.010 align:middle line:84%
A quick look back into
ancient Egyptian history

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.640 align:middle line:84%
and their sacred tree of life
might tell a different story.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.550 align:middle line:10%
>> You'll always find these
acacias along the edge

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.070 align:middle line:10%
of the stream beds that
flood occasionally.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.070 align:middle line:84%
You won't see them
halfway up the cliff.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they'll
be a few feet above.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.120 align:middle line:84%
They've got to get those
roots out into that stream bed

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.160 align:middle line:90%
or they don't survive.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.820 align:middle line:84%
When it doesn't flood, sometimes
as much as 10 years or more

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm told, the tree
will go dormant,

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.370 align:middle line:84%
and it'll stand here
as if it's dead.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Then suddenly years
later, you get a flood,

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.420 align:middle line:90%
and it'll come back to life.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Osiris was known to the
ancient Egyptians as the god

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.190 align:middle line:84%
of transition, rebirth,
and regeneration.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.430 align:middle line:84%
The myth Osiris is that
he was locked in a chest

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.350 align:middle line:84%
and thrown into the Nile River
by his jealous brother, Set.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.500 align:middle line:84%
The chest washed ashore
in the city of Byblos,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.800 align:middle line:84%
where some say an acacia
tree grew around it, housing

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.700 align:middle line:84%
the spirit of Osiris, which his
wife Isis eventually recovers.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.070 align:middle line:10%
If it is possible that
the Egyptians discovered

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.260 align:middle line:10%
the properties of
the acacia tree,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.840 align:middle line:10%
then a psychedelic
death-rebirth connection

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.940 align:middle line:10%
might have come from
the experience elicited

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.140 align:middle line:10%
by one of its compounds.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.450 align:middle line:10%
>> If you look at families
that are known to contain DMT

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.320 align:middle line:10%
or tryptamines like
acacias, for example,

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.850 align:middle line:10%
some of the most potent sources
of DMT known are acacias.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's about
1,200 species of acacias.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Probably 75% of
those contain DMT.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.380 align:middle line:10%
So it's very common in nature.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not an exaggeration to say
that nature is drenched in DMT.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Acacia trees were well
known in ancient Egypt,

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.450 align:middle line:90%
as well as in the Middle East.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.880 align:middle line:84%
If these civilizations
were experimenters

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.420 align:middle line:84%
with local botanicals, as the
tribes of the Amazon were,

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.140 align:middle line:84%
it is possible that one of the
local MAOI-containing plants,

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.320 align:middle line:84%
such as Syrian rue, which was
common in the Middle East,

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.620 align:middle line:84%
could have made it into an
admixture with the acacia tree.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Even yohimbe bark
known to contain MAOI,

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.650 align:middle line:84%
originated from
South and West Africa

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.650 align:middle line:84%
and was probably imported
to ancient Egypt.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.410 align:middle line:84%
There is no
archaeological evidence

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.650 align:middle line:84%
to support this specific
ayahuasca-like concoction.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.890 align:middle line:84%
But it is long known that the
ancient Egyptians experimented

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.040 align:middle line:84%
with the psychoactive
blue lilies for ceremony.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.370 align:middle line:10%
The acacia was supposedly used
for the Ark of the Covenant,

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.880 align:middle line:10%
insinuating that the wood
embodies an arcane secret.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.550 align:middle line:84%
The Freemasons use the
acacia in their symbolism

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.710 align:middle line:90%
for the immortality of the soul.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.650 align:middle line:10%
As the master architect
of King Solomon's temple,

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.650 align:middle line:10%
Hiram Abiff was buried
with a sprig of acacia

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.120 align:middle line:10%
to mark the grave.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.760 align:middle line:84%
It is also said that the
Hebrews planted acacia

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.450 align:middle line:84%
at the head of a grave of a
deceased partner or friend.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Across the ocean
in South America,

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.480 align:middle line:84%
the ayahuasca brew is also known
as the vine of the dead or vine

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.950 align:middle line:84%
of the soul, which the syncretic
ayahuasca UDV Church claims

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.890 align:middle line:84%
that King Solomon paid a little
known visit to the Amazon

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.010 align:middle line:84%
in antiquity and imparted
the knowledge of ayahuasca

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.510 align:middle line:90%
to the indigenous.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.270 align:middle line:84%
Though these myths
remain circumstantial;

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.330 align:middle line:84%
the veneration of these plants
in ancient civilizations

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.500 align:middle line:84%
tend to spring from
their usefulness.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Any plant given
spiritual attributes

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.270 align:middle line:84%
is likely to have
properties that

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.580 align:middle line:84%
cause for higher
visions of reality that

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.530 align:middle line:84%
transcend the limits
of birth, death,

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.420 align:middle line:90%
and three-dimensional reality.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Today, DMT far
exceeds this criteria.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So, what exactly are
dimethyltryptamine's effects

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.780 align:middle line:90%
on consciousness?

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>> It begins very quickly.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.010 align:middle line:10%
You begin to feel different
within a heartbeat or two

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.480 align:middle line:10%
after the completion
of the injection.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.610 align:middle line:84%
There's a feeling
of acceleration

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and inner-psychic tension
that begins and builds quite

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.860 align:middle line:90%
rapidly, almost overwhelmingly.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.300 align:middle line:84%
The visual image of the room,
if you had your eyes open,

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.610 align:middle line:84%
would start to break out in
a pixelation kind of pattern.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.130 align:middle line:84%
If your eyes are
closed at that stage,

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.690 align:middle line:84%
it's a display of
kaleidoscopic images.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:02.270 align:middle line:84%
Also during that time is a
high pitch kind of sound.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Usually high pitch-- it could
be oscillating "wa, wa, wa"

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.470 align:middle line:90%
kind of sound.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Might be some crinkling
kinds of sounds.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.940 align:middle line:84%
But it's increasing
in intensity.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's crescendoing,
which kind of

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.720 align:middle line:84%
parallels the anxiety or
the feeling of stimulation.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And then you just
break out of your body.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.520 align:middle line:84%
It's as if the internal pressure
just can't be held in the body

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.730 align:middle line:84%
anymore, and your
consciousness breaks loose.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And you know, that's kind of
the plateau between two minutes

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.840 align:middle line:90%
and seven minutes or so.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.390 align:middle line:90%
And then you start coming down.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:43.970 align:middle line:90%
And things slowly recongeal.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>> The rapidity, intensity,
and conventional insanity

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.810 align:middle line:84%
of the experience has caused
word to reach the public

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.500 align:middle line:84%
through the internet, as well as
authors and researchers writing

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.420 align:middle line:90%
and speaking on the matter.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Another hot topic is that DMT
is an endogenous compound,

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.980 align:middle line:84%
meaning it's produced
naturally in the human body.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And yet no definitive
explanation for this

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.296 align:middle line:90%
has been discovered.

00:07:07.296 --> 00:07:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a huge amount
of it in the lungs.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.170 align:middle line:10%
That's where most of is.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.290 align:middle line:10%
But it's throughout all
the tissues in the body.

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.170 align:middle line:84%
No one knows what it's
doing in the lungs.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Interesting work is
being done right now

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.020 align:middle line:90%
on the endogenous functions.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.860 align:middle line:10%
There's a very interesting
book just published

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.560 align:middle line:10%
called, "Questions
for the Lion Tamer."

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.660 align:middle line:10%
It's about endogenous DMT.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.740 align:middle line:10%
And it's relating
that to all these

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.670 align:middle line:10%
other rather
interesting what you

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.790 align:middle line:10%
might call physiological
states, which

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:45.990 align:middle line:10%
have to do with gamma-wave
activation in the brain,

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:49.110 align:middle line:10%
and which DMT can
reliably do this.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>> The gamma-brain-wave state
is associated with high-level

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.890 align:middle line:84%
cognitive function and
peak concentration,

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:58.010 align:middle line:84%
as seen in studies with
meditating monks and nuns.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Gamma waves originate
in the thalamus

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.740 align:middle line:84%
and move back and forth through
the three lobes of the brain

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.960 align:middle line:90%
about 40 times per second.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.170 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it is credited
with integrative processing,

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:12.280 align:middle line:84%
the flow state that athletes
and musicians experience,

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.990 align:middle line:84%
and improves memory,
mood, and seems

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.320 align:middle line:84%
to optimize many natural
functions of the brain.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.020 align:middle line:10%
>> And what I see is happening
is that as a consequence

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.590 align:middle line:10%
of the destabilization of
this central control center

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:28.130 align:middle line:10%
that's linked to the prefrontal
cortex and our egoic thinking

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.940 align:middle line:10%
in the top down
management of the brain.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.559 align:middle line:84%
And so what's happening is
that the kind of material

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:37.190 align:middle line:84%
that is normally left in the
unconscious or the subconscious

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.490 align:middle line:84%
is now being forced up into
the front of the brain.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.610 align:middle line:84%
So, it's as if these
deep parts of the brain,

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.830 align:middle line:84%
these ancient aspects
and are called

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.440 align:middle line:84%
the reptilian brain and
the paleomammalian brain

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.510 align:middle line:84%
are being liberated
and integrated

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:52.580 align:middle line:90%
into our conscious awareness.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.730 align:middle line:84%
>> This high-level integrative
processing of ancient neural

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.850 align:middle line:84%
functions might account for
the deeply profound visions

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.210 align:middle line:84%
and feelings of experiencing
and conquering death.

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:03.950 align:middle line:10%
But this still
doesn't answer what

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.570 align:middle line:10%
DMT's function is in the body.

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Many believe it's an ancestral
neurotransmitter that

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:12.080 align:middle line:84%
used to be more
prominent in our lineage

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.630 align:middle line:84%
before modern diets and
lifestyles diminished

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.400 align:middle line:90%
its effectiveness.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.710 align:middle line:84%
Others have suggested
that DMT might

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.050 align:middle line:84%
be a prenatal
neurotransmitter that

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.660 align:middle line:84%
builds the perception
of the pre-birth world,

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.840 align:middle line:84%
then gets replaced by
serotonin shortly after birth

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.080 align:middle line:84%
to create the consensus
world that we all perceive.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Both compounds cause the
brain to generate distinctly

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.180 align:middle line:90%
different models of reality.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.790 align:middle line:90%
But what is a model of reality?

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.600 align:middle line:90%
Isn't there only one?

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.280 align:middle line:10%
The neurobiologist and chemical
pharmacologist Andrew Gallimore

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.300 align:middle line:10%
has been studying
this exact theory.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Seeing a world is
not a passive process.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.290 align:middle line:10%
It's always an active process.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.224 align:middle line:10%
The brain is a world-builder.

00:09:52.224 --> 00:09:54.140 align:middle line:84%
You can separate the
information, if you like,

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.520 align:middle line:90%
into two parts--

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.100 align:middle line:84%
the information generated by a
brain and all the information

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.040 align:middle line:84%
being generated by whatever's
outside your brain.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.320 align:middle line:84%
You can call it the
external world, if you like.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.620 align:middle line:10%
Your brain is an
information-generator.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And your world is built from
the information generated

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:10.970 align:middle line:90%
by your brain.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And this applies under
all circumstances.

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:17.700 align:middle line:84%
So whether you are in
normal waking life,

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:22.340 align:middle line:84%
when you descend into REM
sleep at night when you dream,

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:29.450 align:middle line:84%
but also if you're on the peak
of a high-power DMT experience.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:32.370 align:middle line:84%
The world is always
built from information.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.790 align:middle line:84%
So, the idea that one world
is real and another world

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:36.590 align:middle line:90%
is unreal--

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.350 align:middle line:84%
the idea that this
waking world is real

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:43.950 align:middle line:84%
and yet the DMT state is not
real is not really supported.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Most people, when they hear
about these strange worlds,

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:52.300 align:middle line:84%
will say this is a
distortion of reality.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.640 align:middle line:84%
This is, perhaps, a breakdown
of the brain's ability

00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:00.510 align:middle line:84%
to construct the correct
model of reality.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:03.890 align:middle line:84%
But there is no true
model of reality.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.230 align:middle line:84%
People always have this
assumption, perhaps,

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:09.090 align:middle line:84%
that the world they
inhabit is the real one.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
important to them.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:15.165 align:middle line:84%
What psychedelics do
is they break down

00:11:15.165 --> 00:11:17.540 align:middle line:84%
the kind of the boundary
between the real and the unreal.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.081 align:middle line:84%
And they show you actually that
the world is much more fluid.

00:11:20.081 --> 00:11:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>> The notion that what we
perceive is merely the way we

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.060 align:middle line:84%
and our neurochemistry
causes the information around

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:29.660 align:middle line:84%
and within us to build our
world is mirrored by stand-up

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:33.770 align:middle line:84%
comedian and psychedelic
researcher Shane Mauss.

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of what we consciously
see we take as fact.

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.090 align:middle line:84%
This is a metaphor for
our perception in general.

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:44.720 align:middle line:10%
I don't think we should
trust any of our perception.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:52.370 align:middle line:10%
I think all of our perceptions
are fickle and subjective.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think we should be
really questioning all of them.

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.500 align:middle line:90%
This life is a trip.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:02.000 align:middle line:84%
This life is just as trippy
as any psychedelic experience

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.260 align:middle line:90%
you could ever have.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.890 align:middle line:84%
It's just we spend so
much time in this world

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:11.660 align:middle line:84%
that we are bored by
this trip that we're on.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And a psychedelic journey is
such a short amount of time.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's so intense,
so novel, so salient.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:23.030 align:middle line:84%
The brain loves latching
onto stuff like that.

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:24.980 align:middle line:90%
That's why it seems so true.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.440 align:middle line:84%
>> If it is true that
perceptions are merely the way

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.980 align:middle line:84%
we decode information around
us, and those perceptions are

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.430 align:middle line:84%
subject to personal
and cultural biases,

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:36.470 align:middle line:90%
the question still remains--

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.830 align:middle line:84%
why would psychedelics have
the seemingly primary function

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:41.690 align:middle line:90%
of altering our perception?

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And do all
psychedelic substances

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.770 align:middle line:90%
alter us in the same way?

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>> The LSD,
psilocybin, mescaline--

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:54.010 align:middle line:84%
they change the world
to be novel, more fluid,

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:56.050 align:middle line:90%
more unpredictable.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:59.360 align:middle line:84%
But they seem to
change this world.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:03.380 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be an alternate
version of the consensus world.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.420 align:middle line:90%
Whereas DMT is different.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.800 align:middle line:84%
DMT changes the
information generated

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.500 align:middle line:84%
by the brain in
such a profound way

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.780 align:middle line:84%
that it is essentially
what Terence McKenna used

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:15.890 align:middle line:90%
to call a 100% reality switch.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:18.240 align:middle line:84%
It switches the brain
very, very rapidly

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:22.170 align:middle line:84%
within 30 seconds from
constructing the consensus

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:28.320 align:middle line:84%
world to constructing this
bizarre, highly-complex alien

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.230 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And it does it with
great efficiency.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Psychiatrist Rick Strassman,
who did the first DMT studies

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.780 align:middle line:10%
in the early 1990s
after the prohibition,

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.760 align:middle line:10%
published the reports in
his book titled, "DMT:

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.320 align:middle line:10%
The Spirit Molecule."

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.780 align:middle line:10%
This was the point where
many case reports started

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.030 align:middle line:10%
showing very similar
phenomena happening

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.590 align:middle line:10%
under the influence of DMT.

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the things
that's unique about DMT is that

00:13:55.290 --> 00:14:01.320 align:middle line:84%
it seems to get one into a state
where there is an intelligence.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And so there's been
a lot of speculation

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.190 align:middle line:90%
as to what that might be.

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Might it be
extra-dimensional beings?

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Or might just be
activation of certain areas

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.810 align:middle line:84%
of the brain or
something in between,

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:20.820 align:middle line:90%
like psychological processes?

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:25.350 align:middle line:84%
So that's a unique
property of DMT.

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And we ought to not
necessarily limit

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:34.030 align:middle line:84%
our scope of it investigating
what it might be.

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:37.180 align:middle line:10%
>> DMT is in a class of its own.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.860 align:middle line:10%
It takes us into a
reality that both feels

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:44.580 align:middle line:10%
more real than this
one and is inhabited

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:50.490 align:middle line:10%
by entities that feel more
real than this world as well.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:53.610 align:middle line:84%
So, coming out of an
experience like that where

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:58.320 align:middle line:84%
whether or not it's
true, it feels true.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And it creates an opportunity to
reassess your entire worldview,

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:09.180 align:middle line:84%
your spiritual, religious,
and materialistic worldview.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.790 align:middle line:84%
It brings everything
into question.

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>> The hot topic that has
emerged from DMT studies is

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:17.820 align:middle line:84%
the recurring theme of
the well-ordered structure

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle line:84%
of the place it seems to
send people and the feelings

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.440 align:middle line:84%
of entities
inhabiting this space.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.050 align:middle line:84%
There are accounts
of this happening

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:28.380 align:middle line:84%
through the DMT-containing
brew ayahuasca, as well.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.780 align:middle line:84%
There are sparse accounts
of other psychedelic plants

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.390 align:middle line:84%
transporting people's
minds to other places

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.430 align:middle line:90%
to visit other-worldly beings.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Even psychological
illness has been

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.180 align:middle line:90%
known to show similar traits.

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:43.380 align:middle line:84%
However, it is the sheer amount
of reports from DMT alone

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and the peculiar realness
of this space and the beings

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.530 align:middle line:84%
that cause for a deeper interest
in this compound's effects

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:50.940 align:middle line:90%
on consciousness.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.060 align:middle line:84%
Author and psychedelic
researcher Graham Hancock

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.400 align:middle line:84%
has pored over the
DMT trip reports

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.620 align:middle line:84%
and found correlations
with shamanic reports

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.900 align:middle line:90%
of altered or expanded states.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>> They experience encounters
with supernatural beings,

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:05.190 align:middle line:90%
as they construe them.

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:07.800 align:middle line:10%
Those supernatural beings
may communicate with them

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.640 align:middle line:10%
telepathically.

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.250 align:middle line:10%
This is very common in
the shamanistic trance.

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.260 align:middle line:90%
They may give them teachings.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And very often, they'll have
a therianthropic appearance.

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:20.610 align:middle line:84%
They'd be part animal
and part human.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes they were
malevolent and frightening,

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:26.280 align:middle line:90%
scary, threatening.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.280 align:middle line:90%
They hurt people.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.070 align:middle line:84%
Other times, the
beings, or those things

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:37.180 align:middle line:84%
they encountered that they
called beings, were beneficent.

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.100 align:middle line:90%
They did healing.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.200 align:middle line:90%
They gave advice.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Some predicted or showed
volunteers the future.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:46.710 align:middle line:84%
Some were examining
the volunteers.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Some were putting
things in their bodies.

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.030 align:middle line:84%
But one of the hallmarks
of the interaction

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:54.810 align:middle line:84%
was the strength
of those beings.

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>> The experiences seemed
to be so life changing that

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:00.930 align:middle line:84%
maintaining the memory and
yet returning to the consensus

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:03.810 align:middle line:84%
world amongst people who can't
conceive of what just happened

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:07.079 align:middle line:84%
to you is a quality that
calls for community counseling

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:10.260 align:middle line:84%
and bonding among others
who've shared the experience.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.839 align:middle line:84%
Over 50% of
Strassman's volunteers

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:14.910 align:middle line:84%
reported beings
that felt distinctly

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:19.140 align:middle line:84%
individual from the volunteer
and indescribably real.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Out of 300 of Phillip Meyer's
trip reports, roughly 66%

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:26.430 align:middle line:84%
of them claimed encountering
intelligent creatures.

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Report number 213
said, "I did see

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:32.190 align:middle line:84%
intelligent insect-alien
god beings who

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:36.380 align:middle line:84%
explained that they had created
us and were us in the future.

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:40.080 align:middle line:84%
But that this was all taking
place outside of linear time."

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.740 align:middle line:84%
Report number 19 said, "A
gaggle of elf-like creatures

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.530 align:middle line:84%
in standard-issue
Irish elf costumes

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:49.530 align:middle line:84%
were doing strange things
with strange objects that

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:53.250 align:middle line:84%
seemed to be a weird hybrid
between crystals and machines."

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And well-known psychedelic
psychonaut Terence McKenna

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.680 align:middle line:84%
was very vocal about the
possibilities of what

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.840 align:middle line:90%
stories like this might mean.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.960 align:middle line:84%
As an avid psychedelic
psychonaut and philosopher,

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.810 align:middle line:84%
Terence half-jokingly
mentions global population

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:09.390 align:middle line:84%
and ecological
concerns that may call

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:12.240 align:middle line:84%
for outside-the-box
solutions, such as shrinking

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.940 align:middle line:84%
the size of humans to
the size of fruit flies

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.730 align:middle line:84%
or even exploring societal
functions within realms

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:20.640 align:middle line:84%
of the imagination to
perform future tasks

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.520 align:middle line:84%
rather than depleting
terrestrial resources.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.130 align:middle line:84%
He also lucidly acknowledges
the incredible leap

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:29.130 align:middle line:84%
that the modern mind must
make to accept solutions

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:31.530 align:middle line:84%
that technology and
modern science today

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.170 align:middle line:90%
is not capable of thinking.

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Yet, balances this by
emphasizing that these problems

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:37.710 align:middle line:90%
do need to be resolved.

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And even Albert Einstein said,
problems cannot be solved

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:44.220 align:middle line:84%
by the same level of
thinking that created them.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Can DMT be a physiological key
to unlock higher-level problem

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.620 align:middle line:90%
solving?

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I sincerely believe DMT
is pointing us into an area

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.910 align:middle line:84%
of reality that has not
had enough attention.

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
higher-dimensional nature

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:02.460 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.970 align:middle line:84%
We can try to
perceive or imagine

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:08.340 align:middle line:84%
what more than four
dimensions is like.

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:12.840 align:middle line:84%
But it's not possible in our
current and normal waking

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.920 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Whereas dimethyltryptamine
gives us an opportunity

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.130 align:middle line:84%
to perceive higher
dimensionally,

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:25.470 align:middle line:84%
to actually look at something
either internally or externally

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:29.430 align:middle line:84%
and see it from a space
that contains more than four

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:30.930 align:middle line:90%
dimensions.

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:34.680 align:middle line:84%
>> For space, time, and
form-related problems N,

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.100 align:middle line:84%
N-dimethyltryptamine might be
a revolutionary tool in future

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.300 align:middle line:90%
generations.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.280 align:middle line:84%
when major problems
need to be resolved

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.900 align:middle line:90%
in a short amount of time.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.165 align:middle line:84%
This specific compound
is commonly known

00:19:45.165 --> 00:19:48.360 align:middle line:84%
to generate unique geometric
visuals and interactions

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.070 align:middle line:90%
with strange beings.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.020 align:middle line:84%
However, there is
another form of DMT

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.550 align:middle line:84%
that has been used by the
indigenous of the Amazon

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:57.800 align:middle line:84%
in ayahuasca-like
brews called yage.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:02.170 align:middle line:84%
5-methoxy, or 5-MeO-DMT, is
quite a bit more potent than

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:03.780 align:middle line:90%
and N, N-DMT.

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And mixing these common doses
could cause respiratory arrest,

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:09.600 align:middle line:90%
among other issues on 5-MeO.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.320 align:middle line:84%
However, in the right amount
and under the proper supervision

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.540 align:middle line:84%
with a well-trained
sitter, it is

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.600 align:middle line:84%
said that the
experience of 5-MeO-DMT

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.890 align:middle line:84%
brings the user to a place
beyond time, space, and form.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:26.760 align:middle line:84%
>> 5-MeO-DMT is 5-methoxy
dimethyltryptamine.

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.920 align:middle line:84%
So it's slightly
different chemically.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:34.290 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of its effects,
5-MeO versus N, N-DMT

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:37.770 align:middle line:84%
are often referred to as
the power and the glory.

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:40.620 align:middle line:90%
5-MeO-DMT is the power.

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.780 align:middle line:90%
Whereas N, N-DMT is the glory.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.380 align:middle line:84%
N, N-DMT is the
highly-visual experience.

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Whereas 5-methoxy is often
completely non-visual.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:52.010 align:middle line:84%
But often-- a friend
once described to me--

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:55.380 align:middle line:84%
said that, DMT is like
the fifth dimension,

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:59.100 align:middle line:84%
and 5-methoxy DMT is
like the 12th dimension.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:04.920 align:middle line:84%
It almost takes you beyond
these worlds and into oneness

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:08.060 align:middle line:84%
into the white light,
as it's often described.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Often much more terrifying
with complete destruction

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:16.140 align:middle line:84%
of the ego, the complete
destruction of the self.

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Australian researcher
and journalist Rak Razam has

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:23.360 align:middle line:84%
studied Amazonian indigenous
uses and myths of DMT.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:27.120 align:middle line:10%
>> So, it seems to me that the
indigenous cultures say that

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.552 align:middle line:10%
there's a way to navigate the
tryptamine dimensionality.

00:21:30.552 --> 00:21:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And the way to do
that is to become

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:34.470 align:middle line:84%
empowered by
rejoining the light.

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Sequoia
tribe in Ecuador--

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:38.690 align:middle line:90%
they call their brew yage.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:39.490 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:41.730 align:middle line:90%
It's their word for ayahuasca.

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:44.460 align:middle line:84%
They say that the secret
of yage was given to them

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.280 align:middle line:84%
by the star people or
the heavenly beings which

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.500 align:middle line:90%
live in the light.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.510 align:middle line:84%
Many cultures across
Peru say that they

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:54.960 align:middle line:84%
were told to make ayahuasca by
the plants or different entity

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.820 align:middle line:90%
beings, and how they connect.

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.040 align:middle line:84%
The difference with
how they are is

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:02.750 align:middle line:84%
it contains wambisa, which
has 5-MeO-DMT, not the N,

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:05.430 align:middle line:84%
N-DMT in most other
brews in South America.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:08.930 align:middle line:84%
So, when you drink their
brew, they go to the light.

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>> The beta-Carbolines
in the ayahuasca vine are

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:15.780 align:middle line:84%
phytoreactive, meaning they
attack the bacterial, fungal,

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:20.250 align:middle line:84%
parasitic, and viral infections
when exposed to light.

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:22.680 align:middle line:84%
It has also been
suggested by Nick Sand

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:26.280 align:middle line:84%
that he discovered DMT's
piezoluminescent qualities.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Alexander Shulgin confirmed
this by saying, "A totally

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.910 align:middle line:84%
pure salt, when dry and
when shaken in the dark,

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:36.400 align:middle line:84%
will emit small flashes
of white light."

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.300 align:middle line:10%
Although it might seem likely
that all ceremonies containing

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.940 align:middle line:10%
DMT would be done
during the day,

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.850 align:middle line:10%
many Amazonian tribes will
only conduct the ayahuasca

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:47.040 align:middle line:10%
ceremonies in total darkness.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:50.410 align:middle line:10%
Although accredited
scientific research is scarce,

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:52.990 align:middle line:10%
authors Ross Heaven
and Simon Buxton

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:55.340 align:middle line:10%
write in the book,
"Darkness Visible,"

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:58.570 align:middle line:10%
that in total darkness,
melatonin is produced.

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:00.670 align:middle line:84%
But after three to
five days, it gets

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:04.960 align:middle line:84%
converted to pinoline, which
is an endogenous MAOI secreted

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.770 align:middle line:90%
by the pineal gland.

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:09.070 align:middle line:84%
It is suggested that the
secretion of pinoline

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:12.340 align:middle line:84%
triggers the production
of endogenous DMT, which

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.241 align:middle line:84%
would match the critical
ingredients of ayahuasca.

00:23:15.241 --> 00:23:18.330 align:middle line:90%


00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately,
scientific testing

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:25.080 align:middle line:84%
has not been done to
confirm or deny this claim.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.750 align:middle line:84%
The modern confusion
revolving around DMT

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.880 align:middle line:84%
and its peculiar
effects has to do

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.560 align:middle line:84%
with the newness
of the substance

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.870 align:middle line:84%
in the modern
materialist worldview,

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:36.510 align:middle line:84%
as well as the subjectivity
of the experience that

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:40.620 align:middle line:90%
springs forth after ingestion.

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Does endogenous DMT play a
crucial yet forgotten role

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:44.970 align:middle line:90%
in the human body?

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:47.710 align:middle line:90%


00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Are the visionary effects
simply the mind malfunctioning?

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Or are they glimpses
beyond the veil

00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:56.890 align:middle line:90%
of limited human perception?

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:59.470 align:middle line:90%


00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:03.670 align:middle line:10%
Rick Strassman, in his new book
"DMT: The Soul of Prophecy",

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:06.580 align:middle line:10%
takes a new look at the
common yet mysterious realm

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:08.170 align:middle line:10%
of imagination.

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, the importance of
the prophetic state to studying

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:13.630 align:middle line:84%
psychedelics, to
learning about them,

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:17.080 align:middle line:84%
to figuring out what they're
good for, how best to use them,

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:21.970 align:middle line:84%
we need to have as full
an account as possible.

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:23.870 align:middle line:90%
We can't limit ourselves.

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:27.670 align:middle line:84%
That's why I think there's
been a lot more resulting

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:31.120 align:middle line:84%
from the psychedelic
experience in our culture

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:35.500 align:middle line:84%
through the arts as opposed
to through the sciences.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the imagination
which is being stimulated,

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:41.080 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to the
intellect primarily.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:44.410 align:middle line:84%
You know, the intellect being
stimulated requires education.

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the imagination
is the point

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.290 align:middle line:90%
at which psychedelics act.

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:53.272 align:middle line:90%


00:24:53.272 --> 00:24:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>> At present, the imagination
is so scarcely understood that

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:00.970 align:middle line:84%
people are either left to the
conventional reductionist view

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:03.910 align:middle line:84%
that it's generated by
the brain or to mystical

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:06.160 align:middle line:90%
and philosophical explanations.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.950 align:middle line:84%
To know for certain whether
the DMT world actually

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:11.650 align:middle line:84%
exists, perhaps in
another dimension

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:14.200 align:middle line:84%
or in a future holding
space of potentiality

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.890 align:middle line:84%
called the imagination,
is beyond all conception,

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:21.220 align:middle line:84%
except to those who dare
to enter that space.

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether DMT is a
different dimension,

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:27.910 align:middle line:84%
or you're accessing this world
inside of your head that you

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:30.820 align:middle line:84%
don't normally have access
to, or you're seeing God,

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:35.230 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, the different
possibilities that there are

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:39.300 align:middle line:84%
are all pretty incredible
and are all pretty important

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.440 align:middle line:90%
and all worth looking into.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And definitely we do need to
get down to the bottom of it

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:47.290 align:middle line:90%
and learn more.

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>> In order to learn more,
there seems to be two distinct

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:51.490 align:middle line:90%
methods.

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Firstly is to dive headfirst
into the experience

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:56.860 align:middle line:84%
by ingesting the
psychedelic substance.

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:59.590 align:middle line:10%
Secondly is to study the
effects the substance has

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:02.980 align:middle line:10%
upon the body and the brain,
whether the substance is

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:06.196 align:middle line:10%
taken or produced endogenously.

00:26:06.196 --> 00:26:08.230 align:middle line:84%
The issue with the
second approach

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.210 align:middle line:84%
is that even with the
amount of research that

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:12.760 align:middle line:84%
has been conducted,
the data still

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:17.280 align:middle line:84%
must be interpreted by
limited human minds.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Most humble
researchers will admit

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:21.870 align:middle line:84%
that there is no solid
explanation as to what

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:29.100 align:middle line:84%
the DMT world is and why
DMT is produced in the body.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.380 align:middle line:10%
>> The suggestion is in
rats in the last year

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:35.430 align:middle line:10%
or so, there's been confirmation
that DMT is produced

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:36.930 align:middle line:10%
in the pineal gland in rats.

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:39.360 align:middle line:84%
But we do know in general
it's produced in the lungs,

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:44.460 align:middle line:84%
in the spinal fluid, in
different parts of our body.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And then it accumulates
and comes up.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:49.200 align:middle line:84%
So the pineal gland is
this almost mythical organ

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.086 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:26:50.086 --> 00:26:51.210 align:middle line:90%
They call it the third eye.

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:55.020 align:middle line:84%
The third eye appears in
Egyptian culture, the Eye of Ra

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:58.160 align:middle line:84%
in the mystical sort
of glyphs they have.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.410 align:middle line:90%
It's all through sort of--

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:02.460 align:middle line:84%
well, all through different
historical cultures

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.751 align:middle line:84%
the past that really revered
this idea of the third eye

00:27:04.751 --> 00:27:07.050 align:middle line:90%
as the gateway.

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The romantic obsession with
the pineal gland among mystics

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.620 align:middle line:84%
and psychedelic psychonauts
may have a neurophysiological

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:18.420 align:middle line:84%
basis, but is currently
still subject to debate.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the contention
that the Eye of Ra or Eye

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:24.540 align:middle line:84%
of Horus in the Egyptian culture
represented the pineal gland

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:28.140 align:middle line:84%
can only be seen with
a metaphorical leap.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.030 align:middle line:84%
Some suggest that
the connection lies

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:32.820 align:middle line:84%
in the myth where Horus
gives his eye to Osiris

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:34.470 align:middle line:90%
in the underworld.

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Osiris ate the eye
and was resurrected,

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:40.600 align:middle line:84%
which could fit with the
Eleusinian kykeon, Persian

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:45.300 align:middle line:84%
haoma, Vedic soma,
Amazonian ayahuasca; even

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.630 align:middle line:84%
the Mazatec mushroom rituals,
which regularly included

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:50.500 align:middle line:90%
death and rebirth experiences.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:53.140 align:middle line:90%


00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:58.590 align:middle line:84%
But at present, only
speculations can be made.

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps our ancestors
with cleaner diets

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and more nature-based lifestyles
produced larger amounts.

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the answer
is lost to history.

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the DMT world
inhabited by beings

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:14.940 align:middle line:84%
that appear to be
more real than real

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:19.300 align:middle line:84%
can only be explored by
ingesting exogenous sources.

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:21.700 align:middle line:90%
But one thing seems certain.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Romantics may preach
about the possibilities,

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.230 align:middle line:84%
and the skeptics may
scoff at the gaps.

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:29.320 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that a
psychedelic compound that

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.660 align:middle line:84%
causes the most
mysterious of effects

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:34.390 align:middle line:84%
is produced inside each
and every one of us

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:36.370 align:middle line:84%
is worthy of serious
investigation.

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:39.340 align:middle line:90%


00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:43.150 align:middle line:84%
Up next, join us as we dive
into the mysterious and ancient

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:47.050 align:middle line:84%
origins of psilocybin mushrooms
and the scientific research

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:48.790 align:middle line:84%
showing how they're
revolutionizing

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:53.010 align:middle line:84%
psychotherapy and
psychoneurotic exploration.

00:28:53.010 --> 00:29:02.486 align:middle line:90%
