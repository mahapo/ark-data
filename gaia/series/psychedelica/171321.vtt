>> Every night when we lay down
our day and exit the familiar

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.360 align:middle line:84%
world of waking consciousness,
we set sail for the other

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.980 align:middle line:90%
shore.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.700 align:middle line:90%
The dream world comes alive.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.360 align:middle line:84%
How did our ancient
ancestors view this space?

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.620 align:middle line:90%


00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Considered to be the
oldest continuous culture

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.320 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, the
Aboriginals of what is now

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.010 align:middle line:84%
called Australia believed
that all creation was birthed

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.000 align:middle line:84%
from what the West termed as
the Dreaming, the creation

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.290 align:middle line:84%
of the world, the
origins of knowledge.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.300 align:middle line:84%
The indigenous
tribes of Australia

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.550 align:middle line:84%
would use shamanic
ceremonies and miming

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.040 align:middle line:84%
dances to enter
this space, in which

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.030 align:middle line:84%
all ancestors and all
information was attainable.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.100 align:middle line:84%
The Westerners, who
attempted to translate

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.294 align:middle line:84%
the meaning of this space,
called it Dream Time.

00:01:24.294 --> 00:01:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Even in the Americas,
accessing the dreaming realm

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.860 align:middle line:84%
was a known phenomenon
among the indigenous.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Indigenous people of this
continent are all from the same

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.770 align:middle line:90%
DNA lineage.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.750 align:middle line:10%
It varies, of course.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.030 align:middle line:10%
But there is a common DNA thread
of all the indigenous people.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.010 align:middle line:90%
Basically, they're all related.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And all of them had access
to what we call Dream Time.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, Dream Time is
where the humans

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.230 align:middle line:84%
have access to
information that exists

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.740 align:middle line:90%
in interdimensional spheres.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And the way this was utilized
in pre-American times

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.180 align:middle line:84%
and pre-Hispanic times,
before the colonization,

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.630 align:middle line:84%
and the
Christianization, and all

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.900 align:middle line:84%
this, where they viewed this
as diabolical or useless,

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.640 align:middle line:84%
was that they would
find individuals

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.630 align:middle line:84%
that had this ability
to remember their dreams

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.750 align:middle line:90%
and to be aware in their dreams.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And they would group them
into dreamer societies.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And they would forge a physical
unity through certain dances,

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.650 align:middle line:84%
through certain songs,
through drumming practices.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And then they would go
into the Dream Time, where

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.110 align:middle line:84%
they could access visions of
the future, visions of the past,

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.620 align:middle line:90%
visions of other places.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.680 align:middle line:84%
>> One anomaly of the
dream world is the ability

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.360 align:middle line:84%
of the dreamer to engage with
their own subconscious mind.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.700 align:middle line:84%
The indigenous didn't use
psychological terminology.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.950 align:middle line:84%
So, they spoke not
of the subconscious,

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.000 align:middle line:84%
but of ancestors, animal
guides, and spirits.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Psychedelic plants
have been known

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.110 align:middle line:84%
in shamanic cultures
for thousands of years

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.310 align:middle line:90%
to elicit the same effect.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.230 align:middle line:84%
However, these effects happen
not within times of slumber.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.100 align:middle line:84%
Rather, the dream state enters
this world of waking life.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.430 align:middle line:84%
Yet, in both methods, a great
deal of therapeutic healing

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.670 align:middle line:84%
may occur, if the
journeyer understands

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.040 align:middle line:84%
how to engage the
dream, like the world

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.990 align:middle line:90%
of the psychedelic trip.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Out of 30 million
psychedelic-using Americans,

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.200 align:middle line:84%
how many truly understand
that not only can one

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.510 align:middle line:84%
actively guide their
own experience,

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.090 align:middle line:84%
but speak with their
own subconscious,

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.880 align:middle line:84%
ask questions directly
to it, and begin

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.100 align:middle line:84%
a process of
self-discovery that is

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.040 align:middle line:84%
at the core of all
psychological wellness?

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Our dreams are known
to be easily influenced

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.530 align:middle line:84%
by the events that happen
just beforehand, just

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.780 align:middle line:90%
like psychedelic journeys.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.340 align:middle line:84%
This led to the conversation
of set and setting to emerge.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.040 align:middle line:10%
In the pre-prohibition
psychedelic studies,

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.980 align:middle line:10%
the unpredictable nature of
their effects on each person

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.722 align:middle line:10%
baffled them.

00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:17.165 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGH]

00:04:17.165 --> 00:04:18.608 align:middle line:10%


00:04:18.608 --> 00:04:20.051 align:middle line:10%
>> What's happening?

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:21.500 align:middle line:10%
>> What-- I couldn't.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.620 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't possibly tell you.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.484 align:middle line:10%
It's here.

00:04:25.484 --> 00:04:27.340 align:middle line:10%
Can't you feel it?

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.304 align:middle line:10%
This whole room, it's-- it's--

00:04:30.304 --> 00:04:32.230 align:middle line:10%
everything is in color.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.710 align:middle line:90%
And-- and I can feel the air.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthropologist and
psychedelic researcher Michael

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Winkelman has studied
the peculiar ability

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.560 align:middle line:84%
of psychedelics to amplify
the expectations of not only

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.340 align:middle line:84%
the volunteer, but
also the researcher.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.890 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the interesting
things that emerged in the early

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.040 align:middle line:10%
psychiatric research on
psychedelics was that very

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.030 align:middle line:10%
different kinds of effects
could be elicited depending upon

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.200 align:middle line:10%
the orientation
of the researcher.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.290 align:middle line:84%
So, in the beginning, it
looked like psychedelics

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.080 align:middle line:84%
produced various kinds
of psychotic breakdowns.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And researchers, who
looked at psychotics

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.460 align:middle line:84%
with this point of view,
got their participants

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.660 align:middle line:90%
to have psychotic breakdowns.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.810 align:middle line:84%
Later, people
started to recognize

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.690 align:middle line:84%
that some people had these
transcendent experiences,

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.505 align:middle line:90%
mystical experiences.

00:05:17.505 --> 00:05:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And the researchers that
used these substances

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.980 align:middle line:84%
with that point of view had
many of their participants

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.930 align:middle line:84%
have various kinds of
mystical unfoldings.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.720 align:middle line:84%
So, what this led
to is a recognition

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.630 align:middle line:84%
that there were very
important set and setting

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.380 align:middle line:84%
influences in the unfolding
of the biological or

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.620 align:middle line:90%
pharmacological effects.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>> How could set and setting
influence the outcome

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.360 align:middle line:84%
of scientific studies
to this extent?

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.510 align:middle line:84%
The phrase "set and setting"
was created by Timothy Leary

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.550 align:middle line:84%
during the
pre-prohibition studies.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.670 align:middle line:84%
He noticed the stark contrast
between psychedelic sessions

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.390 align:middle line:84%
in sterile or
clinical environments

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.300 align:middle line:84%
and compared the results to
those done in safe surroundings

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.730 align:middle line:90%
with the right people.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.860 align:middle line:90%
This accounts for the setting.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.220 align:middle line:84%
The other component is the set
or mindset of the individual

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.270 align:middle line:90%
about to have the experience.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.720 align:middle line:84%
Those in safer and warmer
feeling environments

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.590 align:middle line:84%
reflected that quality in the
unfolding of their journey.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Others, that were
without that comfort,

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.210 align:middle line:84%
typically in
interrogation-style rooms,

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.240 align:middle line:84%
across from analytical witnesses
writing notes and remaining

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.570 align:middle line:84%
emotionally detached,
experienced more anxiety

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.820 align:middle line:90%
and overall difficulty.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.060 align:middle line:84%
As these plants are far older
than the '60s, and their use

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.930 align:middle line:84%
can be traced back to
40,000-year-old cave paintings,

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.170 align:middle line:84%
how were our shamanic ancestors
dealing with set and setting

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.470 align:middle line:84%
in their psychedelic
experiences?

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.320 align:middle line:10%
>> When you're dealing with
a powerful psychedelic,

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.800 align:middle line:10%
there are a number
of elements at play.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.060 align:middle line:84%
One of them is your
own internal state,

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.140 align:middle line:84%
your own mental state at the
time you take the psychedelic.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Another is the
psychedelic itself

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:05.210 align:middle line:90%
and how it acts on your brain.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.300 align:middle line:84%
But much more
important, in a way,

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:13.130 align:middle line:84%
is your intention when
you go into that ceremony

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.550 align:middle line:84%
and the setting that
surrounds you, that context.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And what shamanism
done properly does,

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.620 align:middle line:84%
is it pays great attention
to the setting in which

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.100 align:middle line:84%
the psychedelic experience
unfolds, to make sure

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.990 align:middle line:84%
that that setting is one that
will allow the experience

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.560 align:middle line:84%
to emerge freely and of
itself, rather than being

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.510 align:middle line:90%
purely a result of the setting.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And as to set,
it's very important

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.820 align:middle line:90%
with shamanistic work.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it's
very important--

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:50.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I suppose I've drunk
ayahuasca approaching 70--

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:55.400 align:middle line:84%
60 or 70 times over the
last dozen years or so.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.060 align:middle line:84%
It's very important, as well,
what your own intention is

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.600 align:middle line:90%
when you go into that ceremony.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.900 align:middle line:84%
It's not a good idea to just
go into it as a blank slate

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.140 align:middle line:84%
and say, throw me whatever
you've got to throw at me.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a good idea to
have an intention.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.050 align:middle line:84%
So, that is part of
the set that you have.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, it doesn't mean that
you'll get what you intended.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.810 align:middle line:84%
It's rightly said that what
the psychedelics ultimately

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.770 align:middle line:84%
give you is what you
need, not what you want.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:29.270 align:middle line:84%
But it's a good
idea to start out

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.830 align:middle line:84%
with a clear plan, that
I'm undertaking a journey,

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:36.860 align:middle line:84%
and this is my purpose
in this journey.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Just like entering the
unpredictable landscape

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.320 align:middle line:84%
of a dream, the psychedelic
state is a journey

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.820 align:middle line:90%
into the unknown.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And purpose or intention
may guide or direct

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:50.810 align:middle line:84%
what could be an extremely
intense experience.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.450 align:middle line:84%
Astronauts, enduring the
physical and mental training

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.970 align:middle line:84%
before journeying
into worlds unknown,

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.800 align:middle line:84%
were also clear
about why they were

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.040 align:middle line:84%
going into such
unpredictable territory.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Having such an intention makes
the intensity of the unknown

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:08.150 align:middle line:84%
seem purposeful
and worth the risk.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.180 align:middle line:84%
However, ethnobotanist
Dennis McKenna

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.630 align:middle line:84%
adds a caveat to
having an intention.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.610 align:middle line:10%
>> People say you
should have an intent.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:19.210 align:middle line:10%
You should have an intent
when you take psychedelics.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:22.960 align:middle line:90%
I think that you can have one.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.710 align:middle line:84%
If there's a specific
reason why you are doing it,

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.570 align:middle line:90%
then an intention is good.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:30.880 align:middle line:84%
But it's also
perfectly legitimate

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.260 align:middle line:90%
to say my intention is open.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:38.200 align:middle line:84%
My intention is to let
the medicine teach me

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.580 align:middle line:90%
what it wants me to see.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.060 align:middle line:90%
That's an intent too.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.010 align:middle line:90%
There is no right way to do it.

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:49.510 align:middle line:84%
The right way to
do it is develop

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:56.410 align:middle line:84%
a system that works for you,
that optimizes the experience

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:58.660 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't get in the
way of it, I would say.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.920 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The value of an intention
is to give a guiding force

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and a vessel for consciousness
to perform within.

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Not having an intention
on the surface

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.380 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean that the ingestion
of a psychedelic plant,

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.150 align:middle line:84%
and the initiation of
a mind-bending journey,

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.450 align:middle line:84%
isn't directed by some
inner question or purpose.

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Just the decision to
venture into the unknown

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.770 align:middle line:84%
comes from a place
deeper than the level

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.770 align:middle line:84%
we make day-to-day
decisions from.

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:29.320 align:middle line:84%
It is likely that the
quickest and most reliable way

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.800 align:middle line:84%
to know what those drivers
are is to take the leap

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.050 align:middle line:84%
and enter into the
mystery of our own mind.

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:37.710 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Whether through psychedelics,
shamanic rituals, or dreams,

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.940 align:middle line:84%
the experiences can range
from brilliant and beautiful,

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.910 align:middle line:90%
to dark and frightening.

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>> When many people enter
into a psychedelic experience,

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:55.700 align:middle line:84%
it's not just pretty colors
and exciting feelings.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.900 align:middle line:84%
It can also be at
times very difficult.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think that this is in
large part due to the fact

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.020 align:middle line:84%
that the psychedelics
release the unconscious.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And they seem to force
us towards an engagement

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.680 align:middle line:84%
with the conflicts that
we have in our life

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.260 align:middle line:84%
and the repressed memories
that we have about trauma.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And so, psychedelics
can often bring up

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.970 align:middle line:84%
a variety of different
kinds of material

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:21.660 align:middle line:84%
that's very difficult for people
to accept and to figure out

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.070 align:middle line:90%
how to move forward with.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.260 align:middle line:84%
But that's also the gift
of the psychedelics,

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.080 align:middle line:84%
is that they force us to
deal with these issues

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:33.600 align:middle line:84%
that we were otherwise able
to bury into our unconscious.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.700 align:middle line:84%
>> As the psychedelic
plant begins shifting

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.640 align:middle line:84%
the neurochemicals in the brain
and influencing the hormonal

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.850 align:middle line:84%
balance of the body,
transforming the perspective

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:45.000 align:middle line:84%
of the mind and entering
you into a realm of unknowns

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.560 align:middle line:84%
and unpredictability, it becomes
increasingly important to know

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.840 align:middle line:84%
how to intelligently
navigate these spaces.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>> We have grown a lot
in the last 50, 60 years.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:02.580 align:middle line:10%
And I realize that set and
setting had an almost dogmatic

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.720 align:middle line:10%
energy to it.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.990 align:middle line:90%
That was all there is.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And set and setting
is not enough.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.300 align:middle line:84%
That we have to incorporate
skillful use of these medicines

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.250 align:middle line:84%
to really achieve what
we want to do with them.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And so, I like to think
of set and setting

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:20.670 align:middle line:84%
as, like, somebody has a
strong intention and desire

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:21.930 align:middle line:90%
to be an artist.

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:24.540 align:middle line:84%
They have a beautiful canvas,
perfect brushes, and paints.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.210 align:middle line:84%
But they don't
know how to paint.

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:28.980 align:middle line:90%
And so, something is missing.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And certain skill sets,
like the ability to focus,

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.410 align:middle line:84%
the ability to
allow and surrender,

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:36.425 align:middle line:84%
the ability to
perceive inner states,

00:12:36.425 --> 00:12:39.900 align:middle line:84%
the ability to navigate
these inner states,

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.600 align:middle line:84%
the ability to heal
from particular traumas

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:46.590 align:middle line:84%
or explore particular
concepts or problems,

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.110 align:middle line:84%
these are all things
that aren't static.

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:52.800 align:middle line:84%
That they can be developed
over time, using mindfulness,

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.920 align:middle line:90%
using psychological skill sets.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And then also, in the
experience themselves,

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.170 align:middle line:90%
when you know how to use them.

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:03.900 align:middle line:84%
In the psychedelic community,
it's one of the one communities

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:08.580 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't acknowledge this
need for skill explicitly.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:12.090 align:middle line:84%
So, what happens is
people take a passive role

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:14.240 align:middle line:90%
in the experience.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>> A passive role is typically
what most people take towards

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.560 align:middle line:84%
their initial
psychedelic journeys.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And the same is seen
for the set and setting

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.820 align:middle line:90%
that most have before sleep.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:28.006 align:middle line:84%
So even our dreams are
guided by our passive mindset

00:13:28.006 --> 00:13:29.130 align:middle line:90%
and environmental settings.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:32.700 align:middle line:90%


00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Those new to
psychedelic experiences

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.440 align:middle line:84%
typically must acclimate
to the new environment

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.650 align:middle line:84%
and deal with their own
fears and desires first.

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:44.040 align:middle line:84%
However, once this space is
not so new and overwhelming,

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.990 align:middle line:84%
it must be navigated
actively and intentionally.

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, the visions
and the entities

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.390 align:middle line:84%
encountered therein begin
to steer the experience

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:54.980 align:middle line:90%
in their own direction.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.280 align:middle line:84%
The implications of how deep
these experiences can go,

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.190 align:middle line:84%
how endless the
psychedelic universe is,

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.260 align:middle line:84%
and how intense it can be
to relive forgotten moments,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.710 align:middle line:84%
are mindboggling and
not quite accepted

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:09.140 align:middle line:84%
by conventional
science or medicine.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Czech psychiatrist
Stanislav Grof

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:14.660 align:middle line:84%
discovered that volunteers using
psychedelics, or even breathing

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:17.390 align:middle line:84%
exercises, were entering
memories that go as far

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.640 align:middle line:90%
back as the womb and beyond.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And I don't understand
why, for example,

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:26.590 align:middle line:84%
the fact that birth is
such a significant trauma,

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:29.980 align:middle line:84%
cycle trauma,
doesn't get through.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.620 align:middle line:10%
I read it the other day
that it was 50 years ago

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:38.170 align:middle line:10%
when I first talked about it in
an LSD conference in Amsterdam.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:43.590 align:middle line:10%
And I created the four stages,
the four Perinatal Matrices,

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.240 align:middle line:10%
as I call it, the
experiences that people have

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.080 align:middle line:10%
when they relive these
consecutive stages of birth.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't make a dent
in the official thinking.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.720 align:middle line:84%
I now have the
feeling that science,

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.020 align:middle line:84%
current materialistic science,
no matter how sophisticated,

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:06.590 align:middle line:84%
is naive if it does not
include these hidden dimensions

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.330 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.960 align:middle line:84%
The psyche is much, much
larger than the model,

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.660 align:middle line:84%
the current model, of
mainstream psychiatry,

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.380 align:middle line:84%
which is limited to
post-natal biography.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:20.530 align:middle line:84%
There's no recognition
that the hours of birth

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:22.090 align:middle line:90%
are a psychotrauma.

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:25.270 align:middle line:84%
It's bizarre thinking,
if you imagine.

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:27.520 align:middle line:84%
Because we now have
a lot of research

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:32.650 align:middle line:84%
showing that prenatal
experiences are very important.

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:34.810 align:middle line:84%
So, actually we
have many people who

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:37.220 align:middle line:84%
have done psychedelics,
reliving birth, having

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.090 align:middle line:84%
prenatal experiences,
past life experiences,

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:42.550 align:middle line:90%
archetypal experiences.

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And I became very
fascinated by how much you

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.100 align:middle line:90%
can do with such simple means.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Trauma is defined as injury
or stress to someone's physical

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:54.430 align:middle line:84%
tissues or
psychological balance.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:58.150 align:middle line:84%
PTSD in veterans is one
example of a drastic rise

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:00.090 align:middle line:84%
in reported
psychological trauma,

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:02.920 align:middle line:84%
that psychedelic plants,
with proper set and setting,

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.210 align:middle line:90%
can help with.

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Imagine how many
cases go unreported

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:09.520 align:middle line:84%
in people who will never
know that one of the latest

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.190 align:middle line:84%
treatment discoveries
in science is also

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:15.910 align:middle line:84%
one of the oldest psychological
medicines known to culture.

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I never really understood
why I suffered from PTSD.

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's only been discovered
the past year or two.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.080 align:middle line:10%
Prior to that, I'd gone
the Western medicine route,

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:33.130 align:middle line:10%
and gone to psychotherapists,
and done a Western medicine

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:37.480 align:middle line:10%
model of taking a lot
of synthetic drugs.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was on opiates for
pain for about five years.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's really controversial.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And I don't condone
this for anybody.

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:50.260 align:middle line:84%
But it was my way
to quit cold turkey.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.830 align:middle line:90%
I started with mushrooms.

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:54.820 align:middle line:90%
The cannabis use helped.

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.350 align:middle line:84%
I think that
psychedelics are going

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:59.800 align:middle line:84%
to help with all these
issues going forward.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.320 align:middle line:84%
My heart just goes out
to all these veterans.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.609 align:middle line:84%
That some of them, their only
resource is to go to the VA.

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And these doctors are
just prescribing them,

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:11.349 align:middle line:90%
like big bottles of pills.

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And it used to be 32 guys
a day killing themselves.

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.040 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's like 52.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And, like, it kills my soul
because these are my brothers.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.170 align:middle line:90%
There is a better way.

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to
use synthetic drugs.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And if it helps just five
guys out of those 52 not

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.130 align:middle line:84%
kill themselves,
please consider that.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Because you're
talking to a guy who--

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:36.190 align:middle line:90%
I lived it.

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, I did everything
they said to the letter.

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And it drove me in a
negative feedback cycle,

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.730 align:middle line:84%
where I'm lucky to be
sitting here with my life.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:47.430 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:51.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Psychedelics allow us to
stay with those memories,

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.470 align:middle line:84%
with the physical sensations,
without being fully overwhelmed

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:56.670 align:middle line:90%
by them.

00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And it allows us to
process deep traumas

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.160 align:middle line:84%
that we wouldn't
otherwise have access

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.010 align:middle line:84%
to because we wouldn't
be able to remember them

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:08.520 align:middle line:90%
in a normal waking state.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Like remembering a dream,
the insights of psychedelic

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:14.100 align:middle line:90%
journeys can be fleeting.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And the moments when
traumas resurface

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.260 align:middle line:84%
are opportunities to heal
and process the unique gift

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:23.310 align:middle line:84%
and lesson that every hardship
has inherent within it.

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.470 align:middle line:84%
If there is no room
for engagement,

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:27.870 align:middle line:84%
the whole event would
be more like a dream,

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:32.100 align:middle line:84%
in which any decisions that are
made are subconsciously driven.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.800 align:middle line:84%
Actively engaging with
a psychedelic experience

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.040 align:middle line:84%
is turning the dreamlike
state into a lucid dream,

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.530 align:middle line:84%
in which an aspect
of the awakened mind

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:43.080 align:middle line:84%
gets to make decisions and
play with the new rules

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.870 align:middle line:90%
in this flexible territory.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Psychedelic researcher
and author David Jay Brown

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.060 align:middle line:84%
wrote the book,
"Dreaming Wide Awake,"

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.090 align:middle line:84%
where he compares and unites
the psychedelic experience

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:56.650 align:middle line:90%
with lucid dreams.

00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:00.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Lucid dreaming is very much
associated with psychedelics

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.967 align:middle line:10%
because people often have
lucid dreams spontaneously,

00:19:02.967 --> 00:19:04.300 align:middle line:10%
right after doing a psychedelic.

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:07.150 align:middle line:10%
And there's a lot of similarity
between lucid dreaming states

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:08.020 align:middle line:10%
and psychedelics.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:11.590 align:middle line:84%
I think that I started having
the lucid dreams because

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:13.320 align:middle line:90%
of my experience with ayahuasca.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.640 align:middle line:84%
What was probably most
interesting about doing

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.920 align:middle line:84%
the ayahuasca and doing
the lucid dreaming

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:21.280 align:middle line:84%
was the ability to communicate
with this higher intelligence

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.210 align:middle line:90%
or higher part of myself.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:26.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Ayahuasca isn't the only
plant medicine acclaimed

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:31.100 align:middle line:84%
for its abilities to
induce lucid dreaming.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Psychedelic researcher
and author Chris Bennett

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.530 align:middle line:84%
has found particular methods
for inducing lucid dreams

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:38.400 align:middle line:90%
using cannabis.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.870 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, one of the things
that a lot of regular smokers

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:44.870 align:middle line:10%
of cannabis, what they
call chronic smokers,

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:46.900 align:middle line:10%
report is they don't
dream very much.

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:50.960 align:middle line:84%
They have a real-- and this
is, like, widely known.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And scientists trying to
explain this phenomena

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:59.010 align:middle line:84%
have suggested that this may
be due to a spike in melatonin,

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:01.240 align:middle line:84%
which is suggested
by some reports

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:06.530 align:middle line:84%
to spike as much as 4,000 times
the amount of normal waking

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:90%
melatonin levels.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:11.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, using the
imperial method, just

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.460 align:middle line:84%
testing substances
on yourself, I've

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.560 align:middle line:84%
noticed, if I wake up at
about 4:00 in the morning

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.900 align:middle line:84%
and smoke some cannabis
and go back to bed,

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.060 align:middle line:90%
I have the most intense dreams.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.190 align:middle line:84%
They're super
vivid, lucid dreams.

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And I attribute this to this
same spike in melatonin.

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:27.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm already into that
deeper levels of sleep.

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Because I've been
asleep for a few hours

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.343 align:middle line:84%
and just getting up
for a few minutes.

00:20:30.343 --> 00:20:31.160 align:middle line:90%
Go back to sleep.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.025 align:middle line:84%
And bam, I have the most
intense lucid dreams.

00:20:34.025 --> 00:20:35.900 align:middle line:84%
The type of dreams where
you wake up and then

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:36.700 align:middle line:90%
go back to sleep.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And you go back into the same
dream, continuous, very vivid.

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Most people don't realize
that in a lucid dream,

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.980 align:middle line:84%
you could ignore all the
characters in the dream,

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.390 align:middle line:84%
ignore the environment, and
simply talk to the dream

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:48.440 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.990 align:middle line:84%
You just raise your head to the
sky, ask the dream questions.

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:52.280 align:middle line:90%
And it will respond to you.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.970 align:middle line:90%
It responds to you in English.

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:56.270 align:middle line:84%
Or it'll change the
environment in some kind of way

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:59.090 align:middle line:84%
or show you some kind of
answer to your question.

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And remarkably, it knows you
better than you know yourself.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.610 align:middle line:84%
It really shows
you amazing things.

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:08.090 align:middle line:84%
So, that was one of
the major similarities

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:11.090 align:middle line:84%
I saw in working with these
two spirits, the ayahuasca

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:12.515 align:middle line:84%
spirit and the
lucid dream spirit,

00:21:12.515 --> 00:21:15.200 align:middle line:84%
is these two spirits knew me
better than I knew myself.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And I can ask them
any question I want.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.530 align:middle line:90%
And they would have answers.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:21.440 align:middle line:10%
It was like dealing
with an oracle.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>> An oracle, from antiquity,
is typically a person to whom

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:27.770 align:middle line:84%
the commoners would travel, in
order to ask questions about

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:29.150 align:middle line:90%
their future.

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:31.460 align:middle line:10%
Just like ancient
shamans, the oracle

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.040 align:middle line:10%
would do the work
for the commoners.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.010 align:middle line:84%
Shamans would imbibe the
psychedelic plant and journey

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:39.890 align:middle line:84%
into the next world,
seeking remedies and answers

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:41.330 align:middle line:90%
for the tribe.

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, the
oracle would often

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:46.220 align:middle line:84%
inhale vapor that would
alter their perception,

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:49.730 align:middle line:84%
or throw tea leaves, or
stare into a polished crystal

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.490 align:middle line:84%
in order to see
the coming events.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, the trend is turning
towards interdependence,

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.260 align:middle line:84%
in which the
commoners are taking

00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:59.950 align:middle line:90%
the shamanic quest themselves.

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:02.200 align:middle line:84%
They imbibe their
own plant medicine.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.140 align:middle line:84%
They use their own oracle
decks or scrying bowls

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.540 align:middle line:84%
and translate the
messages themselves.

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And this fits well with the
similarities of psychedelics

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.850 align:middle line:90%
and lucid dreams.

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:13.630 align:middle line:84%
If you can ask your
own subconscious

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:16.720 align:middle line:84%
mind questions in the
midst of a deep sleep,

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.270 align:middle line:84%
who or what is the
one responding?

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
psychedelics, oracles,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.080 align:middle line:84%
meditation, and all other
modalities of self-development

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.530 align:middle line:84%
are merely tools to engage
the self that we do know of,

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:32.210 align:middle line:84%
with the parts of
ourselves we've never

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:34.340 align:middle line:90%
been able to imagine?

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.190 align:middle line:10%
>> So, the subconscious mind,
when it trusts and it feels

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:41.810 align:middle line:10%
safe, can open up big.

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:45.680 align:middle line:10%
It can open up childhood
trauma because this is

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.230 align:middle line:10%
the place where it can happen.

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:54.260 align:middle line:84%
This whole psychedelic
structure that you may see,

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:59.960 align:middle line:84%
and the colors, it seems like
the neurons of the universe,

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.270 align:middle line:84%
they are outside,
the same as inside.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:03.080 align:middle line:90%
And you feel it.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.090 align:middle line:90%
You feel connected.

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:07.220 align:middle line:90%
It's allowing.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's opening up.

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
makes it so deep.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And then at a certain moment
you realize, this is all me.

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:17.480 align:middle line:90%
It's just myself.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:22.580 align:middle line:84%
So, in this connection of
reality that is universe,

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:23.390 align:middle line:90%
it's me.

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:24.190 align:middle line:90%
It's you.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:26.390 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:28.250 align:middle line:90%
There's no judgment.

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:31.820 align:middle line:84%
So, you're confronted
with what you're doing,

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:34.786 align:middle line:84%
with what you didn't do, with
what you could have done.

00:23:34.786 --> 00:23:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And you come more
and more to yourself.

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:40.080 align:middle line:90%


00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.740 align:middle line:90%
>> What exactly is the self?

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:46.490 align:middle line:84%
How would it show itself in
psychedelic journeys or dreams?

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:49.620 align:middle line:90%
And how does it communicate?

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Religious, philosophical,
and even scientific circles

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:55.350 align:middle line:84%
have been attempting
to explain this concept

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:58.640 align:middle line:90%
since time immemorial.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:02.960 align:middle line:84%
Many of them seem convinced that
their way is the one and only.

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.450 align:middle line:84%
But is it possible to
catch a glimpse of the self

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:07.730 align:middle line:84%
through each of these
methods, and realize

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:11.420 align:middle line:84%
that all roads lead
not to Rome, but home,

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:14.600 align:middle line:90%
the home of the true self?

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.220 align:middle line:84%
One of the benefits of
psychedelic experiences

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:20.720 align:middle line:84%
is in how they cause,
for moments of humility,

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.210 align:middle line:84%
a re-evaluation of the
choices and actions that

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:25.940 align:middle line:84%
led us to our traumas or
illness in the first place.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:29.080 align:middle line:90%


00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.080 align:middle line:84%
But a look into our past is not
the only thing that comes about

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.660 align:middle line:90%
from these mind-bending plants.

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:37.930 align:middle line:84%
There are accounts from the Old
World of psychedelic journeys,

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:42.640 align:middle line:84%
rendering people comatose
or perceivably dead.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And upon returning, visions of
hellish or heavenly dimensions

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:51.020 align:middle line:84%
were recounted, even
visions of the future.

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And a large amount of the
ancient world references are

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.650 align:middle line:84%
involved in ingested
amounts of cannabis,

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:00.620 align:middle line:84%
which were potent enough to
knock over a couple of days.

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:05.330 align:middle line:84%
So, you would appear comatose
to anybody that observed you.

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:07.580 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
there's obviously

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:10.150 align:middle line:84%
a lot of mental stimulation
going on from the substance

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:13.280 align:middle line:84%
as well because the
people that returned

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:17.820 align:middle line:84%
after such experiences gave
their reports of where they'd

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:18.620 align:middle line:90%
been.

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And in the Zoroastrian
religion, a large part

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:24.700 align:middle line:84%
of the religious
cosmology is derived

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:29.930 align:middle line:84%
from people ingesting bonga,
a potent cannabis extract,

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:31.580 align:middle line:90%
infused into wine.

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And we see this in the
stories of both Arda Wiraz

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:36.650 align:middle line:90%
and a king known as Vishtaspa.

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:40.400 align:middle line:84%
In Arda Wiraz's case,
he drinks the seven cups

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:44.254 align:middle line:90%
of the cannabis-infused wine.

00:25:44.254 --> 00:25:45.170 align:middle line:90%
And then he lies down.

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:46.040 align:middle line:90%
And he comes back.

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And he said that he had been
to see both heaven and hell.

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:52.217 align:middle line:84%
And Arda Wiraz's visions,
these Zoroastrian visions

00:25:52.217 --> 00:25:54.800 align:middle line:84%
of heaven and hell, that's where
we get the concepts of heaven

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:55.600 align:middle line:90%
and hell from.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.500 align:middle line:84%
There was no heaven
and hell in Judaism.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:01.490 align:middle line:84%
In the Old Testament, Samuel
is raised by the Witch of Endor

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:03.600 align:middle line:90%
from the pit of Sheol.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.160 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of a land of shadows.

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.730 align:middle line:84%
So, this is like a direct
experience this guy had,

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:09.310 align:middle line:84%
ingesting the
substances, went to see

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:12.710 align:middle line:84%
the lands of the dead, where
the evil were persecuted

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:14.610 align:middle line:90%
and the righteous were rewarded.

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:20.210 align:middle line:84%
In Vishtaspa's experience,
he saw the end of time.

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:23.000 align:middle line:10%
And the Oracle of
Hystaspes, which

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.940 align:middle line:10%
is a Greek version of
the name Vishtaspa,

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:28.714 align:middle line:10%
was the prototype of what became
the Book of Revelation, written

00:26:28.714 --> 00:26:30.380 align:middle line:10%
along the same sort
of lines, predicting

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:34.380 align:middle line:10%
the downfall of Rome, and
these types of things.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:38.660 align:middle line:84%
So, here we see people using
very, very potent cannabis

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:43.280 align:middle line:84%
things, with lasting visions
that effected history

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.540 align:middle line:90%
from ever since they happened.

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:48.560 align:middle line:90%


00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>> The expanded states
of consciousness brought

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:54.140 align:middle line:84%
on by these few plants might
seem exciting when the focus

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.480 align:middle line:84%
remains on the
visionary, creative,

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.990 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even the prophetic
qualities that they produce.

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:02.060 align:middle line:10%
But it should be
remembered that to reach

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.820 align:middle line:10%
these states, large amounts of
these substances are consumed,

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:08.270 align:middle line:10%
which increase the intensity
and unpredictability

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:10.720 align:middle line:10%
of the journey.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Few seekers are equipped
to take on such experiences

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:15.330 align:middle line:90%
without trauma.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:18.840 align:middle line:84%
In fact, many psychonauts
express their reservations on

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.520 align:middle line:84%
whether or not
just anyone should

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:24.000 align:middle line:90%
be using these substances.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.850 align:middle line:10%
>> There's also a lot of people
that these psychedelic things

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:29.310 align:middle line:10%
were probably not
appropriate for them.

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:31.590 align:middle line:10%
And even Terence McKenna
said, most people

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:34.590 align:middle line:10%
are better off just
leaving all this alone.

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:36.640 align:middle line:90%
It's not for everybody.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.430 align:middle line:84%
People need to
work on themselves.

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:40.170 align:middle line:84%
It's not a substitute
for therapy,

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:43.740 align:middle line:84%
or family counseling, or
Feng Shuiing your house,

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.560 align:middle line:90%
or finding a right livelihood.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.360 align:middle line:84%
All those things
are important too.

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>> And this isn't for everyone.

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:53.850 align:middle line:10%
These experiences are very
powerful, very transformative.

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:55.350 align:middle line:10%
And they stretch
your consciousness.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:56.990 align:middle line:90%
And they're an initiation.

00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:59.190 align:middle line:84%
But without the
cultural container

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:01.750 align:middle line:84%
of how we hold people
before, during,

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:04.067 align:middle line:84%
and after these
experiences, people

00:28:04.067 --> 00:28:05.400 align:middle line:90%
aren't getting the most from it.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.525 align:middle line:84%
And they've not having a
long-term transformational

00:28:07.525 --> 00:28:09.920 align:middle line:90%
change.

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>> The cultural container
is more than just

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:15.240 align:middle line:84%
the environmental setting,
more than the mindset going

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.040 align:middle line:90%
into the experience.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.560 align:middle line:84%
It's even more than having
the skill sets to navigate

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.530 align:middle line:90%
these deeply unfamiliar spaces.

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:24.690 align:middle line:10%
At the heart of
community-based healing,

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:29.470 align:middle line:10%
through generations of plant
medicine work, is the shaman.

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:31.330 align:middle line:10%
This role is
dedicated to those who

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:34.630 align:middle line:10%
have had significant amount of
experience with the medicine

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:38.200 align:middle line:10%
and is familiar with
how to handle crises.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.180 align:middle line:84%
Similar roles to
the shaman are now

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:44.710 align:middle line:84%
being identified for various
purposes, as the guide, sitter,

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:47.020 align:middle line:90%
or facilitator.

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:49.840 align:middle line:84%
In the Johns Hopkins
psilocybin studies,

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Mary Cosimano holds specific
guidelines for her role

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:57.500 align:middle line:84%
in facilitating other people's
psychedelic therapy sessions.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:04.150 align:middle line:10%
>> The guide's responsibility
is to have a relationship with

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:08.450 align:middle line:10%
the participant,
with a volunteer.

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:12.670 align:middle line:84%
It's really about them
feeling safe, and comfortable,

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:14.380 align:middle line:90%
and not judged.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And just being able to
allow whatever experiences,

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:23.770 align:middle line:84%
whatever comes up, whatever
feelings, to express them

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:24.820 align:middle line:90%
and to allow them.

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:28.090 align:middle line:90%


00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>> This type of role
responsibility is not new.

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:35.140 align:middle line:84%
From shamans, to
guides, to facilitators,

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:38.350 align:middle line:84%
the overarching theme is
that unnecessary interference

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:40.600 align:middle line:84%
in the psychedelic
journey of another

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.400 align:middle line:84%
may complicate the
intelligent nature

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.530 align:middle line:90%
of the psychedelic experience.

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:46.030 align:middle line:90%
The guide must keep quiet.

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And only interject for
safety or logistical reasons,

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.070 align:middle line:84%
to allow for the
journeyer to listen

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:53.620 align:middle line:84%
to the message of the
subconscious mind.

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:56.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And it seems to
be a better approach,

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:59.920 align:middle line:84%
from both learning from
studying shamans and from

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.530 align:middle line:84%
the psychotherapy approach
that people have been studying,

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:05.530 align:middle line:84%
to just let the person kind
of have their own experience.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:08.182 align:middle line:84%
And be there with them, be
there in case they need you.

00:30:08.182 --> 00:30:10.390 align:middle line:10%
Be there for support, if
they want to hold your hand,

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:12.920 align:middle line:10%
if they have an experience
they want to share with you.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.320 align:middle line:90%
But don't try to guide the trip.

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.740 align:middle line:90%
Don't try to navigate for them.

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:18.970 align:middle line:10%
Let them navigate themselves
has been the more common wisdom

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:21.670 align:middle line:10%
that's emerged from
MAPS, and from some

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:24.220 align:middle line:10%
of the other psychedelic
schools of thought.

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.770 align:middle line:10%
>> The emergence of new
psychedelic research groups,

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:32.380 align:middle line:10%
like MAPS, ICEERS,
Heffter, Beckley, and more,

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.900 align:middle line:10%
are focused on the approach
of empowering the individual

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:38.830 align:middle line:10%
having the experience with the
skills and tools and knowledge

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:41.800 align:middle line:10%
of how to use them in order
to have a meaningful and safe

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.150 align:middle line:10%
journey.

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:45.430 align:middle line:84%
This empowerment is
leading many aspirants

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:49.450 align:middle line:84%
to realize that psychedelic
plants, lucid dreaming,

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:53.530 align:middle line:84%
meditation, dance, and
many other modalities

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:56.890 align:middle line:84%
are merely tools to access the
deeper layers of reality that

00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:00.400 align:middle line:84%
lie beyond form and
appearance, and contain

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:04.930 align:middle line:84%
all the events in the past,
present, and even future.

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:07.210 align:middle line:10%
This is considered to be
possible in the same way

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:09.100 align:middle line:10%
the Aboriginals of
Australia believe

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.850 align:middle line:10%
the realm of the dreaming to
exist beyond time and space.

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:16.870 align:middle line:84%
So, no event, whether in the
distant past or far-off future,

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:19.120 align:middle line:90%
is truly inaccessible.

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.700 align:middle line:84%
The Aboriginals believed
in continuity, rather than

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:22.840 align:middle line:90%
progress.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.330 align:middle line:10%
They believed in the way
that relationships integrate

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:27.190 align:middle line:10%
into a greater
whole, rather than

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:30.460 align:middle line:10%
isolated roles and functions.

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.230 align:middle line:84%
They also believed
that the land is not

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:36.370 align:middle line:84%
to be owned because the land
is what connects us all.

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:40.270 align:middle line:84%
It is the reason we are all
able to travel and explore,

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:45.100 align:middle line:84%
to nest and find shelter,
and to enjoy life's gifts.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.010 align:middle line:84%
This very land is also home
to the numerous creatures

00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:52.220 align:middle line:84%
we live amongst, as well as
the abundance of plant life.

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And among these plants
live a specific variety

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:58.880 align:middle line:84%
that usher in visions of
animal guides, ancestors,

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.750 align:middle line:84%
other worldly beings, and
a glimpse at the future

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:04.600 align:middle line:84%
we are creating right
now on this planet.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.460 align:middle line:84%
What can we learn from
these visions that

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.070 align:middle line:84%
emerge from the
subconscious mind,

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:13.580 align:middle line:84%
from the space beyond space
and the time beyond time?

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.520 align:middle line:84%
What can we learn from
the shamanic traditions

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:19.450 align:middle line:84%
of antiquity, and their
modern revisions today?

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:21.370 align:middle line:84%
What skills can we
learn by entering

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:26.290 align:middle line:84%
these deep layers of the self
and navigating with intention?

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And what lessons can we
bring back to this world,

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:33.410 align:middle line:84%
to balance the unsustainable
changes happening here?

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:36.110 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps with the support of
highly informed communities,

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:38.750 align:middle line:10%
with the highest
intentions, we can

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:41.060 align:middle line:10%
