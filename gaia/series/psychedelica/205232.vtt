In the 1960s, researchers
make an astonishing discovery

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.200 align:middle line:84%
while excavating an
archaeological site

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.400 align:middle line:90%
called Tel Arad.

of an unidentified
plant material.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.250 align:middle line:84%
According to a new report
released in June of 2020,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.300 align:middle line:84%
it was unidentifiable until
advancements in chemical

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.410 align:middle line:90%
analysis made a breakthrough.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.960 align:middle line:84%
The charred material
was cannabis.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.560 align:middle line:10%
It is the oldest discovery of
cannabis in the ancient Near

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.460 align:middle line:10%

played an important role

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.220 align:middle line:10%

>> My understanding is that
cannabis has been used widely

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.230 align:middle line:10%
in many cultures, everything
from the Vedic traditions,

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:50.770 align:middle line:10%
to Buddhism, to Mbwiti, and
many of the South American

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.420 align:middle line:10%
and their religion.

>> I don't believe there's
another plant that served

humans more than cannabis,

management, but to
create soap, clothing,

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.460 align:middle line:10%
and you name it from hemp.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.810 align:middle line:10%
The cannabis plant is one
of the most important ones,

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.330 align:middle line:10%
and it's been used for thousands
and thousands of years.

>> Cannabis is one of the
oldest-cultivated crops

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.290 align:middle line:84%
in the world and is emerging as
a modern-day wonder of commerce

As new genetic variations,
medicines, and industrial uses

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.940 align:middle line:84%
are developed, some
fear the cannabis plant

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.070 align:middle line:90%
will be changed forever.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.780 align:middle line:90%


00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.450 align:middle line:84%
For some, this is
part of a movement

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.590 align:middle line:84%
to live more
harmoniously with nature.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.630 align:middle line:84%
As we uncover new archaeological
cannabis and hemp discoveries,

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.620 align:middle line:84%
we can construct a more complete
understanding of this plant's

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.700 align:middle line:90%
role in human history.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Could cannabis, with its
many gifts for mankind,

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.490 align:middle line:90%
be the true tree of life?

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.430 align:middle line:84%
As a sacrament,
cannabis was carried

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:84%
throughout the Old World
trade routes and can likely

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.020 align:middle line:84%
be traced back to ancient
Egypt, ancient Greece,

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.330 align:middle line:84%
as well as the early days
of Christianity, Buddhism,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:52.855 align:middle line:84%
Hinduism, Islam, and as the Tel
Arad discovery proved, Judaism.

00:03:52.855 --> 00:03:56.150 align:middle line:90%


00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.850 align:middle line:84%
It's important to note the
difference between the two

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.480 align:middle line:90%
primary subspecies of the plant.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.680 align:middle line:84%
Cannabis sativa, with
higher amounts of THC,

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.760 align:middle line:84%
possesses psychoactive
properties.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Cannabis sativa L,
or hemp, does not,

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.010 align:middle line:84%
and has primarily been
cultivated for manufacturing

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.265 align:middle line:90%
textiles, oil, and food.

00:04:23.265 --> 00:04:26.850 align:middle line:90%


00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.120 align:middle line:84%
The earliest written
evidence of using the plant

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:37.700 align:middle line:84%
dates back to 2737 BCE when
descriptions of hemp oils

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.590 align:middle line:84%
and teas were recorded in
Chinese emperor, Shen Nung's

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.260 align:middle line:90%
Pen Tsao Ching.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.930 align:middle line:84%
But use most likely
dates back even further.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.870 align:middle line:10%
>> There are archaeological
sites in China.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.110 align:middle line:10%
It appears that cannabis
came out of China

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.820 align:middle line:10%
and that some of these sites
are at least 10,000 years old.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.550 align:middle line:84%
It's clear from
the plant materials

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.830 align:middle line:84%
that were recovered
that these were

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.750 align:middle line:90%
resinous forms of cannabis.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.280 align:middle line:90%
They weren't hemp.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.040 align:middle line:90%
There were actually medicine.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Cannabis is the oldest
cultivated plant in human

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.960 align:middle line:10%
history.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Some say it is actually
the tree of life,

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.880 align:middle line:84%
or an analogy of
the tree of life,

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.470 align:middle line:84%
because it has so many
uses, hundreds of uses.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The concept of a sacred
plant or a tree is found in many

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.930 align:middle line:90%
ancient religions.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.040 align:middle line:84%
For some it's called
the tree of life--

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:46.560 align:middle line:84%
a symbol of love, fertility,
wisdom, and immortality.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.130 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.010 align:middle line:84%
The tree of life
may also commemorate

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.325 align:middle line:84%
our symbiotic
relationship with nature.

00:05:55.325 --> 00:05:58.550 align:middle line:90%


00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.720 align:middle line:84%
Some faiths see it as a
provider of healing nectar

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.810 align:middle line:90%
or a gateway to enlightenment.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.510 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.340 align:middle line:10%
Sumerian translator and
Gnostic scholar Anton Parks

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.840 align:middle line:10%
suggests that the tree of life
is significant in human history

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.210 align:middle line:10%
and mythology.

>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.580 align:middle line:10%
>> The story of the tree of life
can be found in many cultures.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.810 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostic texts
mention it a lot.

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.070 align:middle line:84%
It relates to ways for people
to achieve transcendence.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:37.300 align:middle line:84%
We can see it in representations
and through the very specific

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.600 align:middle line:90%
use shamans make of plants.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.950 align:middle line:10%
I think that you can find this
story or possible story mixed

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.000 align:middle line:10%
up in many cultures--

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.440 align:middle line:10%
the idea that you can enter
in direct communication

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.435 align:middle line:10%
with the divine through plants.

00:06:52.435 --> 00:06:55.390 align:middle line:90%


00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that the
tree of life is cannabis.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:04.180 align:middle line:10%
When I look at what plant would
be more useful to humanity,

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.970 align:middle line:10%
and rather than thinking
that the tree of life

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.990 align:middle line:10%
had anything to do with
the fall of humanity,

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.940 align:middle line:10%
I think keeping this
plant away from the people

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.870 align:middle line:10%
has had a lot more to do
with the fall of humanity.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.350 align:middle line:10%
>> I feel that cannabis
was one of the main plants

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:22.330 align:middle line:10%
in the Garden of Eden.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that the reason
that cannabis has come back

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.050 align:middle line:84%
in such a big way
in our society is

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.890 align:middle line:84%
because we've gotten so out
of balance with the masculine,

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:38.650 align:middle line:84%
with this force in the
world of doing and taking

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.950 align:middle line:90%
and conquering.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I think any powerful symbol
like the tree of life is meant

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:50.510 align:middle line:84%
to mirror life in
many different ways.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.910 align:middle line:84%
So it can look like
an actual tree.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.080 align:middle line:84%
It can be our own
neural networks.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.850 align:middle line:84%
It can be what's going
on beneath the soil.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:06.340 align:middle line:84%
To me it's the idea of as
above, so below; as within,

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.100 align:middle line:90%
so without.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.800 align:middle line:10%
>> "The Urantia" book says that
there was an actual tree that

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.990 align:middle line:10%
grows throughout the
universe, and that a group

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:19.450 align:middle line:10%
of extraterrestrials brought a
tree here about half a million

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.960 align:middle line:10%
years ago that would help them
to be immortal and also help

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.730 align:middle line:10%
them to civilize humanity.

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.800 align:middle line:90%


00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible that
this sacred plant may have

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.950 align:middle line:84%
originated from elsewhere
in the universe?

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.750 align:middle line:84%
There's a tribe in Africa
called the Dogon People,

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:43.350 align:middle line:84%
and they knew about Sirius
B before we discovered it

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.350 align:middle line:90%
with our telescopes.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And one of the interesting
things about this culture,

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.610 align:middle line:84%
one of the many
interesting things,

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:54.660 align:middle line:84%
is they use cannabis for
many things in their tribe

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.450 align:middle line:84%
and in their livelihood for
we don't even know how long.

00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:59.010 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a
written history.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:03.150 align:middle line:84%
But they say that cannabis
was given to them by the star

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.420 align:middle line:90%
people from Sirius.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>> The Dogon people called
Sirius the Two Dog star,

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:18.880 align:middle line:84%
and today we call these two
stars Sirius A and Sirius B.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Curiously, in Latin this
constellation's name suggests

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.160 align:middle line:90%
something more profound.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>> The word cannabis can be
broken down into-- the word

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:34.420 align:middle line:84%
canine is for dogs
and Bi means two.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:38.650 align:middle line:84%
So cannabis, actually, we can
define as meaning Two Dog star.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:41.510 align:middle line:90%


00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>> If cannabis means
the Two Dog star,

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:48.350 align:middle line:84%
what might be the significance
of this beloved animal

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:51.320 align:middle line:90%
for the Dogon?

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Psychiatrist
Stanislav Grof posits

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:59.270 align:middle line:84%
that celestial archetypes
often act as spiritual guides

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:03.070 align:middle line:84%
during altered states
of consciousness.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:06.950 align:middle line:10%
>> If psychiatry goes in the
right direction, in my opinion,

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:11.770 align:middle line:10%
it would be working with these
sacred medicines and using

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:14.650 align:middle line:10%
archetypal astrology as a guide.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:17.090 align:middle line:90%
Archetypal astrology is amazing.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.030 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing for
people in these states

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:21.010 align:middle line:90%
to have some kind of guidance.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:24.010 align:middle line:84%
What is happening to them
to understand that it's not

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:24.880 align:middle line:90%
completely erratic?

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.240 align:middle line:90%


00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Modern agricultural practices
have all but depleted the soil.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Deforestation,
pollution, and pesticides

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:47.200 align:middle line:84%
are doing long-term damage
to the soil, mycelium, water,

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.960 align:middle line:90%
and the air we breathe.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>> In modern agriculture, we
have very little to no respect

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:58.130 align:middle line:90%
for what lives within the soil.

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Tilling destroys these
very complex communities

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:07.190 align:middle line:84%
and networks of
organisms, root systems,

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:13.940 align:middle line:84%
and mycelium that are part of
the intelligence of the soil.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.010 align:middle line:10%
>> I think when plants
are grown inorganically,

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.260 align:middle line:10%
they're grown onto lots,
they're grown with chemicals,

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.750 align:middle line:10%
and they're grown with the
motivation of growing them

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.040 align:middle line:10%
for profit.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.480 align:middle line:84%
I think this destroys
the spirit of the plant.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.822 align:middle line:84%
You need diversity in
all systems of life,

00:11:26.822 --> 00:11:29.030 align:middle line:84%
and you need diversity in
the cannabis realm as well.

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:32.020 align:middle line:90%


00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the most fundamental
thing that we could do

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:42.040 align:middle line:84%
to change the way we grow food
or medicine is being in a state

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.505 align:middle line:84%
of relationship, to come
in a place of offering.

00:11:45.505 --> 00:11:49.430 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:52.790 align:middle line:10%
In a more traditional
model of agriculture,

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:56.090 align:middle line:10%
which is being more and more
integrated into smaller-scale

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:59.720 align:middle line:10%
settings, it's
all about how well

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:04.700 align:middle line:10%
you take care of the soil, what
you give back to the soil that

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.430 align:middle line:10%
allows you to have
the kind of outcomes

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:09.920 align:middle line:10%
that you want in
terms of a harvest.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:16.480 align:middle line:90%


00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:21.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Despite all of the advances
in technology and agriculture,

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:25.000 align:middle line:84%
hunger and starvation
continue to plague the world.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.520 align:middle line:90%


00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Hemp cannabis may
offer solutions.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:37.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a medicine and an
industrial material,

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.450 align:middle line:84%
but can it also be
a source of food?

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:49.220 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a plant that can provide
fuel, medicine, fabric, paper,

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:53.930 align:middle line:10%
oil for cooking, and cannabis
is one of the most nutritious

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.640 align:middle line:10%
plants on the face of the earth.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.600 align:middle line:84%
The seeds alone-- excellent
profile of Omega 3

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.890 align:middle line:84%
to Omega 6 fatty acids, which
are so important for our brain

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:05.250 align:middle line:90%
health.

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:09.650 align:middle line:84%
We also know that cannabis
seeds are high in protein and B

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:14.450 align:middle line:84%
vitamins and vitamin E, and
it's a very versatile seed.

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:18.140 align:middle line:90%


00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>> As a possible food source,
hemp consumes only one-third

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.160 align:middle line:84%
of the water of corn, a crop
that is also heavily reliant

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.520 align:middle line:90%
on various pesticides.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.280 align:middle line:90%
Hemp is not.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:39.470 align:middle line:84%
It also has potential
as fabric and paper.

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, another environmental
problem is paper,

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:46.550 align:middle line:84%
and paper used to
be made from hemp,

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:50.300 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't yellow the
way paper from trees does.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.150 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Paper mills contribute to
a major source of chemical

00:13:56.150 --> 00:14:00.110 align:middle line:90%
pollution in waterways.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Trees have a
substance called lignin,

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:07.520 align:middle line:84%
and lignin requires a lot
of chemicals to separate

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:12.470 align:middle line:84%
the lignins from the trees,
whereas cannabis has a lot less

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:17.180 align:middle line:84%
lignin and it can give its
paper-making properties off

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:20.300 align:middle line:84%
with about one-seventh
the amount of chemicals.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.090 align:middle line:90%


00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>> It can even help
wean us of fossil fuels.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:32.300 align:middle line:10%
Hemp-derived biodiesel produces
very low sulfur dioxide

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.340 align:middle line:10%
and it doesn't deplete the soil.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:39.180 align:middle line:10%
>> I see great possibilities
ahead for use of this plant

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.710 align:middle line:10%
that grows so easily.

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:43.390 align:middle line:10%
It can grow as tall as
a tree in three months

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:46.200 align:middle line:10%
and put down a root system
that nourishes the earth,

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.970 align:middle line:10%
and the root decomposes.

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.580 align:middle line:90%
There's really nothing like it.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Here's an ideal stand.

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:54.313 align:middle line:84%
The right height to
be harvested easily,

00:14:54.313 --> 00:14:55.980 align:middle line:84%
thick enough to grow
slender stocks that

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:59.580 align:middle line:90%
are easy to cut and process.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the oldest
cultivated crops in the world,

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:07.350 align:middle line:84%
cannabis just might be able
to help the earth evolve

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:12.830 align:middle line:84%
into a cleaner and more
sustainable economy.

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.700 align:middle line:84%
But humans face increasing
rates of disease.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.510 align:middle line:84%
How bright is the future
if those issues are not

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:23.310 align:middle line:90%
addressed as well?

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:25.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Be careful how you use it.

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:27.480 align:middle line:84%
For to grow hemp
legally, you must

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.670 align:middle line:84%
have a federal
registration and tax stamp.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:32.420 align:middle line:90%


00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:36.410 align:middle line:10%
>> In recent years, the legal
prohibition dam in the United

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:38.105 align:middle line:10%
States has burst.

00:15:38.105 --> 00:15:40.690 align:middle line:10%


00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:45.370 align:middle line:10%
With state after state
decriminalizing cannabis.

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:49.270 align:middle line:84%
The fastest growing commercial
product from this plant

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:50.380 align:middle line:90%
is its medicine.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.400 align:middle line:90%


00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.610 align:middle line:10%
Breakthroughs in
research are documenting

00:15:56.610 --> 00:16:03.840 align:middle line:10%
cannabis' therapeutic abilities
with anxiety, pain management,

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.420 align:middle line:10%
and with the side effects
from chemotherapy.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:12.902 align:middle line:84%
This has led the way in changing
the public's perception.

00:16:12.902 --> 00:16:15.110 align:middle line:10%
>> We're realizing the
tremendous amount of benefits.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:18.110 align:middle line:10%
It's almost good for
everything-- fibromyalgia,

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:22.280 align:middle line:10%
lupus, and immune system
disorders, and pain management

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:27.140 align:middle line:10%
as well, and giving it to cancer
patients to increase appetite.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.500 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, I think the most
amazing emerging evidence

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.380 align:middle line:10%
regarding medical marijuana
is its effects against cancer.

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.270 align:middle line:10%
There were studies
in the '70s, as early

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:38.930 align:middle line:10%
as the '70s, that
indicated that cannabis

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.580 align:middle line:10%
stopped the growth
of tumors, and even

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:44.510 align:middle line:10%
reversed it by stopping the
blood flow into the tumor.

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:48.110 align:middle line:10%
>> I believe there are
435 different chemicals

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:49.760 align:middle line:10%
in the chemical plant.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.490 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of understanding
what kind of resonance

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:55.040 align:middle line:84%
there needs to be between all
of these chemicals, to what

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.980 align:middle line:84%
level of degrees of
strength and weakness

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.050 align:middle line:84%
they need to exist
for us to treat

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:03.090 align:middle line:84%
this specific ailment,
this specific disease,

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:05.420 align:middle line:84%
and this is the engineering
that needs to happen.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:08.480 align:middle line:90%


00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>> To meet the demand
for psychotropic effects,

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:17.510 align:middle line:84%
today's commercial cannabis is
most often bred to have higher

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:20.329 align:middle line:90%
levels of THC.

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:22.670 align:middle line:10%
Humans have selected
certain strains

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:25.310 align:middle line:10%
for certain characteristics
not unlike what we

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.319 align:middle line:10%
do with animals, for example.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:30.650 align:middle line:84%
We get certain breeds that
have certain characteristics

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:33.980 align:middle line:84%
by selecting and breeding
those, and so this happens

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.000 align:middle line:90%
in the plant world as well.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.010 align:middle line:10%
>> You can modify cannabis
through conventional methods

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:44.240 align:middle line:10%
like selective breeding or
even genetic engineering.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.860 align:middle line:84%
You can create all sorts of
tailored strains of cannabis.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:52.370 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at it in terms
of this human-plant symbiosis

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:57.102 align:middle line:84%
relationship, it doesn't seem to
mind that we can manipulate it

00:17:57.102 --> 00:17:59.090 align:middle line:90%
in all kinds of ways.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.370 align:middle line:10%
The therapeutic effects
seem to be related

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:05.870 align:middle line:10%
to ratios between THC and CBD.

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.120 align:middle line:84%
They're really two
different critters.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.460 align:middle line:90%
They have different effects.

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And so biotechnology
opens up the possibility

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:19.610 align:middle line:84%
that you can develop these
designer strains of cannabis.

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:22.000 align:middle line:84%
If you want to breed
for psychoactivity,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.790 align:middle line:90%
you can have higher THC levels.

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:30.050 align:middle line:84%
If you want to breed for some of
the benefits that the CBD has,

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:34.850 align:middle line:84%
you could have high-CBD
strains of cannabis.

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:38.150 align:middle line:84%
CBD is technically
a not psychoactive,

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:41.210 align:middle line:84%
but it does have analgesic
effects, so muscle relaxant

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:44.310 align:middle line:90%
effects and this sort of thing.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>> But can this practice lower
the ratio of other potentially

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.290 align:middle line:90%
beneficial cannabinoids?

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:53.630 align:middle line:10%
>> For a lot of the
history of cannabis,

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:56.900 align:middle line:10%
people have focused
on the effects of THC,

00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.140 align:middle line:10%
which is one of the
eight major cannabinoids.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.110 align:middle line:10%
And THC has many
medicinal properties,

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:05.810 align:middle line:10%
but it also, when
burned or carbonized,

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:08.240 align:middle line:10%
it has a kind of high effect.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And so some people are
attracted to the use

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:16.230 align:middle line:84%
of these high-THC strains
for that high effect.

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:19.280 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is the
other cannabinoids exist

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:22.670 align:middle line:84%
in a certain ratio, and if you
have more of one cannabinoid,

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:24.960 align:middle line:90%
you have less of the other ones.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.980 align:middle line:84%
So we have recently found
that CBD and CBN are

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.510 align:middle line:84%
two of the other
cannabinoids that

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:33.320 align:middle line:84%
have all of the medicinal
properties of THC plus some,

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.100 align:middle line:84%
but they don't have
the high effect,

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.550 align:middle line:84%
and these can be
consumed as an edible.

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:41.400 align:middle line:84%
So this is good news for people
who don't want to get high,

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.220 align:middle line:84%
but want to have all of
the medicinal properties

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:48.230 align:middle line:90%
that this amazing plant offers.

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:54.170 align:middle line:84%
>> A debate remains over whether
or not THC checks all the boxes

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:56.360 align:middle line:90%
as a psychedelic.

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Technically, cannabis
is not a psychedelic from

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.930 align:middle line:84%
a neuroscience standpoint,
and even really from

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:08.330 align:middle line:84%
an experiential standpoint,
but cannabis is most certainly

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:13.280 align:middle line:84%
a teacher plant and certainly
could be put in the category

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:17.060 align:middle line:84%
of these very profound
master plants.

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:22.260 align:middle line:84%
I would not say cannabis
is a psychedelic.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.860 align:middle line:10%
>> THC that nature
provides up to 3%-4%,

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:29.880 align:middle line:10%
and now with the engineering
and the cultivar and hydroponics

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.330 align:middle line:10%
can go up to 28%-29%,
that's psychedelic.

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.525 align:middle line:90%
So cannabis can get psychedelic.

00:20:35.525 --> 00:20:38.260 align:middle line:90%


00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.170 align:middle line:10%
>> What plant medicine
traditions use cannabis

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:44.890 align:middle line:10%
as an accessory to aid
the healing potency

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:49.510 align:middle line:10%
of the ceremonial
psychedelic, and why?

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>> There is, I think, some
branch of the Santo Daime that

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:55.240 align:middle line:84%
it smokes marijuana in their
ayahuasca ceremony and around

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.120 align:middle line:84%
their ayahuasca ceremonies, and
they use it that way and work

00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.830 align:middle line:90%
with it that way.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:03.880 align:middle line:84%
For us, the Shipibo,
at least my experience,

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:09.110 align:middle line:84%
is that it can interfere with
our way of approaching things.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:12.430 align:middle line:10%
And so it can interfere
with our experience

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:15.550 align:middle line:10%
with ayahuasca, not in every
case, but in many cases.

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:19.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Cannabis is a really
interesting energy because she

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:23.290 align:middle line:10%
kind of has a little bit
of a trickster energy.

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:26.710 align:middle line:84%
In the Mbwiti
tradition, many times,

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:31.780 align:middle line:84%
because it's a stimulant,
it can be very activating,

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:36.580 align:middle line:84%
cannabis can be used
to calm and to ground.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.790 align:middle line:84%
But one thing about
cannabis is it can also

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:42.100 align:middle line:90%
reactivate other medicines.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.290 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if
you smoke cannabis

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:47.200 align:middle line:84%
after taking
5-MeO-DMT, you can go

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.410 align:middle line:84%
right back into
a full experience

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:53.470 align:middle line:90%
without taking the 5-MeO.

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:57.730 align:middle line:84%
So I think that you have to
be careful with cannabis,

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:01.270 align:middle line:84%
but it is traditionally
part of the medicine

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:07.640 align:middle line:84%
bag of most medicine teachers
in the indigenous traditions.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So cannabis is a
powerful plant medicine,

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:13.690 align:middle line:84%
highly regarded as a
master plant as well,

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:15.640 align:middle line:90%
even in the Amazon.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I do see it as
a spiritual teacher

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:20.680 align:middle line:90%
for many people.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.170 align:middle line:10%
For the Shipibos, the
people that I work with,

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:28.210 align:middle line:10%
they just comment that
marijuana, like many plants,

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:29.710 align:middle line:10%
has its dark side.

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:31.690 align:middle line:84%
It has its light side,
its medicine side,

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:33.610 align:middle line:90%
and it has its dark side.

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:36.940 align:middle line:84%
The dark side of marijuana is
a tendency towards anxiety,

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:38.590 align:middle line:90%
tendency towards paranoia.

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:41.830 align:middle line:84%
They call it like a
sticky energy, holding on.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.770 align:middle line:84%
You don't progress
emotionally, like delaying

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:47.620 align:middle line:84%
emotional maturation,
staying into some kind

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:51.860 align:middle line:84%
of adolescent attitudes
about certain things.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:55.580 align:middle line:84%
So they would warn
that that's also there.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:59.440 align:middle line:84%
So we need to be aware
of that and still find

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:03.640 align:middle line:90%
ways to use it medicinally.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:08.140 align:middle line:10%
>> Is it possible that these
imbalances can be harmful

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:14.510 align:middle line:10%
and that the prohibition
of cannabis was justified?

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>> The THC mostly affects
the way your brain works.

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.980 align:middle line:84%
It interferes with
your short-term memory,

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:24.270 align:middle line:84%
your concentration, even with
how well you learn things.

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Like tobacco, inhaling
marijuana smoke

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:28.980 align:middle line:84%
is dangerous to
your lungs and can

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.760 align:middle line:84%
be harmful to your heart,
your reproductive system,

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.040 align:middle line:90%
and your immune system.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And the chemicals in pot
can stay in your body

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:42.280 align:middle line:84%
up to 30 days, long
after the high wears off.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Most experts agree it's
not something that can kill

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:49.460 align:middle line:90%
an individual by overdosing.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>> There's usually a mechanism.

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:56.140 align:middle line:10%
For example, opiates--
people die from overdose

00:23:56.140 --> 00:24:00.370 align:middle line:10%
because it suppresses
respiration,

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:04.750 align:middle line:10%
but cannabis just does not
affect those core brain stem

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:07.365 align:middle line:10%
functions that
maintain breathing

00:24:07.365 --> 00:24:08.740 align:middle line:10%
and all the other
things that are

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:12.500 align:middle line:10%
keeping us going in the
autonomic nervous system.

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:16.135 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a matter of they
just don't have those effects.

00:24:16.135 --> 00:24:18.780 align:middle line:90%


00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:23.550 align:middle line:84%
>> For decades, cannabis was
demonized and criminalized

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:27.150 align:middle line:84%
despite its relative safety,
especially when compared

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:30.470 align:middle line:90%
to other substances.

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:33.940 align:middle line:10%
So now can this plant
finally bring even

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.325 align:middle line:10%
the most nature-blind
consumers back to their senses?

00:24:37.325 --> 00:24:41.360 align:middle line:90%


00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Early civilizations owe a
debt of gratitude to hemp.

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:50.160 align:middle line:84%
Simple yet strong
hemp ropes enabled

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:55.130 align:middle line:84%
us to conquer the oceans
with our sailing vessels

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:59.120 align:middle line:84%
and helped us to domesticate
livestock and horses,

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.970 align:middle line:84%
allowing us to migrate
vast distances.

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:04.570 align:middle line:90%


00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:08.920 align:middle line:84%
While cannabis' spiritual
potential is well-established,

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.800 align:middle line:84%
hemp has important
practical applications

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.170 align:middle line:90%
in the physical world.

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Astonishingly, our
ancestors seemed

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:20.180 align:middle line:84%
to have an understanding
of this as well.

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:23.080 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just
consumed or smoked.

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Hemp was literally one of the
building blocks of civilization

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.980 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Cannabis is such
a versatile plant,

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:37.120 align:middle line:84%
and we're still discovering
its myriad of benefits.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.580 align:middle line:84%
But in the ancient
world, it's possible

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:46.090 align:middle line:84%
that cannabis was used as food,
that it was used as medicine,

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:49.570 align:middle line:84%
that it was used
as a fiber plant,

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:53.080 align:middle line:84%
that it was used
for animal bedding--

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:57.250 align:middle line:84%
the leaves can be fodder for
animals, for horses and goats

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:59.020 align:middle line:90%
and so forth--

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:02.230 align:middle line:84%
that it was used as
building material, roofing.

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:05.840 align:middle line:90%


00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>> In the sixth century, the
Merovingian Dynasty built many

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:15.110 align:middle line:84%
bridges throughout the south
of France made of stone

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:17.720 align:middle line:90%
and a hemp-based concrete.

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:21.125 align:middle line:84%
These structures have
stood the test of time.

00:26:21.125 --> 00:26:25.190 align:middle line:90%


00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:30.460 align:middle line:84%
This durable substance wasn't
relegated to southern France.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Nearly 5,000 miles away
near Maharashtra, India,

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:38.560 align:middle line:84%
a similar mixture
of hemp and clay

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.635 align:middle line:84%
was found plastered on the
walls of the alora caves.

00:26:41.635 --> 00:26:45.980 align:middle line:90%


00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:49.670 align:middle line:10%
Over time, hemp
fell out of favor,

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:54.040 align:middle line:10%
hastened by the
prohibition of the plant.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:58.770 align:middle line:84%
But now, coinciding with
the acceptance of cannabis,

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:03.270 align:middle line:84%
hemp's versatility as a
textile and building material

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:09.140 align:middle line:84%
is being rediscovered
in some surprising ways.

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Builders have
updated the concrete

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:15.770 align:middle line:84%
from Merovingian
times, and many believe

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:19.550 align:middle line:84%
this is not only superior
to traditional concrete,

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:22.770 align:middle line:90%
but more sustainable.

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:26.310 align:middle line:84%
Innovative products
derived from hemp

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:29.130 align:middle line:84%
can also replace less
sustainable materials

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:36.540 align:middle line:84%
for cars, homes, planes,
shipping materials, paper

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:42.460 align:middle line:90%
goods, packaging, and clothing.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:46.200 align:middle line:84%
So much of what we
currently use, like plastic,

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.290 align:middle line:84%
is destructive to the
environment or simply

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:52.110 align:middle line:90%
unsustainable.

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:56.010 align:middle line:84%
Could the reemergence
of hemp be one more way

00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:58.530 align:middle line:84%
to help us live more
harmoniously with nature?

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:01.710 align:middle line:90%


00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:06.000 align:middle line:10%
Cannabis is often consumed
in a communal setting,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.290 align:middle line:10%
helping individuals connect
on a spiritual level.

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:12.120 align:middle line:84%
But what if it can
make connections

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:15.090 align:middle line:84%
on a technological
level by meeting

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:18.775 align:middle line:84%
our need for inexpensive
supercapacitors and energy

00:28:18.775 --> 00:28:19.575 align:middle line:90%
systems?

00:28:19.575 --> 00:28:22.610 align:middle line:90%


00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Lithium batteries are
used in just about all

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.160 align:middle line:84%
of our cutting-edge
technologies--

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:34.500 align:middle line:84%
smartphones, computers,
and even electric cars.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:39.390 align:middle line:84%
While their ability to recharge
cuts back on some waste,

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:42.870 align:middle line:84%
we pay a heavy price
for their production,

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:48.860 align:middle line:84%
environmentally
and economically.

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:51.920 align:middle line:84%
The extraction of
lithium and graphene

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.170 align:middle line:84%
as well as the toxic
chemicals needed

00:28:54.170 --> 00:29:02.090 align:middle line:84%
to process them are polluting
our soil, air, and water.

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:04.880 align:middle line:10%
Researchers are unlocking
the capabilities

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:09.050 align:middle line:10%
of hemp-derived graphene,
opening the possibility

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:13.070 align:middle line:10%
of creating batteries that
are just as powerful, more

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:17.150 align:middle line:10%
sustainable, and cost a small
fraction of today's leading

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:19.910 align:middle line:10%
tech.

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Cannabis has the potential
to bring a more cost-effective

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:27.395 align:middle line:84%
and eco-friendly solution
to our technological future.

00:29:27.395 --> 00:29:30.120 align:middle line:90%


00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Could its mind-bending
effects also

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.700 align:middle line:84%
hold the key to our
spiritual future,

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:42.510 align:middle line:84%
bringing human beings back
to the ecology of Gaia?

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>> I have great hopes for
this plant, cannabis sativa.

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:49.020 align:middle line:10%
With so many problems
on our planet,

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.390 align:middle line:10%
even though there's
so many plants,

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:54.540 align:middle line:10%
this is one plant that
could heal so many

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:58.710 align:middle line:10%
of the environmental travesties
that we have going on.

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:00.480 align:middle line:90%
The world needs hemp.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.280 align:middle line:84%
I know if I were
going to another world

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.230 align:middle line:84%
and could bring
one plant with me,

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:07.830 align:middle line:84%
