00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>> As we look at the world, at
society's impact on the planet,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.060 align:middle line:84%
many ideas abound regarding
what kind of species cannot seem

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.210 align:middle line:84%
to help but destroy
its own habitat.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Is this just human behavior,
or is humanity sick?

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.070 align:middle line:10%
According to interpretations
of cave and rock art,

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.520 align:middle line:10%
shamanism begin as early as
humanity's great leap forward

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.810 align:middle line:10%
in human consciousness, almost
as if the shamanic impulse

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.710 align:middle line:10%
emerged because the planet knew
that the spiritual practices

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.180 align:middle line:10%
and listening to
the Earth would be

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.650 align:middle line:10%
needed to balance the behavior
of future generations.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.420 align:middle line:10%
The use of psychedelic
plants have

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.870 align:middle line:10%
been associated with
shamanism since the beginning,

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.630 align:middle line:10%
and many believe that the
shamanic use of psychedelics

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.510 align:middle line:10%
could be one key to creating
a sustainable future,

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.560 align:middle line:10%
not simply by living in
the past but by bringing

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.590 align:middle line:10%
the wisdom of the past
with us and building

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.460 align:middle line:10%
a psychedelic friendly
society and a holistic world,

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.020 align:middle line:10%
one where the face of religion,
pharmacology, architecture,

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.380 align:middle line:10%
and city planning are in
line with the morality

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.210 align:middle line:10%
and conscience that the plant
sacraments tend to evoke.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.770 align:middle line:10%
But over the centuries,
modern society

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.590 align:middle line:10%
has slowly replaced the
practice of shamanism

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.100 align:middle line:10%
and shunned the use
of psychedelic plants.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.280 align:middle line:10%
So what are the consequences
of a species divorcing itself

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.780 align:middle line:10%
from its true nature
and from its past?

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.470 align:middle line:10%
>> I think one of the problems
that we face as humans today is

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.060 align:middle line:10%
that we've lost touch
with human nature.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.240 align:middle line:10%
We've become so enculturated,
socialized, technolized

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.940 align:middle line:10%
that we no longer recognize
what's really truly

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.680 align:middle line:10%
important to human beings.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And what I've hoped to be
able to do through my work

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.419 align:middle line:84%
is to help people
understand that there's

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:13.530 align:middle line:84%
something about spirituality
that's part of human nature,

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.250 align:middle line:84%
that humans evolved through
spiritual practices.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.820 align:middle line:84%
The supernatural is a natural
part of human experience

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.670 align:middle line:84%
and it's been a very important
part of human evolution.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.160 align:middle line:84%
Shamanism is part
of our human nature.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.860 align:middle line:84%
We need to engage in
shamanic practices

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.730 align:middle line:84%
in order to give expression to
aspects of our human nature.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.680 align:middle line:10%
And I think that there
is increasing evidence

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.140 align:middle line:10%
that part of our human
nature was shaped

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.060 align:middle line:10%
by these environmental
influences

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.540 align:middle line:10%
that we call psychedelics, that
in essence are neurotransmitter

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.130 align:middle line:10%
systems were selected for our
ancestor species that were best

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.680 align:middle line:10%
capable of taking
these substances

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.140 align:middle line:10%
and using them constructively.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.950 align:middle line:10%
>> In several
shamanic traditions,

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.400 align:middle line:10%
as well as modern
spiritual disciplines,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.940 align:middle line:10%
the human organism is seen
as a microcosm of the planet,

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.900 align:middle line:10%
and one integral way of
influencing the planet is

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.630 align:middle line:10%
by living differently
from within.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.870 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest shifts that
can occur within a human body

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.600 align:middle line:84%
is through neurochemical and
hormonal transformations.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.980 align:middle line:84%
Neurotransmitters are
the chemical messengers

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.580 align:middle line:90%
of the nervous system.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.570 align:middle line:10%
They signal biological processes
to initiate inside the body.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.590 align:middle line:10%
So why is it that psychedelic
plants mimic the messenger

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.380 align:middle line:10%
molecules to our
neurotransmitter systems?

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.770 align:middle line:84%
There are several
forms of plant mimicry

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.060 align:middle line:90%
that we currently know of.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.400 align:middle line:84%
Some weeds mimic
the scent of flowers

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.580 align:middle line:84%
and attract animals
for pollination.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.090 align:middle line:10%
A few of them mimic the
look of domesticated plants.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.560 align:middle line:10%
Some mimic the look of
insects and still others

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.000 align:middle line:10%
mimic the leaf structure
of neighboring plants.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.460 align:middle line:84%
These are theorized to
be survival mechanisms

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.240 align:middle line:84%
for those particular
plant species.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.780 align:middle line:84%
However, psychedelic and
psychoactive fungi, leaves,

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.390 align:middle line:84%
seeds, flowers, roots, bark,
and even animal species

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.480 align:middle line:84%
mimic neurotransmitter molecules
that affect the way we think,

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.459 align:middle line:84%
feel, and even construct
our belief systems.

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Nature communicates in
chemical signatures through

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:21.570 align:middle line:10%
the species.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.410 align:middle line:10%
And the plant
entheogens, which are

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.500 align:middle line:10%
secreted by nature,
when we take them,

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.800 align:middle line:10%
they plug into our
consciousness and our, you know,

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.260 align:middle line:10%
where-- and they
expand our awareness.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's like Gaia
is communicating

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.180 align:middle line:84%
through these chemical
messengers in the same way

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.390 align:middle line:84%
that she mediates other species
with chemicals in nature.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.110 align:middle line:84%
These plant sacraments
and the entheogens

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.460 align:middle line:84%
may be interspecies
messengers for us.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>> If nature mediates a species
through chemical messengers,

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.130 align:middle line:84%
it stands to reason that
there is a mechanism meant

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.610 align:middle line:90%
for humanity as well.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.260 align:middle line:84%
But is it possible that human
consciousness has been limited

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.430 align:middle line:84%
and shut off to the full
spectrum of nature around us?

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.290 align:middle line:84%
If the purpose of
psychedelic plants

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.630 align:middle line:84%
is to cause humanity
to wake up, how

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.090 align:middle line:84%
does this truly differ
from the spiritual messages

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.140 align:middle line:90%
and religions?

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Why are experts now
claiming that these plants

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.590 align:middle line:84%
can offer genuine insights
into the nature of our reality?

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.330 align:middle line:10%
>> That's the beautiful
thing about psychedelics.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.750 align:middle line:10%
It's a thing that happens
on a personal level.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.530 align:middle line:84%
You can use your own
mind to interpret

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.230 align:middle line:90%
it, make of it what you will.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.620 align:middle line:84%
So this is not encouraged
in our society.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.550 align:middle line:84%
What's encouraged in
society through most

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:46.400 align:middle line:84%
of our institutions-- religion,
academia, all of those things,

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.250 align:middle line:90%
social media, all of this--

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.060 align:middle line:84%
we are encouraged to give up our
ability to think for ourselves.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.900 align:middle line:10%
>> And that's the big difference
is religion is something

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.780 align:middle line:10%
you're told and taught.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.930 align:middle line:10%
Psychedelics is a direct
experience that you have,

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.450 align:middle line:10%
and so it brings an element
in that is more real than what

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.470 align:middle line:10%
you've been told.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Your own experiences
is much more real.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Psychedelics definitely can
break long-held patterns,

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.620 align:middle line:84%
and beliefs systems are
nothing but patterns.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it's a
re-envisioning, a renovation

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.490 align:middle line:84%
of these world religions, the
reintroduction of the sacrament

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.470 align:middle line:90%
that we need at this time.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>> The shamanic perspective
of the sacrament differs from

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.860 align:middle line:84%
culture to culture, but from
a historical perspective,

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.280 align:middle line:84%
psychedelic plant sacraments
for religious purposes have been

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.980 align:middle line:84%
used for tens of
thousands of years.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.680 align:middle line:10%
Since there are so many
psychedelic plant species that

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.170 align:middle line:10%
mimic the same
neurotransmitters,

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.780 align:middle line:10%
can this still be considered
a survival mechanism

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.740 align:middle line:10%
of these particular plants
or is the survival mechanism

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.490 align:middle line:10%
more broadly associated with
human behavior's effects

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.590 align:middle line:10%
on the Earth at large?

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.160 align:middle line:10%
>> I think that it's really
important to mention that with

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.110 align:middle line:10%
all this psychedelic insight
that people are gaining with

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:12.060 align:middle line:10%
all of the mystical experiences,
with all the skills that are

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.700 align:middle line:10%
being improved, and all these
different things that come out

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.610 align:middle line:10%
of it, it's most important
to remember that ecological

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.940 align:middle line:10%
awareness is probably first and
foremost what the psychedelics

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.970 align:middle line:10%
are trying to impart on us.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible that just
like plant mimicry used

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.210 align:middle line:84%
by individual plant species
for their own survival that

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.630 align:middle line:84%
psychedelic plants anticipated
the rapid growth of the human

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:38.010 align:middle line:84%
neocortex and the complicated
behavior that this evolutionary

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:41.140 align:middle line:84%
leap would cause
for this planet?

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And if so, how exactly
are psychedelics

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:48.610 align:middle line:84%
changing humanity's
relationship with nature?

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.750 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the interesting things
that has emerged out of the use

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:55.320 align:middle line:84%
of psychedelics is that many of
the people who have these kinds

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.980 align:middle line:84%
of experiences develop a very
different perception of nature.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.630 align:middle line:84%
Here in the Western
world, we're told

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.340 align:middle line:84%
that it's just a bunch
of physical stuff,

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.770 align:middle line:90%
it's just material world.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:07.620 align:middle line:84%
But when you take the
psychedelics and all

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.360 align:middle line:84%
of these filters
are stripped away

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.460 align:middle line:84%
and we start to have this more
direct perception of nature,

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.880 align:middle line:90%
nature appears alive.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.810 align:middle line:84%
It's dynamic, it's
animated and the trees move

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.510 align:middle line:84%
and the trees emit
energy and plants move

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.640 align:middle line:90%
and they have messages for us.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.485 align:middle line:84%
And of course, what
we see in the shamanic

00:08:25.485 --> 00:08:27.660 align:middle line:84%
cultures is the continued
use of these kinds

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.800 align:middle line:90%
of substances in healing.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So we know that there's a
variety of important influences

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.780 align:middle line:84%
that come in terms of human
social bonding, altruism,

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.130 align:middle line:90%
concern for others.

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:41.159 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very fair to
say that in important ways,

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:44.850 align:middle line:84%
psychedelics influenced human
evolution for the better.

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The major problem in the
world now is alienation.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.160 align:middle line:84%
We are disconnected
from our own bodies,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.190 align:middle line:84%
we are disconnected
from each other,

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:57.210 align:middle line:84%
we are disconnected
from nature, we

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:01.960 align:middle line:84%
are disconnected from the
cosmos, from the divine.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.350 align:middle line:10%
So we need spirituality
that you can get only

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:08.380 align:middle line:10%
from personal experience.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>> If these specific plants
provide a way for humanity

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:14.260 align:middle line:84%
to reestablish our connection
with the natural world,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.800 align:middle line:84%
as well as supernatural realms,
what is the next step that

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:21.790 align:middle line:84%
our modern society needs to take
in order to establish a healthy

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.840 align:middle line:84%
and lasting relationship
with the planet?

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.470 align:middle line:10%
>> A medicine-friendly
society I think would be very,

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:28.560 align:middle line:10%
very beneficial.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.000 align:middle line:10%
I think a medicine-friendly
society is what we need.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.610 align:middle line:10%
I think the fact that we
have banned these medicines

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.230 align:middle line:10%
and replaced them
with pharmaceuticals

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.480 align:middle line:10%
is what has led to
so many problems.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.880 align:middle line:84%
I think if we were taught
these traditions early

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.130 align:middle line:84%
and we were allowed to
use these medicines,

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.890 align:middle line:84%
we would not have this
dysfunctional society.

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:47.009 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't have this
massive amount of sickness.

00:09:47.009 --> 00:09:48.550 align:middle line:84%
These aren't drugs,
they're medicines

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:49.720 align:middle line:84%
like any other
medicines that you

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.850 align:middle line:84%
get from any other plant
that can heal yourself

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:52.850 align:middle line:90%
in different ways.

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Only these can heal you
in psychological ways

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:56.440 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual ways.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.960 align:middle line:84%
People that have gone through
30, 40 years of psychotherapy

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.950 align:middle line:84%
can go and drink ayahuasca
once and get more benefit

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:04.240 align:middle line:84%
than 30 or 40 years
of psychotherapy.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>> As these plants seem to bring
the users awareness directly

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:11.140 align:middle line:84%
into the heart of the issue,
to face it head on, the current

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.690 align:middle line:84%
drugs on the market
within psychiatry--

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.240 align:middle line:84%
while useful and
effective on some levels--

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.640 align:middle line:84%
only dull or reduce
the symptoms,

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.460 align:middle line:84%
which brings the patient even
farther away from actively

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.650 align:middle line:84%
engaging with the root of what
they're attempting to resolve.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Psychiatry as a field
of medicine is really--

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.280 align:middle line:10%
and even psychiatrists in
the field will tell you,

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.450 align:middle line:10%
I can't do anything, the
drugs are not that good,

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:33.575 align:middle line:10%
we don't have anything new.

00:10:33.575 --> 00:10:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And so the psychedelics come
in and they sort of just blow

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:37.150 align:middle line:90%
that all up.

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:40.510 align:middle line:84%
I think it will sort of
resurrect psychiatry.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:46.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Were it to be approved --and
that occur anytime from two

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.300 align:middle line:10%
to 10 years--

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.540 align:middle line:10%
were it to be approved, I
would envision it initially

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:56.740 align:middle line:10%
to be approved under very
restricted conditions, where

00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:04.090 align:middle line:10%
psilocybin perhaps would be held
by a single central pharmacy

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:09.520 align:middle line:10%
and would be dispensed to
specialized therapeutic centers

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:14.410 align:middle line:10%
with people who are trained
in psychedelic psychotherapy.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I think they will have
their therapeutic uses,

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:22.600 align:middle line:84%
but I think the idea to just
have places where you can go

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.970 align:middle line:84%
and have the experience in
a safe environment and focus

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:31.540 align:middle line:84%
on the experience with
people there who can help you

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.150 align:middle line:84%
facilitate it, whether
you call them shamans

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:37.765 align:middle line:84%
or psychotherapists or
some combination of that,

00:11:37.765 --> 00:11:39.290 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't really matter.

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:44.350 align:middle line:84%
The point is they are
facilitators more than anything

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:49.610 align:middle line:84%
else, but they enable you
to have a rich experience.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.650 align:middle line:90%


00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>> These seemingly new
approaches to psychiatry

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.740 align:middle line:84%
and pharmacology are actually
throwbacks to a more ancestral

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.570 align:middle line:90%
method of mental health.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:04.050 align:middle line:10%
In a historical context,
modern psychiatry and medicine

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:06.240 align:middle line:10%
has taken over in
the blink of an eye

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.780 align:middle line:10%
with brand new drugs, brand
new methods, and a form

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.510 align:middle line:10%
of historical amnesia.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:14.280 align:middle line:84%
It is this conventional
mindset that

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.130 align:middle line:84%
has caused for groups like
MAPS to increase awareness

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.530 align:middle line:84%
of the potential
benefits of psychedelics

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:21.880 align:middle line:90%
through the scientific method.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.670 align:middle line:84%
Many other groups are also
spreading this awareness,

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.760 align:middle line:84%
but few of them are willing to
interface with federal agencies

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.000 align:middle line:84%
in order to move this
research forward.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.430 align:middle line:10%
Founder of MAPS,
Rick Doblin, has

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:35.290 align:middle line:10%
waded through the
laundry list of gripes

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.720 align:middle line:10%
about the current
pharmaceutical paradigm

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.030 align:middle line:10%
in order to increase
transparency,

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:43.510 align:middle line:10%
circumvent conflicts
of interest, and more.

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.970 align:middle line:10%
>> The key thing about the
Benefit Corporation is that

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:47.620 align:middle line:10%
it's not about
maximizing profits,

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.060 align:middle line:10%
it's about maximizing
social benefit.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:53.260 align:middle line:10%
The only investor in the
for-profit Benefit Corporation

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.180 align:middle line:10%
is the nonprofit MAPS.

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.420 align:middle line:10%
So that's our structure.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:02.650 align:middle line:10%
So we're going to be
focusing just on donations.

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:04.380 align:middle line:10%
There is no private gain here.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.700 align:middle line:10%
It's all about trying
to really improve

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:10.420 align:middle line:10%
the health of our society
and help us all survive.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.010 align:middle line:10%
Here's the psychedelic clinics
of the future, one day.

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.129 align:middle line:10%
This is a beautiful one.

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:17.920 align:middle line:10%
One day you'll go to
Google Maps and you'll

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.120 align:middle line:10%
say, where is a psychedelic
clinic, and you'll get this.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>> With a new approach to
keeping future pharma ethical

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:28.210 align:middle line:84%
and efficient, what might we
see for the future of medical

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:30.800 align:middle line:90%
and therapeutic industries?

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I think what you may see
not too far in the future is

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:39.880 align:middle line:84%
something like spas or places
you can go and have these

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:45.430 align:middle line:84%
experiences highly structured,
appropriately structured

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:48.670 align:middle line:84%
to optimize people's
experiences.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.280 align:middle line:10%
>> I see a future where
they're fully integrated

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.050 align:middle line:10%
into our society, or at least
in some societies of the world,

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:58.480 align:middle line:10%
that there are psychedelic
facilitators that are

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:04.060 align:middle line:10%
supporting people in big healing
and awakening experiences.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:08.980 align:middle line:84%
But I also see them being
used in scientific inquiry

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:12.910 align:middle line:84%
and technical advancements,
advanced creative problem

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:14.540 align:middle line:90%
solving, and that sort of thing.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:18.190 align:middle line:84%
So I like to see them as
being instrumental in moving

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.648 align:middle line:84%
our future forward in
a positive direction.

00:14:20.648 --> 00:14:23.790 align:middle line:90%


00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:26.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Psychedelics in society
might change the nature of how

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.850 align:middle line:84%
business interfaces
with the public,

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.340 align:middle line:84%
not only through client
engagement and technical

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:35.820 align:middle line:84%
approaches, but also might be
seen in the look and function

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.280 align:middle line:90%
of architecture.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.430 align:middle line:10%
Even tribes that lived
embedded in the natural world

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:44.790 align:middle line:10%
placed different values on
living and working spaces

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:48.180 align:middle line:10%
that the modern world
rarely understands.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.180 align:middle line:10%
The Oneida Indian Nation
in upstate New York

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.970 align:middle line:10%
even build their casinos
to flow with the landscape,

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:57.170 align:middle line:10%
rather than squaring them off.

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:59.630 align:middle line:10%
This is based on their
philosophy that boxed off

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:03.440 align:middle line:10%
spaces cause energy to flow
improperly and even the mind

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.550 align:middle line:10%
to operate unnaturally
within the visual aesthetic.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:09.500 align:middle line:84%
An observation that
some people make

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.630 align:middle line:84%
after a psychedelic
experience is

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:16.490 align:middle line:84%
how alien or industrial modern
urban sprawl tends to look.

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Housing developments without
plant life around them

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.460 align:middle line:84%
seem to stand out, rather than
integrate into the landscape.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:26.720 align:middle line:84%
If these plants are agents
of Mother Earth placed here

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.630 align:middle line:84%
to enhance our
relationship with nature,

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.570 align:middle line:84%
industry might lean in the
same direction and even

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:34.700 align:middle line:84%
the cultural norms
that our youth commonly

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.550 align:middle line:84%
grow up with might change
into something closer

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:41.270 align:middle line:84%
to what our shamanic
ancestors used to employ.

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the important uses
of psychedelics in shamanic

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:46.820 align:middle line:84%
societies were to develop
you into an adult.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.540 align:middle line:84%
You went on a vision quest
and the plant substances were

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:54.350 align:middle line:84%
supposed to enhance your ability
to encounter the spiritual

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:56.900 align:middle line:84%
entities that were going
to guide you in your life.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.480 align:middle line:84%
So at 18, instead of saying,
yeah, I can go out and get

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.670 align:middle line:90%
drunk, we'd have a retreat.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.990 align:middle line:10%
We'd send our 18-year-olds
off for a week or two

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:08.960 align:middle line:10%
and they'd use psilocybin or LSD
or ayahuasca two or three, four

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.010 align:middle line:10%
times.

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:12.020 align:middle line:84%
They'd have a purpose
to try to figure out

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.970 align:middle line:84%
how they want to sort
through their life, what

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:15.050 align:middle line:90%
they want to do next.

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And we'd go through
life this way.

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:20.340 align:middle line:84%
When we'd reach major milestones
or major difficulties,

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:22.100 align:middle line:84%
we'd return to these
substances and try

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.980 align:middle line:84%
to find out what it is that
we can learn about ourselves,

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.830 align:middle line:84%
our goals, our desires in order
to be happier about what we do.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:31.460 align:middle line:84%
I think there's also
important social implications.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.920 align:middle line:84%
I think it would be
really useful to take

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.770 align:middle line:84%
the leaders of conflicting
societies and cultures

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.550 align:middle line:84%
and make them spend a weekend
together doing ayahuasca

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:41.720 align:middle line:84%
or psilocybin talking
to each other,

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.990 align:middle line:84%
starting to see each
other's points of view.

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:47.660 align:middle line:10%
>> The amount of ways that
our world might change due

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:51.230 align:middle line:10%
to the adoption of psychedelics
into the fabric of society

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:55.280 align:middle line:10%
seems to be all pervasive, as
these plants cover a wide range

00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:00.080 align:middle line:10%
of applications from religious
sacraments to psychotherapy

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.500 align:middle line:10%
to rites of passage for our
youth and all the roadblocks

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.589 align:middle line:10%
on the way to the final
moments of one's life.

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:09.020 align:middle line:84%
The only thing slowing
our societal adoption

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.420 align:middle line:84%
of these plants as
viable medicines

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.580 align:middle line:84%
is the approval of their
scientific research.

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:16.609 align:middle line:90%


00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:20.450 align:middle line:10%
If the cultural stigma and legal
restrictions were loosened,

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:24.140 align:middle line:10%
what could these plants teach
us about who we are as a species

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.650 align:middle line:10%
and what our place
is on this Earth?

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:32.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Psychedelics represent unique
opportunities for modulating

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:35.210 align:middle line:84%
and understanding the
nature of consciousness,

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:39.620 align:middle line:84%
the nature of awareness, the
nature of perceptual process,

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:46.020 align:middle line:84%
how we understand ourselves
and others within the world.

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a lot
that we can do in terms

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.290 align:middle line:90%
of scientific understanding.

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:56.030 align:middle line:10%
So that needs to move forward,
and move forward aggressively,

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:59.550 align:middle line:10%
because they're
uniquely powerful tools.

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:05.240 align:middle line:10%
I actually sometimes feel when
I reflect back on the fact

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:10.370 align:middle line:10%
that these compounds were
removed from the research

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:13.790 align:middle line:10%
laboratory for
decades, literally

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:17.450 align:middle line:10%
I feel kind of like
Rip Van Winkle,

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:21.080 align:middle line:10%
awakening to the opportunity
now to reinvestigate

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.450 align:middle line:10%
these compounds and the world.

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:26.340 align:middle line:84%
The scientific
field has moved on.

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have all these
imaging methodologies,

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:32.150 align:middle line:84%
we have much better
psychometric measures

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:38.030 align:middle line:84%
for measuring subjective states,
we have different receptor

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:43.420 align:middle line:84%
models for looking at
interactions of these compounds

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:44.930 align:middle line:90%
and brain processes.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:49.130 align:middle line:10%
We understand spirituality and
some of these subtle states

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.960 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness much better.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.650 align:middle line:10%
And all of these tools of
science now are available,

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:57.480 align:middle line:10%
and now we have this very
powerful intervention.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.360 align:middle line:84%
So there are literally
thousands of different questions

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.850 align:middle line:90%
to be addressed.

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Entertaining thoughts of the
future are always loaded with

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.200 align:middle line:90%
what ifs--

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.930 align:middle line:84%
how far can the
envelope be pushed,

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:14.950 align:middle line:84%
how safe is the approach,
how can external technology

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:17.560 align:middle line:84%
liberate us from
internal illness,

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.650 align:middle line:84%
and how do technologies
undermine our body and mind's

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:23.580 align:middle line:90%
natural abilities?

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.880 align:middle line:84%
In a psychedelic society,
the emphasis of life

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:30.480 align:middle line:84%
likely wouldn't revolve purely
around the use of these plants,

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:34.890 align:middle line:84%
but what new ideas for the
future they can conjure.

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:38.040 align:middle line:84%
One highly debated topic
in the information age

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.460 align:middle line:84%
is the future of mankind's
integration with technology

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.950 align:middle line:90%
and where it may lead us.

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:47.320 align:middle line:10%
As new discoveries of
neurophysiology come to light,

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.710 align:middle line:10%
what advancements might
we see in the near future?

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:56.470 align:middle line:10%
>> We may end up understanding
the brain mechanisms that

00:19:56.470 --> 00:20:00.970 align:middle line:10%
underlie some of these
alterations of moods,

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:04.420 align:middle line:10%
attitudes, behavior,
consciousness that would

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:08.660 align:middle line:10%
ultimately make psychedelic
drugs unnecessary.

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:15.300 align:middle line:84%
So it could be that there will
be ways to stimulate brain, be

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:19.560 align:middle line:84%
it electronically or
with lasers or whatever,

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:24.850 align:middle line:84%
and manipulate history
and context to also induce

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:27.910 align:middle line:84%
these kinds of states
of consciousness.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And then the future of
that is really unknown.

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:35.360 align:middle line:10%
>> If psychedelic states could
be evoked by technologies

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:40.100 align:middle line:10%
in any amount at any time,
could this reduce our capacity

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:44.450 align:middle line:10%
to appreciate nature, not
just the flora and fauna,

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:48.320 align:middle line:10%
but the nature of foraging
or growing psychedelic plants

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.020 align:middle line:10%
or even the necessity
of ceremony?

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.820 align:middle line:84%
If an otherworldly
experience were

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.220 align:middle line:84%
possible at the
push of a button,

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.130 align:middle line:84%
would this be counter-intuitive
to these plants speaking

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:01.750 align:middle line:84%
messages of Mother
Earth to our species?

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Another unknown for the future
of technology and psychedelia

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:09.630 align:middle line:84%
is in regards to the DMT
synthesizing gene in humans.

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:12.840 align:middle line:84%
We asked the author of "DMT:
The Spirit Molecule," Rick

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.570 align:middle line:84%
Strassman, about
this possibility.

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:20.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, there is an interplay
between genetic medicine

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.380 align:middle line:10%
and the psychedelics.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.240 align:middle line:10%
And I think in
one case, it would

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.610 align:middle line:10%
be with respect to
the psychedelics

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:28.890 align:middle line:10%
that the body makes on its own.

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:33.750 align:middle line:10%
And I think we're just
beginning to learn

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:38.520 align:middle line:10%
about the genetic regulation
of DMT synthesis, which I

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:39.960 align:middle line:10%
think will be very important--

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.980 align:middle line:10%
what conditions turn it on,
what turn it off, are there

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:47.970 align:middle line:10%
variants, are there
other influences which

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:51.540 align:middle line:10%
would modify the
synthesis of endogenous

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:54.480 align:middle line:10%
or naturally occurring DMT?

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.540 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you
get an infection,

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:03.450 align:middle line:84%
certain genes get turned
on to make antibodies

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:06.190 align:middle line:84%
and activate the
T-cells and whatnot.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:08.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's called the
genetic regulation

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:15.480 align:middle line:84%
of antibodies or antibody
synthesis at the gene level.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Causing the human organism
to produce different amounts

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:22.020 align:middle line:84%
of DMT naturally within
the body sounds intriguing,

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:25.140 align:middle line:84%
but does the knowledge and
technology exist to be able

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.750 align:middle line:84%
to alter our genetics to
self-produce psychedelic

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:29.860 align:middle line:90%
compounds in the body?

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a technology
called CRISPR,

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:36.490 align:middle line:84%
which is kind of going
down into the gene level.

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:38.990 align:middle line:84%
They've characterized
the gene that

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:43.020 align:middle line:84%
makes the enzymes that are
responsible for the formation

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:44.025 align:middle line:90%
of DMT.

00:22:44.025 --> 00:22:47.990 align:middle line:84%
You could engineer a
rodent, let's say, to not

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:51.270 align:middle line:90%
have any DMT synthesized.

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:55.940 align:middle line:84%
Or you can modify
a rodent, perhaps--

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.330 align:middle line:90%
it's not known yet--

00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:59.880 align:middle line:90%
to overproduce DMT.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:05.610 align:middle line:84%
So, if that's established to
be feasible in lower animals,

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:08.430 align:middle line:84%
I think as we advance in
our understanding of how

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:13.130 align:middle line:84%
to insert genes
into higher species,

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:15.388 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be
an interest in that.

00:23:15.388 --> 00:23:18.600 align:middle line:90%


00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:22.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Could using technology such
as CRISPR-Cas9 genetically

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:25.640 align:middle line:10%
alter the natural DMT
synthesizing gene already

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.950 align:middle line:10%
present in our bodies?

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:30.060 align:middle line:10%
Would it be possible
to control the amounts

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:34.100 align:middle line:10%
of endogenous or
self-produced DMT in the body?

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.830 align:middle line:10%
As many technologies are
becoming consumer-friendly

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:38.855 align:middle line:10%
and price and the
knowledge and skill

00:23:38.855 --> 00:23:41.930 align:middle line:10%
sets to perform these medical
miracles are becoming more

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:45.030 align:middle line:10%
accessible through
information sharing,

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:47.640 align:middle line:10%
what would happen if our
neighbors and community members

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:51.060 align:middle line:10%
began engineering themselves
to bring about the DMT state

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.990 align:middle line:10%
on demand?

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:54.810 align:middle line:84%
One of the greatest
divides happening

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:57.060 align:middle line:84%
in the field of
psychedelica is how

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.890 align:middle line:90%
to get in touch with that space.

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Many psychonauts, such
as Terence McKenna,

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:05.080 align:middle line:84%
spoke about the debate of
whether we should be training

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.110 align:middle line:84%
ourselves through meditation
and movement practices

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:09.820 align:middle line:84%
to achieve the
same state as when

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.340 align:middle line:90%
taking a psychedelic substance.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.490 align:middle line:10%
He asked why one has to
spend years in meditation,

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:17.890 align:middle line:10%
isolated in the
mountains, before catching

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:21.880 align:middle line:10%
a glimpse of the same experience
that a plant can give anyone

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.120 align:middle line:10%
within one hour of
ingestion, while others

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:28.900 align:middle line:10%
believe that avoiding the inner
path to those expanded states

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.480 align:middle line:10%
and always relying
on external sources

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.030 align:middle line:10%
is the very essence of
why we are a species that

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:37.120 align:middle line:10%
is dependent upon
externalities in order to feel

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.190 align:middle line:10%
validated and meaningful.

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:41.410 align:middle line:90%
The concern seems to be growing.

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:44.740 align:middle line:84%
New advancements of psychedelic
substances and technology

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.680 align:middle line:84%
are emerging at an
unbelievable rate.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Well after the DMT
trials that Dr.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Rick Strassman conducted in
the early to mid-'90s, a new

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.830 align:middle line:84%
evolution of psychedelic
theory emerged.

00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:00.190 align:middle line:84%
If the DMT trip is so
short yet gives so many

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:03.070 align:middle line:84%
different insights than
do other psychedelics,

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:06.070 align:middle line:84%
such as superintelligent
entities and a predictable type

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:09.310 align:middle line:84%
of landscape, then
extending the experience

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:11.380 align:middle line:90%
is the next frontier.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Neurobiologist Andrew
Gallimore began

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.110 align:middle line:84%
seeing how possible this
process is and began

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:19.480 align:middle line:84%
developing the formula
and protocol in order

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.810 align:middle line:84%
to establish a reliable
process for communication

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:26.550 align:middle line:84%
with this other world
and the beings therein.

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:28.120 align:middle line:10%
>> If we are to
look to the future--

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.492 align:middle line:10%
I mean, if we--

00:25:29.492 --> 00:25:32.910 align:middle line:10%
I can imagine a
society where the idea

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:36.900 align:middle line:10%
of extradimensional
intelligence is accepted,

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.630 align:middle line:10%
a society where it
is normal for someone

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:43.530 align:middle line:10%
to enter a psychedelic state
and to receive information

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:46.550 align:middle line:10%
from beings from
another reality.

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:49.410 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is radical stuff.

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:53.100 align:middle line:84%
For modern, rational
kind of human,

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:56.670 align:middle line:84%
the idea that there are
intelligences beyond

00:25:56.670 --> 00:26:00.540 align:middle line:90%
this reality is extraordinary.

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:04.470 align:middle line:84%
It occurred to me that the time
that people spent in this space

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:06.187 align:middle line:90%
was often frustrating.

00:26:06.187 --> 00:26:07.770 align:middle line:84%
People would enter
this space and then

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:10.050 align:middle line:84%
they would be dragged
back out, often just

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:12.390 align:middle line:84%
as they had established
some sort of communication.

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:14.510 align:middle line:84%
They said, I have
to go, I have to go,

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:17.400 align:middle line:84%
and they're dragged back,
often against their will,

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.740 align:middle line:90%
into the consensus world.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.990 align:middle line:84%
DMT has a number of
properties, a number

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:23.940 align:middle line:84%
of its unique properties,
that are not shared

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.210 align:middle line:90%
by other classic psychedelics.

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, the main one, the
characteristic feature of DMT,

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.720 align:middle line:90%
is it's very short-acting.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:34.440 align:middle line:84%
The second feature is this
lack of subjective tolerance.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.720 align:middle line:84%
So you can inject
someone with DMT.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.600 align:middle line:84%
This is something
Rick Strassman did.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.940 align:middle line:84%
he showed that you
inject someone with DMT,

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.910 align:middle line:84%
let them have the experience and
come down, and then inject them

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:46.440 align:middle line:90%
again maybe 30 minutes later.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And you can do that
repeatedly and the experience

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.030 align:middle line:84%
reaches the same
level every time.

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:56.350 align:middle line:84%
So these two qualities, this
very rapid but short-acting

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:58.650 align:middle line:84%
effect and the
lack of tolerance,

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:03.040 align:middle line:84%
means that DMT is amenable
to a continuous infusion.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.430 align:middle line:84%
This would allow you to induce
someone into the DMT state

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:08.310 align:middle line:84%
and hold them there not
just for a few minutes,

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:11.680 align:middle line:90%
but perhaps for a few hours.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Though the idea of keeping
people in an extended DMT state

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:18.400 align:middle line:84%
is new in this manner, longer
DMT trips have been going

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.730 align:middle line:84%
on for thousands of years in
the Amazon with the admixture

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:24.250 align:middle line:84%
of the banisteriopsis
caapi vine.

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:26.500 align:middle line:84%
In the ayahuasca
brew, the DMT state

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.020 align:middle line:90%
lasts roughly four to six hours.

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Most people's first impression
of the extended state DMT

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:35.020 align:middle line:84%
journey is that it should be
no different than an ayahuasca

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.560 align:middle line:90%
journey.

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.820 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time on
ayahuasca, if it goes on

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:40.855 align:middle line:90%
you can work with it.

00:27:40.855 --> 00:27:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And with DMT,
you're down and you

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:45.440 align:middle line:90%
aren't able to work with it.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And so that's one of the
advantages of an extended state

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:52.210 align:middle line:84%
is it might allow more
psychological work than occurs

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:54.490 align:middle line:90%
with just peak up and down.

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>> There is interest in that
state and it will turn out

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:02.430 align:middle line:84%
to be an interesting
state, no matter what.

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>> If the interest in using
this fusion of technology

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.440 align:middle line:84%
and biology is directed at
understanding the world it

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.920 align:middle line:84%
sends you to and the
beings that reside there,

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:16.000 align:middle line:84%
the question becomes, what truly
are these seemingly intelligent

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.320 align:middle line:90%
creatures?

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I decided to call them beings
just because that was how they

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.480 align:middle line:90%
seemed, they were being.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.540 align:middle line:90%


00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.540 align:middle line:84%
They were apprehensible,
the volunteer

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:35.920 align:middle line:84%
was able to see them
and interact with them.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And like everything
else in this state,

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:42.640 align:middle line:84%
they were made of light,
quite bright light.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And there's an interaction
between the volunteer

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:49.960 align:middle line:90%
and the being.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And the nature of
that interaction

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:56.830 align:middle line:84%
is like any other types of
interactions we encounter--

00:28:56.830 --> 00:29:03.070 align:middle line:84%
fear, love, arguing,
bargaining, storytelling.

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Because this seems to
be uncharted territory

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:09.970 align:middle line:84%
for humanity, the hope is that
explorers of DMT X or extended

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:14.380 align:middle line:84%
state DMT would be able to gain
useful insight from the beings

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.590 align:middle line:84%
about how to navigate the
turbulent ecological and social

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:19.730 align:middle line:90%
issues we face.

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:22.240 align:middle line:84%
But what are the
potential dangers?

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>> The main danger, I guess,
would be in how people would

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:28.030 align:middle line:90%
manage that kind of experience.

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And you would need very
well trained individuals

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:33.880 align:middle line:84%
to enter the space
and stay there.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:37.240 align:middle line:84%
It's still uncharted
territory, to some extent.

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.030 align:middle line:84%
Having this level
of DMT in the brain

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:42.954 align:middle line:84%
over a long period of
time, we don't know what

00:29:42.954 --> 00:29:44.120 align:middle line:90%
the effects are going to be.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.755 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what the effect
on an individual's psychology

00:29:46.755 --> 00:29:48.130 align:middle line:84%
is going to be,
how they're going

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:52.210 align:middle line:90%
to manage that experience.

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.970 align:middle line:84%
>> It's fascinating to entertain
the thought of what the future

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:57.570 align:middle line:90%
of technology might bring us.

00:29:57.570 --> 00:30:00.120 align:middle line:84%
However, some
caution that in order

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.280 align:middle line:84%
to responsibly move
into the future

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.620 align:middle line:84%
to create a
psychedelic society, we

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:07.320 align:middle line:84%
must honor sustainable
practices and truly

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.930 align:middle line:84%
listen to the messages that
we receive from the plants

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:12.240 align:middle line:84%
themselves in order
to move deeper

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.340 align:middle line:90%
into the ever evolving world.

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:16.950 align:middle line:10%
>> We live in a very
interesting time.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:20.190 align:middle line:10%
This is probably
the first time when

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:23.160 align:middle line:10%
almost the entire human
population of the Earth

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.500 align:middle line:10%
has the opportunity to
communicate and interact

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.140 align:middle line:10%
with one another, whether
it's through travel

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:30.160 align:middle line:10%
or whether it's
through the mass media.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.840 align:middle line:84%
We're aware that we're part
of a large human family,

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.860 align:middle line:84%
and it's a troubled human
family, full of pain

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:44.820 align:middle line:84%
and full of anger and hatred
and war is a prevalent feature

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:46.390 align:middle line:90%
in the world today.

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:49.710 align:middle line:84%
It's our state of consciousness
as the human race as a whole

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:51.540 align:middle line:90%
that is the problem here.

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:53.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a
really messed up state

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:55.840 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, the global
state of consciousness.

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And we need
consciousness change.

00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:00.390 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
work has to be done,

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:02.280 align:middle line:90%
at the level of consciousness.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Nature has provided
us with the vehicles

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.160 align:middle line:84%
to change our
consciousness, to make

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:11.970 align:middle line:84%
that shift into a sustainable
world where we act with love,

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:14.700 align:middle line:84%
rather than with hate; where
we act with trust, rather

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.670 align:middle line:84%
than with suspicion; where
we want to make things grow,

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:20.130 align:middle line:90%
rather than to destroy them.

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:22.140 align:middle line:84%
A shift of
consciousness is needed,

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:25.980 align:middle line:84%
and I believe strongly
that the psychedelics can

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:30.690 align:middle line:84%
play a key role in that, just
as they took our ancestors out

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:34.020 align:middle line:84%
of a state of sleep
40,000 years ago.

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:36.420 align:middle line:84%
It does alter your
thinking about everything

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:40.522 align:middle line:84%
that you look at, and that's
precisely what's needed now.

00:31:40.522 --> 00:31:41.980 align:middle line:84%
That's precisely
what's needed now.

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.720 align:middle line:84%
We need desperately a
change of consciousness

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.705 align:middle line:84%
as the human species if
we are to have any future.

00:31:48.705 --> 00:31:51.580 align:middle line:90%


00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Whatever the
future may bring,

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:57.600 align:middle line:84%
however it may transform the
face of religion, pharmacology,

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.300 align:middle line:84%
architecture,
technology, and more,

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:04.380 align:middle line:84%
perhaps the main importance of
all of our advancements is that

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:09.390 align:middle line:84%
we move forward as a team, that
we acknowledge we are a species

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:13.020 align:middle line:84%
made of many desires,
fears, values,

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:17.010 align:middle line:84%
and ways of moving
along the path of life.

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:19.650 align:middle line:84%
The idea of a
psychedelic-friendly society

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:22.680 align:middle line:84%
is not to encourage more
use of this peculiar variety

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:25.530 align:middle line:84%
of plants, but to
encourage those

00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:31.040 align:middle line:84%
who intend to use them
anyway to do so responsibly.

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And for those with concern
for the future of our species,

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.810 align:middle line:84%
may we come to understand or
truest connection with nature

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:42.430 align:middle line:84%
and use the tools we have
to truly know ourselves,

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:45.800 align:middle line:84%
realize our potential, and
guide one another to a brighter

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.350 align:middle line:90%
future here on Earth.

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:51.380 align:middle line:90%


00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Up next, join us as we explore
the ancestral and modern use

00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:00.830 align:middle line:84%
of sonic in musical tools to
reach psychedelic-type states

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:03.070 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:13.014 align:middle line:90%
