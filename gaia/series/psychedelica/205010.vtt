With so many moving
away from religion,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.510 align:middle line:84%
can psychedelic plants give us
access to our subconscious mind

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.520 align:middle line:90%
to initiate the deep healing?

In the early 1900s, renowned
Swiss psychologist Carl Jung

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.590 align:middle line:84%
developed dream interpretation,
a form of psychology

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.960 align:middle line:90%
based around archetypal imagery.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.090 align:middle line:84%
Some of these archetypes
that he discovered

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.950 align:middle line:84%
are the hero, the
lover, and the sage.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.370 align:middle line:84%
These images described
by his patients correlate

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.680 align:middle line:90%
with ancient myths.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Decades later, this
same archetypal imagery

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.800 align:middle line:84%
is being studied as
the visionary framework

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.680 align:middle line:90%
for psychedelic experiences.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.430 align:middle line:84%
The sensation of allowing one
of these archetypes, the ego,

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.370 align:middle line:84%
to die is viewed
by many as the key

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.150 align:middle line:84%
to tapping into the
collective unconscious.

it changed his life

the ocean of consciousness.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.790 align:middle line:10%
And that right there was, it
was the most humbling experience

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:22.590 align:middle line:10%
I ever had.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:10%
Just to feel my
ego who I thought

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.900 align:middle line:10%
I was, what I thought I was,
completely just annihilated,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.440 align:middle line:10%
and to feel what I actually was.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.480 align:middle line:10%
It was crazy.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.550 align:middle line:10%
It feels so much bigger
and collective to me

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.980 align:middle line:10%
once I started to go
down this journey.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.670 align:middle line:84%
It felt as if for the
first time in my life,

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.372 align:middle line:84%
I understood what it
meant to be the oneness.

00:02:49.372 --> 00:02:51.330 align:middle line:84%
I understood it from a
conceptual point of view

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.750 align:middle line:84%
before but I actually
had an experience

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.145 align:middle line:90%
of feeling the oneness.

00:02:56.145 --> 00:02:59.040 align:middle line:84%

to tap into the collective

unconscious.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.770 align:middle line:10%
Not only that they allow us
to understand who we truly

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.910 align:middle line:10%
are as human beings and what
is our connection to all living

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.450 align:middle line:10%
things and the connection to
the intelligence in nature

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.250 align:middle line:10%

>> But how do we let
these archetypes we create

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.950 align:middle line:84%
symbolically die so that we
can connect to the oneness?

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.240 align:middle line:84%
Science tried to answer
that ancient question.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.350 align:middle line:84%
In November of 2020, a
new study on psilocybin

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.220 align:middle line:84%
found in magic mushrooms was
published in the journal JAMA

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.870 align:middle line:90%
Psychiatry.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.600 align:middle line:10%
Using 27 test
subjects, the study

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.550 align:middle line:10%
examined how
effective psilocybin

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.000 align:middle line:10%
was at treating
symptoms of depression.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.430 align:middle line:84%
The researchers measured
that the psilocybin

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.920 align:middle line:84%
was as much as four
times more effective

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.980 align:middle line:90%
than traditional psychotherapy.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.280 align:middle line:84%
Shamanic practices go
back thousands of years

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.810 align:middle line:84%
and focused on healing the
psyche with psychedelic plants.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.930 align:middle line:84%
This approach encompasses
emotional and spiritual

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.220 align:middle line:84%
well-being, not
just mental health.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.370 align:middle line:10%
>> We have some vocabulary in
our society around physical

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.600 align:middle line:10%
health and well-being.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.860 align:middle line:84%
We have some around mental
health and well-being.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.040 align:middle line:84%
We have very little around
emotional and spiritual

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.240 align:middle line:90%
well-being.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.970 align:middle line:84%
There is no empathic
container to process

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.830 align:middle line:90%
traumatic experiences.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.105 align:middle line:84%
They happen and then
it's supposed to be done.

00:04:35.105 --> 00:04:39.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Plants have a different
gift than humans,

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.520 align:middle line:10%
which is that they seem to
exist in a kind of unity

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.410 align:middle line:10%
consciousness state.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And when people ingest these
sacred plant medicines,

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.350 align:middle line:84%
we kind of entrain
to their state

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.880 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, which is like
a unity consciousness state.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And this in itself is incredibly
healing for the individual

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.355 align:middle line:84%
and for our connection with
others and with the planet.

00:05:02.355 --> 00:05:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>> After millennia of sacred
use among various tribes,

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.140 align:middle line:84%
these plants went through
a global dark age as use

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.810 align:middle line:84%
of psychedelics was viewed
by the Catholic church

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.850 align:middle line:90%
as heretical.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.240 align:middle line:84%
But by the mid-1900s,
the scientific community

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.520 align:middle line:84%
had rediscovered
psychoactive plants

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.010 align:middle line:84%
and earnestly began to study
drugs like Mescaline and LSD.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.410 align:middle line:10%
Following the end
of World War II,

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.870 align:middle line:10%
psychedelic medicine
was enthusiastically

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.530 align:middle line:10%
embraced and researched
by many psychiatrists.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.570 align:middle line:10%
Some of these early
studies were even

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.300 align:middle line:10%
funded by government entities.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.990 align:middle line:10%
By the mid-'60s, over 1,000
research papers had been

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.410 align:middle line:10%
published on psychedelics,
suggesting potential treatments

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.820 align:middle line:10%
ranging from depression,
addiction, and pain relief.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.890 align:middle line:90%
But a backlash soon followed.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.680 align:middle line:84%
Critics pushed back
against a perceived lack

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.110 align:middle line:84%
of long-term follow-up
and criticized

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.390 align:middle line:90%
many studies' methodologies.

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.360 align:middle line:84%
When some repeat studies
were unable to replicate

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.570 align:middle line:84%
early results, the scientific
community's perception

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.580 align:middle line:90%
of psychedelics quickly soured.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.770 align:middle line:84%
This was all happening
in an era that

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.700 align:middle line:84%
was defined by cultural
shifts and civil unrest.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Psychedelic use was a major
part of various counterculture

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.760 align:middle line:84%
movements and soon
became associated

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.210 align:middle line:84%
with protests and social
disobedience, which

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.150 align:middle line:84%
only sealed their fate in
the eyes of the government.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.150 align:middle line:84%
Despite objections from
many psychiatrists,

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.940 align:middle line:84%
the Controlled
Substances Act of 1970

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.750 align:middle line:84%
was passed, placing psychedelics
on the most restrictive

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.322 align:middle line:90%
schedule alongside heroin.

00:06:43.322 --> 00:06:46.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Before Prohibition, my
understanding is there would be

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.340 align:middle line:10%
research for a lot of different
things, psychiatric purposes.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.660 align:middle line:84%
So depression, anxiety,
looking at addiction,

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.160 align:middle line:90%
known as an area of focus.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Psychedelics were prohibited
few decades ago because they

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:03.250 align:middle line:10%
were misunderstood, based
on very little research,

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.770 align:middle line:10%
and some research was falsified.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Also exacerbated by the fact
that people who were using them

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.990 align:middle line:84%
with good intentions
did not realize

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.910 align:middle line:84%
the importance of the
mindset and the setting.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.410 align:middle line:84%
So they took them in
non-controlled settings,

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:22.030 align:middle line:84%
and that increases the
chance of harm to occur.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.180 align:middle line:84%
But now, thanks to
renewed research,

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.100 align:middle line:84%
we have a different
look at them and we're

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:32.186 align:middle line:84%
realizing that they're not
what we thought they are.

00:07:32.186 --> 00:07:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Today, grassroots groups
across the country are pushing

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.440 align:middle line:84%
people to rethink the
prohibition of these plants.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.600 align:middle line:10%
Combined with another
movement to reduce

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.710 align:middle line:10%
drug related incarceration,
both public and political views

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.960 align:middle line:10%
of psychedelics are evolving.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.670 align:middle line:84%
Can this mark a
new turning point

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.110 align:middle line:90%
for the field of psychology?

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.990 align:middle line:10%
>> If psychedelics are going
to be successfully used

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:57.830 align:middle line:10%
in biomedicine, we have to
completely revolutionize

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:02.390 align:middle line:10%
the way that psychiatry
works, and it's likely that

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.990 align:middle line:10%
the psychedelic therapies of the
future are going to look a lot

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.610 align:middle line:10%
like shamanism.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Because shamanism is all
about creating an optimal set

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.380 align:middle line:84%
and setting, and creating
the environment where

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:20.250 align:middle line:84%
people can undergo these
experiences and integrate them.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.820 align:middle line:84%
In order to do that, you
have to completely change

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.520 align:middle line:84%
the economic model,
a therapeutic model,

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.180 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:31.560 align:middle line:90%
So that's a challenge.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>> But experts assert that a
psychedelic like ayahuasca is

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.760 align:middle line:90%
an ordeal medicine.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.039 align:middle line:10%
Meaning you can't just
take it and forget it.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:44.650 align:middle line:10%
It has many properties
that heal the body.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.470 align:middle line:10%
But its most powerful
attribute is how much

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:50.110 align:middle line:10%
psychological healing
people get from not only

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:52.780 align:middle line:10%
the chemicals but
the experience.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a certain faction of
psychopharmacologist who think,

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:03.040 align:middle line:84%
well, the psychedelic experience
in a psychedelic molecule is

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.010 align:middle line:90%
a undesirable side effect.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And they want to try to engineer
the psychedelic experience out

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:12.580 align:middle line:90%
of the molecule.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.290 align:middle line:90%
I think this is impossible.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:17.890 align:middle line:84%
I think this is a complete
misunderstanding of what

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:22.300 align:middle line:84%
it is because psychedelics work
at this interface of the mind

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.720 align:middle line:90%
and body.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
have the experience,

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:29.170 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to be reflected
on the physiological level,

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.440 align:middle line:90%
on the neurochemical level.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Many people have experiences
with early life trauma with

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.050 align:middle line:90%
ayahuasca.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:36.565 align:middle line:90%
Yes, many, many, many.

00:09:36.565 --> 00:09:41.380 align:middle line:10%
I would say that's very
common to see how experiences

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.810 align:middle line:10%
from their early
life and childhood

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:47.110 align:middle line:10%
or even adolescence may
be affecting their life

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.360 align:middle line:10%
and their current experience.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Past life experience,
there's a few people that

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.800 align:middle line:90%
have those kind of experiences.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:58.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that's as common
but it exists as a phenomenon.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>> The idea that one can access
memories from a previously

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:04.230 align:middle line:90%
lived life is not a new one.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Some believe that recent
studies into our DNA

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.870 align:middle line:90%
show how it might be possible.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:13.500 align:middle line:84%
In 2013, researchers
at Emory University

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.110 align:middle line:84%
conducted a study
with mice concluding

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:20.550 align:middle line:84%
that traumatic experiences could
alter DNA and pass those traits

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:22.685 align:middle line:90%
down to future generations.

00:10:22.685 --> 00:10:25.770 align:middle line:84%
>> These mice were shocked
every time this certain smell is

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:27.030 align:middle line:90%
presented to them.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Until finally, they're
so traumatized by that,

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.540 align:middle line:84%
that just the smell alone will
elicit a fight or flight stress

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:34.930 align:middle line:90%
response in them.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.760 align:middle line:90%
So then that gets passed down.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.600 align:middle line:84%
The baby mouse and
multiple generations

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.700 align:middle line:84%
apparently now have a
sensitivity to that smell.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Usually, DNA mutations occur
when they benefit an organism

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:51.360 align:middle line:84%
and they are gradually
passed down over generations.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.880 align:middle line:84%
But studies like the one
from Emory University

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.930 align:middle line:84%
suggest that changes can
occur much more rapidly.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:01.560 align:middle line:84%
In humans, could this explain
why certain populations

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.890 align:middle line:84%
appear to get stuck in cycles
of addiction and mental illness?

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>> People have experiences
of their parent's childhood,

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:13.650 align:middle line:84%
and then beyond that, and beyond
that deeper ancestral trauma.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.990 align:middle line:90%
There's people like Tony Moss.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:18.420 align:middle line:84%
He's out there speaking as
an African-American talking

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.390 align:middle line:84%
about how he had a major
experience of the slavery

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:24.750 align:middle line:84%
experience of his
ancestors and the way that

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.820 align:middle line:84%
has come through
him and the healing

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.360 align:middle line:84%
that he can potentially find
through working with plants

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.410 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's many other
versions of that.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.450 align:middle line:84%
People just feel this
deep ancestral stuff

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.100 align:middle line:84%
that they're letting
go of, sometimes

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.950 align:middle line:84%
they don't know
exactly what it is.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:43.470 align:middle line:10%
>> So I would say that most
of the trauma that we carry

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:46.920 align:middle line:10%
in our modern day has been
passed along our ancestors

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.220 align:middle line:10%
for many, many generations.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.790 align:middle line:84%
If we really break it down,
what the psychedelics do

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:57.360 align:middle line:84%
is they allow us to see
the nature of reality.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, when
we start to address

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:02.340 align:middle line:84%
these ancestral
traumas, we release

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:06.305 align:middle line:90%
that for our entire lineage.

00:12:06.305 --> 00:12:10.780 align:middle line:10%
>> In 2015, a team of
researchers at the Icahn School

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:14.320 align:middle line:10%
of Medicine released results
from a study that examined

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.760 align:middle line:10%
the genes of 32 Jewish Holocaust
survivors and 22 children

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.030 align:middle line:10%
of Holocaust survivors
born after the war.

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Previous studies show
that children of survivors

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.280 align:middle line:84%
showed a higher risk
of developing disorders

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.560 align:middle line:90%
like depression and anxiety.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.380 align:middle line:10%
While their findings are
disputed by some scholars,

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.470 align:middle line:10%
they found that changes
in the DNA of survivors

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:38.830 align:middle line:10%
caused by the Holocaust were
passed down to their offspring.

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:42.850 align:middle line:10%
>> We need to remember
that we are a continuation.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:47.170 align:middle line:10%
We are part of a lineage,
so we have whatever traumas

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:49.480 align:middle line:10%
and experiences we may have had.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And those, we hold
it in our cells,

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.110 align:middle line:84%
we hold it in our
organs, we hold it

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:54.490 align:middle line:90%
in our connective tissue.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.980 align:middle line:84%
We even hold it in
our DNA or the way

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.320 align:middle line:84%
our DNA is read,
our epigenetics.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.750 align:middle line:84%
But we also are
holding experiences

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.140 align:middle line:84%
of our parents, grandparents,
great grandparents.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.780 align:middle line:84%
Then we also hold
collective trauma.

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:13.270 align:middle line:84%
So psychedelics
allow us to access

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:19.360 align:middle line:84%
our own personal experience,
our familial or lineage or

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.790 align:middle line:84%
ancestral trauma, and
then in many cases,

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:28.360 align:middle line:84%
we can have contact with
collective experiences

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and collective wisdom
that we need to access.

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:34.852 align:middle line:90%


00:13:34.852 --> 00:13:38.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Were our ancient ancestors
aware that we can hold this

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:42.140 align:middle line:84%
collective trauma inside
and that we could use

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:46.580 align:middle line:84%
the epigenetic power of these
medicines to heal that trauma?

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.550 align:middle line:10%
A recent animal study
in Spain suggests

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:53.360 align:middle line:10%
that Banisteriopsis caapi
preparations like ayahuasca

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:57.740 align:middle line:10%
show antidepressant activity,
a therapeutic effect that

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:00.260 align:middle line:10%
has been linked to
hippocampus neurogenesis

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.800 align:middle line:10%
in adult mammals, the
creation of neurons involved

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.140 align:middle line:10%
in emotion and memory.

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Psychedelics appear to
stimulate parts of the brain

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:11.810 align:middle line:84%
responsible for
autobiographical memory

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:14.570 align:middle line:84%
and how our brains attribute
meaning and significance

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:16.340 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.570 align:middle line:84%
For skilled
psychedelic journeyers,

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.300 align:middle line:84%
this can help them
to reinterpret

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.385 align:middle line:84%
meaning from past
traumas or life events.

00:14:23.385 --> 00:14:27.320 align:middle line:10%
>> The ability to step out
of your reference frame is,

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.380 align:middle line:10%
I think, at the heart
of psychedelic healing.

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.930 align:middle line:84%
For example, with
addiction, people

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:36.350 align:middle line:84%
get into these feedback loops
with addictive substances.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:38.360 align:middle line:90%
They come to depend on them.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.340 align:middle line:84%
But psychedelics
that you step back

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:44.150 align:middle line:84%
from that look at your behavior
in terms of your relationship

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.130 align:middle line:84%
with the substance
like an opiate

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:49.610 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, and say, this
needs to change, here's

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:51.060 align:middle line:90%
the way to do it.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.620 align:middle line:84%
What you learn of the
psychedelic sessions

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:55.790 align:middle line:90%
has to be applied.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.558 align:middle line:84%
The real work begins
after the session.

00:14:58.558 --> 00:15:00.998 align:middle line:90%

00:15:00.998 --> 00:15:01.974 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.974 --> 00:15:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>> The Congo Basin,
Central Africa.

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:08.140 align:middle line:90%


00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.800 align:middle line:84%
The second largest
rainforest in the world.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Its swamps, rivers,
and dense vegetation

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.270 align:middle line:90%
spread across six countries.

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:22.440 align:middle line:84%
It is home to thousands
of species of animals

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.680 align:middle line:84%
and over 10,000
species of plants.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.370 align:middle line:84%
30% of which are
native to the area.

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:33.630 align:middle line:84%
One of these native plants is
the tabernanthe money shrub,

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:37.380 align:middle line:90%
more commonly called iboga.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.600 align:middle line:10%
Long used in
indigenous ceremonies

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.530 align:middle line:10%
and traditional medicine,
iboga roughly translates

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:47.370 align:middle line:10%
as "to care for" or "to heal."

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.590 align:middle line:10%
Use of the plant
was first observed

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:53.310 align:middle line:10%
by Western explorers in
the late 19th century,

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:57.210 align:middle line:10%
and the main act of substance
called ibogaine was eventually

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:59.730 align:middle line:10%
extracted in 1901.

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:03.240 align:middle line:84%
It was sold throughout
France during the 1930s.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.340 align:middle line:84%
In those days, it
was found to be

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.550 align:middle line:84%
a mental and physical
stimulant for depression,

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:13.950 align:middle line:84%
medical recovery, fatigue,
and infectious disease.

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Starting in the 1960s,
psychiatrist Claudio Naranjo

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:22.470 align:middle line:84%
began testing ibogaine's
potential for psychotherapy.

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:26.280 align:middle line:84%
He discovered ibogaine's ability
to dredge up lost memories

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.980 align:middle line:84%
and resolve past
emotional trauma.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.110 align:middle line:84%
He reported that the
effects of the root

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:33.960 align:middle line:84%
served as a catalyst
for self-discovery

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:38.130 align:middle line:84%
with visions of the archetypes
cataloged by Carl Jung.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:41.130 align:middle line:84%
According to Naranjo,
these experiences

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:44.640 align:middle line:84%
produce psychological
healing in test subjects.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Psychedelics allow us to
deal with childhood trauma

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:50.820 align:middle line:10%
because they're able to
disconnect us from the part

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.450 align:middle line:10%
of the ego that wants
to suppress this memory,

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:59.420 align:middle line:10%
sweeten the memory, make it
seem like, oh, it wasn't so bad.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.640 align:middle line:84%
That's a mechanism
that's healthy in a way

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.368 align:middle line:84%
to keep the person sane,
to keep the person going.

00:17:05.368 --> 00:17:08.780 align:middle line:84%
But it comes at a cost,
which is pushing something

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:09.770 align:middle line:90%
under the rug.

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And that under the rug
is the subconscious mind,

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:16.700 align:middle line:84%
which controls conscious
reality 95% of the time.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:20.869 align:middle line:84%
This is the shadow basically
that Carl Jung speaks about.

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:23.119 align:middle line:84%
So when we take
psychedelics, these things

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:27.589 align:middle line:84%
come back but not in a
screaming and frightening way.

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:30.560 align:middle line:84%
But there's a great
level of equanimity

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.620 align:middle line:84%
to understand the nature
of what we did that was not

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.050 align:middle line:90%
healthy to push something away.

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:39.140 align:middle line:84%
When we put something
away, we create duality.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.180 align:middle line:84%
The self is the one
pushing that thing away,

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.910 align:middle line:84%
the hand is part of me,
and what I'm pushing away

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:47.490 align:middle line:90%
is also part of myself.

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:51.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Cleveland, Ohio, 1947.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:55.550 align:middle line:84%
A 14-year-old boy goes into
cardiac arrest during surgery

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:58.130 align:middle line:90%
to treat a congenital disorder.

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:02.120 align:middle line:84%
His surgeon, Dr. Claude S
Beck, uses a defibrillator

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.070 align:middle line:90%
to resuscitate him.

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:06.140 align:middle line:84%
The first time in
history the technology

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:10.580 align:middle line:84%
was used to bring someone
back from the brink of death.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.010 align:middle line:84%
Since that day,
more and more people

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:15.080 align:middle line:84%
have been back from
the brink of death

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.060 align:middle line:84%
and many have
returned with accounts

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:21.350 align:middle line:84%
with what it feels like to die
and what the afterlife actually

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.690 align:middle line:90%
looks like.

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:25.940 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, some
of these accounts

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.670 align:middle line:84%
describe something quite
similar to the experience

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:30.920 align:middle line:90%
of a psychedelic journey.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Many survivors describe
being enveloped

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:37.730 align:middle line:84%
in darkness or the sensation
of moving through a tunnel,

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:41.570 align:middle line:84%
as well as seeing
vivid lights and stars.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Most agree that they felt an
overwhelming sense of peace.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.890 align:middle line:84%
In Western culture,
death is feared,

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.650 align:middle line:84%
and the traditions surrounding
the loss of a loved one

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:53.420 align:middle line:90%
are deeply mournful.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:56.450 align:middle line:84%
But many look at
death in another way.

00:18:56.450 --> 00:19:01.070 align:middle line:84%
The German poet Johann Wolfgang
von Goethe said of death,

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:03.410 align:middle line:90%
"die and become."

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Mystery schools reenact death
with a "die before you die"

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.320 align:middle line:90%
core belief.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.750 align:middle line:84%
The Greek philosopher
Socrates even

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:16.040 align:middle line:84%
described death as something
to look forward to.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.070 align:middle line:84%
In North America, many
indigenous traditions

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:22.370 align:middle line:84%
regard death as
natural and inevitable.

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:26.300 align:middle line:84%
Some tribes allowed the dead
to decompose in open-air burial

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.000 align:middle line:84%
platforms or trees,
illustrating how

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.590 align:middle line:84%
they viewed the cycle of life
and death as a part of nature.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Why do indigenous cultures
seem to embrace the humility

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:39.920 align:middle line:84%
and loss of ego that
comes with the acceptance

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.000 align:middle line:90%
of our mortality?

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.810 align:middle line:90%


00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:47.230 align:middle line:84%
While researching solutions for
treatment-resistant depression

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:50.680 align:middle line:84%
in 2017, Dr. Robin
Carhart-Harris

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.680 align:middle line:84%
discovered that psilocybin
induced reductions

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.110 align:middle line:84%
of neuronal activity
in brain regions

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:59.680 align:middle line:84%
such as the medial prefrontal
cortex and the anterior

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.590 align:middle line:90%
cingulate cortex.

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Why was this
discovery significant?

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
where neurobiologists

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:13.030 align:middle line:84%
believe our sense of self or
the ego is created and stored.

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:17.020 align:middle line:84%
The death of the ego appears to
be a recurring theme in healing

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.460 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual traditions.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:23.680 align:middle line:84%
So how can psychedelics be
useful for this purpose?

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.830 align:middle line:84%
The personal journey of mixed
martial arts fighter Rashad

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:29.800 align:middle line:90%
Evans may shed some clues.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:34.330 align:middle line:84%
From 2003 to 2018,
Rashad Evans was

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:38.380 align:middle line:84%
one of the biggest stars in the
world of mixed martial arts.

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:42.700 align:middle line:10%
A fearsome, perennial
contender Suga Rashad Evans

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:46.830 align:middle line:10%
joined the UFC Hall
of Fame in 2019.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:50.830 align:middle line:10%
For years, Rashad was at the
top of his game, a success

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.420 align:middle line:10%
by any measure.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.110 align:middle line:10%
Behind the scenes, however,
the competition and lifestyle

00:20:56.110 --> 00:21:01.620 align:middle line:10%
began to take a toll physically,
mentally, and spiritually.

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:06.070 align:middle line:10%
>> It just kept me so locked
up into this Rashad Evans,

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:09.160 align:middle line:10%
you know, who I thought I
was, who people thought I was.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Living from that
place, it really

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:14.530 align:middle line:84%
was not me because it was
based off of something

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:17.090 align:middle line:90%
that I accomplished.

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:18.950 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not my accomplishments.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:21.910 align:middle line:84%
It was just a product of
things that I've done.

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:25.330 align:middle line:84%
But then I started to live
in my accomplishment body.

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And before I know it, whenever
that character would lose,

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:30.820 align:middle line:84%
it was something that
was very disorienting

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.970 align:middle line:90%
for Rashad Evans the person.

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:37.030 align:middle line:84%
After a while of having so
many ups and downs in a career,

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:38.920 align:middle line:90%
I just want to get off the ride.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, I wanted to be
able to lose and win and not

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:45.490 align:middle line:84%
feel the stain on who
I was as a person.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:47.740 align:middle line:84%
That's what made me really
want to start to dig deeper

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:52.590 align:middle line:84%
and to find out who I am
and why I'm even here.

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:56.380 align:middle line:10%
>> For Rashad the defining
moment was when he found

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.250 align:middle line:10%
himself at a crossroads.

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:01.150 align:middle line:84%
He was struggling between
finding a deeper purpose

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.550 align:middle line:84%
or continuing his
fighting career.

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:06.430 align:middle line:84%
His journey with plant
medicines began in earnest

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:08.810 align:middle line:90%
after an experience with DMT.

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:14.410 align:middle line:84%
>> It showed me that I was
not this physical body.

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:19.300 align:middle line:84%
It showed me that what I was,
was beyond space and time.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:23.230 align:middle line:84%
It showed me that
what I was a part of,

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:27.010 align:middle line:84%
this collective consciousness,
we all are part of,

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:31.810 align:middle line:84%
and in a way, it showed me
the way to really connect,

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:34.210 align:middle line:84%
was to connect
with myself first.

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
I struggle with.

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:39.340 align:middle line:84%
I struggle with
understanding how

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.380 align:middle line:84%
do I connect with the
rest of the world.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And the truth of the
matter was it was just

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.502 align:middle line:84%
a matter of just
connecting with myself.

00:22:47.502 --> 00:22:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>> This shedding of ego and
realization of a collective

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:53.570 align:middle line:84%
consciousness during a
psychedelic experience that

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Rashad Evans had, has been
described as ego death.

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:00.650 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
the ego death is

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:03.320 align:middle line:90%
a death of our own archetypes?

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:06.620 align:middle line:84%
The human body and
nature seem to intertwine

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:09.050 align:middle line:90%
to bring us this answer.

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:14.120 align:middle line:84%
To that end, ayahuasca, a
natural provider of DMT,

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.760 align:middle line:84%
has been called the
vine of the dead.

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Traditionally taken at night
when most people are asleep,

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.580 align:middle line:84%
the experience is
often explained

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:25.700 align:middle line:84%
as taking a journey
after leaving one's body.

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:28.640 align:middle line:84%
This dovetails with many
traditional and religious

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.810 align:middle line:90%
descriptions of the afterlife.

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:35.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Ego death is when we let
go of our orientation in this

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:39.170 align:middle line:10%
current reality that we're in.

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:42.890 align:middle line:84%
It's disrupting the
idea of separation,

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:47.630 align:middle line:84%
being a separate entity
or being, and who you are.

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And that part of you
dissolving and merging

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:54.880 align:middle line:90%
back in with the web of life.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.760 align:middle line:84%
This unitive or
transpersonal experience

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.940 align:middle line:84%
can be very different
depending on the psychedelic

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:04.750 align:middle line:84%
that you take, and depending
on how deep you can

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:06.800 align:middle line:90%
surrender to that experience.

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:12.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Ego death is that
experience of surrendering

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.920 align:middle line:10%
into our interconnectedness.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Rather than seeing how
we are all separate

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:22.000 align:middle line:84%
and it's only about me
and mine, that ego death

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.580 align:middle line:84%
is seeing how important
it is that we realize

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:28.240 align:middle line:84%
that we are on this
planet Earth together

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.830 align:middle line:84%
and that we need
to work together

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:32.590 align:middle line:84%
to solve some of these
tremendous concerns

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:34.430 align:middle line:90%
that we all have.

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that ego death in
the psychedelic experience

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:42.410 align:middle line:84%
can also be sort of a
dress rehearsal for dying.

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:46.190 align:middle line:84%
We can perhaps embrace
death with a lot less fear

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:50.905 align:middle line:84%
and anxiety if we have these
dress rehearsals in our life.

00:24:50.905 --> 00:24:55.030 align:middle line:10%
>> So this ego death is
losing the notion of the self

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:58.640 align:middle line:10%
in experience where the
individual and the experience

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.080 align:middle line:10%
are one.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's the non-dual state
that the Sufis were looking

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:05.132 align:middle line:90%
for and called al-fanaa--

00:25:05.132 --> 00:25:06.590 align:middle line:84%
the state of thought
of dissolution

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:10.100 align:middle line:84%
of the ego, which is similar to
the Samadhi state, the Satori

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.470 align:middle line:90%
state, the Kensho state.

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very important
state for humans to seek.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Psychedelics give
us the opportunity

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:20.030 align:middle line:84%
to experience it
in a powerful way,

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:22.700 align:middle line:84%
but we need to learn to
surrender, allow, trust,

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:25.400 align:middle line:84%
and accept, and to be in
a safe environment working

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.890 align:middle line:84%
with a reliable person who is
facilitating keeping us safe,

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:30.620 align:middle line:84%
keep our guests
working on track.

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:35.370 align:middle line:10%
>> The ego death, that's part of
this disabling the default mode

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:36.170 align:middle line:10%
network.

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:39.440 align:middle line:10%
A lot of what the default
mode network is all about

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:45.050 align:middle line:10%
is about maintaining that ego
and that sense of self, the I

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:47.040 align:middle line:10%
function.

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:51.450 align:middle line:84%
When you dissolve that, then
that temporarily goes away.

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:55.890 align:middle line:84%
The insights that come
out of these mystical type

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:59.070 align:middle line:84%
experiences, you know,
people say, well, you know,

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:00.390 align:middle line:90%
we're all one.

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:02.340 align:middle line:90%
There is no separation.

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:06.540 align:middle line:84%
It demolishes the sense of a
separation between ourselves

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:08.190 align:middle line:90%
and the cosmos.

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And you know, your ego
will reconstruct itself

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:14.950 align:middle line:84%
but it might reconstruct
itself in a better way.

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:16.600 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're a
little kinder, maybe

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:20.040 align:middle line:84%
you're a little more empathic,
a little less arrogant,

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.340 align:middle line:90%
