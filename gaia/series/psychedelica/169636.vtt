00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the more important
and forgotten aspects

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.140 align:middle line:84%
of psychedelic experiences is
the shadow side of all people,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.580 align:middle line:90%
all events, and life itself.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.350 align:middle line:10%
The side of the
coin less involved

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.820 align:middle line:10%
with profound visuals, "aha"
moments, and inner healing,

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.770 align:middle line:10%
and more involved
with hidden aspects

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.670 align:middle line:10%
of the psyche, misguided,
or under-educated use,

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.350 align:middle line:10%
and even malicious intent.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Since the dawn of time,
it's in the shadows that

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.050 align:middle line:84%
lurk the predators and blind
spots that have timelessly

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.750 align:middle line:90%
intimidated humanity.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Some steer clear of the
darkness and keep safe.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Others use the dark to
cover their hidden agendas.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And a rare few venture into the
dark shadows to bring light.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.890 align:middle line:84%
A tool that has been used
since the dawn of art

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.830 align:middle line:84%
and human expression to
illuminate the darkness

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.190 align:middle line:84%
is the judicious use
of psychedelic plants.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.170 align:middle line:84%
But these plants
are tools that can

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.280 align:middle line:84%
be used for the light, the dark,
and every gradient in-between.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.590 align:middle line:84%
So, what do psychedelic
researchers and experience

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.340 align:middle line:84%
psychonauts suggest for
newcomers when considering

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.920 align:middle line:90%
a plant-medicine experience?

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.090 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm the faculty advisor for
the psychedelic club at Naropa

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.210 align:middle line:10%
University, where I
teach herbal medicine.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.560 align:middle line:10%
And there's a concern
that a lot of young people

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.900 align:middle line:10%
are taking these
substances and maybe

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.140 align:middle line:10%
having a difficult or
dangerous experience.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And personally,
I think that when

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.660 align:middle line:84%
you're doing these substances
at a concert with thousands

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.380 align:middle line:84%
of people and very loud music
that may not have the highest

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.660 align:middle line:84%
intentions, it might
be music that's

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.130 align:middle line:84%
coming from a place of ego
and only junk food and alcohol

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.060 align:middle line:90%
being served.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.289 align:middle line:84%
I see that as something
that's going to not give you

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.620 align:middle line:90%
a deep personal experience.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.710 align:middle line:10%
>> For me, I try to avoid
festivals and concerts

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.980 align:middle line:10%
in general when I'm
on psychedelics.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.990 align:middle line:10%
I don't think that I get a
lot of deep inner work done

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.220 align:middle line:10%
when there's music blaring and
a light show and all of that.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.890 align:middle line:90%
It can be fun.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.500 align:middle line:84%
It's not that I
never do it, but it

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.190 align:middle line:84%
can be a little overwhelming
for a lot of people, I think,

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.560 align:middle line:90%
or just not productive.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.230 align:middle line:10%
>> And you have to choose if you
want to use the full potential

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.950 align:middle line:10%
of psychedelics or if you want
to play kind of psychedelic

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:46.880 align:middle line:10%
roulette.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.820 align:middle line:84%
People have taken it under a
lot of lousy circumstances,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.760 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.560 align:middle line:84%
The raves that people
go and get it--

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.920 align:middle line:84%
they don't know what
they are taking,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.660 align:middle line:90%
how much they are taking.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.490 align:middle line:84%
They know they're doing
something illegal,

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.260 align:middle line:90%
the police can come--

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.800 align:middle line:84%
just a lousiest possible
setting I can imagine.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>> In the 1950s around London,
wild Bohemian parties called

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.510 align:middle line:84%
the raves began popping
up in youth culture.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Their evolution moved
through the psychedelic craze

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.110 align:middle line:90%
of the '60s.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And once the '80s rolled
around, drugs and dancing

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.600 align:middle line:90%
became the mantra.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.070 align:middle line:84%
These raves have
been the setting

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.820 align:middle line:84%
for many psychedelic
experiences gone wrong.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.370 align:middle line:84%
The music is typified
by monotonous drums

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.820 align:middle line:84%
and catchy hooks that go
for extended amounts of time

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.580 align:middle line:84%
to afford people long
soundscapes upon which

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.050 align:middle line:90%
to dance.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Others claim it's a revival of
shamanic trance rhythms taught

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.080 align:middle line:90%
to our elders by the plants.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Newer renditions of
these scenes seem

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.240 align:middle line:84%
less interested in
community bonding and prayer

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.030 align:middle line:84%
and more into
recreational drug use.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.050 align:middle line:84%
However, there is also a
resurgence of ceremony, prayer,

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.350 align:middle line:84%
and oneness once you leave
the typical rave scene

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.990 align:middle line:84%
and enter festivals like Burning
Man, Boom, Lucidity, Envision,

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.540 align:middle line:90%
Spirit Weavers, and Symbiosis.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.180 align:middle line:84%
But as culture moves farther
away from our shamanic past,

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.350 align:middle line:84%
the safe containers for
psychedelic journeys

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.959 align:middle line:84%
are less understood
by our youth.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.470 align:middle line:10%
>> A couple of years ago, I
went to a Shpongle concert.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.280 align:middle line:10%
I was signing books.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.470 align:middle line:90%
It was in Austin.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And I smelled more DMT
coming from the dance floor

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.110 align:middle line:90%
than I smelled pot.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.430 align:middle line:84%
So, afterwards, I asked Simon
Posford, one of the Shpongle

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.050 align:middle line:90%
members, about that.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.510 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I smelled more DMT
than marijuana from the floor.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.310 align:middle line:90%
Does that happen?

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.560 align:middle line:84%
He said, yeah, it
seems to happen.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.760 align:middle line:84%
So, there's a lot of people
smoking DMT at dance events.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And I asked one kid that
I was signing a book for,

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.210 align:middle line:84%
what was the deal
on the dance floor.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.180 align:middle line:84%
He described that you
would smoke a small amount

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.900 align:middle line:84%
on the dance floor and it
would just kind of enhance

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.130 align:middle line:90%
your sensory experience.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And if you wanted the
full-on DMT effect,

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.320 align:middle line:84%
you would go outside,
or you stay along

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.460 align:middle line:84%
the wall of the hall,
kind of out of the way.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.080 align:middle line:90%


00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Some believe that just as
our ancestors had no rulebook

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.140 align:middle line:84%
for the responsible
use of psychedelics,

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.870 align:middle line:84%
the youth today are finding
their own ways to explore

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.500 align:middle line:84%
the depths of consciousness
while remaining in modern-style

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.150 align:middle line:90%
gatherings.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.650 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps the
biggest difference

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.930 align:middle line:84%
is traditional
ceremonies included

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.250 align:middle line:84%
only those participants
that the shaman would allow.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Today, anyone with
any intention is just

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.800 align:middle line:84%
a ticket fee and a few
travel arrangements

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.300 align:middle line:84%
away from being in your space,
in your sphere of influence,

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.490 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, in your
psychedelic journey.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.300 align:middle line:90%


00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.860 align:middle line:84%
But gathering together
for music, dance,

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.970 align:middle line:84%
and psychedelic
journeys is not new.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.490 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Greece,
the Dionysia festivals

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.030 align:middle line:84%
were a time for people to
gather, dance, and sing, even

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.930 align:middle line:84%
perform plays and partake in
psychoactive herbs infused

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.650 align:middle line:90%
in alcohol.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Across the Atlantic in
present-day Mexico City,

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.430 align:middle line:84%
the Aztecs worshiped the
god of dance, pleasure, joy,

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.180 align:middle line:84%
and psychoactive plants,
named Xochipilli.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.670 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to know how safe
the set and setting were

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.770 align:middle line:90%
at these ancient festivals.

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.560 align:middle line:84%
But we know they were highly
celebrated as opportunities

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.810 align:middle line:90%
to depart from daily labor.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.510 align:middle line:84%
So, in these moments
when thousands of people

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.490 align:middle line:84%
are unleashing their
day-to-day stressors

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.090 align:middle line:84%
onto the same patch of
land, at the same time,

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.610 align:middle line:84%
just like modern
music festivals,

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.090 align:middle line:84%
is there more in the
air than meets the eye?

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Modern-day regression
therapist and healer,

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Marion Boon explains the dangers
of uncontained ceremonies.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.200 align:middle line:10%
>> What I do as an
advanced-regression therapist

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.620 align:middle line:10%
is postmodern shamanism,
because we are doing, in fact,

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.460 align:middle line:10%
similar of the shaman approach.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:09.340 align:middle line:84%
But we teach our client to go
there under the right guidance.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.220 align:middle line:84%
So, when I'm opening up
at a trance festival,

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.350 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of people
are doing the same,

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.880 align:middle line:84%
and we go trance,
trance and open up,

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.950 align:middle line:84%
there is always some
shadow that can enter.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And when you are
hurt inside, you

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:27.730 align:middle line:84%
will attract a similar kind
of hurt from somebody else.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.250 align:middle line:90%
That is seen as darkness.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.380 align:middle line:90%
That is seen as shadow.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:37.270 align:middle line:84%
So, to work with this is
what ancient shamanism does.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.330 align:middle line:84%
They have the courage,
and the tools,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:47.290 align:middle line:84%
and techniques, and the focus
to go into the darkness.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.900 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't allow fear.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.430 align:middle line:90%
There is no fear.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.130 align:middle line:84%
There is light to
gain in the darkness.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And that light has
to be retrieved.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.187 align:middle line:90%
That's a soul retrieval.

00:07:58.187 --> 00:08:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>> There hasn't been enough
medical research to make any

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.940 align:middle line:84%
scientific claims regarding the
dangers of psychedelic journeys

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.790 align:middle line:90%
around thousands of strangers.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.670 align:middle line:84%
But postmodern shamans
see the damaging effects

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.660 align:middle line:84%
and pick up the slack where
modern health care lacks.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And the best methods seem to
be the empowerment of others

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.090 align:middle line:84%
to understand and engage
with their own healing

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.090 align:middle line:84%
by listening to their
own words, and therefore,

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.400 align:middle line:90%
their own subconscious.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>> The client is
the expert of life--

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.280 align:middle line:90%
not me.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.350 align:middle line:90%
My client is.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.660 align:middle line:84%
They only took the wrong
exit on the highway.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.909 align:middle line:84%
And I am indicating
how to go back.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:36.850 align:middle line:84%
But you cannot go back
by ignoring the mistakes.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.370 align:middle line:84%
You go back by going
into your mistake,

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:42.220 align:middle line:84%
seeing how did it happen,
regression in time,

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.860 align:middle line:84%
back to where you still
are good, onto the future,

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.400 align:middle line:90%
and back on track.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's so
exciting, because it works.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.220 align:middle line:90%
People may say, I'm so sad.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm so sad.

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:55.000 align:middle line:84%
My mother died, and
I can't handle it.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.460 align:middle line:90%
Under the sadness is anger.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.540 align:middle line:90%
She went too soon.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:59.930 align:middle line:90%
She was supposed to stay here.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:00.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm so angry.

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:01.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm all alone.

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.564 align:middle line:90%
So, under anger is loneliness.

00:09:04.564 --> 00:09:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And then we go for
the loneliness.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And we find inner children
and probably past lives

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.150 align:middle line:84%
where you have lost soul parts
that need to be retrieved.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:14.810 align:middle line:90%
They can go there themselves.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.720 align:middle line:84%
So, when they leave,
the side-effect

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.540 align:middle line:84%
is they feel empowered,
because they did it.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.840 align:middle line:90%
Of course, I guide them.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.490 align:middle line:84%
That's my job, but
the client does it.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And that is the big difference
in the postmodern shamanism,

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:35.110 align:middle line:84%
as I use the term, as opposed to
the shaman who travels for you.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>> By educating people about
the energetic anomalies that are

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:41.830 align:middle line:84%
yet to be scientifically
proven, this calls them to rise

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:46.030 align:middle line:84%
to the occasion of acknowledging
just how much we don't know.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Once this is acknowledged,
receptivity and sensitivity

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:52.240 align:middle line:84%
to psychic phenomena
can be addressed.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.130 align:middle line:84%
This is the first
step to safeguarding

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:57.300 align:middle line:90%
against life's shadow elements.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:01.110 align:middle line:84%
However, there is also the
flip side of this coin.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Those who are overly fascinated
by the world of psychedelics,

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.010 align:middle line:84%
yet naive to the landscape,
are in danger of delusion,

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.230 align:middle line:84%
and vulnerable to the
shadows that lurk therein.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.260 align:middle line:90%


00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.740 align:middle line:84%
It is believed by mystics, as
well as some psychotherapists,

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:22.170 align:middle line:84%
that people can be hypnotized by
forces that work through them.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.450 align:middle line:10%
And it is believed that
these individuals become

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.400 align:middle line:10%
driven to climb
corporate ladders

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.720 align:middle line:10%
or inject themselves
into positions of power.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.750 align:middle line:10%
As ayahuasca tourism
is growing, newbies

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.670 align:middle line:10%
are fascinated
with medicine work

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.400 align:middle line:10%
and believe they will
be the next shaman.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.680 align:middle line:84%
Medicine worker,
Boa Cowee has seen

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.890 align:middle line:84%
many accounts of this naivety
in ayahuasca communities.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>> It's kind of crazy.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:50.620 align:middle line:10%
In shaman, it's become
almost a dirty word in a way.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.380 align:middle line:10%
People start doing
medicine or maybe

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.975 align:middle line:10%
drink ayahuasca
for the first time,

00:10:54.975 --> 00:10:56.350 align:middle line:10%
and they want to
become a shaman.

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:59.090 align:middle line:84%
I've even met people who have
never drank ayahuasca who said,

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.298 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to become a shaman.

00:11:00.298 --> 00:11:02.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm going down to Peru,
and I'm going to be that.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And drinking ayahuasca
does not make you a shaman.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.740 align:middle line:10%
Working with your
spirit helpers,

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.610 align:middle line:10%
working with your people
can make you a shaman.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.650 align:middle line:10%
But it takes so it
takes a long time.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.920 align:middle line:84%
It takes five to seven
years to get to that point.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's diets, yes, it's
wisdom, it's learning.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.000 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is
this psychic dredging.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And when you get to that point,
you are that hollow bone.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.110 align:middle line:84%
You're that clear
person that can be there

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:31.030 align:middle line:90%
without judgment for somebody.

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And people who are just drinking
ayahuasca for the first time--

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.459 align:middle line:84%
so what happens is that
people are going down there,

00:11:36.459 --> 00:11:37.750 align:middle line:90%
and they're drinking ayahuasca.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.190 align:middle line:84%
They think that they're
going to be the one that's

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:40.154 align:middle line:90%
going to be the shaman.

00:11:40.154 --> 00:11:42.070 align:middle line:84%
But there is no
relationship-building, there's

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.260 align:middle line:84%
no association,
there's no giving back.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Their ego gets
inflamed, and they

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.500 align:middle line:84%
think that they're the
ones that are doing it.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And even if they
are, the medicine

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:53.199 align:middle line:84%
will teach you that you
don't work like that.

00:11:53.199 --> 00:11:54.490 align:middle line:90%
The medicine works through you.

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:56.310 align:middle line:90%
You are that hollow bone.

00:11:56.310 --> 00:12:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And to get to that point,
it takes a long time.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>> The "hollow bone" is a
term to represent the space

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:07.020 align:middle line:84%
an authentic healer or
facilitator must cultivate

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.520 align:middle line:90%
within themselves--

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.040 align:middle line:84%
an attentive presence with
a focus on the illness

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.910 align:middle line:84%
being healed rather than
the appearance it takes on.

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Being a hollow bone means
to leave fear, excitement,

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.560 align:middle line:84%
urgency, unnecessary judgment,
astonishment, and even

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.860 align:middle line:90%
hope, out of the equation.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.350 align:middle line:84%
The healer understands
they are equivalent

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:32.080 align:middle line:84%
to an electrical current
that closes the loop in order

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.310 align:middle line:84%
for universal currents of life
to flow freely to the ones

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.340 align:middle line:90%
seeking healing.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:41.040 align:middle line:84%
In this way, healing
is not seen as being

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.160 align:middle line:84%
done from one healthy
person to a sick one.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Rather, illness is the
result of disconnection

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.660 align:middle line:90%
from the flow of life.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.910 align:middle line:84%
So, the dangers of
psychedelic plants

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:54.520 align:middle line:84%
is in their power to
connect or disconnect you,

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.310 align:middle line:84%
depending on the
set and setting.

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Set and setting is
of paramount importance.

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.870 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing more important.

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:05.700 align:middle line:84%
I have seen also people
20 years in a back ward

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:09.570 align:middle line:84%
because they bad a trip,
which was also poorly handled

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:10.900 align:middle line:90%
by psychiatrists.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:15.300 align:middle line:84%
They're given a big dose of
tranquilizers in the middle

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.570 align:middle line:84%
and then put on
maintenance dosages

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.660 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that the experience
will never complete itself.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And there are people who get
stuck in that in-between place.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Not only can the improper
use of psychedelics lead

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.670 align:middle line:84%
to psychological illness,
but those who are genetically

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:36.240 align:middle line:84%
predisposed to mental illness
find that psychedelic plants

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.360 align:middle line:90%
may cause the issue to surface.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.630 align:middle line:10%
>> In our studies, we screen
out people that have any kind

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:44.520 align:middle line:10%
of mental illness,
psychosis in the family,

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:48.840 align:middle line:10%
first-degree relatives just to
prevent precipitation of sort

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.730 align:middle line:10%
of an acute psychosis.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.489 align:middle line:90%
There are people out there--

00:13:52.489 --> 00:13:54.280 align:middle line:84%
you probably met them,
we've all met them--

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.654 align:middle line:84%
who, you look at that guy,
and if you would think of them

00:13:56.654 --> 00:13:59.370 align:middle line:84%
taking a psychedelic, you
go, that person should never

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:00.750 align:middle line:90%
take a psychedelic.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.550 align:middle line:90%
They're just not all there.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.520 align:middle line:84%
There are people with
bipolar disorder,

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.010 align:middle line:84%
schizoaffective
disorders, things

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:09.990 align:middle line:84%
like that-- shouldn't
be taking these,

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.690 align:middle line:84%
because they're powerful
psychoactive drugs.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:16.350 align:middle line:84%
Schizophrenia typically
hits late adolescence, early

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:17.290 align:middle line:90%
adulthood.

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:18.665 align:middle line:84%
This is a time
when a lot of kids

00:14:18.665 --> 00:14:20.370 align:middle line:90%
are experimenting with drugs.

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And I get cases from
email every once

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:24.720 align:middle line:84%
in a while, where
someone has taken a drug

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.300 align:middle line:84%
and clearly, they've
become schizophrenic.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And they go, did the
drug do this to my son?

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Did the drug do
this to my daughter?

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.749 align:middle line:84%
And what I say
is, probably, this

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:36.540 align:middle line:84%
would have happened
anyway, because they're

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.730 align:middle line:90%
at the right age.

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And typically, stress will
produce an onset of psychosis.

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Psychedelic plants open the
user up to far more unfiltered

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.440 align:middle line:84%
information, and therefore,
is akin to sending more

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.320 align:middle line:90%
electricity to a light bulb.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Those with predispositions
to mental illness

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:57.180 align:middle line:84%
are perhaps unable to
handle the sudden influx

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.620 align:middle line:90%
of new experience.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.390 align:middle line:90%
And eventually, they burn out.

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Even those without
mental health issues

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:07.660 align:middle line:84%
are at the risk of hidden
dangers of psychedelic plants.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:13.140 align:middle line:10%
>> Some of the unknown dangers
that psychedelics can have

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:19.140 align:middle line:10%
for newcomers would include,
being overly excited about it,

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.530 align:middle line:10%
overly excited about the
life-transforming nature of it,

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:25.110 align:middle line:10%
having done it once, and
then wanting to do it again

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:26.100 align:middle line:10%
and again.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And regular use like that,
overuse, is unhealthy.

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And not a lot of
people talk about that

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.620 align:middle line:84%
in the psychedelic
community, particularly

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.490 align:middle line:90%
in like recreational settings.

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:39.900 align:middle line:84%
They're non-addictive,
generally speaking.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.200 align:middle line:84%
So, people think that
they're always safe to use.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.410 align:middle line:84%
But there can be
moments where you've

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:51.480 align:middle line:84%
had fun every time you've taken
them hanging out with friends,

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.550 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a sudden,
you take it one time,

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:58.550 align:middle line:84%
and you drop into a space
that you had no idea existed

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:00.630 align:middle line:90%
and weren't prepared for.

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And those can cause
mental-health crises.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And in uncontained
settings, the dangers

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:10.600 align:middle line:84%
would be having
the police called,

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.080 align:middle line:84%
or trying to
intervene unskillfully

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.170 align:middle line:84%
in a situation that
may look really weird,

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.930 align:middle line:90%
but isn't dangerous in itself.

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:22.860 align:middle line:84%
There are also people who use
these medicines in unsafe ways

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.320 align:middle line:90%
intentionally--

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:29.340 align:middle line:84%
practitioners that might
not have the best intentions

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:33.090 align:middle line:84%
either to get money from
someone or to manipulate them

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:35.620 align:middle line:90%
emotionally, psychologically.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So, it only
takes about a year--

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.170 align:middle line:84%
not even-- to become a brujo,
a witch, a witch doctor.

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Somebody who practices
sorcery can actually

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:47.800 align:middle line:84%
really hurt somebody just
by thinking about it.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>> "Brujo" is the Spanish
word for witch, or magician.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.040 align:middle line:90%


00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.440 align:middle line:84%
There are benevolent
brujas and white witches

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.980 align:middle line:84%
that are basically shamans
and medicine workers.

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.600 align:middle line:84%
But in some ayahuasca
circles, "brujo"

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.290 align:middle line:84%
refers to a dark or
black witch, meaning

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:07.140 align:middle line:84%
they use the same medicine
or methods as shamans,

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:11.160 align:middle line:84%
but with deception, ill will,
and harmful intent to gain

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.540 align:middle line:90%
power over others.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.510 align:middle line:84%
But how are the newcomers
to plant medicine

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:19.810 align:middle line:84%
supposed to identify the
ulterior motives of shamans

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:22.839 align:middle line:84%
before deciding with
whom to do ceremony?

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:26.290 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't know if there is any
way to spot somebody that you

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:29.130 align:middle line:10%
can say, well, this
guy is a brujo.

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:30.730 align:middle line:10%
And I should not be here.

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And you have to hang out
with them for a while

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.500 align:middle line:90%
before you really know that.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:39.820 align:middle line:84%
One sign, I think, in
the context of Peru is

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:44.530 align:middle line:84%
if they're putting toé, if
they're putting Brugmansia

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:48.010 align:middle line:84%
into their brew,
that's a bad sign,

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:50.920 align:middle line:84%
because Brugmansia
is a drug of power.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And they use it sometimes
by itself to essentially

00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:04.840 align:middle line:84%
make you very confused and
very susceptible to suggestion.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Toé-- is from the Brugmansia
of flowers of the Solanaceae

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:11.580 align:middle line:84%
family, better known as
angel's trumpets, Datura,

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.690 align:middle line:90%
or thorn apple.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:18.050 align:middle line:84%
These contain scopolamine,
which is a tropane alkaloid that

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:22.120 align:middle line:84%
causes extreme suggestibility,
and even paralysis, which

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.030 align:middle line:84%
has been used in dark circles
to convince people to give them

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:28.120 align:middle line:84%
money, unwittingly
accept sexual advances,

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:31.270 align:middle line:90%
or even to induce harm.

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.700 align:middle line:84%
There are accounts of young
women from around the world

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.560 align:middle line:84%
traveling to South
America for ayahuasca

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and waking up after being
drugged and taken advantage of.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Even though these
situations are not the norm,

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:45.490 align:middle line:84%
it is important to
know that dark magic

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:49.330 align:middle line:84%
or deceitful
medicine work exists.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.940 align:middle line:84%
The best advice from those
deeply invested in healing

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.910 align:middle line:84%
with plant medicine is
to do your homework.

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:56.200 align:middle line:90%
Travel with friends.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And use your intuition
about the people you meet

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.090 align:middle line:84%
and the situations
you fall into.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And remember that the
best dark magicians

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.310 align:middle line:84%
will be the best at
disguising their intentions

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:09.880 align:middle line:84%
and getting close under the
guise of friendship or wisdom.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.850 align:middle line:84%
But when the invisible
forces you're experiencing

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:16.180 align:middle line:84%
seem too great to withstand,
remember that even

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:18.700 align:middle line:84%
the most powerful
shadows are obliterated

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.360 align:middle line:90%
by the smallest hint of light.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.790 align:middle line:10%
>> We are more than meets
the eye, especially--

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:28.510 align:middle line:10%
and usually our limited sensory
world of the third dimension--

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:32.500 align:middle line:10%
that we often, unless
we can see spirits--

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.990 align:middle line:10%
there are some
individuals-- but most of us

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:37.930 align:middle line:10%
are limited in our
five senses until we

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:40.060 align:middle line:10%
take a psychedelic
or something happens

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.530 align:middle line:10%
that opens up our perception.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:45.790 align:middle line:10%
But in that moment where we
might be having a difficult

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:51.250 align:middle line:10%
time, people from the beginning
of time have found that there

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:55.900 align:middle line:10%
are other energies that exist
that we cannot necessarily see,

00:19:55.900 --> 00:20:00.370 align:middle line:10%
but that exist nonetheless,
and that if we asked

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:06.400 align:middle line:10%
for their help, that they
can guide us and assist us.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.690 align:middle line:84%
In some cultures, we
call them the angels.

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be
Michael or Gabriel.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be even Yahshua
or Buddha in some cultures.

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:16.900 align:middle line:84%
In the Native American,
it might be the spirit

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.760 align:middle line:90%
of the bear or the elk.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.950 align:middle line:90%


00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Spirit guides,
angels, patriarchs,

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:28.370 align:middle line:84%
and matriarchs from
timeless myths--

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:31.610 align:middle line:84%
all of them serve
the same purpose.

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Human consciousness
is free of all form,

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:38.090 align:middle line:84%
yet becomes most powerful in
this world when it's given form

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:40.590 align:middle line:90%
to work through.

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:43.800 align:middle line:84%
This is how our limited
minds grasp unlimited power

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.180 align:middle line:90%
and give it direction.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:49.000 align:middle line:84%
No matter which guides
or helpers we choose,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.810 align:middle line:84%
the importance is to acknowledge
that we, too, all of us

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.210 align:middle line:84%
are capable of
directing consciousness

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:58.680 align:middle line:90%
for harm or protection.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And psychedelic plants
amplify this innate power.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So, how is it that the
same plants can be used

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.555 align:middle line:90%
for two polar opposite results?

00:21:06.555 --> 00:21:09.430 align:middle line:90%


00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>> I now have the
feeling that science,

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.150 align:middle line:84%
current materialistic science,
no matter how sophisticated,

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:20.710 align:middle line:84%
is naive if it does not
include these hidden dimensions

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:22.370 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:24.540 align:middle line:10%
We had years ago, a
wonderful conference where

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.930 align:middle line:10%
Humphrey Osmond was present.

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:27.920 align:middle line:10%
And he addressed this issue.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:32.935 align:middle line:84%
And he said, can you imagine
a discussion about a knife?

00:21:32.935 --> 00:21:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Is the knife this very
diabolical weapon,

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.080 align:middle line:90%
or is it a useful tool?

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And imagine that you
would have a debate where

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.750 align:middle line:84%
one of these persons
who would be present

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:46.000 align:middle line:84%
would be Chief of New York
Police who would be talking

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.300 align:middle line:84%
about all the murders that were
committed in back lanes in New

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.620 align:middle line:90%
York City.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And you would have
the Surgeon General

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:53.980 align:middle line:90%
who would say, wait a minute.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.160 align:middle line:84%
With the right kind of training,
you can do fantastic things

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.510 align:middle line:90%
with a knife.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And you would have
a housewife who

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.220 align:middle line:84%
would be thinking
about it as a tool

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:05.060 align:middle line:90%
to cut salami or a vegetable.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And you would have an artist
who would think about carving

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:11.214 align:middle line:90%
beautiful things from wood.

00:22:11.214 --> 00:22:12.880 align:middle line:84%
That we would understand
that we are not

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.470 align:middle line:90%
talking about the knife.

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:19.010 align:middle line:84%
The knife is a tool that can
be used in many different ways.

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And the same with psychedelics--
there are used for healing.

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:25.880 align:middle line:84%
They are used for inducing
spiritual experiences.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:29.530 align:middle line:84%
But they're also used
by the military--

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:30.690 align:middle line:90%
horrible experiments.

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:35.540 align:middle line:84%
The CIA-- including experiments
on our own population

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:42.100 align:middle line:90%
and in San Francisco and so on.

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.050 align:middle line:84%
I have tremendous
awe and respect

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:47.170 align:middle line:84%
for what psychedelics can
do on both sides, depending

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:50.380 align:middle line:84%
on the set and setting,
depending how they are used.

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:53.410 align:middle line:90%
They are powerful tools.

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:55.840 align:middle line:10%
Aside from dark magicians
or medicine workers

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:59.140 align:middle line:10%
using these plants as
personal power moves,

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:00.910 align:middle line:10%
it must be noted
that psychedelics

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:03.070 align:middle line:10%
have been used by
governments experimenting

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:04.840 align:middle line:10%
on their own people.

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.140 align:middle line:84%
In the mid-1900s, the
Central Intelligence Agency

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:11.020 align:middle line:84%
was fascinated with
psychedelics for mind control,

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.840 align:middle line:84%
as well as other wartime
tactics and began

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.620 align:middle line:84%
conducting experiments on
soldiers and college students.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:22.600 align:middle line:10%
Then on August 16 of 1951,
the town of Pont-Saint-Esprit

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:23.570 align:middle line:10%
was dosed with LSD.

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:24.370 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

Detrick to an experiment

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:34.360 align:middle line:10%
there involving aerosol LSD
sprayed in the small village.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.120 align:middle line:10%
That affected 500
people in that village.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.250 align:middle line:10%
There were three suicides.

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:43.900 align:middle line:10%
And about 40 people were carted
off to a nearby insane asylum

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.500 align:middle line:10%
as a result of that experiment.

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.508 align:middle line:84%
>> Although much of these
accounts can be frightening

00:23:48.508 --> 00:23:51.940 align:middle line:84%
to accept, by taking a
sobering look at human behavior

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.730 align:middle line:84%
throughout the ages, we
shouldn't be surprised that

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:58.030 align:middle line:84%
those with ill intentions will
seek advanced means of getting

00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:00.440 align:middle line:90%
what they wish.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.520 align:middle line:84%
So, the way forward, in a
safe and intelligent manner,

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:08.070 align:middle line:84%
is to understand the protections
we have available to us.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:10.410 align:middle line:84%
The power of psychedelics
to open the mind

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:13.590 align:middle line:84%
to new information is not
simply to make the world look

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:15.460 align:middle line:90%
better than it is.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:19.350 align:middle line:84%
It's to address the
shadow side of all life.

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:22.260 align:middle line:84%
In Buddhism, there are three
steps to truly honoring

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:90%
the whole of existence.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.880 align:middle line:90%
First is right sight.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.610 align:middle line:90%
Second is right understanding.

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:33.090 align:middle line:90%
And thirdly is right action.

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:36.540 align:middle line:10%
Even though action is the way
to bring change into this world,

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:38.340 align:middle line:10%
that action will
always be polluted

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.770 align:middle line:10%
if you do not see the
world as it truly is.

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't see it clearly,
understanding it is impossible.

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:49.410 align:middle line:84%
Psychedelics help
achieve this goal.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:51.720 align:middle line:84%
They don't spoon-feed
us the answers,

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:56.080 align:middle line:84%
but they do dismantle unhealthy
beliefs that muddy our vision.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.650 align:middle line:84%
They offer new
perspectives to worldviews.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And because of this, a
new and more relevant

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:04.020 align:middle line:84%
understanding of the
actual world we live in

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:07.050 align:middle line:90%
can organically assemble itself.

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:08.790 align:middle line:84%
So, how did the
spiritual traditions

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:12.660 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient past view and
deal with the shadow side?

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:15.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the concept of the
shadow side and the way that

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:18.240 align:middle line:10%
you talk about it is big
in many different cultures.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:22.230 align:middle line:10%
I think, as it relates to yoga,
it tends to be talked about

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:26.590 align:middle line:10%
in a kind of new-agey way,
that from my experience,

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:29.340 align:middle line:10%
from the traditional
yoga standpoint,

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:33.390 align:middle line:10%
I would say that the shadow
side is more this idea

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:37.710 align:middle line:10%
of the unconscious
or the subconscious--

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:39.570 align:middle line:10%
the idea of Samskara.

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:43.350 align:middle line:84%
In yoga, the word "Samskara"
means a habit or a pattern.

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:46.590 align:middle line:84%
It's like this deep,
grooved pathway

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:49.380 align:middle line:90%
that we just tend to fall into.

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.230 align:middle line:84%
The mannerisms that we
do, the way that we speak,

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:54.600 align:middle line:84%
the emotional
habits that we have,

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:58.009 align:middle line:84%
the things that we keep having
show up in our life over,

00:25:58.009 --> 00:25:59.550 align:middle line:84%
and over, and over
again, we're like,

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:02.270 align:middle line:84%
how am I still in
the same thing--

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:03.810 align:middle line:90%
that's a Samskara.

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:08.280 align:middle line:84%
It's this it's almost like we're
being ruled by another force.

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.530 align:middle line:84%
But in yoga, we would
say that we're just being

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:13.080 align:middle line:90%
ruled by our unconscious self.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>> It might seem that if the
shadow side is merely our own

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.860 align:middle line:84%
subconscious mind, then other
individuals or entities cannot

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:24.310 align:middle line:84%
penetrate this realm and
complicate our experience.

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:27.750 align:middle line:84%
However, it was postulated
by Carl Gustav Jung

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.720 align:middle line:84%
that there is a collective,
unconscious realm

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.690 align:middle line:90%
that all people share.

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:35.930 align:middle line:84%
If this is true, the
landscape of the unconscious

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:39.320 align:middle line:84%
would be a shared territory
that other sentient beings can

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:43.800 align:middle line:84%
use to enter other subconscious
minds, meaning that the yoga

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:47.010 align:middle line:84%
perspective might fit perfectly
with psychic attacks reported

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:50.070 align:middle line:84%
by shamanic and
spiritual practitioners.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Even though there is
currently no technology

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:54.870 align:middle line:84%
to verify the existence
of these realms,

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:56.610 align:middle line:84%
countless people
are still imbibing

00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:00.030 align:middle line:84%
psychedelic substances,
entering the unknown,

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:03.000 align:middle line:84%
and coming back with tales
of spirits and entities

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.790 align:middle line:90%
with all kinds of motives.

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:08.910 align:middle line:10%
University of Pennsylvania
neuroscientist Dr. Andrew

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:12.450 align:middle line:10%
Newberg has been studying the
relationship of brain function

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:14.280 align:middle line:10%
and states of consciousness.

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.920 align:middle line:84%
He found that the parietal
lobe of the brain in Tibetan

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Buddhist monks becomes
deactivated while

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:20.670 align:middle line:90%
in meditation.

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:22.440 align:middle line:84%
This area of the
brain is said to be

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.080 align:middle line:84%
responsible for giving us
a sense of our orientation

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.860 align:middle line:90%
in time and space.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:30.600 align:middle line:84%
So, as meditation causes this
brain region to go offline,

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.960 align:middle line:84%
the sensation of leaving the
body and the suspension of time

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.520 align:middle line:90%
ensues.

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:39.700 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Newberg has called this
the "neurotheological model."

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.510 align:middle line:84%
In other words, brain
function is the phenomenon

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:47.500 align:middle line:84%
which gives rise to mystical
or religious-type experiences.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.800 align:middle line:84%
However, some believe
that mystical events

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:54.120 align:middle line:84%
are not caused by the brain,
but simply correlated.

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.550 align:middle line:84%
Symptoms in the brain are
seeing at the same time

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.680 align:middle line:90%
as the experience.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.720 align:middle line:84%
So, if there are
really shadow entities

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.030 align:middle line:84%
with their own
capacity to think,

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:05.220 align:middle line:84%
or if these are just
unknown compartments

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:08.790 align:middle line:84%
of human intelligence, what
communication mechanism

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:11.800 align:middle line:84%
allows us to become
aware of them at all?

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:15.210 align:middle line:10%
Ancient and shamanic cultures
may have proposed the idea

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:19.300 align:middle line:10%
that through cycles of time
and in vibrations of matter,

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:22.050 align:middle line:10%
these may account for all
phenomena and the unity

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:27.000 align:middle line:10%
between our individual conscious
minds and the Universal Mind.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Many indigenous cultures had
an idea that the basis of all

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:41.370 align:middle line:84%
of manifested creation is either
sound, or certain geometries,

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:45.780 align:middle line:84%
or certain frequency
patterns-- certain numbers.

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:47.880 align:middle line:90%
And the Mayans and the Aztecs--

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.570 align:middle line:84%
they encoded this into
not only their calendar,

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:56.160 align:middle line:84%
but in their system of how
they structure their society.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And they recognize that our
body is a set of vibrations.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Our part is pulsing, our
breath, our brain waves,

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.900 align:middle line:84%
every cell of our
body is vibrating.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
all the rhythms.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And if they knew that there was
a certain set of frequencies

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:20.030 align:middle line:84%
that were the fabric, that just
these certain notes or numbers

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:24.510 align:middle line:84%
were what we encoded into
our system of culture, then

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:26.880 align:middle line:84%
we would be in harmony
with the cosmos.

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:29.140 align:middle line:84%
They would even use
breathing practices,

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:32.130 align:middle line:84%
along with meditation
and intention,

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:34.350 align:middle line:84%
to align themselves
with these patterns.

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And from this,
they would achieve

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:39.420 align:middle line:90%
altered or expanded states.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.330 align:middle line:84%
This is where yogis, just like
other shamanic traditions,

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:44.670 align:middle line:90%
actually start to use sound.

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So, there's an understanding
that sound is vibration

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.120 align:middle line:84%
and that vibration is at
the essence of everything.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And usually, our awareness
is caught in all this noise

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:56.985 align:middle line:90%
and sound of the outside world.

00:29:56.985 --> 00:30:03.090 align:middle line:10%
So, as we sit, we breathe, we
start to draw awareness in,

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:06.420 align:middle line:10%
and then we focus the
awareness on something--

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:08.010 align:middle line:10%
one-pointed concentration.

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:13.410 align:middle line:84%
So, we work with quieting the
mind, withdrawing the senses,

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:19.290 align:middle line:84%
and merging with and resting
in this place of awareness that

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:24.890 align:middle line:84%
is beyond just the ups and downs
of the mind and the emotion.

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:26.760 align:middle line:90%
And while both are real--

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.570 align:middle line:84%
because your mind still exists,
your emotions still exist,

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:31.540 align:middle line:90%
they're never going to go away--

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:34.860 align:middle line:84%
we just start to
step away from that

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:36.901 align:middle line:90%
that's our only identification.

00:30:36.901 --> 00:30:40.200 align:middle line:90%


00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>> There are some that say
identifying with darkness

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and shadow is the way we
hand over power to it.

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:49.470 align:middle line:84%
But the traditional
practices that

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:51.780 align:middle line:84%
have survived thousands
of years acknowledge

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:53.760 align:middle line:84%
that the shadow side
is a phenomena that

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.800 align:middle line:90%
will never go away.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.720 align:middle line:84%
It's merely the way
that light works

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.660 align:middle line:90%
in a world of objects and form.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Day fades to night, and
light goes into hiding.

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:08.380 align:middle line:84%
The daily activity
falls into sleep.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And waking consciousness
goes dormant.

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:15.430 align:middle line:10%
Light touches a leaf
and casts a shadow.

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:17.800 align:middle line:84%
These are natural and
beautiful phenomena.

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And when all is said and
done, the dark aspects of life

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:23.680 align:middle line:90%
are our greatest teachers.

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:26.860 align:middle line:84%
The sages and adepts
of times long ago,

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:30.160 align:middle line:84%
as well as wise gurus
and savants today,

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.690 align:middle line:84%
have only one thing
to say when they

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:34.000 align:middle line:84%
peek behind the veil
of their own mind

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.910 align:middle line:84%
and see the darkness
of the world.

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:38.470 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for calling
attention to my blindness

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:43.510 align:middle line:84%
and giving me the
gift of right sight

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:47.050 align:middle line:84%
so that I may rightly understand
what lurks in the shadows

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:52.150 align:middle line:84%
and act in love and
protection of all life.

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Up next, join us
as we shed light

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:56.920 align:middle line:84%
on the expanded states of
consciousness in the dream

00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:01.800 align:middle line:84%
state and what this can teach us
about psychedelic experiences.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:11.342 align:middle line:90%
