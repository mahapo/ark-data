00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Deep in the
heart of the Amazon,

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.630 align:middle line:10%
out of generations
of indigenous people,

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.470 align:middle line:10%
from mysterious origins, birthed
from a specific combination

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.400 align:middle line:10%
of plants comes a
visionary experience,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.569 align:middle line:10%
an ancient healing tradition,
modern controversy and massive

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.690 align:middle line:10%
interest from younger
generations all surrounding

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:14.310 align:middle line:10%
a sacred brew called Ayahuasca,
a beverage that contains DMT.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.870 align:middle line:10%
DMT is a tryptamine that
even our brain produces,

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.830 align:middle line:10%
but the chacruna leaves
contain much more.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Left alone, this molecule
will be metabolized

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.810 align:middle line:90%
before having any effect.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.050 align:middle line:10%
So the sacred vine is
added to protect its entry

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.550 align:middle line:10%
through the body, into the
brain, and into our experience.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.360 align:middle line:90%


00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.320 align:middle line:84%
From scientists to
shamans, many theories

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.680 align:middle line:84%
abound regarding the strange
effects of Ayahuasca,

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.060 align:middle line:84%
and yet it still is
not fully understood.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.182 align:middle line:90%
>> So Ayahuasca is--

00:01:51.182 --> 00:01:52.390 align:middle line:90%
it's a whole bunch of things.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.670 align:middle line:10%
But you know, on the nuts and
bolts level, it's a beverage.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.400 align:middle line:84%
It's made from two plants,
at least one of which

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.610 align:middle line:90%
contains dimethyltryptamine.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.760 align:middle line:84%
At the cultural level, it's
much broader than that.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.169 align:middle line:84%
These are essentially
shamanic practices,

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:13.120 align:middle line:84%
and Ayahuasca is at
the center of that kind

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.910 align:middle line:84%
of traditional
medicine, you know,

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.670 align:middle line:84%
which is really a mind
body kind of medicine.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>> This mind-body medicine
has been used for so long

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.210 align:middle line:84%
in a region devoid of literature
that the true beginnings

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.290 align:middle line:84%
of Ayahuasca are left to
oral traditions and myth.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.480 align:middle line:84%
There are only a few
cultural artifacts

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.060 align:middle line:84%
that have survived this
hot and wet climate

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.160 align:middle line:84%
before being
completely decomposed

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.170 align:middle line:90%
and recycled back into nature.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And the mystery of how the
indigenous discovered these two

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.710 align:middle line:84%
ingredients among
countless other species

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.630 align:middle line:90%
has baffled the world.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Why do these few plants,
out of a half a million

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.920 align:middle line:10%
in the world, have these
unearthly effects on the mind

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.120 align:middle line:10%
and sometimes on the body, that
they think can transport him

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.940 align:middle line:10%
to outer realms of space?

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And they believe in these plants
there is a resident spirit.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Ayahuasca was the only
psychedelic session where I had

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.500 align:middle line:10%
a sense of a personal therapist,
kind of like a spiritual guide

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.260 align:middle line:10%
of some sort,
which I didn't see,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.590 align:middle line:10%
but it was a very clear
sense of energetic presence

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.830 align:middle line:10%
and telepathic communication
guiding me in a very specific

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.580 align:middle line:10%
way through my sessions, what
I should look at, what I should

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.870 align:middle line:10%
work on.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And if I didn't
do it, it sort of

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.400 align:middle line:84%
returned and was sort of putting
some pressure on me to do it,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.200 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.770 align:middle line:84%
It had an intention for
me, what I should do,

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.200 align:middle line:84%
what I should become
in that session.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>> The indigenous of the
Amazon refer to it as Mother

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Ayahuasca, known by some to be
the divine feminine principle

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.700 align:middle line:90%
and the first woman of creation.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.130 align:middle line:84%
The Ayahuasqueros,
or healers, say

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.410 align:middle line:84%
it is her that we
commune with for guidance

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.420 align:middle line:84%
before, during, and
after drinking Ayahuasca.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.079 align:middle line:84%
It is she that allows us access
to all that we've forgotten

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.750 align:middle line:90%
in this life and all others.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.880 align:middle line:84%
However, in the
initial ceremonies

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.550 align:middle line:84%
where people are introduced
to this resident spirit,

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.370 align:middle line:84%
it can be painful and
quite confrontational

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.310 align:middle line:84%
because so much of our
trauma is unknown to us,

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.680 align:middle line:84%
and therefore we rarely
acknowledge our baggage

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.220 align:middle line:90%
as a part of us.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.955 align:middle line:84%
>> So, what Ayahuasca does is
she goes through the physical

00:04:36.955 --> 00:04:39.460 align:middle line:90%
and energetic body--

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.330 align:middle line:84%
and emotional bodies-- that
are totally interconnected.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.520 align:middle line:10%
And she's going
through and our traumas

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.980 align:middle line:10%
are held in the tissues.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.560 align:middle line:10%
And so, she's going and
ripping out that stuff.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.010 align:middle line:10%
And so, it hurts, whether it be
physical, through nauseousness.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Or even actual pain,
or sometimes we

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.480 align:middle line:84%
have that stuff in our thought
processes, our patterns.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And so, we're holding
onto this stuff,

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.300 align:middle line:84%
and Ayahuasca is
opening, opening, opening

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.420 align:middle line:90%
and pulling that stuff out.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone's experiences are
different in personal ways.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.880 align:middle line:90%
Not everyone experiences pain.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.770 align:middle line:90%
Some are left in ecstasy.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.620 align:middle line:84%
But no two ceremonies
are identical.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Some describe the
evolution of ceremonies

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.020 align:middle line:84%
as the medicine speaking
a story of our blind spots

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.310 align:middle line:90%
and ailments.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Although traditionally the
main purpose of Ayahuasca

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.080 align:middle line:84%
has been for healing,
it's typically

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.830 align:middle line:84%
the visionary quality that
initially attracts newcomers.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.240 align:middle line:84%
They come with curiosity,
expectation, ambition,

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.160 align:middle line:84%
and a drive to
become enlightened,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.262 align:middle line:90%
a mystic, a spiritual savant.

00:05:50.262 --> 00:05:51.720 align:middle line:10%
But if you listen
to those who have

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.880 align:middle line:10%
spent many years
with the medicine,

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.910 align:middle line:10%
or even just a few weeks
in a traditional setting,

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.860 align:middle line:10%
you'll learn that
the path to heaven

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.610 align:middle line:10%
often comes through the
belly of a personal hell.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.860 align:middle line:84%
The wake-up call
happens when those

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.930 align:middle line:84%
who want to merge
with pure divinity

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.640 align:middle line:84%
are faced with their
fears of death.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.450 align:middle line:84%
In Ayahuasca culture,
facing mortality

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.720 align:middle line:84%
is a prerequisite to evolving
on the path of spirituality.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.360 align:middle line:84%
The vine itself is
called the vine of souls

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.980 align:middle line:90%
or the vine of the dead.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And even though these difficult
encounters are well-known,

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.060 align:middle line:84%
there are still thousands of
people journeying to the Amazon

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.580 align:middle line:84%
with the desire to
peek behind the veil,

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.180 align:middle line:84%
to receive the
overflowing gifts of life

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.920 align:middle line:84%
and uncover these painful yet
fruitful mysteries of death.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.900 align:middle line:10%
Getting into the
heart of the Amazon

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.110 align:middle line:10%
requires much time, money,
and determination just

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.560 align:middle line:10%
to get through the
hustle and bustle,

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.540 align:middle line:10%
only to arrive on a long boat
ride to your final destination.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Once the boat departs
and you're finally

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.900 align:middle line:84%
miles from modern civilization,
the jungle begins to speak.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.200 align:middle line:84%
The volume of the jungle
seems deafening and ominous,

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.580 align:middle line:90%
overpowering at times.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.920 align:middle line:84%
The anticipation of
the coming ceremony

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.780 align:middle line:90%
puts the nerves on alert.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.630 align:middle line:10%
And so begins the real work.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.380 align:middle line:10%
The curandero, or healer,
will seek the purest leaves,

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.180 align:middle line:10%
the wisest vines, pound them,
pray over them, and add them

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.390 align:middle line:10%
to the pot, light
the fire, and begin

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.100 align:middle line:10%
the alchemical distillation.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.160 align:middle line:84%
The ceremonial
maloka is prepared

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:33.060 align:middle line:84%
for the evening, beds, blankets,
buckets, and the altar.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.440 align:middle line:84%
When the night hits,
the jungle shifts

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.505 align:middle line:84%
its song and the
ceremony begins.

00:07:37.505 --> 00:07:41.110 align:middle line:90%


00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:44.470 align:middle line:84%
The maestro blows the protective
smoke of mapacho tobacco

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:49.030 align:middle line:84%
over those about to drink,
and then he pours the brew.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:54.580 align:middle line:10%
Each individual accepts
their share, sits and drinks.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.520 align:middle line:84%
The first thing one might
notice is the taste.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.160 align:middle line:84%
A confusing mix of bitter,
sour, sweet, and the unknown

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.810 align:middle line:84%
fills the taste
buds and lingers.

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Once the medicine
becomes noticeable,

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:10.480 align:middle line:84%
it can be felt in the
stomach and in the tissues,

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.690 align:middle line:84%
in the bones, and deep
down in the psyche.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:15.880 align:middle line:84%
As the minutes
pass, the medicine

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.460 align:middle line:84%
spreads out and tracks a
path through every layer

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:24.460 align:middle line:84%
of the body, mind, and beyond,
until at last, hours later,

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.710 align:middle line:90%
the peak is upon us.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:31.390 align:middle line:84%
The peak usually lasts
roughly for an hour or two,

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:34.299 align:middle line:84%
but it is also known
to come in waves.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:36.159 align:middle line:84%
The pulse of
Ayahuasca is slightly

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.679 align:middle line:84%
different for every
person and even changes

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:41.799 align:middle line:90%
from ceremony to ceremony.

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Visions begin swirling and
pulsing in front, behind,

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:48.460 align:middle line:90%
and everywhere around us.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Time and space may
dissolve, and the visions

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:53.870 align:middle line:90%
become the only reality.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And it is at this point the
creatures of the jungle appear.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I have seen and experienced
a lot of identification with

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.550 align:middle line:84%
animals, but there seems to
be preponderance of certain

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:08.190 align:middle line:84%
animals like Jaguar
and Anacondas.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.160 align:middle line:10%
>> They may be entirely animal,
they may be entirely human.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.040 align:middle line:10%
But sometimes you get
these therianthropes.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.520 align:middle line:10%
Again and again they crop
up in visionary experience.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.580 align:middle line:84%
I've had such visions
myself under the influence

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.260 align:middle line:90%
of Ayahuasca.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.720 align:middle line:84%
So, it doesn't surprise
me that ancient people

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.920 align:middle line:90%
had those visions as well.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.610 align:middle line:84%
The shamans are drinking
Ayahuasca to enter a deeply

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.230 align:middle line:90%
altered state of consciousness.

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And a great many
of those shamans

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.770 align:middle line:90%
paint their visions today.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Are people under these states
experiencing the same visions

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.120 align:middle line:84%
that our ancestors saw in
each corner of the globe?

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.770 align:middle line:84%
How would it be
possible that humans

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.960 align:middle line:84%
are connecting to
ancestral visions

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.000 align:middle line:90%
through a plant combination?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Various aspects of the
visual cortex are stimulated

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.620 align:middle line:10%
by the presence of psychedelics.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.220 align:middle line:10%
So, the fact that we have
visions we can easily explain.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.830 align:middle line:10%
The content of the
visions, what it is we see,

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:05.850 align:middle line:10%
presents some much more
significant challenges.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:08.670 align:middle line:84%
How is it that the brain
gets access to information

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:12.270 align:middle line:84%
that people often claim has
nothing at all to do with what

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.250 align:middle line:90%
they've experienced before?

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, perhaps some of
this can be understood

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.290 align:middle line:84%
as the stimulation of what's
been called archetypes,

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.510 align:middle line:90%
archetypal structures.

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Archetypes are common types
of people or forms that seem

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:28.710 align:middle line:84%
to emerge from mythology
and visionary imagery,

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:32.880 align:middle line:84%
from cultures separated by time
and space with no known contact

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.590 align:middle line:90%
or communication.

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:37.380 align:middle line:10%
Swiss psychiatrist
Carl Gustav Jung

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.360 align:middle line:10%
wrote extensively
about these visions

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.850 align:middle line:10%
from patients in
psych wards who spoke

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:45.150 align:middle line:10%
of seeing imagery that is
nearly identical to mythological

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.700 align:middle line:10%
figures that at the
time were not even

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.790 align:middle line:10%
translated into English yet.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.600 align:middle line:84%
If these archetypal
forms are not

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.000 align:middle line:84%
withered by the passing
of time, is there

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.480 align:middle line:84%
a reason for their
arrival in our visions?

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.170 align:middle line:10%
Some believe these are messages
for our personal advancement

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.090 align:middle line:10%
by showing us who
and what we truly

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:07.390 align:middle line:10%
are, not the individual
body or identity we inhabit,

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.450 align:middle line:10%
but all the events
that have unfolded

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.780 align:middle line:10%
since the origin
of life and beyond.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I think what happens with
plant medicine is that plant

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.830 align:middle line:84%
medicine helps you get yourself
out of your own body and look

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:20.670 align:middle line:90%
at yourself.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.170 align:middle line:84%
There's your birth,
but then there's

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:24.210 align:middle line:84%
your mom's birth, you
grandmother's birth,

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:27.620 align:middle line:84%
the birth of a nation,
the birth of humanity,

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.460 align:middle line:90%
the birth of the universe.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.850 align:middle line:84%
It's like this longer life,
kind of very much like quilting,

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:35.990 align:middle line:84%
where in the quilt you
might be just one stitch,

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:39.570 align:middle line:84%
but you're one stitch of
this big, beautiful quilt,

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:42.250 align:middle line:84%
this big, beautiful
pattern that, for us, would

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:46.740 align:middle line:84%
be a story or the history,
if you want to call it that.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Whatever the source, these
visions are almost always

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:52.920 align:middle line:84%
outside the realm of anything
we've ever experienced in this

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.150 align:middle line:90%
waking life.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:57.870 align:middle line:84%
They tell stories,
reveal hidden truths,

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:02.760 align:middle line:84%
conjure emotions, and even lead
the mind into realms unknown.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Many who try to explain these
visions by conventional means

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:08.880 align:middle line:84%
come up short of
legitimate answers.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:13.180 align:middle line:90%
Some say the visions are alive.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.070 align:middle line:84%
In combination
with these visions

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:17.610 align:middle line:84%
comes the strange
bodily sensations

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:20.140 align:middle line:84%
and the physiological effects
of the beta carbolines

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.370 align:middle line:90%
in the vine.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:22.960 align:middle line:84%
The common result
of this is what

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.540 align:middle line:90%
some call la purga, the purge.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.960 align:middle line:84%
The need to throw up is
why there are typically

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.860 align:middle line:84%
buckets set out next to the
beds in the ceremonial maloka.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And the belief of
many indigenous

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.470 align:middle line:84%
is that purging is the physical
outlet for an energetic release

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:40.060 align:middle line:90%
and surrender.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.662 align:middle line:84%
>> With the purging, some
people might say, well,

00:12:42.662 --> 00:12:44.620 align:middle line:84%
why are you going to put
yourself through that?

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:48.790 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually part of the
process of not only detoxing,

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:50.080 align:middle line:90%
but also healing.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.850 align:middle line:84%
I think it depends on where
you're at with the medicine.

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.300 align:middle line:84%
I think in the beginning,
a lot of the purging

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.057 align:middle line:84%
has to do with physical
stuff that's in your body,

00:12:58.057 --> 00:12:59.640 align:middle line:84%
because when you
come out of ceremony,

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:04.750 align:middle line:84%
you really recognize how
your diet affects you, be it

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.760 align:middle line:84%
the water or lack
of water you drink,

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:11.380 align:middle line:84%
or the type of food, how
healthy or unhealthy it is.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.774 align:middle line:84%
Once the physical
part kind of passes--

00:13:14.774 --> 00:13:16.940 align:middle line:84%
or I don't want to call it
the next level, but maybe

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.880 align:middle line:90%
a deeper level--

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.980 align:middle line:84%
it becomes more of
an emotional purge,

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.680 align:middle line:84%
where sometimes you
will realize that if you

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.810 align:middle line:84%
go into the storyline,
and if the storyline

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:28.000 align:middle line:84%
is a negative
storyline, that's when

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.730 align:middle line:84%
the purging, like the
feeling of purging, starts.

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Then after a while, you start
realizing that your habits kind

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.339 align:middle line:90%
of recreate it again.

00:13:35.339 --> 00:13:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And then the next ceremony
comes and you're still

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:38.180 align:middle line:90%
getting it out.

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you're just kind
of repeating that cycle.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:45.070 align:middle line:84%
So, you get to a point that
all of a sudden the purge

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.670 align:middle line:84%
is the acknowledgment of
there's something there

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.510 align:middle line:90%
that you need to work with.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Working with discomfort,
the trauma and unknown aspects

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:56.110 align:middle line:84%
of the psyche is not a
modern Western approach,

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:59.380 align:middle line:84%
where most medicines
dull pain, mask symptoms,

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.350 align:middle line:84%
and require no work
after being taken.

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:05.650 align:middle line:84%
Ayahuasca, on the other hand,
is impossible to take and forget

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:09.790 align:middle line:84%
about, and requires the
courage, strength, patience,

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:12.970 align:middle line:84%
and understanding to face
the darkest aspects of us

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:14.650 align:middle line:90%
that we've forgotten.

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:15.650 align:middle line:90%
>> We want to develop.

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:17.350 align:middle line:90%
We want to know ourselves.

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:22.630 align:middle line:10%
And it helps to surrender
to yourself, in fact,

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:27.010 align:middle line:10%
because what Ayahuasca is,
it is a jungle medicine that

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:29.500 align:middle line:10%
opens up your own subconscious.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:35.170 align:middle line:84%
So, if you see beauty,
then you deserve

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:37.510 align:middle line:84%
to feel that before
you can, maybe,

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:42.100 align:middle line:84%
be confronted with your behavior
that is not always beautiful.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.920 align:middle line:84%
When you see darkness,
it may indicate

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.950 align:middle line:84%
that there is some
shadow energy in you that

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:50.470 align:middle line:90%
needs to be digested.

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>> The strange ability for
Ayahuasca to introduce you

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:56.920 align:middle line:84%
to your own shadow in a
detached and unique way is why

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.160 align:middle line:84%
the indigenous have used it as
a form of mind body medicine

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.510 align:middle line:90%
for millennia.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most profound
revelations under the medicine

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.910 align:middle line:84%
often come once the
purging is over,

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:08.680 align:middle line:84%
once the difficulty
and discomfort

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.470 align:middle line:84%
subsides and the medicine
begins the softer

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.570 align:middle line:84%
part of the journey,
in which the shattered

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.150 align:middle line:84%
pieces of the story
we've told ourselves

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:19.000 align:middle line:84%
begins to reassemble into
a more humbling, more

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.850 align:middle line:90%
real, and holistic narrative.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:25.520 align:middle line:84%
The ceremony
concludes, the morning

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:30.180 align:middle line:84%
comes, a recommended period
of silence to reflect.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And then the group
comes together

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.012 align:middle line:90%
and the sharing begins.

00:15:34.012 --> 00:15:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>> The sharing after your
ceremony is integrating

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.260 align:middle line:90%
the whole experience.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:43.070 align:middle line:84%
After Ayahuasca
ceremony, you don't just

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:44.210 align:middle line:90%
continue in daily life.

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:45.680 align:middle line:90%
You're changed.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.140 align:middle line:84%
There is this neuroplasticity
in the mind that

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.660 align:middle line:84%
makes you change after
every experience,

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.880 align:middle line:90%
and this is a major experience.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Part of the Ayahuasca
in the West, you know,

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.500 align:middle line:10%
as well as when you do
these ceremonies together,

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.230 align:middle line:10%
you hear other people's pain.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:03.060 align:middle line:10%
You hear their purging and
you hear their connection,

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.650 align:middle line:10%
and you feel interconnected.

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:07.140 align:middle line:10%
And you come out and
you're very bonded.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.010 align:middle line:84%
There's been some--
one test I know

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.430 align:middle line:84%
that Dennis McKenna and
Charles Grubb and others

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:15.180 align:middle line:84%
did a few decades ago now
with Hoasca Project looking

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.550 align:middle line:84%
at one of the Ayahuasca
churches in South America.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't just that the
Ayahuasca was increasing

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:23.190 align:middle line:84%
the serotonin in the
brain, which it was,

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:26.280 align:middle line:84%
on a neurochemical level,
and they felt more integrated

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.410 align:middle line:84%
and more connected because
their community were all

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:29.800 align:middle line:90%
doing Ayahuasca together.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.260 align:middle line:84%
What Ayahuasca can
really do, they

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.290 align:middle line:84%
say it can be like
10 years of therapy

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:38.160 align:middle line:84%
in one night, because when
you're in therapy in the west,

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.530 align:middle line:84%
you're talking and you're
engaging the intellect.

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:43.260 align:middle line:84%
But Ayahuasca makes
permeable your unconscious.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.820 align:middle line:90%
It opens the heart more.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.140 align:middle line:90%
And it becomes very visible.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Anything you've been holding in
your energetic field, anything

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.997 align:middle line:84%
emotionally or you've
suppressed can come up.

00:16:51.997 --> 00:16:54.330 align:middle line:84%

of this plant mixture
in a modern context.

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:17.369 align:middle line:84%
And we found in our
Ayahuasca study in Brazil

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:21.280 align:middle line:84%
that long-term
users of Ayahuasca

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:26.790 align:middle line:84%
had an upregulation of
the serotonin transporter.

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:28.650 align:middle line:84%
When we got into
it, it turns out

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.620 align:middle line:84%
that deficits in
those transporters

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:35.730 align:middle line:84%
are linked to all kinds of
pathologies, alcoholism,

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:40.710 align:middle line:84%
suicidal ideation, intractable

in fact, that Ayahuasca

So, that can't be coincidence.

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.500 align:middle line:10%
You know, it looks like
Ayahuasca can actually

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.730 align:middle line:10%
reverse these deficits
over time and really

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:59.040 align:middle line:10%
not just control the
symptoms, but actually

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:03.060 align:middle line:10%
repair the brain at
some fundamental level.

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:46.950 align:middle line:10%
And I had a series of
Ayahuasca experiences

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:50.520 align:middle line:10%
that really took me into it,
really made me face the trauma.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:55.170 align:middle line:10%
And one of the primary
symptoms of the trauma

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:57.360 align:middle line:10%
was fear, you know,
that I had this kind

rid of those fears,

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.170 align:middle line:84%

to correct that.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.620 align:middle line:10%

>> The indigenous of the Amazon,
as well as many other shamanic

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:03.030 align:middle line:84%
traditions from
around the world,

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:07.129 align:middle line:84%
believe the only medicine
is truth and authenticity.

00:26:07.129 --> 00:26:08.670 align:middle line:84%
Whether that comes
through a shaman's

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:11.460 align:middle line:84%
particular vocal
vibration, a movement

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:14.250 align:middle line:84%
of energy through
dance, a cleansing

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:16.380 align:middle line:84%
of the body through
diet, or even

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:20.160 align:middle line:84%
the mind-opening properties
of psychedelic plants, truth

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.680 align:middle line:84%
and authenticity
is a state of being

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:27.270 align:middle line:84%
that a human can surrender to
or continue to defend against.

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:29.160 align:middle line:84%
But if one is open
to acknowledging

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:33.360 align:middle line:84%
their blind spots, a new
state of being unfolds.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.420 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a flowing with
the energy of life.

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:39.360 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's why people
have so much synchronicity

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.670 align:middle line:10%
after they have
experienced Ayahuasca

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:44.640 align:middle line:10%
or have experienced
these kinds of medicines.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.950 align:middle line:84%
You start to run into
events in your life.

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like you just
surrender to the flow,

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:54.300 align:middle line:84%
and it takes you exactly
where you need to go.

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.150 align:middle line:10%
>> And this is why Ayahuasca
has not simply remained

00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:00.510 align:middle line:10%
in the jungle, but has
spread across the world,

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:04.290 align:middle line:10%
and also why the culture stays
traditional in some regions yet

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.750 align:middle line:10%
evolves and updates in others.

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:09.570 align:middle line:84%
The UDV and Santo
Daime churches have

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:11.970 align:middle line:84%
been established for
semi-traditional and even

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:14.490 align:middle line:90%
syncretic uses of Ayahuasca.

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:16.230 align:middle line:84%
Even the Native
American church that

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:20.700 align:middle line:84%
originally protected peyote
use has now included Ayahuasca.

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Some say that Ayahuasca is
growing beyond the jungle,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.520 align:middle line:84%
first through
awareness and now being

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.980 align:middle line:84%
grown in many
different locations,

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.410 align:middle line:84%
causing not only the
medicine to spread,

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:33.990 align:middle line:84%
but the cultural mindset
of being one singular

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:37.890 align:middle line:84%
species on a turbulent and
rapidly changing planet.

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Very often I'm surprised how
common it is for people to come

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.490 align:middle line:84%
to South America, for
example, take Ayahuasca,

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:52.830 align:middle line:84%
and they come back with this
really broadened perspective

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:56.130 align:middle line:90%
about how we fit into nature.

00:27:56.130 --> 00:28:01.620 align:middle line:84%
As global culture rediscovers
these ancient medicines,

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:05.070 align:middle line:84%
we're also rediscovering
the traditions

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:07.260 align:middle line:84%
behind them, which is a
good thing because they

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.240 align:middle line:90%
do have traditions.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that, as
a society, we lacked, I think,

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.250 align:middle line:84%
when in the 60s we didn't
really understand that.

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:18.210 align:middle line:90%
Now we do.

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:25.500 align:middle line:10%
So, we're adapting shamanism
to our own purposes

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:33.000 align:middle line:10%
and developing variations
of shamanism that may not

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.120 align:middle line:10%
be traditional, but they're
more appropriate for who

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.850 align:middle line:10%
we are at this time.

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Perhaps looking at
the world in new ways,

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:45.150 align:middle line:84%
relating to all nature as if
it's an extension of ourselves

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:48.230 align:middle line:84%
is the real medicine
for the people,

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:51.350 align:middle line:84%
not just through the visionary
features of Ayahuasca,

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:54.020 align:middle line:84%
but also through the master
plants of the jungle that

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:57.260 align:middle line:84%
the shamans diet to
teach them the mysteries.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the jungle
really does speak or sing

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:04.790 align:middle line:84%
the messages of Gaia that
must be heard sooner or later.

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:07.280 align:middle line:10%
And all those singing
and living that message

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:10.760 align:middle line:10%
are embodying the medicine,
the truth and authenticity

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:15.200 align:middle line:10%
that the world needs most,
stepping aside from dogmas

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.020 align:middle line:10%
and experiencing real
moments of connection,

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:21.940 align:middle line:10%
real compassion for
others, lucid reflection

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.700 align:middle line:10%
upon global issues,
and inspiration

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:28.060 align:middle line:10%
for future endeavors
through visions of animal

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:31.030 align:middle line:10%
guides, spirits, and entities.

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:35.920 align:middle line:84%
This path is not for the
tourist, not for the curious.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.890 align:middle line:84%
This path is for those who
have accepted and committed

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:44.470 align:middle line:84%
themselves to the health of all
beings and the whole planet.

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:48.310 align:middle line:84%
Up next, we explore the unique
and lightning fast phenomena

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:51.970 align:middle line:84%
of the DMT experience and
the strange inhabited feeling

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:53.730 align:middle line:90%
of the space.
