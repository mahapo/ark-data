00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most overlooked
aspects of human ancestry,

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.170 align:middle line:84%
whether from shamanic traditions
or simply observing common

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.620 align:middle line:84%
behavior throughout history,
is the pursuit of altered

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.140 align:middle line:84%
or expanded states of
consciousness through many

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.790 align:middle line:90%
various methods.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.740 align:middle line:90%
Many mammals do the same.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And every ancient
and modern culture

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.540 align:middle line:84%
has some form of practice
that deliberately

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.760 align:middle line:84%
alters the baseline
state of consciousness

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.300 align:middle line:90%
that humans operate from.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.670 align:middle line:84%
The fix-it-fast drivers
of modern society

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.800 align:middle line:84%
have caused for many
psychonauts to turn

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.340 align:middle line:84%
to devices and electronics
to induce or amplify

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.820 align:middle line:84%
their favorite expanded and
psychedelic states, placing

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.850 align:middle line:84%
a larger wedge between
biology and technology

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.420 align:middle line:90%
for future generations.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.250 align:middle line:84%
Ingesting psychedelic
plants might

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.260 align:middle line:84%
be the quickest and
most reliable way

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.480 align:middle line:84%
to induce such a
mind-bending journey.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.380 align:middle line:84%
However, the full
picture of human history

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.240 align:middle line:84%
shows us that there
are many other ways

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.760 align:middle line:84%
to experience flow
states of consciousness

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.370 align:middle line:90%
and psychedelic-like journeys.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And the debate
about whether or not

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.840 align:middle line:84%
the plants or technology
are necessary when

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.600 align:middle line:84%
we can create these
experiences from within

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.240 align:middle line:84%
has sparked interest in what
each of these categories

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.940 align:middle line:84%
might mean for human evolution
over the course of time.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps this is what
the oldest practices

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.890 align:middle line:84%
of yoga and many
other traditions

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.570 align:middle line:90%
were meant to evoke--

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.620 align:middle line:84%
the natural highs that
exist just under the skin.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.540 align:middle line:10%
>> It's not just the
plants or the sacrament.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.340 align:middle line:10%
It's you.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.189 align:middle line:10%
You are the medicine, and it's
helping reveal that within you.

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.480 align:middle line:10%
But essentially, you know,
there's multiple modalities.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.700 align:middle line:10%
The plants are just one way.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.501 align:middle line:10%
There's trance.

00:01:57.501 --> 00:01:58.300 align:middle line:10%
There's dance.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.130 align:middle line:10%
There's breathwork.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.315 align:middle line:10%
There's yoga.

00:02:00.315 --> 00:02:01.500 align:middle line:10%
There's tantra.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.480 align:middle line:10%
You know, there's so
many different modalities

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.820 align:middle line:10%
because all of those things
are essentially getting us

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.290 align:middle line:10%
in touch with ourselves.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.420 align:middle line:10%
And our true potential is to
be divine beings incarnated,

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.170 align:middle line:10%
is to be connected
to the web of life,

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.560 align:middle line:10%
and to be receiving
more of the signal.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of these methods
are generated by flowy,

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.390 align:middle line:84%
repetitious, or
chaotic body movements,

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.110 align:middle line:84%
whether performed within
major muscle groups,

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.300 align:middle line:84%
breathed within
the chest cavity,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.020 align:middle line:84%
or vocalized with the tiny
muscles in the throat.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Even the endorphins and
other neurochemicals

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.330 align:middle line:84%
that are produced internally
through strenuous activity

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.030 align:middle line:84%
like sports have been
known to push athletes

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.360 align:middle line:84%
into very beneficial
modes of consciousness.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, a natural high is some
of the best highs you can ever

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.690 align:middle line:10%
have.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.890 align:middle line:10%
And I find at
least, that through

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.370 align:middle line:10%
intense physical
activity and athletics,

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.320 align:middle line:10%
I tend to find those
natural highs more

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.810 align:middle line:10%
readily than in my daily life--

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.060 align:middle line:10%
one of the main reasons why
I still participate so often

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.460 align:middle line:10%
in my sports.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.670 align:middle line:10%
>> For me, as a former
collegiate tennis player,

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.910 align:middle line:10%
I would experience flow state
when everything was going right

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:09.920 align:middle line:10%
on the court.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.510 align:middle line:84%
A perfect example of
that would be, you know,

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.580 align:middle line:84%
you look at a different
sport like basketball

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.340 align:middle line:84%
and how you'd see Michael
Jordan during the playoff games

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.340 align:middle line:84%
where everything was
just smooth and happened.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.220 align:middle line:84%
The way that many
athletes describe it

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.240 align:middle line:84%
is a complete,
effortless experience.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.990 align:middle line:90%
You're in the zone.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the highest level
athletes reportedly find

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.280 align:middle line:84%
themselves in the zone during
highly intense moments when

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.170 align:middle line:84%
training takes over, and the
problem-solving mind gets out

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.970 align:middle line:90%
of the way.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:46.500 align:middle line:90%


00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.840 align:middle line:84%
In every ancient
or modern culture,

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.260 align:middle line:84%
you will not find any
tradition devoid of dance.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.360 align:middle line:84%
All shamanic and
religious origins

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.530 align:middle line:84%
utilize dance for meaningful
and ceremonial purposes,

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.140 align:middle line:84%
ushering the one dancing to
another plane of consciousness.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Dances, in our culture
we say [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.590 align:middle line:10%
We say moving energy.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.820 align:middle line:10%
This is different.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.450 align:middle line:10%
Songs, they're communication.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.220 align:middle line:10%
But when you're
dancing, now you're

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.810 align:middle line:10%
moving your collective-- well,
if you're individual dance,

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.610 align:middle line:10%
you're moving
energy for yourself.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.570 align:middle line:90%


00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.340 align:middle line:90%
I dance in my backyard.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.130 align:middle line:84%
I can transform my
backyard from what

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.740 align:middle line:84%
it was into what it is now,
just by certain dances.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Because you're
creating movements,

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:44.105 align:middle line:84%
there is like geometric designs
that go into the universe

00:04:44.105 --> 00:04:47.630 align:middle line:84%
that you just communicated,
I want to create this.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.570 align:middle line:90%
And the universe says, OK.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:50.720 align:middle line:90%
And then you create it.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Collective dance brings about
change, brings about creating.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And these ancient
civilizations understood

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.830 align:middle line:84%
this, where they would create
huge plazas where people would

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.390 align:middle line:84%
come visiting, partake
of these sacred plants,

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.330 align:middle line:90%
and do these sacred dances.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.580 align:middle line:10%
>> The whirling dervishes in
the Sufic traditions created

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.200 align:middle line:10%
by the 13th century poet Rumi
would twirl or spin in circles

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.360 align:middle line:10%
for extended periods of time.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Even children are known to spin
in circles until they cannot

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.980 align:middle line:90%
stand anymore.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.170 align:middle line:84%
"Ring Around the Rosie"
and merry-go-rounds

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.200 align:middle line:84%
are other examples of children's
love for the sensation

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.150 align:middle line:90%
that twirling brings about.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.520 align:middle line:10%
In the film "Dance
and Human History,"

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.350 align:middle line:10%
we are shown that
each of the earliest

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.570 align:middle line:10%
and untouched traditions
around the world

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.490 align:middle line:10%
include dance styles
that correlate

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.400 align:middle line:10%
with the types of tools
they used for daily labor,

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.760 align:middle line:10%
such as linear, one-dimensional
dance where wooden tools were

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.880 align:middle line:10%
used, twisting or
two-dimensional when metallurgy

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.610 align:middle line:10%
was prominent, and even
three-dimensional dances

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.580 align:middle line:10%
in areas near waterways.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And the common theory of
the purpose for these dances

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.580 align:middle line:84%
are to revere daily chores
and natural elements as sacred

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.330 align:middle line:84%
and to achieve
psychedelic-like states.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.320 align:middle line:10%
>> The Kalahari Bushmen
in Southern Africa achieve

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.540 align:middle line:10%
an equally powerful altered
state of consciousness

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.930 align:middle line:10%
by dancing for 24 hours around
the fire and becoming deeply

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.890 align:middle line:10%
dehydrated and falling into
a rhythmic trance-like state.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.010 align:middle line:10%
And in that trance-like
state, they then have visions,

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.870 align:middle line:10%
and that, it turns
out, is what is

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.540 align:middle line:10%
being painted on the cave
walls and in the rock shelters.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.517 align:middle line:10%
It's the visions
of ancient shamans.

00:06:26.517 --> 00:06:28.850 align:middle line:10%
So they enter the deeply
altered state of consciousness,

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.141 align:middle line:10%
either through a rhythmic
dance or some other technique

00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:35.330 align:middle line:10%
or through consuming a plant
psychedelic, most often

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.290 align:middle line:10%
the latter.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.960 align:middle line:10%
They enter a deeply altered
state of consciousness.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.880 align:middle line:10%
They experience visions.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.820 align:middle line:10%
They experience encounters
with supernatural beings

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.140 align:middle line:10%
as they construe them.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.780 align:middle line:10%
Those supernatural beings
may communicate with them

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:48.590 align:middle line:10%
telepathically.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.230 align:middle line:84%
This is very common in
the shamanistic trance.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.230 align:middle line:90%
They may give them teachings.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.270 align:middle line:10%
And very often, they'll have
a therianthropic appearance.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.080 align:middle line:10%
They will be part
animal and part human.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>> How was it that these rituals
helped early cultures commune

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.230 align:middle line:84%
with ancestors or beings
from another realm?

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Some believe that
humanity currently

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.160 align:middle line:84%
operates from a
limited bandwidth,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.560 align:middle line:84%
only seeing what we
are prepared to see.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.520 align:middle line:84%
These dances, rhythmic drumming,
and psychedelic plants all

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.070 align:middle line:84%
have one major
component in common--

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.930 align:middle line:84%
they deactivate
the communication

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.300 align:middle line:84%
between regions of
the brain that hold us

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.440 align:middle line:90%
in our behavioral patterns.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.670 align:middle line:10%
Once these regions go
offline, the human experience

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.070 align:middle line:10%
opens up to new patterns,
and we no longer

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.110 align:middle line:10%
need to be prepared to
see in order to truly see.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.360 align:middle line:84%
But communing with
other worldly beings

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.510 align:middle line:84%
is just one effect of
these expanded states.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.150 align:middle line:84%
The health of communities
improves with ritual,

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:49.230 align:middle line:84%
as seen in the study of
psychoneuroimmunology.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:52.130 align:middle line:10%
>> The concept of
psychoneuroimmunology emerged

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:56.720 align:middle line:10%
in the 1970s, when researchers
started to recognize that how

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.260 align:middle line:10%
people thought not only
affected how they felt,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.190 align:middle line:10%
but it also affected the
neurotransmitter systems.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And depending on what
the emotional state was,

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:09.920 align:middle line:84%
those neurotransmitter
systems could either

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.690 align:middle line:84%
be elicited to enhance
our immune functioning

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:15.500 align:middle line:90%
or to compromise it.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.530 align:middle line:90%
The simplest example is stress.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:22.250 align:middle line:84%
If you view the world as
being a threatening place,

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:26.210 align:middle line:84%
you fear the world, this
releases stress hormones,

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and the stress
hormones compromise

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.710 align:middle line:84%
the optimal functioning
of the immune system.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.890 align:middle line:84%
So by using, for
instance, ritual

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.780 align:middle line:84%
to change people's
attitude, to get

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.419 align:middle line:84%
them to focus on the
positive things in life,

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:40.880 align:middle line:84%
this is not just
emotional in the brain,

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.380 align:middle line:90%
it's emotional biologically.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Your neurotransmitter
soup changes.

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And if you get connected
with other people,

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.850 align:middle line:84%
this starts to elicit
the release of lots

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:52.700 align:middle line:84%
of different positive
hormones in the body that

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.370 align:middle line:84%
can enhance the functioning
of the immune system.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.920 align:middle line:84%
So we might say
it's just a ritual.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.620 align:middle line:84%
So it may just be a trick,
but the trick works.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>> The emerging understanding
that what what we act out

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.590 align:middle line:84%
through our body actually
changes hormonal,

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.860 align:middle line:84%
and even neural functioning,
has been backed up by even more

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.870 align:middle line:90%
evidence in the past century.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.420 align:middle line:10%
In the well-known story
of Norman Cousins,

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.580 align:middle line:10%
he used laughter
in order to recover

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.420 align:middle line:10%
from a crippling
connective tissue disease.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.840 align:middle line:10%
Another example came from
an NBC article titled,

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.330 align:middle line:10%
"Smiling can trick your
brain into happiness

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.210 align:middle line:10%
and boost your health,"
showing that the act of smiling

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:32.270 align:middle line:10%
triggers a chemical reaction
of dopamine and serotonin

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.970 align:middle line:10%
in the brain, lowering
stress, boosting

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:37.650 align:middle line:10%
mood and the immune system.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.970 align:middle line:84%
There are also articles showing
that Botox injections, which

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.670 align:middle line:84%
use a neurotoxin to
smooth out wrinkles,

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:47.420 align:middle line:84%
also keeps the face from being
able to express emotions.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.250 align:middle line:84%
This has been touted
as performing like

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:52.100 align:middle line:84%
an anti-depressant, as they're
finding that if the face

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.160 align:middle line:84%
can't act out a depressive
or anxious expression,

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.370 align:middle line:84%
then the brain cannot maintain
the hormonal and neurochemical

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:01.520 align:middle line:84%
recipe to trigger the inner
sensation attributed to those

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.260 align:middle line:90%
emotions.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.990 align:middle line:10%
Even animals seek natural highs.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:09.860 align:middle line:10%
Jane Goodall has been observing
apes at Gombe, Tanzania

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.280 align:middle line:10%
as they seem to seek altered
states of consciousness.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.740 align:middle line:84%
They become aroused as
they creep towards pounding

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.500 align:middle line:84%
waterfalls, throwing
stones at them,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.200 align:middle line:84%
and then settling down
and swaying rhythmically

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.920 align:middle line:84%
as they peer almost meditatively
into the natural wonder.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Since the dawn of cave
art, humanity's reverence

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.950 align:middle line:84%
for altered states is
found nearly everywhere.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And quite possibly, one of
the oldest methods of sending

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.620 align:middle line:84%
participants into states that
are identical to psychedelic

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:41.910 align:middle line:84%
journeys is an alteration of an
act that we cannot survive more

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:43.970 align:middle line:90%
than a few minutes without--

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:46.740 align:middle line:90%
the breath.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:50.100 align:middle line:10%
>> The method I like the most
that doesn't require an actual

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.490 align:middle line:10%
psychedelic substance to
induce a psychedelic state is

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:54.500 align:middle line:10%
breathwork.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.410 align:middle line:10%
There is a lot of different
practices of breathwork,

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:02.130 align:middle line:10%
and this is a
pretty reliable way

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.680 align:middle line:10%
of engaging the
body and the breath

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.320 align:middle line:10%
to induce an altered state.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't take
that long, whereas some

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.960 align:middle line:84%
of the other ways of
inducing an altered state

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.760 align:middle line:90%
without medicines--

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.620 align:middle line:84%
like extreme physical exertion,
or an illness, or injury,

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:20.940 align:middle line:90%
or something like that--

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:26.350 align:middle line:84%
isn't as adaptable
in modern society.

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:33.120 align:middle line:84%
But we can induce an altered
state with breathwork

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and have a full
experience within an hour,

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:38.190 align:middle line:90%
hour and and a half.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:42.480 align:middle line:84%
To me, that makes it very
accessible for somebody

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.435 align:middle line:84%
to have an altered
states practice--

00:11:44.435 --> 00:11:48.210 align:middle line:84%
a regular altered states
practice that both helps heal

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:52.260 align:middle line:84%
the body, keeps us
grounded, helps balance

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.560 align:middle line:84%
out other psychedelic
medicine use,

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.720 align:middle line:84%
and it can be done
pretty regularly

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:00.690 align:middle line:84%
to help clear that
psychic plaque that we

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:07.320 align:middle line:84%
carry from day-to-day stress
and being rushed in the world.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>> These modalities are seen
most easily in the yogic

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.690 align:middle line:84%
and Tibetan Buddhist
practices of the East.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Popularized in Western culture,
the core breath techniques

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:21.180 align:middle line:84%
still remain in the highly
modernized forms of yoga today.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:24.300 align:middle line:10%
However, even newer
developments of using breath

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.840 align:middle line:10%
to enhance health are seen
with Stig Severinsen's

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:31.590 align:middle line:10%
"breatheology," Wim Hof's
"Innerfire," Buteyko breathing,

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:33.720 align:middle line:10%
as well as many other
techniques for achieving

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.950 align:middle line:10%
different outcomes.

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.700 align:middle line:10%
The most popular of the
expanded states techniques

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.710 align:middle line:10%
was developed by
Czech psychiatrist

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:43.530 align:middle line:10%
and psychedelic
researcher Stanislav Grof

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.870 align:middle line:10%
called holotropic breath.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.600 align:middle line:10%
After taking a break
from psychedelic studies,

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.390 align:middle line:10%
he decided to write a few
books on the power of expanded

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.650 align:middle line:10%
states of consciousness.

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:58.610 align:middle line:10%
>> So I moved to Esalen,
and I was trading this house

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:04.170 align:middle line:10%
and the food for workshops.

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And I was basically
talking of what we found

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.526 align:middle line:90%
in the psychedelic sessions.

00:13:10.526 --> 00:13:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And people were not
very happy with me.

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.130 align:middle line:84%
They said, it's great
to hear about all

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:16.890 align:middle line:84%
these great experiences,
but can't we do something?

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Don't you have a little
stash on the side?

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know, I don't
have the license to do it.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think Esalen would
not be very happy with us.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.340 align:middle line:90%
But they kept asking.

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.550 align:middle line:84%
So I started thinking
about what we could do.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.950 align:middle line:84%
We realized how much
can be achieved just

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:37.200 align:middle line:84%
by such simple means
as breathing, music,

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.210 align:middle line:90%
and the bodywork.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.610 align:middle line:84%
We were looking for a
good name, and we finally

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.790 align:middle line:84%
came up with the name
holotropic because we

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:48.320 align:middle line:84%
were seeing how this
experiential spectrum of people

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.480 align:middle line:84%
is expanding from that
very constricted, limited

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.210 align:middle line:84%
that is available in our
everyday consciousness.

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:57.780 align:middle line:84%
So holos means whole, and
-trope or -troping means

00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.800 align:middle line:90%
moving towards.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Like in the name heliotrope,
is from helios, is the sun.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Heliotrope is the property of
the plant, the flower, always

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:12.350 align:middle line:90%
oriented, going for the sun.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:15.130 align:middle line:84%
So it means moving
toward wholeness.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:18.030 align:middle line:84%
So holotropic states
are not like that.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Your intellectual functioning
is dramatically changed,

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.490 align:middle line:90%
but not reduced.

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.140 align:middle line:90%
It's transformed.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.470 align:middle line:84%
You can see certain
things much clearer.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:29.870 align:middle line:90%
You get insights about things.

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Where you go inside,
and you find out

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:36.430 align:middle line:84%
that the whole universe is
represented inside of your sky.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.460 align:middle line:84%
The whole universe
from this perspective

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.980 align:middle line:90%
is coded somehow in the psyche.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:45.730 align:middle line:84%
It's available through
intrapsychic exploration.

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is of
course the essence

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.320 align:middle line:90%
of all the esoteric cultures.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.080 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.130 align:middle line:90%
As without, so within.

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:56.880 align:middle line:84%
So each individual
is a microcosm

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:01.770 align:middle line:84%
that also contains
the whole macrocosm.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>> In a society hypnotized by
scientific study with the use

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.790 align:middle line:84%
of external technologies,
exploration into the mysteries

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:11.790 align:middle line:84%
of the universe using
self-observation is seen

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:14.870 align:middle line:90%
as inaccurate and flimsy.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Answers to our most timely
questions, such as who am I?

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.090 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:21.600 align:middle line:90%
And, what am I to do?

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Are given only the most
conservative answers like,

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.370 align:middle line:90%
we don't know.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Or that gene hasn't
been found yet.

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:30.050 align:middle line:90%
Speculation is frowned upon.

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:32.150 align:middle line:84%
But psychedelic states
or natural highs

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:35.330 align:middle line:84%
seem to push the mind
into greater curiosity,

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.990 align:middle line:84%
expanded receptivity,
inner contemplation,

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:40.850 align:middle line:90%
and wild speculation.

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Those who seek altered
states of consciousness

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.150 align:middle line:84%
are not doing so to
get more of the same.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.030 align:middle line:90%
They seek transformation.

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:53.600 align:middle line:84%
People of all walks of life go
to the blazing hot and dry lake

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.870 align:middle line:84%
bed of Black Rock City
for Burning Man one week

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:58.310 align:middle line:90%
out of every year--

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:01.280 align:middle line:84%
not to strengthen their
routines and habits,

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.920 align:middle line:84%
but to dismantle them
and see beyond the veil

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.810 align:middle line:90%
of their own making.

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:08.930 align:middle line:10%
In a society touted as being
almost completely consumer

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:14.030 align:middle line:10%
driven, people are left to use
plants, vacations, retreats,

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:17.720 align:middle line:10%
natural, and unfortunately
not-so-natural substances

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.100 align:middle line:10%
to shield their eyes and ears
from the onslaught of products

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.250 align:middle line:10%
and sales gimmicks.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:27.000 align:middle line:10%
The Kogi people of
Columbia spend nine years

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.100 align:middle line:10%
of their formative
life in darkness

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:33.170 align:middle line:10%
in order to connect with what
they call cosmic consciousness.

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:35.120 align:middle line:10%
Egyptians had the pyramids.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.380 align:middle line:10%
Romans used the catacombs.

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And even the Essenes
in Israel are

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.740 align:middle line:84%
reported to use extended
periods of darkness.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.070 align:middle line:84%
All of this to remove the
shackles of limited thinking

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:49.460 align:middle line:84%
and liberate oneself from
the wheel of suffering.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.850 align:middle line:10%
John Chavez, author of
"Questions for the Lion Tamer,"

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:55.220 align:middle line:10%
has pushed the speculative
envelope regarding

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:59.420 align:middle line:10%
the role of indigenous DMT
and telepathy, lucid dreaming,

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.750 align:middle line:10%
and the overall questions
of how much of our biology

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:06.990 align:middle line:10%
we can actually control
through thoughts and actions.

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:09.690 align:middle line:10%
Extended fasting leading
to years of inedia,

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:13.140 align:middle line:10%
or living without food, breath
practice leading to world

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:16.319 align:middle line:10%
records of 22 minutes
without oxygen,

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:18.780 align:middle line:10%
breaking the four-minute
mile when doctors said it was

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:22.319 align:middle line:10%
impossible, surviving
incurable diseases,

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:25.950 align:middle line:10%
unbelievable feats of
strength and willpower,

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:28.950 align:middle line:10%
all because the human
spirit seems to seek beyond

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:34.840 align:middle line:10%
conventions and restrictions
and mostly with purpose--

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:41.510 align:middle line:10%
to know thyself, not just
in theory but embodied.

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.380 align:middle line:84%
The psychonauts
that long to witness

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.650 align:middle line:84%
as much as they can on
this beautiful planet

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:48.150 align:middle line:84%
in these amazingly
mysterious bodies

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:50.520 align:middle line:84%
do so because the
greatest mystery of all

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.580 align:middle line:84%
is right around the
corner, and this life

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.300 align:middle line:90%
might be their only chance.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.510 align:middle line:84%
What truly lies on the other
shore when this body dies

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:00.950 align:middle line:90%
is a mystery.

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:02.510 align:middle line:84%
But glimpses into
that world have

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:06.460 align:middle line:84%
been coming to light in the
form of near-death experiences.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And the experience is far
closer to a psychedelic journey

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:11.790 align:middle line:90%
than one may think.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:14.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Michael Sabom, the
cardiologist who studied his

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:19.100 align:middle line:10%
own patient-- he had a case
where they were operating

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:22.670 align:middle line:10%
for a tumor which was sitting
at the base of the skull.

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:25.410 align:middle line:90%
They had to freeze the patient.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:29.600 align:middle line:84%
So there was not only no
cardiogram showing anything,

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.180 align:middle line:90%
but the EEG was flat.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.070 align:middle line:90%
There was no brain activity.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:38.450 align:middle line:10%
And yet from her they got
the most accurate perception

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:41.060 align:middle line:10%
of this out of body perception.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.520 align:middle line:84%
She was able to describe
what they were doing.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:47.450 align:middle line:84%
She drew the pictures of the
surgical instruments and so on.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.110 align:middle line:90%


00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:53.320 align:middle line:10%
And you know, this
happens with not just

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.200 align:middle line:10%
in these kinds of situations,
but all kinds of transpersonal

00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:01.330 align:middle line:10%
experiences mediate sort
of extrasensory perception,

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:08.461 align:middle line:10%
becoming an animal, or
experiences from the past,

00:19:08.461 --> 00:19:12.730 align:middle line:10%
from historical events,
visiting the mythological realms

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:15.950 align:middle line:10%
and having visions
from mythologies

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:17.490 align:middle line:10%
that you never studied.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:20.970 align:middle line:84%
This is the Jungian idea of
the collective unconscious.

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:24.870 align:middle line:84%
It is all well-documented
in psychedelic research

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:29.360 align:middle line:84%
and confirmed by
holotropic breathwork.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.230 align:middle line:84%
So these kinds of
things, you know,

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:36.330 align:middle line:84%
they ask for a radical revision
of psychiatry and psychology.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:40.550 align:middle line:84%
The most basic metaphysical
assumptions are wrong.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>> One in five people who
are resuscitated from cardiac

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:47.240 align:middle line:84%
arrest are reported to have
a near-death experience.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.950 align:middle line:84%
Why would the process
of death bring

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.710 align:middle line:84%
on such similar experiences
to psychedelic states

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:53.540 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness?

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:57.590 align:middle line:10%
One study by Jimo Borjigin
at the University of Michigan

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:00.590 align:middle line:10%
has found that for about 30
seconds after rodent models'

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:03.650 align:middle line:10%
breathing and heart stopped,
their brains increased

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:08.150 align:middle line:10%
their neural activity, including
gamma waves in all of them.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Oddly enough, the activity in
different parts of the brain

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:13.290 align:middle line:84%
became twice as
synchronized as when awake.

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:15.890 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:19.790 align:middle line:84%
Cognitive Neuroscientists
John Kounios and Mark Beeman

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:21.440 align:middle line:84%
found in their
research that what

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.960 align:middle line:84%
we would term as
an aha moment has

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:27.710 align:middle line:84%
direct correlations with gamma
wave bursts in the brain.

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:30.850 align:middle line:84%
These bursts happen when
brain centers fire together

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:33.560 align:middle line:84%
that have never done
so before, giving rise

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:37.820 align:middle line:84%
to a newly integrated and
higher level of insight.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:41.090 align:middle line:84%
One hypothesis popularized
by Dr. Rick Strassmann

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:43.890 align:middle line:84%
got the world thinking about
why the psychedelic compound

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:48.700 align:middle line:84%
DMT is produced in the body
and congregates in the brain.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.910 align:middle line:10%
While the evidence of DMT being
released in dying brains is

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:54.990 align:middle line:10%
still in question, an
article published by Juan

00:20:54.990 --> 00:21:00.460 align:middle line:10%
Acosta-Urquidi reports that
both 5-MeO and N,N-DMT caused

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.250 align:middle line:10%
widespread cortical
hyper-coherence in the gamma

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:04.720 align:middle line:10%
wave region.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.970 align:middle line:84%
While this is not
definitive proof,

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Rick Strassmann gives
an insight as to why

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.890 align:middle line:90%
dying brains might release DMT.

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:14.530 align:middle line:10%
>> To protect the
body, number one,

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:21.490 align:middle line:10%
and to kind of begin the
movement of consciousness out

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:29.260 align:middle line:10%
of a more body-grounded state,
which occurs when you take DMT,

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:32.500 align:middle line:10%
is you lose awareness
of your body.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.500 align:middle line:84%
So I think it would
be protective.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.540 align:middle line:84%
There are some data
from Hungary which

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:41.530 align:middle line:84%
indicate that DMT
is what is called,

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:45.430 align:middle line:84%
you know, neuroprotective
in conditions of low levels

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.570 align:middle line:90%
of oxygen in the brain.

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:52.120 align:middle line:84%
Which means that if
you're not providing

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:57.370 align:middle line:84%
your brain with enough oxygen,
your nerve cells begin to die.

00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And DMT seems to
inhibit the bad effect

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:06.670 align:middle line:84%
of a low level of oxygen.
It protects the brain

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:09.310 align:middle line:90%
against low oxygen levels.

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
DMT theoretically

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:15.410 align:middle line:90%
is being released.

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:22.050 align:middle line:84%
So it would be important to
demonstrate that either DMT is

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:25.320 align:middle line:90%
increased by stress.

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Or if you could demonstrate
that DMT was increased

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:35.100 align:middle line:84%
at the time of death, then it
would be a pretty good picture

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.510 align:middle line:90%
that would be completed.

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:40.250 align:middle line:84%
You would have the low
oxygen, which is a stress.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And if that increased
DMT, then you'd

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.020 align:middle line:84%
have more DMT around
to help with respect

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:48.530 align:middle line:90%
to neuroprotection.

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>> While Chemist and Psychedelic
Researcher David Nichols does

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:54.380 align:middle line:84%
not believe DMT is the most
important chemical that is

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:58.160 align:middle line:84%
present at the time of death, he
does express the neurochemical

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.740 align:middle line:84%
dump that the brain
produces during high stress

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.750 align:middle line:90%
and near-death experiences.

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:05.390 align:middle line:10%
>> That was a topic that I
addressed at the Breaking

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:07.490 align:middle line:10%
Convention talk recently.

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:09.560 align:middle line:10%
And it was interesting
because one of the people

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.710 align:middle line:10%
there was named Jimo Borjigin.

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:15.200 align:middle line:84%
She is at University of
Michigan Medical School.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.670 align:middle line:84%
They looked at
brain transmitters.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:21.944 align:middle line:84%
And what they said was when you
cause cardiac arrest, you get--

00:23:21.944 --> 00:23:22.860 align:middle line:90%
and this is her word--

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:25.330 align:middle line:90%
a brain storm of chemicals.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:30.780 align:middle line:84%
She saw dramatic increases
in norepinephrine, dopamine,

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.420 align:middle line:90%
serotonin release.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And that may be actually
what's driving the increased

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:37.160 align:middle line:90%
activation, the EEG coherence.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:41.970 align:middle line:84%
But then what I said was,
well, in addition to that,

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:44.810 align:middle line:84%
we know that under
times of stress, people,

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:47.900 align:middle line:84%
their brains
generate endorphins,

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.720 align:middle line:84%
endogenous
morphine-like compounds.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.900 align:middle line:84%
So people that, say they're
long-distance runners,

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:58.010 align:middle line:84%
it's well known that they
run, and run, and run,

00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:00.470 align:middle line:84%
and they get to a
point where it becomes

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:01.920 align:middle line:90%
too painful to run any further.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And then they get a second
wind and they keep going.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.230 align:middle line:84%
That's actually
releasing endorphins.

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:09.160 align:middle line:84%
So now you've got increased
norepinephrine, increased

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.120 align:middle line:84%
serotonin, increased
dopamine, probably increased

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.360 align:middle line:84%
dynorphin release,
other enkephalins,

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.440 align:middle line:90%
increased glutamate.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.860 align:middle line:84%
You've got this whole literally
brainstorm of chemicals.

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Why do you need to talk
about traces of DMT?

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:25.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, it doesn't
make any sense.

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:27.530 align:middle line:84%
So that was an
argument I presented.

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:28.984 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to
invoke something

00:24:28.984 --> 00:24:30.650 align:middle line:84%
where it is just
speculation, when we've

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:32.630 align:middle line:84%
got all these things
that we know happen,

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:36.730 align:middle line:84%
that we know are released, that
we know are neurotransmitters.

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Perhaps psychonauts often
speculate about what is not yet

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:44.770 align:middle line:84%
proven because this is merely
the collective genius at work.

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:47.500 align:middle line:84%
Theories are proven
and disproven daily,

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.200 align:middle line:84%
and some are resurrected
for further review.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Most people prior to
the early modern period

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:54.550 align:middle line:84%
believed that the
stars and planets

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:56.350 align:middle line:90%
revolved around the Earth.

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Most people more than
a few centuries ago

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:01.780 align:middle line:84%
knew nothing of
what microbes were.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.030 align:middle line:84%
50 years ago, we
had no knowledge

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:06.370 align:middle line:84%
that the human body could
produce the most radical

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:07.960 align:middle line:90%
psychedelic compound.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And 50 years from
now, we'll likely

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:13.120 align:middle line:84%
know much more than we
could ever dream of today.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.250 align:middle line:84%
Speculation should
never supersede

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:16.810 align:middle line:90%
the scientific method.

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:20.440 align:middle line:10%
Yet Einstein reportedly arrived
at his most amazing discovery

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:25.720 align:middle line:10%
in the relaxing mind frame
of a shower, not the lab.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.940 align:middle line:10%
Steve Jobs says
psychedelics gave him

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:32.290 align:middle line:10%
one of the most important
moments of his life.

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:36.250 align:middle line:10%
And co-discoverer of the DNA
double helix, Francis Crick,

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:38.110 align:middle line:10%
was on a mild
psychedelic journey

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:40.840 align:middle line:10%
when he made his discovery.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And whether or not DMT is
the prime neurotransmitter

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:46.540 align:middle line:84%
during near-death
experiences, even what

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Nichols' reports shows
just how incredible it

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:53.140 align:middle line:84%
is to have a pharmacy just
beneath our skin that floods

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.420 align:middle line:84%
the body with mind
altering substances

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:58.480 align:middle line:84%
in the presence of
high stress situations.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.990 align:middle line:84%
In 1990, Dr. Kasamatsu
and Dr. Hirai

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:04.720 align:middle line:84%
conducted a study on a
group of Buddhist monks

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.210 align:middle line:84%
in which they took a
three-day voyage to a mountain

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:10.580 align:middle line:84%
in extreme cold
weather, no food, water,

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.480 align:middle line:90%
or communication of any kind.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.630 align:middle line:84%
After the second day, the
monks began seeing and feeling

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:20.980 align:middle line:84%
the presence of ancestors
and other beings.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.380 align:middle line:84%
It was found that increased
amounts of serotonin

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.210 align:middle line:90%
began flooding the brain.

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:29.050 align:middle line:10%
Serotonin is exactly
what psychedelics mimic.

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:32.080 align:middle line:10%
Even a modern rendition
of Tibetan tummo yoga

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.830 align:middle line:10%
has been crafted by Wim
Hof in the Netherlands.

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:38.590 align:middle line:10%
His breathing method has
created much of a buzz

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:40.720 align:middle line:10%
because it has been
scientifically shown

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.880 align:middle line:10%
that he can withstand
submerging himself up

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.740 align:middle line:10%
to his neck in ice
water for eight

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.590 align:middle line:10%
hours with perfect alertness
and core temperature that

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:51.730 align:middle line:10%
not only stabilized, but even
increased during the test.

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:54.400 align:middle line:84%
This breathing technique has
been shown to dramatically

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.340 align:middle line:84%
boost immunity in the face
of E. coli infections,

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:59.420 align:middle line:90%
for himself and his students.

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.490 align:middle line:84%
>> You feel the
adaptation right on.

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:02.290 align:middle line:90%
I can see it.

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:07.160 align:middle line:90%


00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.595 align:middle line:90%
[BREATHING]

00:27:09.595 --> 00:27:10.569 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:27:10.569 --> 00:27:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Now you can look at
it, contemplate on it.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>> As well as produce
experiences that have been

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:22.220 align:middle line:84%
explained as nearly identical
to psilocybin mushrooms, or DMT,

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.950 align:middle line:84%
could it be possible that
these substance-free methods

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:28.130 align:middle line:84%
of dumping neurochemical
cocktails into the system are

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:32.330 align:middle line:84%
not simply ways to get high,
but that normal consciousness is

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:36.140 align:middle line:84%
filtered heavily by our default
brain activity and that these

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:39.710 align:middle line:84%
practices and their ensuing
neurotransmitters unlock that

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:43.730 align:middle line:84%
filter, allowing for us to see
and feel more of the real world

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:45.890 align:middle line:90%
that exists all around us?

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:48.050 align:middle line:10%
Is this what yogis
and mystics alike

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:50.840 align:middle line:10%
have been seeking with spiritual
practices for thousands

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:56.450 align:middle line:10%
of years, the soma within or
divine ambrosia in the body?

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:58.960 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it's important
to ask ourselves,

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.950 align:middle line:84%
once the astonishment of states
of psychedelica are not so new,

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:05.210 align:middle line:90%
then what is the point?

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:08.180 align:middle line:84%
Is it to see visuals
and feel peculiar?

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Or are those merely the
sensations associated

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:13.100 align:middle line:84%
with stepping out of
the conventional box

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:17.000 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness in order to
access more of what we truly

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.350 align:middle line:84%
are, what we are truly meant
to witness in this life?

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps this is the real
purpose of psychedelic plants,

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:27.740 align:middle line:84%
not simply to use
substances to tune out,

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:30.980 align:middle line:84%
but to move past the temporary
tickle of the body and peek

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:34.520 align:middle line:90%
beyond the veil of illusion.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:38.090 align:middle line:84%
For when the top-down opinions
and the rhetoric of culture

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:42.380 align:middle line:84%
are carefully examined,
all that is left to do

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.900 align:middle line:90%
is to remain open to love.

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.210 align:middle line:84%
What happens when the
mind becomes still

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:51.230 align:middle line:84%
in the knowledge that you are
the real and only medicine

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:54.180 align:middle line:84%
that this beautiful
planet needs?

00:28:54.180 --> 00:29:00.010 align:middle line:84%
There is only one way to find
out, and that way is within.

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:12.534 align:middle line:90%
