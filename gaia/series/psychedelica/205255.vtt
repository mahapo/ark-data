>> The healing benefits of
psychedelic plant medicines are

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.950 align:middle line:10%
well-documented.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.270 align:middle line:84%
But what about the rest
of the plant kingdom?

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.625 align:middle line:84%
And can they heal not just our
bodies but our entire planet?

In 2019, the Imperial
College of London

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.480 align:middle line:10%
released a study that
found participants

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.200 align:middle line:10%
who use psychedelics
reported an enhanced feeling

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.094 align:middle line:10%
of connectedness,
especially with nature.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.770 align:middle line:10%
As temperatures rise
and ice caps melt,

massive wildfires and
extreme weather events

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.820 align:middle line:10%
have become the norm,
not the exception.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.900 align:middle line:90%


00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.750 align:middle line:84%
Getting people to
simply care about this

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.750 align:middle line:84%
remains one of the
biggest hurdles.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.470 align:middle line:84%
So, could the solution
involve plant medicines?

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>> All you have to do is turn on
the TV to see what's going on.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.430 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's happening, and
it's not happening slowly.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.280 align:middle line:10%
it's happening rather rapidly.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.870 align:middle line:84%
You'd think that
would be a wake-up .

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Call without
psychedelics there's

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.600 align:middle line:90%
plenty of reason to be alarmed.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.430 align:middle line:84%
But maybe the psychedelics
provide an additional boost

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.340 align:middle line:84%
to help focus people's
attention on it.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.130 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.330 align:middle line:84%

societies are in turmoil.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And our mental and
physical well-being

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.300 align:middle line:84%
is being threatened by
our own advancements

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.770 align:middle line:90%
in agriculture and technology.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.690 align:middle line:10%
>> I think we're in
the situation that

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.330 align:middle line:10%
we're in because we've lost
our sense of belonging on this

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.520 align:middle line:10%
planet.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.820 align:middle line:10%
We feel so disconnected
from ourselves,

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.710 align:middle line:10%
from our experiences, from
each other, from the Earth,

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.910 align:middle line:10%
and we've forgotten how to
connect to that sacredness

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.950 align:middle line:10%
within us.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.550 align:middle line:84%
So we no longer know how
to come in a good way

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.510 align:middle line:84%
and how to be in right relations
with all the living beings

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.310 align:middle line:90%
around us.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.420 align:middle line:90%

>> Could plants be the teachers
we need to guide us into living

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.130 align:middle line:90%
healthier, more spiritual lives?

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And if so, can humans
and plants come together

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.010 align:middle line:84%
to save the world just
in the nick of time?

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Mushrooms, fungi,
perhaps no other organism

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.580 align:middle line:84%
illustrates our
planet's potential

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.250 align:middle line:90%
for interconnectedness.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Most of us are familiar with
the fruiting body of mushrooms.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.490 align:middle line:10%
But, yet, underground,
there's this whole network.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>> These aren't just roots.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.900 align:middle line:10%
This complex web
absorbs nutrients

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.620 align:middle line:10%
and can even break down
pollutants, plastic,

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.165 align:middle line:10%
and even radioactive waste.

00:03:50.165 --> 00:03:52.690 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.720 align:middle line:84%
They can even discern
between plants or minerals

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.590 align:middle line:84%
they come into contact with
and make decisions to keep

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.280 align:middle line:90%
the ecosystem in balance.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>> We're learning that sometimes
the network could be miles

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.150 align:middle line:84%
across and that the plants are
actually communicating with

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.070 align:middle line:90%
each other.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.910 align:middle line:84%
>> It's believed that the
so-called mycelium blanket was

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.930 align:middle line:84%
perhaps the largest connected
organism on the planet,

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:26.080 align:middle line:84%
a vast interconnected
underground network of fungi.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.450 align:middle line:84%
But as mankind built roads
and tilled the soil for crops,

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.120 align:middle line:84%
underground connections
in this network

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.110 align:middle line:84%
were severed,
effectively isolating

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.440 align:middle line:84%
large and varied ecosystems
from one another.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.620 align:middle line:84%
What does this suggest
about the potential

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.020 align:middle line:90%
for plants' intelligence?

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.360 align:middle line:10%
>> The way that we define
the word "intelligence"

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.970 align:middle line:10%
is usually in the realm
of human experience.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.440 align:middle line:84%
But we can look at other
organisms on this planet

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.870 align:middle line:84%
as having a kind of
intelligence that

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.770 align:middle line:84%
is just different from
the way that we operate.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Plants have a kind
of intelligence

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.640 align:middle line:84%
that surpasses a
lot of the things

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.840 align:middle line:90%
that we can do as humans.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.300 align:middle line:90%


00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>> In December of 2020, "The
New York Times Magazine"

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.600 align:middle line:84%
published a story about how
trees can form mycorrhizas,

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.200 align:middle line:84%
underground partnerships with
fungi to communicate with each

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.120 align:middle line:90%
other.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.690 align:middle line:84%
These networks can span
entire forests and even

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.150 align:middle line:90%
link trees of separate species.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.670 align:middle line:10%
>> I think plants are not just
intelligent but brilliant.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.380 align:middle line:84%
I think they may be far more
intelligent than humans,

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.480 align:middle line:90%
in fact.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.910 align:middle line:84%
To understand that there
is a threat, to understand

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.810 align:middle line:84%
exactly what they need to
create to deal with that,

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.990 align:middle line:84%
to maybe attract another
predator to get rid

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.470 align:middle line:84%
of this predator or to
impair the fertility

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.690 align:middle line:84%
of this particular
predator that's

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.690 align:middle line:84%
right there at that
time, that tells me

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.930 align:middle line:84%
that plants really
understand how

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.020 align:middle line:84%
to interact with their
environment in very

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.310 align:middle line:84%
rapid and intelligent and
careful and brilliant ways.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.020 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm fond of saying that these
psychedelic plants are sort

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.740 align:middle line:10%
of Gaian ambassadors.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.070 align:middle line:84%
They are one of the mechanisms
that the biosphere is

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.380 align:middle line:84%
bringing forward to try to,
again, wake up our species.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.130 align:middle line:84%
They are catalysts, and
there's co-evolutionary aspects

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.270 align:middle line:90%
to this.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.930 align:middle line:84%
We have been co-evolving with
these plants for millennia,

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.070 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And now, all of a sudden,
something like ayahuasca

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:51.060 align:middle line:84%
has escaped from the Amazon and
it's spread across the world.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Or something like
cannabis, which

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:57.900 align:middle line:84%
before was kind of
suppressed and vilified,

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.940 align:middle line:90%
now it's everywhere.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.600 align:middle line:90%
So maybe the biosphere--

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.060 align:middle line:90%
Gaia, if you will--

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.110 align:middle line:84%
recognizes that
it's in great peril.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:15.330 align:middle line:10%
So this may be one of
the ways that it responds

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.200 align:middle line:10%
by sort of bringing these
plants forward, bringing them

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.750 align:middle line:10%
into our attention.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is not unlike
the way any ecosystem will

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.040 align:middle line:90%
respond to a threat.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Trees are conscious.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.860 align:middle line:90%
They understand things.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.313 align:middle line:10%
And they even respond
to different stimuli

00:07:34.313 --> 00:07:35.980 align:middle line:10%
depending on threat
and stuff like that.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.022 align:middle line:10%
And they warn each other.

00:07:37.022 --> 00:07:39.180 align:middle line:10%
So there's a consciousness
in this plant

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.480 align:middle line:10%
that, when you smoke
them, when you eat them,

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.290 align:middle line:10%
you get a download of
that consciousness.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.570 align:middle line:90%
And even this is just a glimpse.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:54.850 align:middle line:84%
You get a glimpse of the
ancient history of this Earth.

00:07:54.850 --> 00:08:02.110 align:middle line:84%
You feel the ancestral lineage
when you touch these plants.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:06.790 align:middle line:84%
It's like a way of
reconnecting to our ancestors,

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.910 align:middle line:84%
to Mother Earth, in a way
that most people don't really

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.720 align:middle line:90%
understand.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>> It's important to remember
that we all share this common

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.360 align:middle line:90%
ancestry.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.670 align:middle line:10%
The neurotransmitters
in our brain

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:22.610 align:middle line:10%
that drive consciousness--

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:27.470 align:middle line:10%
the so-called monoamines
like serotonin, epinephrine,

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:32.179 align:middle line:10%
norepinephrine, and now
DMT, which we know is

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.520 align:middle line:10%
a neurotransmitter--

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.130 align:middle line:10%
these were all
widespread in nature

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:41.870 align:middle line:10%
and had signal transduction
functions and ecosystems

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:45.800 align:middle line:10%
before there were any complex
mammalian nervous systems.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.560 align:middle line:90%


00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Many believe that another way
we can reconnect is to develop

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.620 align:middle line:84%
an understanding of spirits
residing within a plant.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:02.120 align:middle line:10%
>> The word "deva" has been used
in different ways in different

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.250 align:middle line:10%
cultures over time.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:09.980 align:middle line:84%
But here in reference to
the idea of a plant entity,

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:14.300 align:middle line:84%
we can see that deva is like
the spirit behind the scenes

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.860 align:middle line:90%
of a certain species of plant.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:24.190 align:middle line:84%
So there might be a deva for
mint or a deva for sunflowers

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:27.390 align:middle line:84%
or a deva for the
cannabis family.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And each of the
plants that grow are

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:35.620 align:middle line:84%
like cells of this larger
being or field of intelligence.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And we can see this in
even insect species,

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.790 align:middle line:90%
like ants or bees.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.850 align:middle line:84%
They have an underlying deva
that they are all a part of,

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.220 align:middle line:84%
and they operate
like a group mind.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And they collectively
work together

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:54.220 align:middle line:90%
for the symbiosis of Gaia.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible, as
our ancestors believed,

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:04.290 align:middle line:84%
to connect with the spirit of a
plant family and to gain access

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.060 align:middle line:90%
to its healing powers?

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Certain plant devas
are specifically operating

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:16.150 align:middle line:84%
in the realm of affecting
human consciousness.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And since they exist in a kind
of unity consciousness state,

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.000 align:middle line:84%
we, when we ingest
these plants, we

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.660 align:middle line:84%
can entrain to the frequency of
this deva or the consciousness

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.330 align:middle line:90%
underlying this plant.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is an amazing
experience for the human

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:34.330 align:middle line:84%
because we can see what
it's like to experience

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:39.040 align:middle line:84%
a kind of group mind, not
only with the symbiotic nature

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:45.140 align:middle line:84%
of our planet Gaia but
also with other humans.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And this experience
can help humans

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:51.290 align:middle line:84%
to connect with each
other in a way that

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:56.400 align:middle line:84%
is almost like a telepathic
grid of unity consciousness.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And this alone could
help us to solve

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:02.360 align:middle line:84%
many of the problems
we face as a species.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.410 align:middle line:84%
>> These devas are believed
to be present in plants of all

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:08.060 align:middle line:90%
kinds.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:13.430 align:middle line:84%
Shamans and medicine workers use
psychedelics for deep healing.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:17.240 align:middle line:84%
But the devas, found in
many other types of plants,

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:24.320 align:middle line:84%
can be used to heal,
enhance, and energize.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:29.780 align:middle line:84%
Gotu Kola is used for
energy and mental alertness.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:33.710 align:middle line:90%
Ginkgo biloba helps with memory.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Betel nuts are chewed for
digestion and mental acuity.

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:42.860 align:middle line:90%
These are considered adaptogens.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Adaptogens are plants
that can help us acclimate

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.160 align:middle line:10%
to different situations.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.890 align:middle line:10%
So, for example, an adaptogen
might help us calm down

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:54.540 align:middle line:10%
when we're feeling stressed.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:12:00.157 align:middle line:84%
But it could also help us to
sleep when we have insomnia.

00:12:00.157 --> 00:12:01.740 align:middle line:84%
But it could also
give us more energy.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:05.050 align:middle line:90%


00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Adaptogens like astragalus,
ashwagandha, ginseng, turmeric,

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:18.090 align:middle line:84%
and even small dosages of
cannabis can aid the body

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and mind in adapting to stress,
something that isn't in short

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.390 align:middle line:90%
supply these days.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of the adaptogens grow
under very adverse conditions.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:33.930 align:middle line:90%
I think of rhodiola.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:37.830 align:middle line:84%
This is a plant that grows
in a very northern climate

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:42.210 align:middle line:90%
and survives all this adversity.

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:45.570 align:middle line:84%
The plants that grow
under adverse conditions,

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:49.050 align:middle line:84%
like in the Arctic
Circle in Siberia,

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:54.240 align:middle line:84%
they figured out the key to
survival and adaptability.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And by imbibing them, it
can help us acclimate.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:02.940 align:middle line:90%


00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.210 align:middle line:84%
We should also be looking at
the dandelion, because here's

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:09.780 align:middle line:90%
the plant that we disdain.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.390 align:middle line:90%
And yet, nobody planted it.

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:14.640 align:middle line:90%
Nobody watered it.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.490 align:middle line:84%
They mow it down, and it
still comes back just a little

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:20.550 align:middle line:90%
shorter the next season.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.730 align:middle line:84%
I feel that one thing we
really need to partner with

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:27.570 align:middle line:84%
is some of these plants that
have adapted to adversity.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And by imbibing that,
it's going to help

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:34.080 align:middle line:84%
us have those Jedi
superhero skills

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.600 align:middle line:84%
so that we can
adapt and acclimate.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.830 align:middle line:90%
Be like the dandelion.

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:41.040 align:middle line:90%


00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Our ancestors developed
methods and theories around

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.940 align:middle line:90%
the use of herbs.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.390 align:middle line:10%
One such practice, developed
by the ancient Greeks,

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:56.430 align:middle line:10%
was referred to as the
doctrine of signatures.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:14:00.090 align:middle line:10%
>> The doctrine of signatures
has been used by humans since

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:04.050 align:middle line:10%
the beginning of time to
determine the effect of a plant

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:09.480 align:middle line:10%
or a food on the human body in
healing or in medicinal value.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.190 align:middle line:90%


00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:16.960 align:middle line:84%
For example, a carrot if you
cut it, it looks like an eye.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And the carotenoids in the
carrots are good for the eyes.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.453 align:middle line:84%
Walnuts look like the brain,
and we know now that, yes,

00:14:24.453 --> 00:14:25.620 align:middle line:90%
they are good for the brain.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.470 align:middle line:90%


00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:32.340 align:middle line:90%
Horsetail looks like hair.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:37.030 align:middle line:84%
It's got silica in it, and
it is good for the hair.

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:42.400 align:middle line:84%
So this is the meaning of
the doctrine of signatures.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>> The continued
growth of the internet,

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:49.900 align:middle line:84%
even in remote regions,
has encouraged more sharing

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:54.610 align:middle line:84%
of herbs and plants
from all over the world.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:58.870 align:middle line:84%
With more accessibility to
botanical cultures than before,

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:01.330 align:middle line:84%
some in the scientific
community have

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.970 align:middle line:84%
started to study
the synergy that can

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:07.120 align:middle line:90%
occur between different plants.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Plant medicines have been
used by millions of people

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:12.960 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And to research that and look
at something that can actually

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.820 align:middle line:84%
help nourish us
as well as heal us

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.430 align:middle line:84%
might be a wiser choice
than something that

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:25.410 align:middle line:90%
just suppresses the symptoms.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:28.500 align:middle line:90%


00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>> One doesn't always need a
full psychedelic experience

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:37.140 align:middle line:84%
to access some of the healing
and connecting properties

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.810 align:middle line:90%
of plant medicines.

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Microdosing allows people to
have contact with this medicine

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:49.200 align:middle line:84%
in small amounts and to gain
some of the neuroplasticity

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.730 align:middle line:90%
benefits.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:54.930 align:middle line:84%
They can have experiences where
they feel more creative, more

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:59.190 align:middle line:90%
relaxed, more flexible.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And it can be profound for
some people who are very stuck.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.710 align:middle line:84%
But they don't have to do
this more dramatic experience.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:10.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Microdosing works differently
depending on the person,

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:14.670 align:middle line:10%
the frequency, the
amount that people take,

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:19.520 align:middle line:10%
even how many times they
take it during the same day.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.520 align:middle line:84%
One cannot microdose
with everything.

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:29.780 align:middle line:84%
The two most useful microdosing
are with mushrooms and LSD.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:36.470 align:middle line:10%
Some people do it with a bit
of iboga or a bit of peyote.

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:40.535 align:middle line:84%
Microdosing is very valuable
and needs to be studied further.

00:16:40.535 --> 00:16:43.070 align:middle line:90%


00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:49.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Macrodosing is the classic
trip experience where you have

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:56.120 align:middle line:10%
the full psychedelic
experience for several hours.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:02.930 align:middle line:84%
The benefit of a macrodose is
you have full ego dissolution.

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.750 align:middle line:90%
You don't have any defenses.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:11.270 align:middle line:84%
You are going to have to dive
into this immersive experience

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:16.069 align:middle line:84%
and have a period
of full surrender.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:19.560 align:middle line:90%
Surrender is medicine.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.859 align:middle line:84%
That is a powerful
medicine that can touch you

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:24.200 align:middle line:90%
in ways that nothing else can.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.720 align:middle line:90%


00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And surrendering to nature
may be the best way to fight

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.850 align:middle line:84%
back against the forces
trying to destroy it.

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:42.740 align:middle line:90%


00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.980 align:middle line:84%
Our fraught relationship
with technology

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.285 align:middle line:90%
was in some ways foretold.

00:17:47.285 --> 00:17:50.190 align:middle line:90%


00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Beginning in 1891,
Rudolf Steiner

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:56.910 align:middle line:84%
warned of electromagnetic
radiation,

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:00.210 align:middle line:84%
insisting the spiritual
aspirin would need twice

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:03.930 align:middle line:84%
as much fortitude to
accomplish the same amount

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:06.840 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual work.

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.260 align:middle line:84%
>> We're being forced to
adapt to the technology,

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.320 align:middle line:84%
but technology is
not entirely bad.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.950 align:middle line:84%
It can serve humanity,
and it has done so.

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Like Rudolf Steiner
and many others

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:21.360 align:middle line:84%
have promoted that we need
to create spiritual science.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.580 align:middle line:84%
We need to create
technology that does not

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.790 align:middle line:84%
endanger the
existence of humanity,

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:30.570 align:middle line:84%
to create more chaos and
addictions and abuse,

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:34.050 align:middle line:84%
creating reality for people,
so social engineering,

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:37.410 align:middle line:84%
and to realize the consequences
and to create technology

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:40.740 align:middle line:84%
in the right way to
further ourselves

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:44.910 align:middle line:84%
to maybe, at some point, we can
bypass this form of technology

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:48.660 align:middle line:84%
that can endanger us and
realize the old technologies

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.870 align:middle line:84%
that the ancients use,
which is to figure out what

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.330 align:middle line:90%
else Earth can serve us with.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:56.910 align:middle line:90%


00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Steiner couldn't possibly
have imagined the amount

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.930 align:middle line:90%
of EMFs we now produce.

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:06.750 align:middle line:84%
So how can a spiritual
aspirins of today

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:12.860 align:middle line:84%
live harmoniously in a world
of increasing EMF production?

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>> EMF and technology are
wreaking havoc on the human

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:17.850 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:18.650 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.370 align:middle line:90%
Because we're energy machines.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
electromagnetics

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:29.150 align:middle line:84%
at work within us and
the brain and the heart

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.290 align:middle line:90%
and the rest of the body.

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:34.970 align:middle line:84%
So when we're
subjected to Wi-Fi,

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:39.920 align:middle line:84%
when we're close to every plug
in the wall that's 60 Hertz,

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.790 align:middle line:84%
it's interfering in
human consciousness,

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:46.370 align:middle line:84%
in the living
machine that we are,

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.430 align:middle line:84%
and we're having to adapt
to it very quickly--

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:50.510 align:middle line:90%
to cell towers.

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And now there's a
great concern with 5G.

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:57.380 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the fact that we're
interested in profit

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:02.360 align:middle line:84%
is getting us to overlook what
the long-term exposure and what

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:03.530 align:middle line:90%
the consequences are.

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:06.090 align:middle line:90%


00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Can the plant kingdom
have some kind of assistance

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:10.260 align:middle line:90%
or defense?

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.350 align:middle line:90%


00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:18.840 align:middle line:84%
Many herbalists,
researchers, and healers

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.030 align:middle line:90%
believe the answer is yes.

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:24.440 align:middle line:90%


00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.470 align:middle line:84%
One doesn't need to
travel to the Amazon

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:30.890 align:middle line:84%
to acquire these
beneficial plants.

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Many can be found in
your pantry, supermarket,

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:36.290 align:middle line:90%
or even your backyard.

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:39.770 align:middle line:90%


00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And research suggests that
ginger, turmeric, and citrus

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.960 align:middle line:84%
can mitigate the effects
of radiation exposure.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:55.630 align:middle line:90%


00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And the mere introduction
of plant material

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.410 align:middle line:84%
into the water we consume
can have profound effects.

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:06.130 align:middle line:90%


00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:10.420 align:middle line:10%
Konstantin Korotkov's
Bio-Well technology

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:14.170 align:middle line:10%
measures photon emissions
and shows readings

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:18.190 align:middle line:10%
before and after
drinking water infused

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:26.830 align:middle line:10%
with plants, like tea, essential
oils, or flower essences.

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:31.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Konstantin Korotkov used
his Bio-Well device to measure

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:35.390 align:middle line:10%
the biophotons emitted from
the human energy field before,

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:39.550 align:middle line:10%
during, and after the
ingestion of ayahuasca.

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:43.480 align:middle line:10%
And it was amazing to note
that, during the experience

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:47.620 align:middle line:10%
of the plant medicine, there
was almost no visible field

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:50.350 align:middle line:10%
around the body.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And after the experience,
there were still

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:57.760 align:middle line:84%
large holes in it that took
a while to reconstitute.

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.390 align:middle line:10%
And this showed us how these
plant medicines open us up

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:04.570 align:middle line:10%
to view the higher realms
and have expanded states

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:06.470 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness.

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:09.790 align:middle line:10%
But it also indicated that,
after the experience, it

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:13.960 align:middle line:10%
it's good to leave some time to
let the auric or the biofield

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.100 align:middle line:10%
regenerate itself.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And there are things
that we can do,

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:25.520 align:middle line:84%
such as visualization
or prayer or a salt bath

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:30.320 align:middle line:84%
or time in nature, to help the
process of the reconstitution

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.030 align:middle line:90%
of the field.

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:37.310 align:middle line:10%
>> The major problem in the
world now is alienation.

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:39.960 align:middle line:84%
We are disconnected
from our own bodies.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.910 align:middle line:84%
We are disconnected
from each other.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:45.560 align:middle line:90%
We are disconnected from nature.

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:50.560 align:middle line:84%
So returning spirituality into
the industrial civilization,

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.120 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the most
effective, most powerful,

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:57.520 align:middle line:84%
most hopeful way of dealing with
the crisis, the global crisis

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.930 align:middle line:90%
that we have lost.

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:01.840 align:middle line:84%
We have lost effective
spirituality.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.090 align:middle line:84%
We have organized
religions, but they

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:06.580 align:middle line:90%
became very fundamentalist.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing that the
industrial civilization managed

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:13.480 align:middle line:84%
to just completely suppress
it, including things

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:17.470 align:middle line:84%
like killing shamans
in different countries,

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:20.290 align:middle line:84%
stopping these
different religions--

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:24.310 align:middle line:84%
in many instances, replacing
really relevant native

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:25.290 align:middle line:90%
spirituality.

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:29.460 align:middle line:90%


00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>> The ancient keepers
of plant wisdom--

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:37.980 align:middle line:84%
such as witches,
shamans, and healers--

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.950 align:middle line:90%
are nearly gone.

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:44.250 align:middle line:84%
But institutions are
slowly rediscovering

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:49.050 align:middle line:84%
what our ancestors
intuitively understood.

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Balance with nature
is not only better

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:58.560 align:middle line:84%
than endless economic growth
but essential to our survival.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Wherever you live, if you
live in an apartment or you

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.960 align:middle line:10%
live in a house,
you're on autopilot,

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:08.320 align:middle line:10%
intuitively connected to your
whole home and how it works.

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.500 align:middle line:84%
How do you open the
garage or whatever

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:13.200 align:middle line:84%
it is, that might be a mystery
to somebody that's never lived

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.310 align:middle line:90%
in that kind of circumstance.

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:20.550 align:middle line:84%
The Indigenous cultures,
they live in nature.

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:23.930 align:middle line:90%
And so that's their influence.

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Nature is this
incredible teacher.

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:32.020 align:middle line:84%
So when you immerse
yourself in that,

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:33.950 align:middle line:90%
you learn more about that.

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:37.390 align:middle line:90%
You learn more about yourself.

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:38.950 align:middle line:84%
You understand more
about what it is

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:42.520 align:middle line:90%
to be alive here on this Earth.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And so when you don't have
that, what a disconnect

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:48.965 align:middle line:90%
that is from the cosmos.

00:24:48.965 --> 00:24:49.765 align:middle line:90%
It's massive.

00:24:49.765 --> 00:24:52.550 align:middle line:90%


00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:58.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Depression, anxiety, trauma--

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:02.160 align:middle line:10%
the pace and pressures
of the material world

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:08.050 align:middle line:10%
can lead many down a path that
leaves them feeling isolated.

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:10.750 align:middle line:84%
For those that have
lost their way,

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:14.380 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that
psychedelic plant medicines

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:19.570 align:middle line:84%
can reintroduce the notion
of being one with nature?

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:22.330 align:middle line:10%
>> We're right on the cusp
of ecological devastation

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:24.430 align:middle line:10%
and a biological extermination.

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:27.220 align:middle line:10%
And if we don't open up
to this consciousness

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.440 align:middle line:10%
to get back to
Gaian consciousness,

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.220 align:middle line:10%
we're going to die.

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we are out of balance
with the masculine and feminine

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:39.910 align:middle line:84%
energy that overly masculine
is overly intellectual,

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:43.420 align:middle line:84%
overly materialistic,
overly objective.

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a big
turn right now, a shift,

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:51.030 align:middle line:90%
to recognize the feminine.

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Plant medicines can
help foster our access

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.985 align:middle line:84%
to the feminine, our
reverence for the feminine.

00:25:55.985 --> 00:25:59.870 align:middle line:90%


00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:02.450 align:middle line:90%
>> The clock is ticking.

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:04.520 align:middle line:84%
Is there any hope
that the world can

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:08.420 align:middle line:84%
come into harmony with nature
the way our ancestors once

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:09.890 align:middle line:90%
lived?

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:15.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Anything that can help us to
have more humanitarian aspects,

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:21.260 align:middle line:10%
caring for others, caring about
the survival of our children,

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:26.840 align:middle line:10%
about the planet, rather than
only what's going on right now,

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.130 align:middle line:10%
is really imperative.

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:30.910 align:middle line:90%


00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Understanding the power
of Gaia may be the key.

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:41.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Sacred psychoactive
plants can serve humanity.

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:44.500 align:middle line:84%
They have always been here
provided, by our dear planet

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:48.190 align:middle line:90%
Gaia, to help us awaken.

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And now they are resurging to
share their medicine with us

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:52.860 align:middle line:90%
at this time.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:57.240 align:middle line:90%


00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So how we go forward
may truly be up to us.

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Are we at a quantum
timeline choice point,

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:10.760 align:middle line:84%
as many ancient
cultures believed?

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many cultures
that have pointed to this time

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:18.980 align:middle line:84%
in history as a kind of timeline
bifurcation as a possibility

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.140 align:middle line:90%
of what we might experience.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:29.510 align:middle line:84%
The Aztecs, the Hopi prophecies,
modern Damanhur Federation,

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:34.010 align:middle line:84%
and many others say that, at
certain junctures in history,

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:38.030 align:middle line:84%
there can be a bifurcation
of the timeline, which

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:41.960 align:middle line:84%
means a quantum
splitting of realities.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And there might be
some reality that

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:48.590 align:middle line:84%
exist where AI takes over
the planet and biology

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:52.880 align:middle line:84%
as we know it fades out and
another reality where humans

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.070 align:middle line:84%
go to the next level
of their evolution,

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:59.900 align:middle line:84%
of symbiosis with the Gaian
super mind and with each other.

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.690 align:middle line:84%
We have to realize
that we have more power

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:07.310 align:middle line:84%
than we realize to create the
reality we want to live in.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>> It's important to think
about this matter of self

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:12.140 align:middle line:90%
empowerment.

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:14.540 align:middle line:10%
The power is within us.

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:19.520 align:middle line:10%
The plant medicines just help
us to discover that power.

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.920 align:middle line:10%
>> We need to
understand who we are,

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:26.390 align:middle line:10%
to bring spirituality into
the shamanic experience,

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:28.670 align:middle line:10%
to not empower
things outside of us,

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:32.270 align:middle line:10%
which we are trained
to look for our savior,

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:35.930 align:middle line:10%
for extraterrestrial,
for profit,

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:39.650 align:middle line:10%
for an avatar who's going
to come and save us.

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:42.070 align:middle line:84%
We are the ones that
we can save ourself,

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:44.480 align:middle line:84%
but we need to
upgrade this, and we

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:47.540 align:middle line:84%
need to use what we know
of psychedelics to really

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.640 align:middle line:84%
understand that
words create reality.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.490 align:middle line:90%


00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Perhaps only a radical
expansion of consciousness can

00:28:57.110 --> 00:29:02.670 align:middle line:84%
reveal the solution to an
urgent and growing threat.

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the most important
thing that we need to do is

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:10.860 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that we need to
function in partnership with

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:15.990 align:middle line:84%
nature, we're not
the owners of nature,

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:19.810 align:middle line:84%
and that nature is
really running the show.

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:23.370 align:middle line:84%
We need to accept that and
behave in such a way that

00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:27.900 align:middle line:84%
supports the flourishing
of life on Earth,

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:32.840 align:middle line:84%
supports the evolution,
the co-evolution.

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:37.400 align:middle line:10%
>> The first and most important
thing is to remember that we

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:42.060 align:middle line:10%
are in relationship
with plant world.

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:44.040 align:middle line:90%
They are our family.

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.840 align:middle line:90%
They're our kin.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.650 align:middle line:90%
They're our friends.

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:48.525 align:middle line:90%
They're our teachers.

00:29:48.525 --> 00:29:51.150 align:middle line:90%


00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:56.130 align:middle line:84%
We want to approach the plants
as though they are respected

00:29:56.130 --> 00:30:02.100 align:middle line:84%
and beloved members of our
family with wisdom to impart.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:04.560 align:middle line:90%
They're our elders.

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:08.550 align:middle line:84%
That means we want to come
in a place of gratitude,

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:12.025 align:middle line:84%
of appreciation, of
awe, and of wonder.

00:30:12.025 --> 00:30:14.790 align:middle line:90%


00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:18.930 align:middle line:84%
We want to come with offerings,
whether it's to the soil,

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:23.520 align:middle line:84%
to the plants, with
songs, with celebration.

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And then we just need
to learn to listen.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>> What I believe
Gaia truly means--

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:35.700 align:middle line:84%
it's not just the
feminine spirit.

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a type of
intelligence that is

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:42.420 align:middle line:84%
connected to the ultimate
feminine archetype, which

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:45.310 align:middle line:90%
is nature.

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:49.120 align:middle line:10%
>> We cannot do anything to
nature that doesn't happen

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.170 align:middle line:10%
to ourselves.

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:54.930 align:middle line:84%
If you work with people
with holotropic states,

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:57.030 align:middle line:84%
they develop a sense
of spirituality

00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:00.300 align:middle line:84%
that's universal, that's
all encompassing, that's

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.820 align:middle line:90%
ecumenical.

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Those are all
characteristics that

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.080 align:middle line:84%
would help our
survival as a species

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:11.010 align:middle line:84%
if it would happen on
a large enough scale.

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether it can happen
on a large enough scale

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:18.590 align:middle line:84%
and whether we have enough
time, that's a question.

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:20.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have seen
the transformation

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.757 align:middle line:84%
in hundreds of
people, literally.

00:31:22.757 --> 00:31:25.890 align:middle line:90%


00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:29.760 align:middle line:10%
>> The global initiative to
restore our relationship with

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:36.750 align:middle line:10%
Gaia, with nature,
with ancient knowledge,

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:42.180 align:middle line:10%
and with plant medicine
is not a regression.

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:44.940 align:middle line:84%
It is a move
forward to reconnect

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:48.300 align:middle line:84%
with the technology
that has been with us

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:51.580 align:middle line:90%
since the very beginning.

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:54.820 align:middle line:84%
It could be that the
use of psychedelics

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:58.480 align:middle line:84%
is an ancient tool to
access the consciousness

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:03.120 align:middle line:84%
of the future, the
consciousness of Mother Earth.
