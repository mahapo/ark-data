00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>> American astronomer Carl
Edward Sagan was best known

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.410 align:middle line:84%
from his show called
"Cosmos," as the spokesman

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.810 align:middle line:84%
for the responsible
use of science,

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.930 align:middle line:84%
his interest in
extraterrestrial intelligence,

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.840 align:middle line:84%
and the eloquent way he
simplified complex concepts

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.220 align:middle line:90%
to the world.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.760 align:middle line:84%
However, a little known fact
about the late, great thinker

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.450 align:middle line:90%
was his ritual use of cannabis.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.360 align:middle line:84%
His love for this plant
caused for a few quotes of his

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.680 align:middle line:84%
to be immortalized regarding
the absurdity of its illegality,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.380 align:middle line:84%
the ability for its effects
to improve experiences

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.230 align:middle line:90%
of food, art, and lovemaking.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.510 align:middle line:84%
He spoke of the
possibility that cannabis,

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.050 align:middle line:84%
or the textile producing parts
of the plant known as hemp,

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.959 align:middle line:84%
as humanity's oldest
cultivated crop,

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.720 align:middle line:84%
and that it may have led to
the invention of agriculture,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.020 align:middle line:84%
thereby leading to its
roots of civilization.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Could a simple
psychoactive and textile

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.910 align:middle line:84%
crop have been given
so much acclaim,

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.910 align:middle line:84%
or is there more to this
plant than meets the eye?

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Cannabis, in my view,
is another of the great

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.010 align:middle line:10%
and powerful teacher plants.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.800 align:middle line:10%
We cannot really argue that
cannabis is a psychedelic,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.230 align:middle line:10%
although at high dosages, with--

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.020 align:middle line:10%
particularly with
individuals who

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.900 align:middle line:10%
are not experienced
with cannabis--

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.280 align:middle line:10%
the experience is
pretty close to a full

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.460 align:middle line:10%
on psychedelic experience.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.070 align:middle line:90%
It can be.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.380 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I think
that the natural world

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.375 align:middle line:90%
has been bounteous to us.

00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:56.840 align:middle line:90%
It has provided us with--

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.680 align:middle line:84%
well, of course, all our food
and clothing and everything

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.600 align:middle line:84%
comes out of nature,
and has provided us

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.700 align:middle line:84%
with these substances
that alter consciousness

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.590 align:middle line:84%
as well, which humanity has
had a long relationship with.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>> There are so many terms for
this plant today that it seems

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.280 align:middle line:84%
each passing generation and
cultural clique refreshes its

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.380 align:middle line:90%
terminology.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.240 align:middle line:90%
>> It's called ganja.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.490 align:middle line:84%
>> The combination of
mindfulness and marijuana--

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>> We hang out, we talk,
we kind of break the ice.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>> The class opens with students
sampling cannabis products.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:44.340 align:middle line:90%


00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>> But how far back can we find
evidence of man's use of hemp

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.230 align:middle line:84%
or cannabis, and what might
our ancestors have called it?

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, as far as
evidence of hemp--

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.360 align:middle line:10%
you know, hemp fibers
and the use of hemp--

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.740 align:middle line:10%
that goes back, according
to the foremost expert

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.794 align:middle line:10%
on ancient textiles, Elizabeth
Whalen Barber, to about 25,000,

00:03:05.794 --> 00:03:08.710 align:middle line:10%
28,000 years ago.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.320 align:middle line:10%
And this is in the
form of tools used

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.210 align:middle line:10%
for breaking up hemp fibers.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.220 align:middle line:10%
We have evidence of
hemp cloth going back

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.050 align:middle line:10%
at least 12,000 years, very,
very widespread, you know.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.120 align:middle line:84%
The use of cannabis
can basically

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.580 align:middle line:84%
be followed by the spread
of Indo-European language,

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.970 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking about the
root language of French,

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.300 align:middle line:90%
German, English, Sanskrit.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Wherever it goes,
as soon it's there,

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.650 align:middle line:90%
it starts taking on new names.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.780 align:middle line:10%
You know, the giver of delights,
the end of sorrow, the gift,

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.910 align:middle line:10%
the secret, you know,
all these different names

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.240 align:middle line:10%
start coming into play.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.230 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1936, a Polish
entomologist an anthropologist,

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.220 align:middle line:10%
Sula Benet, proposed that the
biblical term kaneh bosm was

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.730 align:middle line:10%
misinterpreted by the Greek
and Latin translators as being

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.240 align:middle line:10%
the marsh root calamus, which
commonly grew everywhere

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.220 align:middle line:10%
throughout the Middle East.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.122 align:middle line:84%
But cannabis was not
native to this region.

00:04:04.122 --> 00:04:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>> In the Old
Testament references,

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.580 align:middle line:84%
a kaneh is specifically
described as something coming

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.730 align:middle line:84%
from a distant land and that's
why I would suggest that

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.180 align:middle line:84%
the Indo-European term,
kaneh, followed it.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.529 align:middle line:10%
It came with that name
as an item of trade,

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:19.329 align:middle line:10%
and we know that
Scythians and other groups

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.820 align:middle line:10%
were trading in the
area of the region

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.650 align:middle line:10%
from archeological evidence.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.970 align:middle line:10%
>> The term Scythian identifies
a collection of nomadic tribes

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.620 align:middle line:10%
that were cannabis using tribes.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.820 align:middle line:10%
They even were over in India
and dominated in northern India

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.630 align:middle line:10%
from about 400 BC
to about 200 AD.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.330 align:middle line:10%
And it's interesting,
because Ithithians in India

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.440 align:middle line:10%
adopted the worship of Shiva,
a god associated with cannabis.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.360 align:middle line:10%
Some ancient texts refer
to Buddha as a Sacae,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.330 align:middle line:10%
and Sacae's the Persian
name for the Scythians.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And so there's this
whole connection

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.060 align:middle line:84%
that he may have been
a Persian prince.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.260 align:middle line:10%
And in some of the
older accounts,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.460 align:middle line:10%
it's also written that he
survived on one hemp seed a day

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.300 align:middle line:10%
before coming to his
divine revelations.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.260 align:middle line:10%


00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Why would this single plant
be found in so many ancient

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.600 align:middle line:10%
cultures, riddled
throughout religions,

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.780 align:middle line:10%
and seen as a divine sacrament?

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.030 align:middle line:84%
Could a psychoactive
experience be worth enough

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.900 align:middle line:84%
to trade this plant across a
5,000 mile stretch of land,

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.250 align:middle line:84%
or is there more to this
plant than we've been told?

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>> There are so many uses
of this amazing plant,

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.740 align:middle line:90%
cannabis sativa.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.210 align:middle line:90%
You could eat the leaves.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.700 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people don't know
that just eating the leaves

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.690 align:middle line:10%
could be juiced, and
made into a salad.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.900 align:middle line:10%
You can eat the seeds,
they're high in protein.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.390 align:middle line:10%
They're high in
essential fatty acids.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:51.160 align:middle line:84%
You could be feeding this
plant for livestock feed

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.480 align:middle line:84%
to your goats and chickens
and horses and cows.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.870 align:middle line:84%
We could be using this
plant to make a rope.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.390 align:middle line:84%
It makes a very,
very strong rope.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>> The use of hemp for
cordage and rope has been seen

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.500 align:middle line:84%
in hunter gatherer groups all
the way up until World War II.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Thus plans are afoot for
a great expansion of the hemp

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.010 align:middle line:84%
industry as a part
of the war program.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.910 align:middle line:10%
This film is designed
to tell farmers

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.460 align:middle line:10%
how to handle this ancient
crop, now little known

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.485 align:middle line:10%
outside Kentucky and Wisconsin.

00:06:20.485 --> 00:06:23.590 align:middle line:10%
This is Manila hemp, from
the Navy's rapidly dwindling

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:24.760 align:middle line:10%
reserve.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.310 align:middle line:10%
When that is gone, American
hemp will go on duty again.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Hemp for mooring ships,
hemp for towlines.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.870 align:middle line:10%
>> But as technology
compounded upon itself

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.230 align:middle line:10%
in the post-industrial
era, newer and more useful

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.960 align:middle line:10%
applications of the
hemp plant have emerged.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.150 align:middle line:84%
Radio host and
researcher Max Egan

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.090 align:middle line:84%
has been using this plant
medicinally for himself

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and his community
for many years,

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.450 align:middle line:84%
and speaks publicly around
the world about its many uses.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>> We can make plastics
out of cannabis.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.636 align:middle line:84%
We can make paper
out of cannabis.

00:06:56.636 --> 00:06:59.620 align:middle line:10%
The best quality materials,
as strong as denim and as soft

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.849 align:middle line:10%
as silk.

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:03.140 align:middle line:10%
Everything you can think of,
we can make of this plant.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.780 align:middle line:10%
Half of old Cairo is
built from cannabis.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.260 align:middle line:10%
You can get the hurd, mix it
with lime, and it petrifies.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.270 align:middle line:84%
What other plant will
petrify into stone

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.290 align:middle line:84%
and allow you to
build houses from it?

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.789 align:middle line:84%
This is what this plant can
do, it's an incredible plant.

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And you can grow
out in three months,

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.970 align:middle line:84%
and it'll produce a crop that
will do all that stuff in three

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.880 align:middle line:84%
months rather than tearing our
forests down and ripping up

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.700 align:middle line:84%
our landscapes and doing
all the things we're doing.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Logging has become a
multi-billion dollar industry

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:33.290 align:middle line:84%
and employs almost 1 million
people in the US alone.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:35.750 align:middle line:84%
In the past 30
years, human activity

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.580 align:middle line:84%
has destroyed a plot
of land the size

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.910 align:middle line:84%
of Germany in the Brazilian
rain forest alone.

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.480 align:middle line:84%
If industrial hemp weren't
so heavily restricted

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.690 align:middle line:84%
in nearly every country
as well as resisted

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.840 align:middle line:84%
from corporate interests,
much of these issues

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.200 align:middle line:84%
could be diminished or
resolved completely.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.110 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason,
this highly useful plant

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.820 align:middle line:84%
is shunned on a cultural level,
illegal on a federal level,

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.770 align:middle line:90%
and feared on an industry level.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>> The reason cannabis is banned
is because it would destroy

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.690 align:middle line:84%
most of the most profitable
businesses on the planet,

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.860 align:middle line:84%
were it legalized, and
unfortunately these are all

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.560 align:middle line:84%
some of the most pollutive
businesses on the planet

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.520 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So, I can see why this
is really a threat to a lot

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.680 align:middle line:90%
of industries.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.630 align:middle line:84%
There's one plant that
could solve so many

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:28.730 align:middle line:84%
of our environmental
problems and grows so easily.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:33.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't know another
plant that does this.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.429 align:middle line:84%
>> The benefits of cannabis have
been speculated for generations

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:39.700 align:middle line:84%
that existed in times less bound
by the burden of scientific

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.409 align:middle line:90%
proof.

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Today, as several
countries around the world

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.810 align:middle line:84%
are loosening the
restrictions around cannabis,

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.870 align:middle line:84%
the scientific
data is pouring in.

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Joe Cohen has been
researching the many healing

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.630 align:middle line:84%
qualities through case studies
and personally overseeing

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.360 align:middle line:90%
the results in patients.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Most of my research related
to cannabis actually comes from

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.300 align:middle line:10%
patient experiences.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.340 align:middle line:10%
I've been practicing
cannabis medicine

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.780 align:middle line:10%
for close to eight
years and I've

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.760 align:middle line:10%
seen thousands of patients.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.770 align:middle line:84%
So I often see patients
with chronic pain,

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:17.140 align:middle line:84%
and one area that I work a lot
with is autoimmune disease.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Autoimmune disease is
characterized by the body

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.410 align:middle line:84%
producing antibodies, which in
turn attacks its own tissues.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.230 align:middle line:84%
This confusion of
the immune system

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:30.910 align:middle line:84%
is often seen when diet is
poor, vaccines are overdone,

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.680 align:middle line:84%
and the health of
the gut microbiome

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.130 align:middle line:84%
has an imbalance of unhealthy
bacteria and not enough healthy

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:37.750 align:middle line:90%
flora.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:40.840 align:middle line:10%
However, great advancements
in treating the symptoms

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.650 align:middle line:10%
has been seen with the many
compounds found in cannabis.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So, there is over 400
different parts of a cannabis

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.230 align:middle line:84%
plant, chemicals in the plant,
of which probably 85 to 100 are

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:57.490 align:middle line:84%
cannabinoids, like THC,
and cannabidiol, CBD,

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:59.620 align:middle line:90%
which has become very popular.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And then on top of that,
we have probably a couple

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.940 align:middle line:90%
hundred different terpenes.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.650 align:middle line:10%
Terpenes are in a lot
of plants and fruits,

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.290 align:middle line:10%
that gives flavor
and odor to things.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:10.930 align:middle line:10%
So when you smell
the cannabis plant,

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:12.700 align:middle line:10%
you're actually
smelling terpenes.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.790 align:middle line:10%
They actually
modulate-- modify--

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.400 align:middle line:10%
the effects of the
cannabinoids in the plant.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.140 align:middle line:90%
And then there's flavonoids.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:23.800 align:middle line:84%
So, we're talking about over
400 compounds in this plant,

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.300 align:middle line:84%
and they all kind
of work together

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.930 align:middle line:84%
to give the effect that
you are looking for.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>> As with all other
psychoactive plants,

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.670 align:middle line:84%
the different chemical
properties alter the types

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:36.490 align:middle line:84%
of feelings and
effects one receives,

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:39.670 align:middle line:84%
creating a symphonic effect
where no one ingredient is

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:42.355 align:middle line:90%
given full credit for the high.

00:10:42.355 --> 00:10:46.030 align:middle line:84%
The THC molecule found in
all strains of cannabis

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:49.550 align:middle line:84%
affects the body and mind the
same way across the board.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.220 align:middle line:84%
So, the reason every
strain of cannabis

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:55.780 align:middle line:84%
affects people differently
has to do with the terpenes.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And this symphony
of biochemistry

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:00.850 align:middle line:84%
also accounts for the numerous
beneficial applications being

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:02.110 align:middle line:90%
found in clinical research.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.850 align:middle line:90%


00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>> The most profound thing that
I see regarding cannabis is how

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.230 align:middle line:84%
it can treat so many
different disorders,

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:16.780 align:middle line:84%
and that's really related
to the fact that we have

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.730 align:middle line:90%
an endocannabinoid system.

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:21.200 align:middle line:90%
We produce our own cannabinoids.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.800 align:middle line:10%
Animals have been
producing cannabinoids

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.380 align:middle line:10%
for 600 million
years, and the plant

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:31.090 align:middle line:10%
didn't arrive until about
25 million years ago.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:34.420 align:middle line:10%
>> The endocannabinoid system
in our body contains specific

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.390 align:middle line:10%
receptors in the mammalian
brain and throughout the nervous

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:39.880 align:middle line:10%
system that not only
allows humans to enjoy

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.240 align:middle line:10%
the psychoactive effects,
but also serves to maintain

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.360 align:middle line:10%
a healthy homeostasis
and immunity.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.340 align:middle line:84%
One of the hallmarks
of this effect

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.830 align:middle line:84%
is most notable in the
increase in appetite

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:53.200 align:middle line:90%
after ingesting cannabis.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Why does weed
make you hungry?

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.070 align:middle line:90%
Why do you get the munchies?

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:03.040 align:middle line:10%
And it's because you have a
chemical mechanism in you that

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.670 align:middle line:10%
keeps you alive that says, hey
dude, you're kind of running

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:10.300 align:middle line:10%
low on nutrients, and if you
want this machine to keep

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.150 align:middle line:10%
running, fuel me up.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And the longer you disregard
that internal chemical message,

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.230 align:middle line:84%
the more that chemical pain
increases and chemically

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:21.920 align:middle line:90%
forces you to eat.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.040 align:middle line:84%
That's what hunger is, and
it's keeping you alive,

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.730 align:middle line:84%
and it's this natural
balancing mechanism.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's balanced
on cannabinoids.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.440 align:middle line:84%
The heaviest amount
of cannabinoids

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.800 align:middle line:84%
that humans produce
is in breast milk,

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:39.340 align:middle line:84%
cause it feeds the building
blocks of life to children.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Balances also all
of your receptors--

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:47.170 align:middle line:90%
your electronic mechanisms.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:51.580 align:middle line:84%
We were always told in
school by the $1.3 billion

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:57.010 align:middle line:84%
monopoly a year, DARE, that
cannabis kills brain cells.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:58.260 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's the opposite.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.490 align:middle line:84%
It's actually
neurological protectants.

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>> It's what we
call an adaptogen.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:07.090 align:middle line:84%
An adaptopogenic herb is
something that tries to create

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:08.990 align:middle line:90%
balance in our body.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:12.250 align:middle line:84%
So, this is an herbal
medicine, a plant medicine,

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.980 align:middle line:84%
that actually has
the same chemical

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.250 align:middle line:84%
structure as our
own cannabinoids,

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.460 align:middle line:84%
and it tries to keep
everything in balance.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:24.190 align:middle line:84%
Cannabinoids travel in
a reverse direction.

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:27.220 align:middle line:84%
They go retrograde
through the synapse,

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.770 align:middle line:84%
and by going retrograde through
the synapse, what they're

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:33.940 align:middle line:84%
actually doing is they're
slowing down the hypersystem

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.460 align:middle line:84%
and they're speeding
up the hyposystem,

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:40.060 align:middle line:90%
and therefore creating balance.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>> The beauty of this
adaptogenic herb is

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:45.430 align:middle line:84%
in the intelligence of how
it knows to bring biological

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:48.940 align:middle line:90%
processes back into balance.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:52.180 align:middle line:84%
It has an ability to listen
and respond to its environment

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:55.330 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring
balance and growth.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.490 align:middle line:10%
Through our
endocannabinoid system,

00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:00.850 align:middle line:10%
we are hardwired to
listen and respond,

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:04.030 align:middle line:10%
meaning we have an
ancient symbiotic language

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:middle line:10%
with cannabinoids.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.620 align:middle line:90%


00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that a
specific tree that

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.010 align:middle line:84%
can grow to full maturity
in one year with healing

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:16.090 align:middle line:84%
properties in its very structure
is truly remarkable, even

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:19.020 align:middle line:84%
for the whole of
the plant kingdom.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Although cannabis is not
a classic psychedelic that

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:24.700 align:middle line:84%
works on the serotonin
2A receptors,

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.120 align:middle line:84%
it's the ability of the
flowers of this tree

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.700 align:middle line:84%
to bend the mind in so
many different ways that

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.360 align:middle line:90%
deserves deeper investigation.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.050 align:middle line:90%


00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Cannabis is much
more, in my opinion,

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:45.060 align:middle line:84%
about sensual experience, about
realizing the full potential

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:46.110 align:middle line:90%
of our sensuality.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And when I say sensuality,
I don't only mean sex,

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:50.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm also talking
about appreciation

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.140 align:middle line:90%
of food, appreciation of music.

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Stuff that our ears and our
eyes have been shut off to

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:59.390 align:middle line:84%
suddenly comes in and we realize
what majesty we live amongst.

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.680 align:middle line:90%
Cannabis can play that role.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.360 align:middle line:10%
>> When used with the right set
and setting and the right skill

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.830 align:middle line:10%
set, cannabis can
mimic psilocybin.

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:12.840 align:middle line:10%
It can mimic Ayahuasca and DNT.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:17.670 align:middle line:84%
It can also mimic the
empathogens, like MDMA.

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And so from my experience,
it's also a little slower

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:25.080 align:middle line:84%
than other
psychedelics, so we can

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:29.340 align:middle line:84%
have a capacity to develop
those skill sets like navigation

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:33.190 align:middle line:84%
or capacity or focus in
overwhelming situations,

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:39.540 align:middle line:84%
or the capacity to engage
strong emotional experiences.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And then those
skill sets can then

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.500 align:middle line:84%
be translated to other
psychedelic medicines.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.830 align:middle line:84%
So, cannabis is like a bridge
to other psychedelic medicines,

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:54.810 align:middle line:84%
but it's also its
own sacred substance.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:56.580 align:middle line:90%
Its own sacred medicine.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:58.620 align:middle line:90%
It's gentler on the body.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.840 align:middle line:84%
It has shorter
experiences, so people

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:06.430 align:middle line:84%
who have compromised physical
bodies can use it safely,

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:10.170 align:middle line:84%
and it can also be
used more regularly

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:13.760 align:middle line:90%
than other psychedelics.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>> The fact that cannabis
can elicit different effects

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.100 align:middle line:84%
depending on the
way it's ingested,

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:21.210 align:middle line:84%
the mindset going in, and
the type of setting it's done

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:24.410 align:middle line:84%
in, shows a versatility not
typically seen with other

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:26.750 align:middle line:90%
psychoactive plants.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:31.220 align:middle line:84%
Cannabis can induce visuals,
euphoria, relaxation,

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:34.460 align:middle line:90%
or even heightened alertness.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:37.700 align:middle line:84%
However, it can also
cause anxiety, paranoia,

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.860 align:middle line:90%
and short term memory fog.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.620 align:middle line:84%
But these are not always
adverse side effects,

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.900 align:middle line:84%
as they mimic the
ability of psychedelics

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:49.710 align:middle line:84%
to dredge up trauma
from deep in the psyche.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:52.840 align:middle line:10%
Some of the skills people bring
to these kinds of difficulties

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:57.610 align:middle line:10%
are breathing techniques or
movement like dance or Qigong.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:01.120 align:middle line:84%
In modern applications,
biohackers and extreme athletes

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.660 align:middle line:84%
have come up with their
own uses for cannabis.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Personal trainer and
podcast host Ben Greenfield

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:09.970 align:middle line:84%
has been using this plant
to aid in his highly

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:12.460 align:middle line:90%
competitive sports lifestyle.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.140 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm a hard charging,
high achiever,

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:18.970 align:middle line:10%
trying to live this limitless
life of racing and traveling

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:23.440 align:middle line:10%
and speaking and writing, and
it's hard to turn the mind off

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.849 align:middle line:10%
at the end of the day.

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And I initially found cannabis,
and frankly, CBD, not even

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.580 align:middle line:90%
THC to be useful for that.

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:37.030 align:middle line:84%
I began micro dosing
with smaller amounts

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:38.550 align:middle line:90%
prior to workouts.

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:42.730 align:middle line:84%
CBD is an interesting
molecule in that it currently

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:45.850 align:middle line:84%
is not banned by the World
Anti-Doping Association

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:49.420 align:middle line:84%
or by the US Anti-Doping
Association or many

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.850 align:middle line:84%
of the governing
bodies of sport,

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:52.558 align:middle line:84%
which, for me, as a
professional athlete,

00:17:52.558 --> 00:17:56.560 align:middle line:84%
is something that's important,
because I'm able to use it

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.270 align:middle line:84%
for those purposes
without having

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:02.530 align:middle line:84%
to worry about in-season pee
tests or anything like that.

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:08.080 align:middle line:10%
And for CBD, there's
a host of research

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:12.070 align:middle line:10%
now on not just the relaxation
and the anti-inflammatory

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:15.190 align:middle line:10%
effects, but also the
beneficial hormonal effects,

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:18.880 align:middle line:10%
the beneficial effects on
muscle response the training,

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:24.040 align:middle line:10%
the beneficial effects on
everything from testosterone

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.890 align:middle line:10%
to a slight increase
in fat mobilization

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:29.470 align:middle line:10%
to all sorts of things
that serve an athlete well.

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:33.170 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at
something like off season use

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:39.070 align:middle line:84%
of cannabis, I began to realize
that THC, the more psychoactive

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:42.580 align:middle line:84%
component, is actually something
that served me quite well

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.660 align:middle line:90%
for writing and for creativity.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I would say that from a
creative production standpoint,

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:56.410 align:middle line:84%
I've found that both micro
and admittedly macro dosing

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:59.080 align:middle line:84%
with THC has been
something that's been

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.840 align:middle line:90%
really helpful in that regard.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Cannabis, in my opinion,
can be used as a performance

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:07.270 align:middle line:90%
enhancing drug.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:11.230 align:middle line:10%
It tends to help me elicit
flow states more readily,

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:14.284 align:middle line:10%
kind of calms my
mind, helps me relax.

00:19:14.284 --> 00:19:15.700 align:middle line:84%
But the mental
clarity that really

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:19.780 align:middle line:84%
comes from it is probably
why I micro dose anything,

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.150 align:middle line:90%
is for that mental clarity.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:23.890 align:middle line:84%
Really getting
out of my own way,

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:29.500 align:middle line:84%
stopping the self-judgment,
stopping the self-criticism.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Those are really my
biggest barriers.

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:36.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Flow states are spoken about
intensively in Steven Kotler

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.000 align:middle line:10%
and Jamie Wheal's books,
"The Rise of Superman,"

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.620 align:middle line:10%
and "Stealing Fire."

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:44.200 align:middle line:84%
They are typified by the
zone that athletes, dancers,

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.010 align:middle line:84%
musicians, and even
meditators find themselves

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:50.580 align:middle line:84%
in when the task they're
performing becomes effortless.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Time slows down, analysis goes
quiet, and intuition guides

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.240 align:middle line:90%
each decision.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And though these flow states
can be brought on simply

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.570 align:middle line:84%
through mental discipline
or breathing techniques,

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:05.470 align:middle line:84%
another reliable way is through
micro dosing psychedelic

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:07.290 align:middle line:90%
plants.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.210 align:middle line:84%
But how is it that
cannabis can enhance

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:11.970 align:middle line:84%
mental clarity, when the
cultural stigma claims

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:13.620 align:middle line:90%
the opposite?

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:16.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Innocently, they danced.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.780 align:middle line:10%
Innocent of a new and
deadly menace lurking

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.646 align:middle line:10%
behind closed doors.

00:20:20.646 --> 00:20:21.446 align:middle line:10%
[GONG RINGING]

00:20:21.446 --> 00:20:27.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Marijuana, the burning
weed with its roots in hell.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:31.140 align:middle line:10%
>> The reefer madness stereotype
is anti-hemp propaganda,

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.180 align:middle line:10%
there's no truth to it.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And now that cannabis
is legal in many places,

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:40.140 align:middle line:84%
medical cannabis as well
as recreational cannabis,

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:46.200 align:middle line:84%
we have statistical evidence
that violent crime is reduced,

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.420 align:middle line:84%
that opiate use and
opiate deaths are reduced,

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:53.810 align:middle line:84%
and even DUIs and intoxicated
driving is reduced.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:21:00.510 align:middle line:10%
So, the anti-cannabis
hysteria is simply

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:04.230 align:middle line:10%
propaganda to prohibit
the production of hemp,

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.200 align:middle line:10%
to protect corporate interests.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:12.400 align:middle line:84%
They used racism and showed
out of control behavior

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:16.260 align:middle line:84%
and put it on something
that they couldn't otherwise

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.270 align:middle line:90%
challenge.

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Daniel McQueen founded
medicinal mindfulness,

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:23.430 align:middle line:84%
which specializes in the
spiritual and therapeutic

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:26.160 align:middle line:84%
application of psychedelics
or breathing techniques

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.000 align:middle line:90%
in the Boulder, Colorado area.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>> In regards to set and
setting with cannabis,

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:37.160 align:middle line:84%
we bring in a gratitude prayer
when we imbibe the medicine,

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.970 align:middle line:90%
and we sit in a circle.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And we're calling and energies
and ways of being that

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.770 align:middle line:84%
support a psychedelic
journey work.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:49.350 align:middle line:90%
And this is far from--

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:53.640 align:middle line:84%
like, the exact opposite
extreme of recreational use

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.610 align:middle line:84%
or unconscious use
or habitual use.

00:21:56.610 --> 00:22:02.220 align:middle line:84%
We're not just sitting there
feeling stoned or blissed out.

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:06.330 align:middle line:84%
There's some real significant
psychological, spiritual,

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:09.150 align:middle line:84%
and energetically
healing and life

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:12.990 align:middle line:84%
transforming occurrences
happening in the psyche

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:14.100 align:middle line:90%
and in the body.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And we turn towards
those experiences

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.860 align:middle line:84%
instead of using the
medicine to check out

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.990 align:middle line:90%
from those experiences.

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:24.870 align:middle line:84%
>> By creating a healing
intention or a safe space

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:28.590 align:middle line:84%
to enter deeply mystical realms,
circles such as these are

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:31.650 align:middle line:84%
dismantling the negative
stereotypes and calling

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:35.690 align:middle line:84%
in a revival of ancient
ceremonial use of this plant.

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the real big
attraction of cannabis

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:43.640 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of people is that
esoteric element that it brings

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.950 align:middle line:84%
into your daily life of
you're starting to see

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:50.900 align:middle line:84%
the synchronicity and patterns
and all these elements.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:54.200 align:middle line:84%
I've currently writing a book
about the role of cannabis

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.720 align:middle line:84%
in Medieval and Renaissance
magic and alchemy

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:57.710 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And I notice a lot
of references are

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:04.250 align:middle line:84%
based around the use of cannabis
with magic mirrors, right.

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:07.636 align:middle line:84%
And the magic mirrors is kind
of a splitting of consciousness,

00:23:07.636 --> 00:23:08.510 align:middle line:90%
you know what I mean?

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:10.340 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you look in the
mirror, you're schizophrenic.

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.350 align:middle line:84%
There's you in the mirror,
and there's you over here,

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:13.150 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
the use of cannabis

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.110 align:middle line:84%
helps to break that veil
between the subconscious

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:24.110 align:middle line:84%
or the unconscious,
and the conscious mind,

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:27.214 align:middle line:84%
and that when you project your
consciousness into there, then

00:23:27.214 --> 00:23:28.880 align:middle line:84%
you can kind of have
that division where

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.550 align:middle line:84%
you can reach down into
lower aspects, deeper

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:33.980 align:middle line:84%
aspects of your own psyche
that you can't normally

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:37.910 align:middle line:90%
reach in waking consciousness.

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way that
that happens in dreams.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:44.360 align:middle line:84%
So, the one talking to you in
the mirror, the magic mirror,

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.280 align:middle line:84%
is the one telling you
your dream at night

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.610 align:middle line:84%
as well, which is your own
shadow or your subconscious

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:50.620 align:middle line:90%
or your unconscious.

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:54.050 align:middle line:90%


00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>> As cannabis has been
attributed to lifting the veil

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.300 align:middle line:84%
between the conscious
and subconscious mind,

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.900 align:middle line:84%
some believe that the concept
of utilizing time rather than

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:06.530 align:middle line:84%
being a passive and unwitting
victim of its cycles began with

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:08.580 align:middle line:90%
agriculture.

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And as Carl Sagan and
many others suggest,

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:15.020 align:middle line:84%
agriculture likely
started with cannabis.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.020 align:middle line:84%
An example of this lies
in the equatorial region

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.060 align:middle line:90%
of west central Africa.

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>> In regards to
cannabis and time,

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.260 align:middle line:84%
one of the first things
novice users experience is

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.520 align:middle line:90%
a difference in time.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.260 align:middle line:84%
A minute seemed like
an hour, or an hour

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.120 align:middle line:84%
seemed like a minute
type of thing.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Cannabis was
used by the Pygmies,

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.350 align:middle line:10%
and the Pygmies themselves say
that God gave them cannabis

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:35.990 align:middle line:10%
to be healthy and happy,
and that they've been using

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:38.300 align:middle line:10%
cannabis since the dawn of
time, which likely means

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.160 align:middle line:10%
their conception of time.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:44.204 align:middle line:84%
Another Congo tribe that used
cannabis is the Bachilangue.

00:24:44.204 --> 00:24:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And when they began
using it, they

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:47.524 align:middle line:84%
burned all their
cultic fetishes.

00:24:47.524 --> 00:24:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And they started
convincing other tribes

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:52.580 align:middle line:84%
to do this as well, and
they joined together

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:57.170 align:middle line:84%
in a brotherhood of cannabis
called the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:58.520 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah, fascinating role.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not thought to have
come into central Africa

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:05.510 align:middle line:84%
until Medieval Muslim
traders brought it in.

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Not only was cannabis
likely involved in some

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:12.720 align:middle line:84%
tribes' conception of time,
but also medicine, philosophy,

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:16.580 align:middle line:84%
and even mystical experiences
with their tribal lineage.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>> In China, cannabis appears in
the oldest known pharmacopeia,

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.150 align:middle line:84%
the Pen-tsao, put together
by Emperor Shen Nung,

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:26.630 align:middle line:84%
who recommends it for a variety
of medical conditions that is

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:28.280 align:middle line:90%
prescribed for today.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.950 align:middle line:84%
It was also used
by Taoist priests

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.410 align:middle line:84%
for astral traveling
type journeys

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:36.230 align:middle line:90%
to the Land of the Ancestors.

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:39.710 align:middle line:84%
There's a great quatrain
from about 2,500 years ago.

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:44.240 align:middle line:84%
It goes "First a yin then a
yang, no one knows what I do.

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.985 align:middle line:84%
Jade buds and holy hemp for
the one that lives apart."

00:25:46.985 --> 00:25:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of like
life has its ups and downs,

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.460 align:middle line:84%
but you know, with cannabis
I'm able to maintain

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:55.200 align:middle line:90%
that steady road.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>> As cannabis trade likely
occurred along the Silk Road,

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:01.830 align:middle line:84%
it inevitably made
its way into India.

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:05.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Cannabis has an
extensive history in India,

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:08.120 align:middle line:10%
and is still used in
religious rituals there.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.380 align:middle line:84%
Shivaratri, dedicated
to the god Shiva,

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:12.930 align:middle line:84%
cannabis is commonly
consumed in temples.

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:17.580 align:middle line:10%
At the Festival of Colors,
where they throw paint and dyes,

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.880 align:middle line:10%
whole villages are drinking
Bhang, the traditional cannabis

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.230 align:middle line:10%
drink from India.

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:25.110 align:middle line:10%
Cannabis is particularly wound
up with the cult of Shiva.

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:29.010 align:middle line:84%
She was the oldest continually
worshiped god on Earth--

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:33.990 align:middle line:84%
also the god who is said to
have brought yoga to humanity.

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:36.960 align:middle line:10%
And to this day, you could go
along the banks of the Ganges

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.390 align:middle line:10%
and you will witness
sadhus and holy men

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:42.960 align:middle line:10%
partaking of a chillum full of
cannabis in honor of Lord Shiva

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.410 align:middle line:10%
before setting down to
do their Yoga asanas.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:49.860 align:middle line:84%
So cannabis and
yoga go way back.

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.160 align:middle line:10%
>> There's actually a resurgence
of cannabis and yoga today,

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.380 align:middle line:10%
called ganja yoga.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:58.260 align:middle line:10%
As many states in the US
rollback the prohibition

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:01.110 align:middle line:10%
on the versatile and
mind bending plant,

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:04.080 align:middle line:10%
the trend is currently
growing, but many places

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.960 align:middle line:10%
are still on the fence
with cannabis, culturally

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.460 align:middle line:10%
and religiously.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Cannabis in Islam
is very interesting,

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:15.180 align:middle line:84%
because there's not any
sort of specific prohibition

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.710 align:middle line:84%
of cannabis in the Quran,
like there is with alcohol,

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:20.050 align:middle line:84%
so it's been a big
matter of debate.

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:23.730 align:middle line:84%
But it has been used
by mystics of Islam,

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:28.770 align:middle line:84%
such as Sufis and Dervishes
since the very beginnings.

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And generally they
use it-- a lot

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:33.510 align:middle line:84%
of times it'd be for
reciting poetry and playing

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:35.820 align:middle line:84%
music through the evening
and drinking coffee

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:38.620 align:middle line:84%
and using cannabis,
and at other times,

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:42.690 align:middle line:84%
in more powerful preparations,
to obliterate the ego

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:45.660 align:middle line:84%
and get down to the essence
that animates us all.

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:48.190 align:middle line:90%


00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:51.640 align:middle line:10%
>> From Africa to Scythian
tribes commemorating cannabis

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:56.420 align:middle line:10%
with a focus on agriculture
and time, to groups in China,

00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:00.340 align:middle line:10%
India, and sects of Islam using
it for spiritual and mystical

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:05.110 align:middle line:10%
pursuits, why is this versatile
textile crop that can likely

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:09.070 align:middle line:10%
solve deforestation and many
medical ailments seen as such

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:12.920 align:middle line:10%
a devious drug to
modern society?

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Currently, the
prohibition on cannabis

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:18.680 align:middle line:84%
is slowly rolling itself
back, state by state,

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.780 align:middle line:84%
even though the federal
government holds firm

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:23.720 align:middle line:90%
on its prohibitory position.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So, it's a wonderful thing
for me to see what's happened

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:28.180 align:middle line:90%
in Colorado.

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:31.490 align:middle line:84%
I do think Colorado is leading
the world in this area,

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:33.800 align:middle line:84%
in saying no, this is a
fundamental human right

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.194 align:middle line:90%
of adults.

00:28:35.194 --> 00:28:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Adults have a right to make
choices over their own bodies,

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:41.480 align:middle line:84%
they don't have to refer
to the government as to

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.780 align:middle line:90%
whether they can do this or not.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:47.240 align:middle line:10%
It's a very important step in
the re-liberation of mankind

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.560 align:middle line:10%
that is taking place
in states like Colorado

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.560 align:middle line:10%
and the other-- what,
seven or eight states that

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.350 align:middle line:10%
have legalized cannabis
now and more than 23

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:57.830 align:middle line:10%
or 24 where at least cannabis is
available for medical purposes.

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:01.910 align:middle line:84%
This is winding back the war
on drugs, state by state.

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I am deeply inspired by
cannabis and it's important

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:08.930 align:middle line:84%
to think of cannabis as
not just one medicine,

00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:13.010 align:middle line:84%
but many medicines that the
different plants and different

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:17.820 align:middle line:84%
strains have different functions
and capacities for healing.

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that cannabis has
an amazing intelligent effect

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:24.380 align:middle line:84%
to it because of the
healing properties.

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:27.260 align:middle line:84%
When you think about
what cannabis does,

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:30.140 align:middle line:84%
we're wired for this
plant because we

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:33.440 align:middle line:84%
have the same type
of compounds that we

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.900 align:middle line:90%
produce that are in the plant.

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And if we can use
this intelligence

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:42.920 align:middle line:84%
in this plant in
its natural form,

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:48.350 align:middle line:84%
I believe that it's
incredibly healing.

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:50.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And since cannabis
is an adaptogenic herb,

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:54.560 align:middle line:84%
bringing the body into balance,
perhaps its intelligence reads

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and understands genetic and
biological information in order

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.580 align:middle line:84%
to act as a medicine to any and
all that come into contact with

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.360 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps this is why
cannabis has been revered

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:10.200 align:middle line:84%
for longer than any other plant,
side by side with humanity,

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:13.100 align:middle line:84%
through the greatest leaps
in the evolution of the mind,

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.590 align:middle line:90%
technology, and culture.

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And some even believe
that this highly

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:19.910 align:middle line:84%
sought after herb
played a hand in the way

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:23.060 align:middle line:84%
that humans think
and behave today.

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Cannabis, like any
other plant medicine,

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.620 align:middle line:84%
is a substance with
highly potent chemicals

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:31.490 align:middle line:84%
that rapidly alters body
chemistry and thought patterns.

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:34.970 align:middle line:84%
At present, cannabis trends
are changing so rapidly

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:36.950 align:middle line:84%
that only time will
tell how humanity

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:39.950 align:middle line:84%
will respond
psychologically, genetically,

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:42.080 align:middle line:90%
and even spiritually.

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.934 align:middle line:84%
Anything with this power
must be respected and used

00:30:44.934 --> 00:30:46.100 align:middle line:90%
with the wisdom it deserves.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:50.460 align:middle line:90%


00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Up next, join us as we explore
the darker aspects and shadow

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:57.260 align:middle line:90%
side of psychedelic use.

00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:07.394 align:middle line:90%
