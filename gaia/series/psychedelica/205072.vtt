00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Many people who have
psychedelic experiences,

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.090 align:middle line:84%
near-death experiences,
and mystical or out of body

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.470 align:middle line:84%
experiences often report that
sound was a key in the journey.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.260 align:middle line:90%


00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.620 align:middle line:10%
Can the power of sound be
connected with the ability

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.680 align:middle line:10%
to travel between different
worlds and dimensions

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.350 align:middle line:10%
as ancient cultures
once believed?

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.770 align:middle line:10%
>> The music, the
auditory sound,

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.000 align:middle line:10%
and the psychedelic experience
are very closely related.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.560 align:middle line:10%
In February of 2018,
the publication PsyPost

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.810 align:middle line:10%
reported on a new
brain study that

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.800 align:middle line:10%
had been released only
two months earlier.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.760 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Selen Atasoy, computational
neuroscientist at Pompeu Fabra

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.440 align:middle line:10%
University, explored how
the brain communicates

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.430 align:middle line:10%
through harmonic vibrations.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.800 align:middle line:10%
Using a new math-based
method called

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.740 align:middle line:10%
connectome-harmonic
decomposition,

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.470 align:middle line:10%
her team was able to
analyze brain activity

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.390 align:middle line:10%
and observe how LSD
affected consciousness.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.210 align:middle line:84%
With plant medicine
and sound, is it

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.240 align:middle line:84%
possible to reliably
affect our brains

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.050 align:middle line:84%
into harmonics or songs
that loosen our attachment

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.800 align:middle line:90%
to consensus reality?

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.070 align:middle line:10%
One could argue that there's
no form of expression

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.435 align:middle line:10%
as impactful and far reaching
as the ancient art of music.

00:02:11.435 --> 00:02:18.740 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.050 align:middle line:84%
It is found within nearly every
culture on every continent.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.020 align:middle line:84%
It conjures memories
and emotions.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.980 align:middle line:84%
It forms bonds, connecting
people and communities.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.790 align:middle line:90%
It moves us.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.710 align:middle line:84%
We're a highly visual species,
but the ability to hear sound

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.530 align:middle line:90%
is one of our core senses.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.320 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the primary
ways our brain makes sense

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.000 align:middle line:84%
of the world around us, picking
up cues or frequencies even

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.100 align:middle line:90%
on a subconscious level.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Sound and frequency are
fundamental to our perception

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.850 align:middle line:84%
of reality, but
also the building

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.490 align:middle line:90%
blocks of reality itself.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Frequency is a
vibrational state.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.440 align:middle line:10%
It's measured using
hertz, cycles per second.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.130 align:middle line:10%
The music can affect reality
in a very specific way.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.990 align:middle line:10%
We experience it in
a hearing threshold,

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.030 align:middle line:10%
which is between 20
hertz and 20 kilohertz.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.550 align:middle line:84%
It affects us in a
very particular state.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And when we're subjected to it,
it does specific change in us

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.715 align:middle line:84%
whether on the energetic,
physical, mental, emotional,

00:03:30.715 --> 00:03:31.900 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual level.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.740 align:middle line:84%
So there is a form
of entrainment.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Entrainment occurs
when music affects us.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.290 align:middle line:84%
It can be as simple as tapping
your foot or dancing to a beat.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>> This is how acoustics, the
part of physics that deals with

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.520 align:middle line:84%
sound and vibration,
creates reality.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.920 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness
is being affected

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.250 align:middle line:84%
by something outside of us and
actually, just about anything

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.440 align:middle line:84%
that our consciousness
is exposed to.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.395 align:middle line:84%
That's why entrainment is
huge in creating reality.

00:04:02.395 --> 00:04:06.860 align:middle line:90%


00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The human brain is often
described as a computer.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.860 align:middle line:84%
But to better
understand how it works,

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Selen Atasoy
argues that it's

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.130 align:middle line:84%
more like a
multi-scale resonance

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.200 align:middle line:90%
system or an orchestra.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.610 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if the
brain is playing music.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. Selen Atasoy found
that the brain has certain

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.830 align:middle line:10%
harmonics.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.690 align:middle line:10%
And these are in
multiples of nine.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And that created a predictable
state of consciousness.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Some of them greatly
expanded states.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Modern science refers to
the sections of our brain

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.970 align:middle line:10%
responsible for generating our
sense of self as the default

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.790 align:middle line:10%
mode network.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.520 align:middle line:84%
It's where memories
are created and where

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.930 align:middle line:84%
we construct mental models
or simulated realities.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.990 align:middle line:84%
But the default mode
network can operate almost

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.800 align:middle line:84%
like a program or a song
that runs in the brain,

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.900 align:middle line:90%
hindering open-mindedness.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.050 align:middle line:84%
The human brain appears
to consistently fluctuate

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.210 align:middle line:90%
through harmonic frequencies.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.360 align:middle line:10%
However, Dr. Atasoy observed
that the brains of those on LSD

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.560 align:middle line:10%
displayed more complex brain
harmonics, which are associated

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.690 align:middle line:10%
with higher level cognition.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Atasoy's research on
studying people's brains who

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.760 align:middle line:84%
are on LSD, well, first of
all, when people take LSD,

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.490 align:middle line:84%
the brain is lit
with activities.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.490 align:middle line:84%
All the different parts
of each hemisphere

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.830 align:middle line:84%
are interacting with
each other, communicating

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.820 align:middle line:84%
in both hemispheres, are
creating a state of coherence.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.900 align:middle line:10%
>> The research on brain
connectome-harmonics is

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:59.140 align:middle line:10%
fascinating because it's using
fMRI and imagery over time

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:05.170 align:middle line:10%
to map the brain in terms of
harmonics like music and then

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:10.330 align:middle line:10%
allows us to deconstruct what's
happening in the brain down

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.460 align:middle line:10%
to the musical notes.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.600 align:middle line:10%
So we're able to see the
brain in terms of resonance,

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.380 align:middle line:10%
how it's affected by
outside input, what's

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.280 align:middle line:10%
happening in its own
resonant organization within,

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.900 align:middle line:10%
and how it responds to context.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:33.770 align:middle line:90%


00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Musical instruments
naturally resonate at certain

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:42.710 align:middle line:84%
frequencies, changing only when
a musician manipulates a fret,

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.810 align:middle line:90%
key, or reed.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.880 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
the human brain

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.930 align:middle line:90%
works in a similar fashion?

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.900 align:middle line:84%
Atasoy and her
research team concluded

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.610 align:middle line:84%
that internal and
external stimuli,

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.010 align:middle line:84%
such as psychedelics and music,
altered harmonic brain states.

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And these changes
incited the brain

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.270 align:middle line:84%
to reorganize its activity as
if to tune itself to resonate

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.280 align:middle line:90%
with these altered frequencies.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Each brain signature
or song correlates

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.190 align:middle line:84%
to a particular state
of consciousness.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Atasoy's method predicts
states of consciousness

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.980 align:middle line:84%
based on brain
frequency patterns.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:32.100 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the 9th, 18th,
and 27th harmonics in the brain

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.280 align:middle line:84%
are the signatures for
deep sleep and loss

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.520 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.950 align:middle line:84%
There is a
mathematical framework

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:48.110 align:middle line:84%
central to the theories of
heat, light, sound, gravity,

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:52.920 align:middle line:84%
magnetism, and even
fluid dynamics.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:56.220 align:middle line:84%
It can predict animal
patterns, the morphology

00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:00.630 align:middle line:84%
of biological systems,
heat diffusion,

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:05.940 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic behavior,
and quantum mechanics.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.130 align:middle line:84%
It's as if there is
a predictable pattern

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:11.610 align:middle line:84%
inherent in the cosmos,
a kind of harmonic code.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.250 align:middle line:90%


00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.520 align:middle line:84%
In humans, the more
complex the harmonic song

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.540 align:middle line:84%
is, the greater access the
individual has to their brain's

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.970 align:middle line:90%
higher potential.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:27.180 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Atasoy found
psychedelics reliably

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:31.080 align:middle line:90%
give human beings more access.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.289 align:middle line:84%
Why does a psychedelic
compound like LSD

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:37.020 align:middle line:84%
bring consciousness to a
more sophisticated level

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.950 align:middle line:90%
of brain harmonics?

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>> When people take LSD,
both hemispheres are creating

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.190 align:middle line:90%
a state of coherence.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And naturally,
when that happens,

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.160 align:middle line:84%
then the effect of sound and
music would be far greater.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Cymatics in the way the brain
is being exposed to the harmony.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.760 align:middle line:84%
But also we need to be careful
with what kind of harmony

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.250 align:middle line:84%
are we using here, an
equal tempered harmony

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.320 align:middle line:90%
or a nonequal temperament.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.810 align:middle line:84%
Equal temperament
is a system that we

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:10.770 align:middle line:84%
created that quantized the 12
half steps in the octave, which

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.860 align:middle line:84%
means we're no longer following
the blueprint of sound

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.500 align:middle line:90%
that nature gave us.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Ethnomusicologists like
Tannous believe that humans are

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.380 align:middle line:84%
attracted to creating
instruments like singing bowls,

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:31.830 align:middle line:84%
gongs, bells, rattles,
instruments that create

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.580 align:middle line:90%
a buzzing sound.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.320 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.400 align:middle line:84%
To connect with the
harmonies of nature.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Harmonic vibrations are
several compatible vibrations

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:43.800 align:middle line:90%
playing at once.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.490 align:middle line:10%
>> And this is where the
body is recalibrating itself,

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:53.640 align:middle line:10%
reinstating the state of
harmony within the self affected

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:59.310 align:middle line:10%
by the sympathetic resonance of
music with nonequal temperament

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:03.360 align:middle line:10%
impacting the brain and
the connective harmonic.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.880 align:middle line:84%
There's so much to learn
about music and sound.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:11.910 align:middle line:84%
It's so exciting but also
frightening of the enormity

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.460 align:middle line:90%
of how much we still don't know.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.300 align:middle line:90%


00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Imagine walking alone
along a forest trail,

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:24.490 align:middle line:84%
isolated from the noise
pollution of the city.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:27.030 align:middle line:90%


00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.790 align:middle line:90%
Silence.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.670 align:middle line:84%
But as you go further,
you begin to register

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.910 align:middle line:84%

the rustle of leaves in
the wind, the birdsongs,

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.580 align:middle line:90%
and the chattering squirrels.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.570 align:middle line:84%
Nature constantly
generates its own music.

so integral to our healing

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:58.800 align:middle line:10%

and so much more so in moments

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.300 align:middle line:10%
of ceremony.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.070 align:middle line:90%
We regulate to those sounds.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Our nervous systems, especially
our parasympathetic nervous

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.730 align:middle line:84%
systems, are in
balance when we are

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.160 align:middle line:84%
in the presence of all the
different sounds of nature.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.450 align:middle line:90%


00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:19.110 align:middle line:10%

rainforest where Ayahuasca
traditions were developed long

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.130 align:middle line:10%
ago.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:29.360 align:middle line:10%
It should come as no surprise
that jungle noises have always

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:33.620 align:middle line:10%
been an integral part of
the traditional ceremonies.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.490 align:middle line:10%
>> So I find that jungle noises
are impactful if there are

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.580 align:middle line:10%
jungle noises if you're
in that environment.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:44.090 align:middle line:10%
This is an aspect of bringing
the background forward.

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:46.550 align:middle line:90%
Your hearing seems quite acute.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:49.350 align:middle line:84%
Your hearing seems much
more acute than normal.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.890 align:middle line:84%
So you're aware of
these background noises

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:56.660 align:middle line:84%
very much in that
jungle setting.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:01.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Also playing a role in these
ceremonies is the human voice.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>> The song being sung by these
shamans is called an icaro.

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:15.270 align:middle line:84%
These are traditional
songs and chants

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:19.320 align:middle line:90%
used in healing ceremonies.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.295 align:middle line:84%
They originate with
the indigenous tribes

00:12:21.295 --> 00:12:22.095 align:middle line:90%
in the Amazon.

00:12:22.095 --> 00:12:24.840 align:middle line:90%


00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.870 align:middle line:84%
It is believed that they
are direct connection

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:32.040 align:middle line:84%
with the spirits of ancestors,
plants, and animals.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:41.750 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.210 align:middle line:84%
In conjunction with
plant medicine,

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:50.240 align:middle line:84%
this can facilitate healing
and open new realms of reality.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.650 align:middle line:84%
These icaros create a unique
resonance within the song

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:58.340 align:middle line:84%
and within those who are
simply listening to it.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:02.030 align:middle line:10%
>> In the Ayahuasca setting,
the singing of icaros,

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:07.460 align:middle line:10%
the magical songs if you
will, that's also a big part

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:11.120 align:middle line:10%
of the setting component,
because to set up these

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.980 align:middle line:10%
resonances is, I think, very
important to the way that we

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:19.250 align:middle line:10%
process the information.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:23.030 align:middle line:84%
For example, everyone who
has taken Ayahuasca probably

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:28.370 align:middle line:84%
understands that the icaros,
or whatever oral stimulation

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:32.870 align:middle line:84%
you have in the experience,
drives the hallucinations.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.450 align:middle line:90%
It can trigger synesthesia.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:40.760 align:middle line:90%


00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And shamans become
very adept at directing

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:48.750 align:middle line:84%
the experience for the entire
group through the icaros.

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:52.230 align:middle line:84%
So the importance of
the sonic environment,

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.470 align:middle line:84%
the auditory
environment, can't really

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:58.120 align:middle line:90%
be underemphasized at all.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.760 align:middle line:90%
It's very important.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So then there's the
synergy of the two.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.240 align:middle line:84%
There's something about
ingesting the substance.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.620 align:middle line:90%
There's a pharmacology to that.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And yes, that's a
real material thing.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:13.440 align:middle line:10%
But there's also the
person's direct experience

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.020 align:middle line:10%
of the Ayahuasca.

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.000 align:middle line:10%
Somebody who's very
familiar with the culture,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.400 align:middle line:10%
familiar with the energetics
and open that way,

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.340 align:middle line:10%
maybe they can get all
the same from the song.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:24.870 align:middle line:84%
But somebody who's
totally close,

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:27.810 align:middle line:84%
they don't believe in anything,
then you give them Ayahuasca

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:29.070 align:middle line:90%
and then they hear the song.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:30.600 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot different.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:36.120 align:middle line:10%
>> To be able to receive
those songs requires being

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:42.750 align:middle line:10%
in a receptive place and being
in a sacred feminine energy,

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.540 align:middle line:10%
which doesn't have to do
with being a man, or a woman,

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:50.490 align:middle line:10%
or any gender, but simply
being in that place of yin,

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:56.130 align:middle line:10%
of receiving, that we all
need so badly to bring back

00:14:56.130 --> 00:15:01.060 align:middle line:10%
into balance within each
of us and within the world.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>> For some adepts and shamans,
the icaro is an interactive

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:09.913 align:middle line:84%
tool capable of receiving
and sending information.

00:15:09.913 --> 00:15:11.830 align:middle line:10%
>> My particular tradition,
Shipibo tradition,

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:17.890 align:middle line:10%
the icaro is what we use to
look and see with the person.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:21.880 align:middle line:84%
So I'm trying to have visions
about what's wrong with them.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And the song will help that
open up for me, the song I sing.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.510 align:middle line:90%
And I can see more when I sing.

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Something like echolocation,
or sonar, or whatever,

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.565 align:middle line:84%
it's like, I'm pinging
out to the world.

00:15:35.565 --> 00:15:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm interacting
with something over there.

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:43.040 align:middle line:90%


00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Of course, one doesn't need
to participate in one of these

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:51.170 align:middle line:84%
ceremonies to experience the
psychadelic potential created

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:55.450 align:middle line:84%
by the frequencies
of the human voice.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:59.440 align:middle line:84%
One third of the somatosensory
cortex area of the brain

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.380 align:middle line:84%
is fully devoted to
the oral cavity--

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:07.050 align:middle line:90%
tongue, lips, and speech.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:10.410 align:middle line:84%
By speaking,
singing, or chanting,

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:13.860 align:middle line:84%
can we further stimulate
these areas of the brain?

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Using the voice is very
important whether through

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:22.140 align:middle line:10%
singing, vocalization, or
toning because of what it does

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:23.460 align:middle line:10%
to the body.

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.310 align:middle line:84%
When we sing, when we talk,
we experience our voice

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:29.380 align:middle line:84%
in two different ways,
the auditory aspect,

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:31.260 align:middle line:84%
which comes out of
the mouth and bounces

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.380 align:middle line:84%
on the walls and ceilings,
and comes back to our ear.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.710 align:middle line:84%
The second one is through
bone and tissue conduction.

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
why when people

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:43.080 align:middle line:84%
hear their voice on the
recording for the first time,

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.090 align:middle line:84%
they say, oh, this
doesn't sound like me.

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:45.890 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:48.570 align:middle line:84%
That's you through the
auditory sense alone.

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:49.950 align:middle line:90%
And that's how people hear you.

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And you hear your voice through
bone and tissue conduction

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:55.300 align:middle line:90%
40% to 50%.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:17:00.810 align:middle line:84%
So when we are toning and
moaning with lips closed,

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:04.319 align:middle line:84%
we're focusing on the
vibrational aspect traveling

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:07.847 align:middle line:84%
through the lips, the
jaws, the cheeks, the head.

00:17:07.847 --> 00:17:09.930 align:middle line:84%
When we're vocalizing,
there is some sort of that.

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:13.859 align:middle line:84%
It's not as great as the
toning, but that causes

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:15.060 align:middle line:90%
several things to happen.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.609 align:middle line:84%
The entire body
is being vibrated.

00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:20.910 align:middle line:84%
So there's a frequency
that is affecting

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:23.190 align:middle line:84%
the water in our
body, the liquid,

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:26.310 align:middle line:84%
and enhancing the
cymatics effect,

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:30.270 align:middle line:84%
and changing the neurochemistry,
affecting the vagus nerve that

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:33.360 align:middle line:84%
starts at the brainstem
and goes through our neck.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And this, the neck
area is probably

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:38.260 align:middle line:84%
the best area to get the
closest to the vagus nerve.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:39.060 align:middle line:90%


00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.640 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a phenomenon
called cymatics,

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.030 align:middle line:10%
which is where you
have a metal plate,

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:49.710 align:middle line:10%
and you put some powder on it,
and then you hold a tuning fork

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:52.920 align:middle line:10%
or expose it to an
auditory signal.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see how it
organizes itself into patterns.

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:10%
Well, the same thing is
going on in your body.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:05.880 align:middle line:10%
These resonances have
that organizing effect.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>> The vagus nerve extends
through the throat,

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:12.870 align:middle line:84%
between the lungs, and
attaches to every major organ.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Stimulating it sends a
relaxation message to the body.

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:19.050 align:middle line:10%
>> So when we
vocalize and we tone,

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:21.240 align:middle line:10%
we are causing some
sort of massaging.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Also, diaphragmatic
breathwork-- belly breathing,

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.830 align:middle line:90%
what people call--

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:28.590 align:middle line:84%
is some sort of massage
to the vagus nerve that

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:31.770 align:middle line:84%
goes through the diaphragm
that relaxes the body.

important to enhance

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.700 align:middle line:84%
the psychedelic experience,
to bring the awareness inward.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:44.820 align:middle line:90%

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:55.980 align:middle line:10%
sessions with profound
results that seem to mimic

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:59.010 align:middle line:10%
a psychedelic experience.

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:01.770 align:middle line:10%
>> We have many people who
have done psychedelics coming

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:04.350 align:middle line:10%
to holotropic
breathwork sessions.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:08.100 align:middle line:10%
And I do, before the
sessions, relaxation

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.600 align:middle line:10%
before they start
breathing faster.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And there are
always a few people

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.630 align:middle line:84%
who start going before we
even tell them to breathe

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.210 align:middle line:84%
because they have
been holding it down,

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:20.740 align:middle line:90%
sometimes for months or years.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And so we started
experimenting just

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:24.220 align:middle line:90%
with music and the breathing.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And we found out that the
breathing itself with the music

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.790 align:middle line:84%
would take people to
very similar places.

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:33.180 align:middle line:84%
People are reliving birth,

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:37.000 align:middle line:84%
past life experiences,
archetypal experiences.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And I became very
fascinated by how much you

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:42.270 align:middle line:90%
can do with such simple means.

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.160 align:middle line:84%

anything about technology,

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:12.410 align:middle line:84%
it's that humans are quick
to expand the new one's reach

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:16.250 align:middle line:84%
before fully understanding

has begun rolling
out across the world.

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:29.960 align:middle line:84%
China and South Korea
have already adopted it

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.990 align:middle line:84%
in major cities, and
the global rollout

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:37.680 align:middle line:84%
is moving even faster than
most experts predicted.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.260 align:middle line:84%
But could this wave
of new technology

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:43.800 align:middle line:84%
be disruptive to the natural
evolution of consciousness

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:48.730 align:middle line:84%
to higher and more
sophisticated harmonic patterns?

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Concerns over the
disruptive effects

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:57.250 align:middle line:84%
of technology-based frequencies
date back over 100 years.

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:01.480 align:middle line:10%
>> As far back as 1917,
Rudolf Steiner said that

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.420 align:middle line:10%
electromagnetic frequencies
were making it harder for people

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:06.580 align:middle line:10%
to connect to the
spiritual realms.

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:09.430 align:middle line:10%
But he did not say that
we should avoid or reject

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:10.630 align:middle line:10%
the technology.

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:14.530 align:middle line:10%
He said we need to illuminate
the dragon from within.

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:17.590 align:middle line:10%
What this implies is that
these frequencies are

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:20.050 align:middle line:10%
meant to be worked
with and transmuted

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.450 align:middle line:10%
and that they have
a purpose, but we

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:24.340 align:middle line:10%
have to turn them
into something that

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:28.960 align:middle line:10%
is at least non-harmful or
maybe even beneficial to humans.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.090 align:middle line:84%
At this time, they
seem to be accelerating

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:34.350 align:middle line:84%
some of the crisis we
face on the planet.

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:36.770 align:middle line:84%
So this might indicate
that sometimes we

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:42.260 align:middle line:84%
need a kind of crisis to
accelerate a spiritual

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.510 align:middle line:90%
or an evolutionary leap.

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
seems to be happening.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:51.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Can mankind,
using technology,

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:55.010 align:middle line:84%
harness the power of frequencies
to create something more

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:57.350 align:middle line:90%
therapeutic?

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:59.630 align:middle line:84%
The therapeutic
properties of music

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:03.350 align:middle line:84%
have been widely
accepted for many years.

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:06.470 align:middle line:84%
When used in conjunction
with medicinal plants,

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:09.230 align:middle line:84%
could more potential
be unlocked?

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>> We know that the experience
of listening to certain musical

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.820 align:middle line:84%
tracks, certain frequencies,
can help us to expand

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:21.200 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness and
reach mystical states.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.960 align:middle line:84%
We also know that plant
medicines can do this, as well.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And when, in the
right combination,

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.000 align:middle line:84%
these are used
together, they can

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000 align:middle line:84%
be like the golden
key that opens up

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.270 align:middle line:84%
the gateway of our consciousness
to the higher worlds.

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:38.360 align:middle line:10%
>> I feel like when you work
with these psychoactive plants,

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:42.280 align:middle line:10%
the music really
helps you to relax.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.900 align:middle line:84%
It helps you to
let go of the mind.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And it really helps
you to start to lose

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:51.810 align:middle line:90%
your presence of the body.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And so what that does
is that carries you off

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.040 align:middle line:90%
into those other realms.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:00.920 align:middle line:84%
So it really assists in kind of
being the river that you travel

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:04.940 align:middle line:90%
on into the spirit realm.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a difference between
prerecorded music and music

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:11.810 align:middle line:90%
played live during a ceremony?

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Prerecorded music sometimes
has its own intelligence,

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:21.230 align:middle line:84%
and that can be a profoundly
healing experience.

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And I also think there's
something profound

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.720 align:middle line:84%
about an artist
or musician who's

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.060 align:middle line:84%
in the frequency
of the medicine.

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.940 align:middle line:84%
Usually, the
musicians in ceremony

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:33.890 align:middle line:84%
have taken a small
amount of medicine

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:36.530 align:middle line:90%
so that they're tapped in.

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And they're playing
that music that

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:42.860 align:middle line:84%
is really connected to the
group and what the group needs.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:47.220 align:middle line:84%
So I do feel that that has
some incredible power to it,

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:50.720 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't necessarily mean
that recorded music doesn't

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.540 align:middle line:90%
have that potential.

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.570 align:middle line:10%
>> The sounds of
nature align us, also,

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:58.850 align:middle line:10%
to the cycles of nature--

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:04.760 align:middle line:10%
day and night, monthly,
and even to the seasons,

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:08.674 align:middle line:10%
whereas man-made sounds are
always going, going, going,

00:24:08.674 --> 00:24:12.770 align:middle line:10%
going, and do not connect us
to that deep, ancient part

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:14.520 align:middle line:10%
of ourselves.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.370 align:middle line:10%
>> You may have experienced
being at a concert,

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:21.810 align:middle line:10%
and the music is so loud it
comes up through your body.

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:25.920 align:middle line:84%
You can feel it taking over
your natural biorhythms.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And when music is
really fast and it

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:31.050 align:middle line:84%
has a beat that's
faster than your heart,

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:33.550 align:middle line:84%
that can promote
feelings of anxiety.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:36.060 align:middle line:84%
So I like the idea
of using music

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:39.240 align:middle line:84%
that is harmonious
with the human body

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.210 align:middle line:90%
to keep us in a calm state.

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:47.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Through listening to music,
I'm able to mentally take

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:50.790 align:middle line:10%
myself to a place where I never
thought that I could without

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:52.500 align:middle line:10%
being on drugs.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.020 align:middle line:90%
And that's the power of music.

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:56.880 align:middle line:84%
That's something
that I discovered

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.103 align:middle line:90%
doing a sound therapy.

00:24:58.103 --> 00:24:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just like,
man, I'm really

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:03.630 align:middle line:84%
having almost like a psychedelic
experience with just sound.

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And when I did the ayahuasca
here in the icaros,

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:13.533 align:middle line:84%
that in itself was enough to
make me go into a trip alone.

00:25:13.533 --> 00:25:15.450 align:middle line:10%
>> The role of music in
psychedelic experience

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:19.110 align:middle line:10%
and shamans is something to
be taken extremely seriously.

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:21.990 align:middle line:10%
And especially with
this current interest

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:26.730 align:middle line:10%
in Western science and Western
medical system and using these

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:31.320 align:middle line:10%
compounds to help humans
to heal from debilitating

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:35.165 align:middle line:10%
mental, emotional disorders
and diseases because they're

00:25:35.165 --> 00:25:37.290 align:middle line:10%
a state of going out of tune.

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And we've also
seen how much music

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.425 align:middle line:90%
can be a rehabilitative force.

00:25:42.425 --> 00:25:43.800 align:middle line:84%
Take, for example,
music therapy.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.020 align:middle line:90%


00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:49.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Perhaps inspired by
this kind of research,

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:53.380 align:middle line:10%
some engineers are hopeful
that psychedelic states

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.380 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness could
actually be induced using

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.560 align:middle line:10%
frequency-emitting technology.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.560 align:middle line:10%
If it is possible to
synthesize or replicate

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.590 align:middle line:10%
consciousness-expanding
frequencies,

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:09.520 align:middle line:10%
could we also retrofit modern
communication technologies

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:13.720 align:middle line:10%
to emit beneficial, or at
least neutral, frequencies?

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:17.440 align:middle line:10%
>> In our modern era, we've
really gotten away from

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:22.030 align:middle line:10%
the sound frequencies in music
and how those sound frequencies

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:24.370 align:middle line:10%
could be used for healing.

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:26.800 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Egypt,
there were temples

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:31.160 align:middle line:84%
dedicated to sound
and sound therapy.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So when we observe
the monuments,

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:38.890 align:middle line:84%
the archaeological sites,
that the Mayans, the Aztecs,

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:41.560 align:middle line:84%
the Incas, the
ancient Egyptians,

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.380 align:middle line:84%
and many other
civilizations left us,

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:48.400 align:middle line:84%
we realize that these are
buildings that we still now

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:52.420 align:middle line:84%
cannot reproduce them when
it comes to the mathematical

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:56.770 align:middle line:84%
constants that they involve,
to the effect of music that we

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:58.690 align:middle line:90%
experience in the space.

00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:02.400 align:middle line:84%
That means they were
built with sound in mind.

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Could psychedelics be
ancient chemical factories that

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:09.090 align:middle line:84%
stimulate our higher
chakras when consumed?

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Can they help our minds
open to new realities

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.730 align:middle line:90%
that were previously hidden?

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:17.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Plant medicines-- sometimes
combinations of different

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:18.720 align:middle line:10%
plants--

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.330 align:middle line:10%
seem to have an effect
on the human energy

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:24.690 align:middle line:10%
field and the endocrine
system in the human body,

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:27.090 align:middle line:10%
similar to the
alchemists as they

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:30.390 align:middle line:10%
looked at the alembic
of the human body

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:33.570 align:middle line:10%
and the transmutation
of the lead into gold.

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:36.540 align:middle line:84%
This could be seen
as another experience

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:40.680 align:middle line:84%
of a psychedelic awakening
where the right combination

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.410 align:middle line:84%
and intention and
container of the use

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:45.600 align:middle line:84%
of these sacred
sacramentals can help

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.720 align:middle line:84%
to open up the chakras, which
are our endocrine glands,

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.570 align:middle line:84%
and stimulate certain
secretions that

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:54.270 align:middle line:84%
help to facilitate higher
and expanded states

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:55.740 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:27:55.740 --> 00:28:00.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Art indicates and addresses
the invisible realms of our own

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.000 align:middle line:10%
hearts that people can't
see, but then they hear it,

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.640 align:middle line:10%
or what we experience or the
story of our life or the story

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.140 align:middle line:10%
of our ancestors.

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.510 align:middle line:10%
And we hear it in the
song, and it touches us.

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And we learn and we
grow and we emote.

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.630 align:middle line:84%
So I think music
is a sacred thing.

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>> It is my hope that,
at this time in history,

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:22.680 align:middle line:84%
we can remember the power of
music and frequency and these

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.280 align:middle line:84%
