00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:21.740 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Since the dawn
of modern humans,

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.810 align:middle line:84%
every culture in every region
practiced what some would call

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.570 align:middle line:90%
shamanism.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.530 align:middle line:84%
This mystical
practice is scarcely

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.890 align:middle line:90%
understood but not forgotten.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.060 align:middle line:84%
In the 1960s, amateur
ethnomycologist, Gordon Wasson,

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.220 align:middle line:84%
wrote his first
book titled, "Soma--

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Divine Mushroom of
Immortality," after noticing

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.400 align:middle line:84%
the indigenous mushroom
culture in Siberia.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Siberian shamans would collect
the fly agaric or Amanita

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.880 align:middle line:84%
muscaria mushrooms, and
either dried and ate them

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.760 align:middle line:84%
or would feed them to reindeer
and drink the urine to get

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.460 align:middle line:90%
the effects free of nausea.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Because this culture neighbored
ancient Indian culture,

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Wasson surmised that
the Amanita muscaria

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.610 align:middle line:84%
mushroom must be the lost
ingredient of the drink, Soma.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.070 align:middle line:10%
Soma was the sacred and
psychedelic beverage

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.650 align:middle line:10%
of ancient India.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.370 align:middle line:10%
But how could this
mushroom have ended up

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.670 align:middle line:10%
in a foreign
religious sacrament?

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.230 align:middle line:84%
This drove Wasson to
dig deeper to discover

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.020 align:middle line:90%
what shamanism truly is.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.060 align:middle line:10%
>> The term itself came from
the Siberian cultures and was

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.210 align:middle line:10%
brought into English
through Russian and German.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.010 align:middle line:10%
And people started
to recognize it

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.530 align:middle line:10%
as a phenomenon that was found
in many parts of the world

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.860 align:middle line:10%
and started applying it to
Native American practices,

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.680 align:middle line:10%
into Australian practices,
and things like this.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.720 align:middle line:84%
What really is a
shaman kind of depends

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.430 align:middle line:90%
on the perspective we take.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.460 align:middle line:10%
>> So the shaman is like
a spiritual bounty hunter.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:56.260 align:middle line:10%
He or she deliberately
induces these altered states

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.410 align:middle line:10%
with drugs or other means.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.190 align:middle line:84%
But then, they don't just
sit there and have the trip.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.800 align:middle line:84%
They can actually actively
navigate in that world.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.539 align:middle line:10%
>> The shamans have attained
a sufficient sophistication

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.210 align:middle line:10%
to explicitly understand that
the vessel of our chemical

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.470 align:middle line:10%
transformation is the body.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.910 align:middle line:10%
And the plants lift the
imprisoning structures

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.140 align:middle line:10%
of the ego.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And the ego flows
out into the world.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Beyond the confines of
small tribes in Siberia,

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.930 align:middle line:10%
author Gordon Wasson discovered
that larger societies were also

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.230 align:middle line:10%
using psychedelic plants as
a form of societal shamanic

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.860 align:middle line:10%
ritual.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Even in studying
the Hindu culture,

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.540 align:middle line:10%
the Ganges River comes
out of Shiva's top knot.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.370 align:middle line:10%
In very many depictions, you
see a picture of a cannabis leaf

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.170 align:middle line:10%
on top of Shiva's head.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And also, he's holding a vessel
that contains bhang, B-H-A-N-G,

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.750 align:middle line:84%
which is a cannabis-containing
beverage that is flavored with

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.170 align:middle line:84%
cinnamon and cardamom
and other spices.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was also very interested
to learn about the Eleusinian

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.580 align:middle line:90%
Mysteries.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.210 align:middle line:10%
>> The Eleusinian Mysteries
in ancient Greece clearly had

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.650 align:middle line:10%
a psychedelic sacrament.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.870 align:middle line:10%
We even know what it was now.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.360 align:middle line:10%
It a form of ergot
that grows on barley.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Was used in a beverage
called the kykeon

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.690 align:middle line:84%
that initiates of the
Eleusinian Mysteries drank.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And then, they had extraordinary
and life-changing experiences

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.750 align:middle line:90%
in the dark halls.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.570 align:middle line:84%
They were addressing,
setting there as well.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.500 align:middle line:84%
These experiences were
underwent and undergone

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.530 align:middle line:84%
in a place called the
Telesterion, which

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.110 align:middle line:84%
was underground and in
darkness, probably dimly

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.450 align:middle line:84%
lit with little
lamps here and there,

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.080 align:middle line:84%
creating a setting for the
experience to unfold in.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And the initiates of the
Eleusinian Mysteries,

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.660 align:middle line:84%
who included people like
Plato, people like Socrates,

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.100 align:middle line:84%
people like Cicero, came
out, and afterwards,

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.850 align:middle line:84%
reported that their
lives had been utterly

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.920 align:middle line:84%
transformed by the experience
that they had undergone.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.840 align:middle line:84%
They had lost their
fear of death.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.910 align:middle line:84%
They knew that they
were immortal spirits,

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.640 align:middle line:84%
that they were just temporarily
housed in a human body.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>> From ancient India to Greece,
psychedelic plants have been

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.290 align:middle line:84%
used for deeply spiritual
quests and large-scale healing.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.690 align:middle line:84%
But what was the first
well-organized psychedelic

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:28.890 align:middle line:90%
society?

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.100 align:middle line:10%
Scholars and historians had
all but given up on uncovering

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.960 align:middle line:10%
the mysterious beginnings of the
shamanic society, when in 1976,

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.080 align:middle line:10%
Soviet archaeologist
Viktor Sarianidi unearthed

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.050 align:middle line:10%
the 4,000-year-old temple
complex in present day

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.370 align:middle line:10%
Turkmenistan.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.090 align:middle line:84%
This complex is nearly a
half a million square meters

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.930 align:middle line:84%
divided into a large northern
and smaller southern region.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Its walls, made of clay
bricks, span 120 by 150 meters

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.600 align:middle line:84%
and were reinforced by
20 rectangular towers.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.040 align:middle line:84%
Roughly 6500 to 1700
BC, the northern region

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.400 align:middle line:84%
was burned down, and the whole
complex was abandoned quickly,

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.500 align:middle line:84%
leaving the mystery
of its origins

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.870 align:middle line:84%
only with the
artifacts found there.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Author and researcher
Chris Bennett

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.280 align:middle line:84%
spent years investigating
the spread of cannabis

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.460 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient world and began
piecing the puzzle together

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.620 align:middle line:90%
from this location.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.090 align:middle line:10%
>> The debate about Soma and
Haoma, the origins of them,

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.280 align:middle line:10%
has changed lately because
of archaeological finds.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.260 align:middle line:10%
And one of the
really important ones

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.250 align:middle line:10%
is the work of the Russian
archaeologist Viktor Sarianidi.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.680 align:middle line:84%
He wrote about this
in his book, "Margiana

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.870 align:middle line:90%
and Protozoroastrism."

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And Sarianidi he was doing
work in the outer regions

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.130 align:middle line:84%
of Afghanistan, in an area
known as the Bactria-Margiana

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.110 align:middle line:90%
Archaeological Complex.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And in this region, he found
a number of temple sites,

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.960 align:middle line:84%
and these were big temples,
about the size of a football

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.800 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And half of the
temple sites were

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.350 align:middle line:84%
dedicated to the preparation of
this beverage, which Sarianidi

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.380 align:middle line:84%
has identified as Soma,
Haoma, the sacred beverage

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.200 align:middle line:84%
of the Persians and the
Indians-- ancient Indians.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>> It is still debated whether
this lost city of Gonur Tepe

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.090 align:middle line:84%
had a supreme ruler or simply
an elite class and high priest.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.210 align:middle line:84%
In many ways, the priests
of larger civilizations

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.470 align:middle line:84%
mirrored the role of the
predecessor, the shaman.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So, the shaman in the
traditional role is basically

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:32.370 align:middle line:84%
a liaison for the community to
this realm of the supernatural

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.940 align:middle line:90%
and these supernatural forces.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:41.580 align:middle line:84%
So, in that sense, it's kind
of a priest-like function.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>> At Gonur Tepe, the high
priest was the gatekeeper

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.160 align:middle line:84%
to spiritual and
psychedelic experiences.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.080 align:middle line:84%
The psychedelic trip
has been equated

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.540 align:middle line:84%
to a mystical
experience, as it allows

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.870 align:middle line:84%
the user to peek behind the
veil of cultural conditioning.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And the high priest was the
one that bestowed these vision

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.610 align:middle line:90%
quests upon the people.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.590 align:middle line:10%
Only through his
approval were commoners

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.690 align:middle line:10%
allowed to drink this sacrament.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.690 align:middle line:10%
Gordon Wasson claimed that
the Amanita muscaria mushroom

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.110 align:middle line:10%
was the psychoactive
ingredient in Soma and Haoma

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.810 align:middle line:10%
because of the mushroom's
common use in nearby areas.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.550 align:middle line:84%
But this claim is unproven, and
some believe quite implausible,

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.620 align:middle line:84%
due to the kind of experience
these mushrooms elicit.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Amanita muscaria
mushrooms have been

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:27.210 align:middle line:84%
known to cause euphoria but
also nausea, sweating, cramping,

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.650 align:middle line:90%
and salivation.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.380 align:middle line:84%
So, the mystery has
continued through the ages,

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.720 align:middle line:84%
until Victor Sarianidi sent
scraping samples from Gonur

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.900 align:middle line:90%
Tepe out to be analyzed.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Based on archaeological
evidence that's recently come

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.730 align:middle line:84%
up in the last decades, they
found big bowls in the ground

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:47.820 align:middle line:84%
where the Soma would have
been ground with mortars

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.720 align:middle line:84%
and pestles, and then
also straining devices,

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.600 align:middle line:84%
as well as bowls, with
fossilized remnants in it.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And so they took some of these
fossilized remnants, which

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:02.760 align:middle line:84%
was like a fossilized liquid
substance, and had it tested.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And they found evidence
of cannabis, ephedra,

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.010 align:middle line:90%
and in some cases, poppy.

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And all these plants grow in
this region as well, still.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Poppy is the base
ingredient for opium,

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:16.950 align:middle line:84%
which elicits a sedative and
euphoric effect, while ephedra,

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.080 align:middle line:84%
the basic ingredient
for amphetamines,

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.600 align:middle line:84%
is a stimulant and
appetite suppressant.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And lastly, cannabis elicits
a slightly psychedelic effect

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.020 align:middle line:84%
with an increase in appetite,
causing this beverage

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.140 align:middle line:84%
to act as a symphony of
mind-altering ingredients

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:34.530 align:middle line:84%
for these ancient
Indo-European cultures.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.289 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's interesting it has
his counterpart in the Avestan

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:40.559 align:middle line:84%
religion over in Persia,
where it's known as Haoma.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Because of language similarities
and mythological similarities--

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:47.070 align:middle line:84%
they're both
Indo-European languages--

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:52.470 align:middle line:84%
this combined use and identity
indicates a much older origin

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:56.010 align:middle line:84%
from an identical call, so
going considerably far back

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:56.820 align:middle line:90%
into history.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.910 align:middle line:84%
We know that they were
involved in trades

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.560 align:middle line:84%
with another
Indo-European culture

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.190 align:middle line:84%
living in central China,
known as the Gushi Culture.

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And we found numbers of
perfectly preserved specimens

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.280 align:middle line:84%
of both cannabis and
ephedra at this site.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's likely that these
Indo-Europeans living in China,

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.370 align:middle line:84%
who were exporting
cannabis, were

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:24.210 align:middle line:84%
likely the suppliers of the
Bactria-Margiana Archaeological

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Complex's use of it and
delivered by Scythians.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.180 align:middle line:10%
My view is that the
Chinese term for cannabis,

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.510 align:middle line:10%
which is [NON-ENGLISH],,
traveled with cannabis

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:37.200 align:middle line:10%
into the Bactria-Margiana
Archaeological Complex with

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.830 align:middle line:10%
this name that became Haoma
and then through dialectical

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.610 align:middle line:10%
changes as it reached into
India became Soma in the Vedic

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:45.870 align:middle line:10%
language.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Along several
ancient trading routes,

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:51.810 align:middle line:84%
the nomadic horseback Scythians
had burial kurgans that were

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.030 align:middle line:90%
recently unearthed.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:55.950 align:middle line:84%
Not only were
golden vessels found

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:58.470 align:middle line:84%
containing remnants
of cannabis and opium,

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:02.130 align:middle line:84%
but the frozen tundra preserved
the tattoos on their skin,

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.800 align:middle line:84%
depicting animals
warping and spiraling,

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.440 align:middle line:84%
as if seen in a
psychedelic trance.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Ancient Greek
historian Herodotus

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.180 align:middle line:84%
recorded the funerary
rites of the Scythians

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.480 align:middle line:84%
as they built tripod tents
and fumigated cannabis seeds

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.620 align:middle line:90%
inside.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.540 align:middle line:84%
But this wasn't the
only place in history

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.960 align:middle line:84%
we see the use of a tent
with smoke and vapor.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.250 align:middle line:10%
>> There is a
Polish entomologist

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:28.440 align:middle line:10%
and anthropologist, Sula Benet,
who suggested that this Hebrew

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.290 align:middle line:10%
term, [? canabasin ?] was a
reference to cannabis and that

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:36.090 align:middle line:10%
this reference appears for the
first time in the Exodus 30.23,

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:37.520 align:middle line:10%
where God who--

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.150 align:middle line:10%
appears to Moses
in flames of fire

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.010 align:middle line:10%
from within a burning
bush, commands

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.350 align:middle line:10%
Moses to make a
holy anointing oil.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.510 align:middle line:10%
And every time that Moses
has to speak the Lord,

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.800 align:middle line:10%
he has to go inside
this enclosed tent--

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.790 align:middle line:10%
a little area called "the
tent of the meeting."

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And he covers
himself in this oil.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And he also places some of the
oil on the altar of incense.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And he speaks to the Lord
and the pillar of smoke

00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.987 align:middle line:90%
over the altar of incense.

00:10:59.987 --> 00:11:02.070 align:middle line:84%
None of the other Israelites
in the biblical story

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:03.153 align:middle line:90%
ever see or hear the Lord.

00:11:03.153 --> 00:11:06.180 align:middle line:84%
They can only tell if Moses
is talking to the Lord

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.760 align:middle line:84%
if smoke is pouring out of
the tent of the meeting.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Moses is believed by
historians to have lived

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.110 align:middle line:84%
in the 16th century BC, just
after the period of Gonur Tepe

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.510 align:middle line:84%
and connected to the
same trade routes.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.390 align:middle line:10%
The phenomena of inhaling
mind-altering substances

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.730 align:middle line:10%
in order to speak
to divine sources

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.310 align:middle line:10%
are also seen with
the Oracle of Delphi,

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:27.840 align:middle line:10%
which ranged from
the eighth century

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.650 align:middle line:10%
BC and possibly earlier, in
the late Mycenaean times.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:34.020 align:middle line:10%
The scholar Martin
Litchfield West

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.090 align:middle line:10%
wrote that the
Pythia, or Oracle,

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:39.900 align:middle line:10%
exhibited Central Asian shamanic
practices, as she reportedly

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:44.220 align:middle line:10%
sat upon a tripod above a chasm
from which vapors poured forth

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.560 align:middle line:10%
as she inhaled them
and prophesized.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.930 align:middle line:84%
If it is true that these
age-old stories show

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:52.110 align:middle line:84%
a deep appreciation for
mind-altering plants,

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:54.750 align:middle line:84%
how much farther back can
we trace shamanic traditions

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.880 align:middle line:90%
into history?

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:01.020 align:middle line:84%
>> That evidence, we first
encounter it in the painted

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:07.080 align:middle line:84%
caves of upper-Paleolithic
Europe going back close

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.150 align:middle line:90%
to 40,000 years ago.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And curiously enough, just
quite recently in Indonesia was

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.270 align:middle line:84%
discovered a series
of painted caves,

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:21.930 align:middle line:84%
which date back to more or
less exactly the same period,

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:26.220 align:middle line:84%
the high 30,000s almost
40,000 years ago in the past.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:31.230 align:middle line:84%
There are certain types
of imagery that regularly

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.500 align:middle line:84%
and routinely crop up
in those deeply altered

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.950 align:middle line:84%
states of consciousness
brought on by psychedelics.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's precisely those
types of the imagery

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.160 align:middle line:84%
that we find in the
ancient rock and cave art

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.530 align:middle line:90%
all around the world.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:50.900 align:middle line:84%
You'll often find geometry in
the paintings or engravings.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.580 align:middle line:84%
You will find-- and
this is really quite

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.670 align:middle line:84%
diagnostic-- you will find
creatures that are referred

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.470 align:middle line:90%
to as therianthropes.

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.980 align:middle line:10%
That's from the Greek therian,
which means wild beast,

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.780 align:middle line:10%
and anthropos, which means man.

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:07.100 align:middle line:10%
They're hybrid human
and animal figures.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Not only were these visionary
illustrations important enough

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.910 align:middle line:10%
to appear in humanity's earliest
art in the painted caves,

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:16.550 align:middle line:10%
but they were also
immortalized in the flesh,

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:19.730 align:middle line:10%
as the therianthropic paintings
on the cave walls conjure

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:23.510 align:middle line:10%
similar imagery to that
of the Scythian tattoos.

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:25.640 align:middle line:84%
There are remnants
of shamanic practices

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.070 align:middle line:90%
in every corner of the globe.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Might we also find references
to psychedelics in the creation

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.750 align:middle line:90%
myth of the Bible?

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>> If you look at the
imagery that is conjured up

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.730 align:middle line:84%
of the serpent in
the Garden of Eden--

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:41.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not saying that
painters in the 14th century

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.670 align:middle line:84%
actually saw the serpent
in the Garden of Eden.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.211 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
the imagery that's

00:13:45.211 --> 00:13:47.840 align:middle line:90%
conjured up, very often--

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.610 align:middle line:84%
actually, I would say about
eight times out of 10,

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:53.295 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that that
serpent is a therianthrope,

00:13:53.295 --> 00:13:57.540 align:middle line:84%
that that serpent has a
serpent body and a human head,

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.340 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.006 align:middle line:84%
Or it may be equipped
with arms and legs

00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:03.870 align:middle line:84%
off-- branching off that
serpent body in some cases.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.866 align:middle line:84%
So right there,
there's a suggestion

00:14:05.866 --> 00:14:07.990 align:middle line:84%
that we're dealing with a
classic entity of vision.

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:11.600 align:middle line:84%
In the mainstream
Christian position

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.490 align:middle line:84%
on the serpent in
the Garden of Eden,

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:17.180 align:middle line:84%
is that it represents the
devil, the bad guy who's

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:20.480 align:middle line:84%
come to tempt and
mislead Adam and Eve.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.120 align:middle line:84%
But the very powerful
alternative point

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.640 align:middle line:84%
of view provided
by the Gnostics is

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:29.090 align:middle line:84%
that the serpent was one of the
ancient teachers of mankind,

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:32.180 align:middle line:84%
that he's coming to
say to Adam and Eve,

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:35.300 align:middle line:84%
you need to learn the difference
between good and evil.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.560 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to
the book of Genesis,

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.090 align:middle line:84%
the forbidden fruit is the
knowledge of good and evil.

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:43.970 align:middle line:84%
That's what the-- that's
what that tree is.

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:46.190 align:middle line:10%
It's the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:48.309 align:middle line:10%
And its fruit is
therefore- is therefore

00:14:48.309 --> 00:14:49.600 align:middle line:10%
the knowledge of good and evil.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.980 align:middle line:84%
But is there a
deeper layer to that?

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Could we, indeed, be
talking about some kind

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.880 align:middle line:90%
of natural psychedelic?

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>> What would it mean to
discover that the forbidden

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.550 align:middle line:84%
fruit that the parents of our
species ate was psychedelic

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.170 align:middle line:90%
in nature?

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.940 align:middle line:10%
And is it possible
that this fruit

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:09.340 align:middle line:10%
initiated the rapid expansion
of the human neocortex?

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's an interesting
set of findings about how

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.620 align:middle line:84%
humans differ from our
chimpanzee relatives in terms

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:19.470 align:middle line:84%
of the use of these psychedelics
and what happens in the body.

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:22.910 align:middle line:84%
The human serotonergic
system is much more sensitive

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:24.380 align:middle line:90%
to these substances.

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.190 align:middle line:84%
The binding of the
serotonin neural receptors

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:31.830 align:middle line:84%
with the psychedelics is two
to four times more powerful

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.160 align:middle line:84%
that what happens
in chimpanzees.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>> John McPartlin
and Dr. Jeffrey Guy,

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.640 align:middle line:84%
the founder of GW
pharmaceuticals,

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:45.470 align:middle line:84%
they both have speculated that
cannabis may have played a role

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:50.420 align:middle line:84%
in this time period, that
the psychoactive effects

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:55.250 align:middle line:84%
of cannabis may have resulted
in new novel ways of thinking

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:57.260 align:middle line:90%
and approaching problems.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And the creativity aspect may
have provided that element

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:04.760 align:middle line:90%
for the great leap forward.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Another theory, popularized
by the McKenna brothers,

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.400 align:middle line:84%
was the potential for
coprophilic spores or rather

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.250 align:middle line:84%
manure-loving mushroom
species, like psilocybin,

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:17.110 align:middle line:84%
as being the impetus for
humanity's great leap forward.

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Cattle worship is seen
throughout ancient Egypt,

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Greece, Israel, Rome, Germany,
and is seen in Jainism,

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:29.230 align:middle line:90%
Hinduism, and Zoroastrianism.

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:31.360 align:middle line:10%
Our ancient ancestors,
seeking food

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.420 align:middle line:10%
in the plains and grasslands,
would have eventually found

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.760 align:middle line:10%
the cattle that
grazed in the fields

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.440 align:middle line:10%
and noticed a
strange mushroom that

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.660 align:middle line:10%
grew from their
droppings that influenced

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.170 align:middle line:10%
the lingual and problem-solving
regions of the brain.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.180 align:middle line:84%
Were cannabis and
psychedelic mushrooms

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.850 align:middle line:84%
possible causes for
such drastic differences

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:52.990 align:middle line:84%
in intelligence between modern
humans and our ancestors?

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.510 align:middle line:84%
How much of our modern
society has been influenced

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:57.640 align:middle line:90%
by our shamanic roots?

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Really, out of shamanism come
the roots of religion for sure,

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:03.550 align:middle line:90%
pharmacology.

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:07.690 align:middle line:84%
But chemistry and poetry and
theater and all of these things

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:10.810 align:middle line:84%
really find their
roots in shamanism.

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a certain point
when religion doesn't want

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:15.319 align:middle line:90%
the shamanism in there anymore.

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:18.760 align:middle line:84%
That's really where we see the
decline of the shamanic use

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.670 align:middle line:84%
of these substances,
as religions become

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:24.715 align:middle line:84%
more politically motivated as
a means of controlling society

00:17:24.715 --> 00:17:26.770 align:middle line:90%
and organizing society.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:30.610 align:middle line:84%
There became, I think, both
a theological and political

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:35.860 align:middle line:84%
desire to unify the people under
one consolidated head and rule.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>> As religious institutions
and political leaders began

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.280 align:middle line:84%
combining their powers, as we
see mirrored in major corporate

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:46.460 align:middle line:84%
mergers today, the momentum
was to keep spreading.

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:49.240 align:middle line:10%
And at the start of what
we call the Modern period,

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:53.020 align:middle line:10%
European nations began sending
forces to the Americas.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, indigenous
tribes were decimated,

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.720 align:middle line:84%
and countless generations
of shamanic wisdom

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.880 align:middle line:90%
was erased from the Earth.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.710 align:middle line:90%
Was there an agenda?

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:06.280 align:middle line:90%
If so, what was the purpose?

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I do believe that there
are many forces that see

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:13.240 align:middle line:84%
the psychedelic
movement as a threat.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.880 align:middle line:90%
And it's its vast.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.700 align:middle line:84%
In earlier times, it might
have been the church.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.850 align:middle line:84%
But I also see
that it's a threat

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:24.070 align:middle line:90%
to the pharmaceutical industry.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Big pharma imported $86
billion in drugs and exported

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:32.650 align:middle line:90%
$47 billion worth in 2015 alone.

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:35.680 align:middle line:84%
The power of this industry
and its advertising sector

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.360 align:middle line:84%
has forced the
world of shamanism

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.150 align:middle line:84%
beneath the shadow
of Western medicine.

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:43.120 align:middle line:84%
But what truly is the
difference between the two?

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>> In shamanism, when
you have sickness,

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:51.640 align:middle line:84%
when you have an ill
individual for any reason,

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.220 align:middle line:84%
you don't do what Western
medicine does and look

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:57.850 align:middle line:84%
for the causes of that illness
at the level of the physical

00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:58.690 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:02.260 align:middle line:84%
The causes of that illness
are always one level above.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.510 align:middle line:84%
They're at the next level,
in the spiritual dimension.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:07.830 align:middle line:84%
There's a spiritual
disconnect which

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.080 align:middle line:90%
is the source of this illness.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.290 align:middle line:10%
So, the shaman will address
the spiritual problem,

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:15.340 align:middle line:10%
the nonphysical problem in
order to step down and solve

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:16.510 align:middle line:10%
the physical problem.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.060 align:middle line:84%
In Western medicine, we
have no such concept.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:20.860 align:middle line:84%
Because Western
medicine doesn't even

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.780 align:middle line:84%
believe in the
spirit or the soul

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.610 align:middle line:84%
or any such aspect
of human beings.

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Western medicine really does
regard human beings as rather

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:31.900 align:middle line:84%
clever and sophisticated
meat robots.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:32.970 align:middle line:90%
But that is not--

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:35.680 align:middle line:84%
that is not the
shamanistic view.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.310 align:middle line:84%
The shamanistic view is that we
are immersed in an incredibly

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:42.780 align:middle line:84%
complex multi-layered
reality and that--

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:45.370 align:middle line:84%
and that what is happening at
other levels of that reality

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:47.950 align:middle line:84%
directly impact what happens
at the level of reality

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:49.120 align:middle line:90%
that we inhabit.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.940 align:middle line:10%
>> This perspective on the
nature of healing is summarized

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.700 align:middle line:10%
by radio host and
filmmaker Max Igan,

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.640 align:middle line:10%
who has spent years traveling
the world to visit shamanic

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.340 align:middle line:10%
tribes to preserve their wisdom.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:04.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Shamanism, it can be seen as
something integral to the human

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:05.490 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:08.230 align:middle line:10%
I'm a firm believer that all
life progresses according

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:09.424 align:middle line:10%
to the Fibonacci sequence.

00:20:09.424 --> 00:20:10.840 align:middle line:10%
If you look at
Fibonacci sequence,

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.960 align:middle line:10%
how that sequence works is
you actually get the present,

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.750 align:middle line:10%
and you combine it with the
past to create the future.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:18.020 align:middle line:90%
That's how it works.

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:19.480 align:middle line:84%
If we can get our
present culture

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.400 align:middle line:84%
and combine it with
these past ways,

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.540 align:middle line:90%
we will create a viable future.

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.570 align:middle line:84%
But if we discard all of
that ancient knowledge

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:28.490 align:middle line:84%
and simply go with our
technological flow,

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:31.120 align:middle line:84%
we're going to lead ourselves
to a very bad place.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>> A few modern healers,
such as Kimba Arem,

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:36.760 align:middle line:84%
utilize ancestral and modern
techniques in her alternative

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.260 align:middle line:90%
practices.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And her experience
has taught her

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:41.620 align:middle line:84%
where the healing
intelligence truly

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.590 align:middle line:84%
lies in terms of
shamanic ceremonies.

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:46.990 align:middle line:10%
>> And I actually see that
rather than the shaman is

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:51.970 align:middle line:10%
healing them, that the shaman
is activating that person's own

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:53.980 align:middle line:10%
inner healing ability.

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Because that's really
the true power,

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:59.200 align:middle line:84%
is reminding people that
they, too, are the divine.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.130 align:middle line:90%
We're the healer.

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Like if you cut your finger,
you're the one who heals it.

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:08.140 align:middle line:84%
The doctor or the shaman
can help address the wound.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.570 align:middle line:84%
But we're actually
doing the healing work.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Perhaps it is the adoption of
unhealthy patterns that builds

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.950 align:middle line:84%
and obstructs the pure healing
intelligence within each of us.

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:20.380 align:middle line:10%
So if we look beyond
the cultural adornments

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.950 align:middle line:10%
and poetic language, might we
find a more scientific basis

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.500 align:middle line:10%
to shamanic rituals?

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:30.110 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that they
did was use ritual practices,

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:32.590 align:middle line:84%
including chanting and
singing and drumming,

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:34.910 align:middle line:84%
that begin to change
our brain wave pattern.

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:38.290 align:middle line:84%
The alteration of consciousness
in the shamanic ritual

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:40.450 align:middle line:84%
starts off with a
stimulatory phase--

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:43.060 align:middle line:84%
dancing, drumming,
singing, chanting--

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:46.250 align:middle line:84%
to the point of exhaustion
and to the relaxation phase.

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is a shift
from stimulating

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:51.240 align:middle line:84%
the sympathetic nervous system
to the parasympathetic nervous

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.040 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.770 align:middle line:84%
The parasympathetic
nervous system

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:56.500 align:middle line:84%
is the part of the nervous
system that relaxes us.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And so basically, the
relaxation response

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:02.830 align:middle line:84%
is part of what's brought
about by ritual activities.

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:05.960 align:middle line:10%
>> American-based psychoanalyst
Wilhelm Reich mentioned

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:09.010 align:middle line:10%
a similar pattern when he
spoke about the four stages

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:12.220 align:middle line:10%
of a primal pattern that
healthy cultures share--

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:17.070 align:middle line:10%
tension, charge,
discharge, and relaxation.

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:19.210 align:middle line:84%
It is seen in the
movement of many forms

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:23.380 align:middle line:84%
of classical and modern music,
all forms of storytelling,

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.380 align:middle line:84%
love-making, as well
as healing catalysts.

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.570 align:middle line:84%
Even though the content
on top of this pattern

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:31.270 align:middle line:84%
will always change,
the underlying flow

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:34.480 align:middle line:84%
is what establishes a space
for a healing response.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Something must dredge
up the traumatized

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:39.880 align:middle line:84%
psychological material from
the unconscious, which would be

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.830 align:middle line:90%
during the stimulatory phase.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.920 align:middle line:84%
The contents must be
processed, breathed through,

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.520 align:middle line:84%
and exacerbated in order to
bring about a critical point

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:52.130 align:middle line:84%
when the psyche transforms
the way it holds that content.

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Finally, the discharge
is a pivot point in which

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:56.590 align:middle line:90%
breakthroughs are made--

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:59.710 align:middle line:84%
not by the shaman, but by the
natural healing intelligence

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.900 align:middle line:84%
of the one who is
seeking the remedy.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.240 align:middle line:84%
This leads to the
relaxation phase,

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.780 align:middle line:84%
which allows a new unhealthy
pattern to integrate.

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:11.680 align:middle line:84%
This is the same as what's seen
in the Savasana stage of yoga.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.680 align:middle line:84%
What other shamanic anomalies
may have a physiological

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:15.820 align:middle line:90%
and neurological basis?

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:20.257 align:middle line:90%


00:23:20.257 --> 00:23:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>> It Is by agreement there's
a marker at the beginning

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:25.550 align:middle line:90%
and at the end.

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:27.650 align:middle line:84%
You invoke the
spirit at the end.

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:31.250 align:middle line:10%
You thank the spirits and
each other at the end.

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:36.110 align:middle line:10%
And you move into ordinary
time-- ordinary space time.

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:38.520 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
significance of ritual.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:42.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a fantastic-- to
do it in the right way,

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.460 align:middle line:84%
it opens up fantastic
possibility.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Because then,
[INAUDIBLE] feel safe.

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:49.760 align:middle line:84%
For example, if
you're in a ritual

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.989 align:middle line:84%
and you're exploring
something and you--

00:23:52.989 --> 00:23:55.280 align:middle line:84%
say psychologically you're
working on your relationship

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.920 align:middle line:84%
with your mother or your
father or traumatic things,

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.850 align:middle line:84%
and people are laughing
back in the dining area,

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:06.450 align:middle line:84%
cracking jokes, and
drinking whatever-- beer--

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:08.680 align:middle line:90%
what's that gonna be like?

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:12.222 align:middle line:90%
It's not respectful of people.

00:24:12.222 --> 00:24:14.680 align:middle line:84%
It's like trying to do therapy
in the middle of the subway.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:19.640 align:middle line:90%


00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>> It is likely that
in traditional shamanic

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:24.710 align:middle line:84%
communities, the whole
group was not only involved

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:28.290 align:middle line:84%
in the ceremony, but they all
had similar belief systems,

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:30.800 align:middle line:84%
allowing all of them to be
more rooted in the customs

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.990 align:middle line:90%
of their ritual.

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:36.140 align:middle line:10%
If one person was
experiencing a healing crisis,

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:37.910 align:middle line:10%
the rest of the group
was likely holding

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:40.610 align:middle line:10%
space for their healing,
rather than distracting them

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:43.280 align:middle line:10%
with unnecessary
noise or movement.

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.290 align:middle line:84%
If they understood
the basic criteria

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:48.950 align:middle line:84%
for psychological healing, are
there other shamanic anomalies

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:52.790 align:middle line:84%
that may have a physiological
or neurological basis?

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:56.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Shamanism has certain
characteristics that are pretty

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:57.850 align:middle line:90%
much universal.

00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:02.060 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of what the shaman
does is retrieve souls--

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:05.840 align:middle line:84%
illness-- mental and physical
illness in these cultures

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.510 align:middle line:84%
is often understood
as a loss of souls.

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:11.900 align:middle line:84%
The idea of the shaman
is a soul traveler

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:15.650 align:middle line:84%
will often go to
what's conceived

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:19.580 align:middle line:84%
as the center of the
universe, the world tree.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a well-known
phenomenon of the out-of-body

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.150 align:middle line:84%
experience, or
astral projection.

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, what we know is that
there is a particular part

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:30.060 align:middle line:84%
of the brain that's supposed
to integrate our sense of self

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.630 align:middle line:84%
with our body, the
temporal parietal junction.

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And when this part of the
brain is taken offline,

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:39.330 align:middle line:84%
then we're able to
experience ourselves

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:41.490 align:middle line:90%
independent of our body.

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:44.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Does this mean that the
shaman simply convinces his

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:48.480 align:middle line:10%
or her own brain that the
mind and body are separating?

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And if so, does that mean
that it's just a mirage?

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Or is belief, imagination,
and creativity

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.310 align:middle line:84%
the physical mechanisms by
which an aspect of the shaman

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:01.770 align:middle line:84%
leaves his or her
body to perform work

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:03.254 align:middle line:90%
in other dimensions?

00:26:03.254 --> 00:26:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps this is the
underlying knowledge

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:08.770 align:middle line:84%
that shamans utilized when
crafting a healing environment.

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:10.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Shamans become healers.

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:12.310 align:middle line:90%
They become good artists.

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:16.380 align:middle line:10%
They can design
their own rituals.

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.170 align:middle line:84%
They create their
own music and so on.

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Again, what makes
the shaman a shaman

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:25.950 align:middle line:84%
is that he or she had
a substantial number

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:29.510 align:middle line:90%
of personal experiences.

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:33.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Through lifetimes of
shamanic experiences,

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:39.160 align:middle line:10%
bringing wisdom from the other
side to this physical world,

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.410 align:middle line:10%
could this be the basis
of all shamanic rituals?

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:45.040 align:middle line:90%


00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.010 align:middle line:10%
What would the shamans
of today look like?

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:50.110 align:middle line:10%
Would they still be
wearing the same clothes

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:52.360 align:middle line:10%
and singing the same
songs, or would they

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.540 align:middle line:10%
be doing brand new work
with the same spirit,

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:57.970 align:middle line:10%
joining hearts and hands
in ancestral twine,

00:26:57.970 --> 00:26:59.860 align:middle line:10%
as Xavier Rudd would say?

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And if shamans of the
past did healing work

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.230 align:middle line:84%
for their village, what
would a modern shaman

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:08.920 align:middle line:84%
truly use to get their music
and their message to the people?

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.860 align:middle line:84%
If this shamanic power
is still present today,

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:13.960 align:middle line:84%
it would be present
within all of us,

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.760 align:middle line:84%
and the real tragedy
from there would

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:18.100 align:middle line:84%
be to remain ignorant
of this gift.

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:20.080 align:middle line:84%
The modern mindset
seems to marvel

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:23.290 align:middle line:84%
at the latest and greatest
technology while disregarding

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:25.700 align:middle line:90%
the importance of our heritage.

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.170 align:middle line:84%
What if this is exactly why
the health of the masses

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:31.480 align:middle line:84%
and the health of the
planet is struggling

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:35.590 align:middle line:84%
to keep up with the rapid
changes that we are causing?

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:38.530 align:middle line:84%
What if the passing of
each generation to the next

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:42.520 align:middle line:84%
is a direct connection
to our shamanic ancestry

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.850 align:middle line:84%
and the biological
technology of the human body

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:49.480 align:middle line:84%
remembers all that our
lineage has been through?

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And what if the remedy
to all our human problems

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:58.420 align:middle line:84%
is simply to remember who
and what we truly are,

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:02.910 align:middle line:90%
embodied in the heart and soul.

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:05.340 align:middle line:84%
If psychedelic plants
and shamanic rituals

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:08.070 align:middle line:84%
are a vital key to
unlocking our past,

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:10.650 align:middle line:84%
is this why they've
been suppressed, feared,

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:15.030 align:middle line:84%
and crusaded against in the
old world, as well as the new?

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:18.600 align:middle line:10%
In the late 1400s, as
European Naval forces set out

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.490 align:middle line:10%
to the New World,
they would soon

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:24.330 align:middle line:10%
stumble upon shamanic tribes
in every corner of the Americas

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:27.630 align:middle line:10%
with a rich history in
using psychedelic plants.

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:30.270 align:middle line:84%
One such region in
South America would soon

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:34.170 align:middle line:84%
reveal an ancient psychedelic
cocktail of several botanicals.

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Was there any connection
between this ancient religious

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:40.260 align:middle line:84%
sacrament and the Old
World's Soma and Haoma,

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.920 align:middle line:84%
or is the shamanic phenomenon of
seeking deeply-expanded states

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:47.370 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness through plant
medicines an innate function

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:50.640 align:middle line:84%
of those people that
lived closest to nature?

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:54.090 align:middle line:84%
Up next, join us as we
explore the deep mysteries

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:57.790 align:middle line:84%
of the Amazon rain forest and
the ancient shamanic traditions

00:28:57.790 --> 00:28:58.590 align:middle line:90%
that live there.
