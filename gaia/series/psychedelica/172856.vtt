mystical type experiences seem

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.490 align:middle line:84%
to revolve around

In legends and myth,

from walking on water
and astral projection

to stories of resurrection
and transcendence,

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.460 align:middle line:84%
have baffled the rationale of
skeptics and pragmatists alike.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.650 align:middle line:84%
But the story was
about to change

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.280 align:middle line:84%
after an unlikely ancient relic
was discovered after being

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.758 align:middle line:90%
lost for 2000 years.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.380 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.700 align:middle line:84%
On March 14 of 1952, at
an archaeological site

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.090 align:middle line:84%
on the West Bank in Israel's
Qumran National Park,

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.090 align:middle line:84%
15 scrolls were unearthed,
the last of which

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.610 align:middle line:84%
was famously called
the copper scroll.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.720 align:middle line:10%
It was corroded to the point
where it could not be unrolled.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.660 align:middle line:10%
So English archaeologist,
John Marco Allegro,

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.460 align:middle line:10%
recommended that
the scrolls be sent

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.530 align:middle line:10%
to Manchester
University in order

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.910 align:middle line:10%
to cut them into pieces,
making them easier to read.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.050 align:middle line:10%
After 15 years of study, Allegro
published his book, "The Sacred

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.600 align:middle line:10%
Mushroom and the Cross."

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.390 align:middle line:84%
He argued that the linguistics
of this dead language

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.580 align:middle line:84%
revealed that the
roots of Christianity

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.010 align:middle line:84%
were born in fertility
cults, with the use

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.370 align:middle line:84%
of sacramental and
psychedelic mushrooms,

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.710 align:middle line:84%
also stating that
these rituals survived

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.340 align:middle line:84%
in secrecy within
Christian artwork seen

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.620 align:middle line:90%
in cathedrals and churches.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.390 align:middle line:84%
But the most popular of
Allegro's interpretations

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.930 align:middle line:84%
was the fresco at
Plaincourault Chapel.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Right before his book, "The
Sacred Mushroom" got published,

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.175 align:middle line:84%
he saw a grainy image of
the Plaincourault fresco

00:02:09.175 --> 00:02:10.800 align:middle line:84%
and thought it was
an amanita muscaria,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.680 align:middle line:84%
so he put it in the
dust jacket of his book.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Like all people, when I first
saw the Plaincourault fresco,

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.050 align:middle line:90%
I was like, oh, my god.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.170 align:middle line:84%
That's an amanita
muscaria, of course.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Professor Jerry Brown served
as the founding professor

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.230 align:middle line:84%
of anthropology at Florida
International University

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.710 align:middle line:84%
in Miami, where he taught
a course on psychedelics.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.370 align:middle line:10%
>> It really started with my
first psychedelic experience

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.150 align:middle line:10%
which was on LSD at a
Rainbow Family gathering,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.740 align:middle line:10%
high in the Rocky Mountains.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.509 align:middle line:10%
It was a frightening
experience, and I wasn't alone.

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:46.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Albert
Hoffman thought he was

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.240 align:middle line:90%
dying in his first experience--

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.220 align:middle line:90%
discovery of LSD.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And it really made me
pause and want to learn

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.890 align:middle line:90%
a lot more about psychedelics.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I didn't have
the instant nirvana

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.170 align:middle line:84%
that Larry was talking about,
and so being an anthropologist

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.710 align:middle line:84%
I designed and taught a course
on hallucinogens in culture.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.320 align:middle line:90%
Then, fast forward to 2006.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.910 align:middle line:10%
My wife, Julie, and I are in
Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland,

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.680 align:middle line:10%
and I discovered, in the head
of the most prominent green man,

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.500 align:middle line:10%
a fertility head of
which there are about 100

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.440 align:middle line:10%
in Rosslyn Chapel, about
two weeks after buying

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.430 align:middle line:10%
this replica of this
Rosslyn Chapel green man,

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.520 align:middle line:10%
I turned it around on a table.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And I looked, and was staring
at a replica of an amanita

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.430 align:middle line:90%
muscaria mushroom.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.210 align:middle line:84%
The bulbous bottom, the
little veil around the stem,

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.120 align:middle line:90%
the little white dots, the dots.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was this discovery
of a psychoactive mushroom

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.050 align:middle line:84%
in a Catholic church that led
Julie and me to start thinking,

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.850 align:middle line:84%
are there other psychedelic
mushrooms in Christian art?

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.390 align:middle line:10%
Julie and I had the opportunity
to meet with Paul Stamets, one

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.930 align:middle line:10%
of the world's most eminent
and knowledgeable mycologists.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.200 align:middle line:10%
And we said, Paul, do you
agree with our interpretation

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.870 align:middle line:10%
that this is an amanita
muscaria mushroom?

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.090 align:middle line:90%
And he said, oh, absolutely.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.410 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said, and now I'm
embarrassed about this, I said,

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:17.880 align:middle line:90%
Paul, are you sure?

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.519 align:middle line:84%
That's like asking the pope,
are you sure you're Catholic?

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.270 align:middle line:10%
And he laughed, and he said,
this is a taxonomically correct

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.000 align:middle line:10%
amanita muscaria mushroom.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.640 align:middle line:10%
>> As Jerry and Julie Brown
found their conviction that

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.640 align:middle line:10%
this was indeed a secretive
depiction of the psychoactive

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.350 align:middle line:10%
amanita muscaria mushroom by
the artist Sir William Sinclair,

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.900 align:middle line:10%
the author of "The Witches'
Ointment," Tom Hatsis,

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.640 align:middle line:10%
with a master's in history, has
a different view on the matter.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Every image put forth by
the holy mushroom advocates,

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.550 align:middle line:90%
and they all have different--

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.400 align:middle line:84%
they all have different
details in their theories,

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.000 align:middle line:84%
but they're all trying to say
the same thing, that there

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.630 align:middle line:90%
are mushrooms in Christian art.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.270 align:middle line:84%
While I do believe that there's
a lot to say about psychedelics

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.900 align:middle line:84%
in early Christianity and
medieval Christianity,

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that there is
anything to say about mushrooms

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.830 align:middle line:90%
secretly hidden in art.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.040 align:middle line:10%
An example would be the green
man from Rosslyn Chapel.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.240 align:middle line:10%
Paul Stamets and
Jerry Brown both say

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.070 align:middle line:10%
that that's an amanita
muscaria mushroom,

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.450 align:middle line:10%
and that it's a taxonomically
correct amanita muscaria

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.310 align:middle line:10%
mushroom.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.410 align:middle line:84%
But that's only because
they put an unnatural line

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.210 align:middle line:84%
of demarcation at the nub
where the mushroom should end.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.160 align:middle line:84%
If you get rid of that
line of demarcation,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.540 align:middle line:90%
it goes on, and on, and on.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.720 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't look like it amanita
muscaria that I've ever seen.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:84%
One of the things about the
holy mushroom hypothesis,

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.940 align:middle line:84%
if we can call it that,
is that it actually

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.110 align:middle line:90%
has a lot of shortcomings.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, these
shortcomings are often

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.140 align:middle line:84%
overlooked by the people
bolstering the theory,

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.890 align:middle line:84%
but for others who pay a little
bit more careful attention

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.016 align:middle line:90%
to detail, we see a big problem.

00:05:52.016 --> 00:05:52.890 align:middle line:90%
There's a disconnect.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And in my opinion,
the biggest problem

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.650 align:middle line:84%
is that Christians,
especially the church fathers,

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.530 align:middle line:84%
wrote about their
psychedelic experiences.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, St. Basil
recommended taking mandrake.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.950 align:middle line:10%
Theodoret of Syria would
smoke opium and then

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:08.970 align:middle line:10%
read from the gospels.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.730 align:middle line:84%
So these guys were totally
open about discussing

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.370 align:middle line:84%
their psychedelic
use, so why not say,

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.400 align:middle line:84%
hey, we're secretly
painting it in art, too.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Why talk about cannabis,
and opium, and mandrake,

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.470 align:middle line:84%
and henbane, and never
bring up a mushroom?

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.300 align:middle line:90%
It makes no sense historically.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Tom asked, he said, look,
if there is all of these

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.060 align:middle line:84%
psychedelics, why aren't
the church fathers--

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.650 align:middle line:84%
why aren't there
more about this in

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.900 align:middle line:90%
the early Christian writings?

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And my answer to Tom on
this point is twofold.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:41.660 align:middle line:84%
One, absence of evidence
is not evidence of absence.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.420 align:middle line:84%
Just because they didn't
write about it doesn't mean

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.890 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't there.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.620 align:middle line:10%
And when we come
back to this point

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.600 align:middle line:10%
that these were
the holies of holy,

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.100 align:middle line:10%
that people talked about them
in secrecy, that the pope said,

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:00.230 align:middle line:10%
let art be the Bible of the
illiterate, they expressed it,

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.480 align:middle line:10%
but they expressed it
in the artwork and not

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.590 align:middle line:10%
in the writings.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.010 align:middle line:84%
It was too sacred to
put into the writings.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Tom began researching the
holy mushroom theory years ago,

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.060 align:middle line:84%
and was even on the path to
writing a book on the topic.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So I used to actually believe
the holy mushroom theory in its

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.040 align:middle line:90%
totality.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And I actually, I didn't
think that anybody

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.692 align:middle line:84%
had written a good book on
the topic, so I'm like, OK.

00:07:24.692 --> 00:07:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going to
write that book.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.640 align:middle line:84%
So before I wrote "The Witches'
Ointment," the first book

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.430 align:middle line:84%
in psychedelics I was going to
write was on the holy mushroom

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:32.450 align:middle line:90%
theory.

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.750 align:middle line:84%
But the more I investigated
it, the more I came to realize,

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.210 align:middle line:84%
none of these things
are actually mushrooms.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.180 align:middle line:10%
A lot of the times,
the advocates

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.770 align:middle line:10%
don't know what
they're looking at.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.410 align:middle line:10%
And some of them have
kind of mushroomy shapes,

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.510 align:middle line:10%
but in an odd way,
so does a stop sign.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.020 align:middle line:10%
And look, it's red at the
top, and it's on a stem.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So I was just trying to
make this theory fit--

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:57.110 align:middle line:84%
the evidence fit what I already
thought, and I was like, well,

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.250 align:middle line:90%
aren't I a sucker?

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.200 align:middle line:90%
There's just nothing to it.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.880 align:middle line:90%
I fell for it.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.767 align:middle line:10%
And so now I spend my time
investigating these photos,

00:08:05.767 --> 00:08:07.850 align:middle line:10%
and these pictures, and
showing what they actually

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.160 align:middle line:10%
are because I think it's
an important question.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.710 align:middle line:84%
Look, if Jesus had anything to
do with magic mushrooms, that

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:13.910 align:middle line:90%
is a big deal.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.170 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:21.350 align:middle line:10%
>> By the time Jerry and Julie
Brown's book came out in 2016,

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.420 align:middle line:10%
many other books had
been published regarding

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.640 align:middle line:10%
psychedelics and Christian art.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.130 align:middle line:84%
The concept was
growing in popularity,

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.680 align:middle line:84%
yet because there were so
many unanswered questions

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.590 align:middle line:84%
and wild speculations,
Jerry and Julie

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.530 align:middle line:84%
found it imperative to write
a comprehensive book on where

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:38.510 align:middle line:90%
the debate sits today.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:41.059 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there other
entheogens in Christian art?

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:44.240 align:middle line:84%
Does Christianity have
a psychedelic history?

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.210 align:middle line:84%
If it does, what does
this imply for the life

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.400 align:middle line:90%
of Jesus and the disciples?

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.350 align:middle line:10%
And before we
slipped into a kind

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.170 align:middle line:10%
of a rambunctious
overthrow of reason,

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:57.380 align:middle line:10%
Carl Sagan's famous
words came to us,

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:01.580 align:middle line:10%
"extraordinary claims require
extraordinary evidence."

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Extraordinary claims
require ordinary evidence,

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.090 align:middle line:10%
and the holy mushroom hypothesis
doesn't even have base

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.030 align:middle line:10%
evidence, let alone
extraordinary evidence.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.800 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't even--
it's got nothing.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Of all the pieces
that I've seen,

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.710 align:middle line:84%
they're easily
explained away by using

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:21.260 align:middle line:84%
very basic historical criteria
in detective crime solving

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.300 align:middle line:84%
methods, every
single one of them.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.520 align:middle line:84%
In those days,
psychedelics were not

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.597 align:middle line:84%
classified the way we
classify drugs today.

00:09:29.597 --> 00:09:30.680 align:middle line:90%
They didn't classify them.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.660 align:middle line:90%
They classified magic.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:37.820 align:middle line:84%
So you could give somebody
cannabis, right, to heal them.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:38.630 align:middle line:90%
And they're healed.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:39.800 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's good.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.617 align:middle line:90%
That's good magic.

00:09:40.617 --> 00:09:41.450 align:middle line:90%
You're a good witch.

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:42.576 align:middle line:90%
Congratulations.

00:09:42.576 --> 00:09:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, you give somebody
cannabis and let's say

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.980 align:middle line:84%
they start to freak
out because they don't

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.688 align:middle line:84%
know what's going on
or mushrooms-- well,

00:09:47.688 --> 00:09:48.770 align:middle line:90%
now you're a bad witch.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And now you didn't try
to heal that person,

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.717 align:middle line:84%
you were trying to
send demons into them.

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:54.050 align:middle line:90%
You were trying to possess them.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.880 align:middle line:90%


00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.970 align:middle line:84%
So much of it depended
on, really, the outcome.

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.790 align:middle line:10%
>> If psychedelics were not
as important as the intentions

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:06.890 align:middle line:10%
of the people using
them in magic,

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:09.500 align:middle line:10%
then would it make sense
to keep them secret?

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.720 align:middle line:84%
The extraordinary claims
that Jerry and Julie

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Brown were looking to back up
had many obstacles to overcome.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>> We had some serious
reservations at the beginning.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.890 align:middle line:10%
But we finally came
to a point where

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.670 align:middle line:10%
we gathered so much
information at a distance

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.500 align:middle line:10%
that Julie and I
said, you know, we

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.050 align:middle line:10%
will regret it the
rest of our lives

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.660 align:middle line:10%
if this insight was
given to us, if we

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.210 align:middle line:10%
don't undertake this
journey of discovery

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.330 align:middle line:10%
to see if we can find
psychedelic images

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:41.218 align:middle line:10%
in Christian art.

00:10:41.218 --> 00:10:43.970 align:middle line:90%


00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Jerry and Julie set out
for Europe and the Middle East

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.180 align:middle line:84%
to hunt down the original
artwork, take pictures,

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:54.610 align:middle line:84%
and gather the extraordinary
evidence that they were after.

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:57.940 align:middle line:10%
>> The first place we went
was to Plaincourault, France,

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:03.430 align:middle line:10%
to the tiny chapel, 20
feet wide by 60 feet deep

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:08.350 align:middle line:10%
in Plaincourault, where there
is a giant amanita mushroom

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:12.940 align:middle line:10%
on a fresco of the temptation
scene in the Garden of Eden.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.970 align:middle line:84%
We went there because
this place was

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:21.340 align:middle line:84%
the source of the debate between
Gordon Wasson and John Allegro

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:25.340 align:middle line:84%
as to, is this an amanita
muscaria mushroom,

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:26.560 align:middle line:90%
or is it not?

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.770 align:middle line:84%
Wasson said, no, citing
the art historian

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:34.510 align:middle line:84%
Panofsky, who said it's a
stylized Italian pine tree.

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And Allegro said,
oh, it absolutely is.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:41.050 align:middle line:84%
It was an incredibly
emotional day for both of us,

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:43.220 align:middle line:90%
but especially for me.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:48.070 align:middle line:10%
I had been waiting for 40
years to see this giant amanita

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:51.430 align:middle line:10%
mushroom in
Plaincourault Chapel.

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:53.800 align:middle line:84%
The guide to the
chapel showed up.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.920 align:middle line:84%
He spoke in French which
we could understand,

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.350 align:middle line:84%
and he described
it as an amanita.

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And when we looked at it,
it was completely clear

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.390 align:middle line:84%
that this was an
amanita mushroom because

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:10.750 align:middle line:84%
of the meticulous white dots on
the cap, which were obviously

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:14.230 align:middle line:84%
drawn with intention because
Adam and Eve were covering

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.900 align:middle line:84%
themselves with mushroom
caps, not fig leaves.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And Eve was partially
skeletonized which

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:25.030 align:middle line:84%
in shamanism is associated
with transcendence.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:26.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, skeletonization
in the bones

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.050 align:middle line:90%
are very key to shamanism.

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.240 align:middle line:90%
And Julie noticed that.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:35.710 align:middle line:84%
So it was the first place
we stopped in our journey,

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:38.860 align:middle line:84%
and it was the initial
confirmation to say,

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:42.250 align:middle line:84%
yes, Allegro was right
about Plaincourault,

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:46.000 align:middle line:84%
and we have our
first major signpost

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.780 align:middle line:84%
on the trail of finding
compelling evidence

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:53.650 align:middle line:90%
of mushrooms in Christianity.

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:56.700 align:middle line:10%
>> There are shamanic skeletal
references in books as well

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.420 align:middle line:10%
as rock art, in which the motifs
represent death and rebirth

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.890 align:middle line:10%
of the spirit or transcendence.

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And the image even has
definitive markings

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.850 align:middle line:84%
to depict that Eve is
either starving or becoming

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:11.990 align:middle line:90%
skeleton-like.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:15.180 align:middle line:84%
But was John Marco Allegro
truly correct in his claim

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:19.140 align:middle line:84%
that this was a name
amanita muscaria mushroom?

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Allegro himself
came to believe that that

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.700 align:middle line:90%
wasn't a mushroom.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.220 align:middle line:10%
And in every edition of the
sacred mushroom and the cross,

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.870 align:middle line:10%
that photo was taken out.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:32.190 align:middle line:84%
He died believing only in his
linguistic interpretations.

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:35.550 align:middle line:84%
All these people today
don't read dead languages,

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:39.160 align:middle line:84%
so they picked up on the art
because it's just easy to--

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:39.960 align:middle line:90%
it's art.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.230 align:middle line:84%
We can all interpret whatever
we want to see in art.

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:46.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's simple, especially
because some of the trees

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.940 align:middle line:90%
are kind of zany looking.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.760 align:middle line:84%
They do have purple
tops, or red tops,

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.430 align:middle line:84%
and have kind of a bulbous
top with a long stem.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:55.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, go outside.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:58.410 align:middle line:90%
That's what trees look like.

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I would point out that
this is from about the 1100s,

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:05.910 align:middle line:84%
and perspective did not
come into art until the 15th

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.020 align:middle line:90%
century.

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:07.900 align:middle line:90%
So the artist could--

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:08.700 align:middle line:90%
look.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.670 align:middle line:84%
This is not an anatomically
correct Adam and Eve,

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:16.080 align:middle line:84%
nor is it an anatomically
correct amanita muscaria fly

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.670 align:middle line:90%
agaric mushroom.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:21.900 align:middle line:84%
So this could be the artist
drawing a cluster of mushrooms

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:22.960 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And as an
anthropologist, I always

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:27.550 align:middle line:84%
like to see what do the
locals, the natives, say.

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:32.700 align:middle line:10%
A bishop in early France said
that these were psychoactive,

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.400 align:middle line:10%
or really mind
altering substances,

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.530 align:middle line:10%
using the language of that time.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:40.260 align:middle line:84%
When it was first introduced
to the Mycological

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Society of France, the
mycologist presenting it

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:48.360 align:middle line:84%
said, and look, the artist
has drawn a giant fly agaric.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.020 align:middle line:84%
When I asked the guide
to Plaincourault,

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.690 align:middle line:84%
who was taking us around, why
did the artist put this there?

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:59.010 align:middle line:84%
He said, because he wants
people to understand

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.280 align:middle line:84%
that they have to have a
transcendental experience

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:06.210 align:middle line:90%
to come closer to God.

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>> The double-edged sword of
art is that some pieces can be

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:13.140 align:middle line:84%
interpreted in many ways,
whereas others are quite

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.790 align:middle line:90%
on the nose.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Making a distinction between
which of those categories

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:19.590 align:middle line:84%
these Christian
renderings fall into

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:24.300 align:middle line:84%
is the debate that has raged for
the better part of a century.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.240 align:middle line:10%
But Jerry and Julie kept on
with their investigation,

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.150 align:middle line:10%
wondering where else they might
find evidence of psychedelics

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.970 align:middle line:10%
in Christian art.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>> After Plaincourault, we drove
about two hours east in France

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:41.190 align:middle line:84%
to the Parish Church of
Saint-Martin de Vic, again,

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:43.590 align:middle line:90%
about 1,000 years old.

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And when we came into the
choir, Julie took my arm

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and she said, do
you see what I see?

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at the joint
scene of the purification

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:57.600 align:middle line:84%
of Isaiah's lips and
Jesus entering Jerusalem.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And up in the right hand corner
of the scene of Jesus entering

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Jerusalem, the joyful youth, who
are welcoming him to Jerusalem

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:08.200 align:middle line:84%
on the Passover, one
of them is holding

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:13.810 align:middle line:84%
onto the stem of one of
five, large, tan psilocybin

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.820 align:middle line:90%
mushrooms.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:19.600 align:middle line:10%
And as we looked
to the next wall,

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.060 align:middle line:10%
Jesus is going towards
the Tower of Jerusalem.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.160 align:middle line:84%
On top of the
Tower of Jerusalem,

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.980 align:middle line:84%
there are other youth
with long knives,

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.190 align:middle line:84%
cutting down unmistakable
psilocybin mushrooms,

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:31.990 align:middle line:90%
cutting through the stem.

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:38.230 align:middle line:84%
If that was not enough on this
wall, the painting, the fresco,

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:41.830 align:middle line:84%
of the Towers of
Jerusalem is looking down

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:43.540 align:middle line:90%
on the Last Supper.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.250 align:middle line:90%
It is not bread on the table.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:46.600 align:middle line:90%
It's mushroom caps.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.270 align:middle line:84%
If it were bread, it
would be pulled apart.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:50.740 align:middle line:90%
It would be baked in loaves.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And the same knives
are on the table

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.530 align:middle line:84%
that were used to cut
down the mushrooms

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.510 align:middle line:90%
in the Tower of Jerusalem.

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So a lot of people look
at that image without knowing

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.572 align:middle line:90%
exactly where it comes from.

00:17:04.572 --> 00:17:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And when I say exact
where it comes from,

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.230 align:middle line:90%
I mean, literally, the Bib--

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:11.810 align:middle line:84%
the chapter and verse
of where it comes from.

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:14.290 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the
Gospel of Mark.

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:19.210 align:middle line:84%
It's often
misappropriately titled,

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:23.870 align:middle line:84%
The Triumphal Entry, by people
who are not New Testament

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:24.670 align:middle line:90%
historians.

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:26.878 align:middle line:84%
Because New Testament
historians know that it was not

00:17:26.878 --> 00:17:28.480 align:middle line:90%
a triumphal entry.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.070 align:middle line:90%
Mark's Gospel is a war gospel.

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:34.240 align:middle line:90%
This was a counter-protest.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.490 align:middle line:84%
In the Gospel, you
have Jesus coming

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:38.090 align:middle line:90%
in from one side of town.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:38.890 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:42.670 align:middle line:10%
He's contrasted by Caesar
coming in from the other side

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:45.340 align:middle line:10%
with the standards
and the warhorses.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.770 align:middle line:90%
So Jesus is not on a war horse.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:49.390 align:middle line:90%
He's on a lowly donkey.

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:50.290 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And even though the
Romans are coming in

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:55.600 align:middle line:84%
with their parasols of victory
getting back to that peace,

00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:84%
you see the young boys,
handing the parasol of victory,

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.830 align:middle line:90%
instead, to Jesus.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Parasols and umbrellas seem
to be a point of debate between

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:08.860 align:middle line:84%
scholars looking
into religious art.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Even in Hindu, Babylonian,
and Assyrian art,

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.860 align:middle line:90%
we find many parasols.

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:18.860 align:middle line:84%
But are these really meant
to depict the same objects?

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And why would the
children be using knives

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:22.900 align:middle line:84%
to cut down the
parasols of victory

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.060 align:middle line:84%
instead of pulling
them out of the ground?

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:27.760 align:middle line:84%
A knife would make more sense to
cut a mushroom from the ground

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.800 align:middle line:90%
than an umbrella.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.840 align:middle line:84%
As Jerry and Julie continued
their investigation,

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.920 align:middle line:84%
they found many images that
look far less like parasols,

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.870 align:middle line:84%
but still peculiar
enough to question.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>> In the opening folio of
the great Canterbury Psalter,

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:46.850 align:middle line:84%
which was created at
Canterbury Cathedral,

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:51.220 align:middle line:84%
it started about 1180, it
tells the story of Genesis,

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:53.470 align:middle line:84%
all the way through
the life of Christ.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And there's this scene
where Jesus heals the leper.

00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And the leper says,
master, please cleanse me.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus says-- and his scroll
reaching out to the leper,

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.820 align:middle line:90%
says, I will be cleansed.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:12.820 align:middle line:84%
But what is
fascinating about this

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.700 align:middle line:84%
is that the scroll that
the leper is holding

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:21.070 align:middle line:84%
goes from his hand not to
Jesus, but to a very clear, tan

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:24.490 align:middle line:84%
psychedelic mushroom at
the bottom of the painting.

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:27.730 align:middle line:10%
Jesus is hovering, sort
of suspended in air,

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:29.380 align:middle line:10%
over that mushroom.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:32.200 align:middle line:10%
And the artist
obviously was showing us

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:38.660 align:middle line:10%
the significance of mushrooms
in Jesus' healing ministry.

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:43.010 align:middle line:10%
In this fresco in the Parish
Church of Saint-Martin de Vic

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:45.380 align:middle line:10%
in central France,
there is a fresco

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:48.950 align:middle line:10%
that brings together to the
New Testament, Jesus entering

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:52.670 align:middle line:10%
Jerusalem and the Old Testament,
Isaiah's lips, the purification

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:53.600 align:middle line:10%
of his lips.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And the story is that
the Seraphim, the angel,

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.840 align:middle line:84%
took a burning coal
with tongs and put it in

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.240 align:middle line:84%
to cleanse his lips,
and metaphorically

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.030 align:middle line:90%
wash all of his sins away.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:08.150 align:middle line:84%
What's in this
painting is a tan,

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:12.290 align:middle line:90%
round object in Isaiah's lips.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:16.010 align:middle line:84%
It is not burning hot
black like a coal.

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:17.510 align:middle line:90%
It's not burning red.

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:19.020 align:middle line:90%
There are no tongs.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And given the
relationship, the context

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.930 align:middle line:84%
of mushrooms in the rest
of the scenes there,

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:28.280 align:middle line:84%
we believe that this story is
talking about an entheogen,

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.100 align:middle line:84%
even back in the
Old Testament time.

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that moment
that we had our aha discovery,

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:38.040 align:middle line:84%
and said, this is a
psychedelic Gospel.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.330 align:middle line:84%
This is an alternative
history of Christianity.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:43.010 align:middle line:10%
And this shouldn't
be so surprising,

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:44.930 align:middle line:10%
because back in
the sixth century,

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:49.670 align:middle line:10%
Pope Gregory said, let art be
the Bible of the illiterate,

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:52.280 align:middle line:10%
because most of the people
throughout the entire medieval

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.130 align:middle line:10%
period were illiterate.

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Is illiteracy the reason
why these seemingly psychedelic

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:01.370 align:middle line:84%
mushrooms show up
in Christian art?

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:04.370 align:middle line:84%
One other theory is that from
early on in the construction

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:06.830 align:middle line:84%
of the religious
institution, these plants

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.890 align:middle line:84%
were suppressed and kept only in
the hands of the inner circles

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:11.150 align:middle line:90%
of the church.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:14.030 align:middle line:84%
But Jerry sees this
point a bit differently.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>> When it comes to secrecy
of the mushrooms and these

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:23.210 align:middle line:84%
rituals, the major point to
make here is that secrecy is not

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:24.560 align:middle line:90%
suppression.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:28.280 align:middle line:84%
There are some people who argue
that entheogens were suppressed

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.870 align:middle line:90%
in Christianity.

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:31.340 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:34.760 align:middle line:84%
This did not happen until
after the Inquisition.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.670 align:middle line:10%
That's the point where
they really disappear

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:40.280 align:middle line:10%
for a variety of reasons.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:45.320 align:middle line:10%
The reason that these mushrooms
are there for the initiates

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:51.280 align:middle line:10%
to see is because this
is the holy of holies.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.490 align:middle line:10%
These are the sacred plants.

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:58.900 align:middle line:10%
And so in all of the shamanistic
and classic religious

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:02.290 align:middle line:10%
traditions that use entheogens,
these are treated reverently,

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:04.810 align:middle line:10%
and secretly, and quietly.

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:07.640 align:middle line:10%
Among María Sabina and
the Mazatec shaman,

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.890 align:middle line:10%
they're talked a little--

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:11.640 align:middle line:10%
landslide mushrooms, the
little saints of the Mazatec,

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.260 align:middle line:10%
are talked about in
whispers at night

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:18.100 align:middle line:10%
at veladas, at midnight
healing ceremonies.

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.100 align:middle line:10%
>> The use of secrecy in
magic and religion is seen

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:24.940 align:middle line:10%
ubiquitously through many
different spiritual traditions.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Kees Willem Bolle opens his
book, "Secrecy and Religion"

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:33.640 align:middle line:84%
by saying, not only is there
no religion without secrecy,

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.640 align:middle line:84%
but there is no human
existence without it.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.990 align:middle line:84%
Religious expressiveness and all
human life cannot be understood

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:44.830 align:middle line:84%
if we ignore their peculiar
codes, reservations,

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:48.580 align:middle line:84%
self restraints, and cautions
that seem their very grammar

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.740 align:middle line:90%
and idiom.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.020 align:middle line:10%
Many in modern self
encounter groups

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.780 align:middle line:10%
state that the only difference
between magic practice

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:58.450 align:middle line:10%
and religion is that
religion is sanctioned

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:01.090 align:middle line:10%
by a near governmental
size authority,

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:02.890 align:middle line:10%
and magic refers
to the groups that

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:05.350 align:middle line:10%
didn't build the mass
congregation or business

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:07.600 align:middle line:10%
model around it.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.640 align:middle line:84%
But authors like
Jordan Maxwell seem

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.280 align:middle line:84%
to find that obscure
passages in the Bible

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:16.480 align:middle line:84%
might point to mushroom
worship amongst the Israelites.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Exodus 16:14 states, and when
the dew that lay was gone up,

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:24.400 align:middle line:84%
behold upon the face
of the wilderness,

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.250 align:middle line:84%
there lay a small
round thing, as small

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:30.340 align:middle line:90%
as the hoarfrost on the ground.

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:33.460 align:middle line:84%
He also points out that the
hats worn by Jewish priests

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:36.600 align:middle line:90%
look similar to mushroom caps.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Professor Carl Ruck, who wrote
"Mushrooms, Myth and Mithras,"

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:44.820 align:middle line:84%
says of Mithraism, the
religions kept its secrets well.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:46.560 align:middle line:84%
The teachings were
never codified

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.600 align:middle line:90%
in official scriptures.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:52.560 align:middle line:84%
He also says that Mithras, like
the amanita muscaria mushroom,

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.160 align:middle line:84%
was said to be born wearing
a red, star-spotted cap

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.280 align:middle line:84%
from a pine cone or
philosopher's stone.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Many of these
religions were born

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:03.690 align:middle line:84%
in a similar area
of the old world,

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:05.790 align:middle line:84%
while we also find
mushroom idolatry

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:10.710 align:middle line:84%
among many North, Central,
and South American indigenous.

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:middle line:10%
Even if only a few
of these references

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:16.100 align:middle line:10%
are, in fact, historically
accurate, speaking

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:17.840 align:middle line:10%
about psychedelic
worship leading

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.900 align:middle line:10%
to widespread
religions, what, then,

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.760 align:middle line:10%
is the incentive
to keep the secrecy

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:26.480 align:middle line:10%
alive in the information
age that we live in today?

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:32.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Institutions that are very
invested in telling large

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:37.910 align:middle line:10%
numbers of people what they
should think, like religions,

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:40.700 align:middle line:10%
is probably the best example,
psychedelics are very

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:44.030 align:middle line:10%
threatening to that
because you're saying, no.

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:49.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to accept your
doctrine, your dogma, whatever.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:53.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to think for myself.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.880 align:middle line:84%
A society of people that
actually think for themselves

00:24:55.880 --> 00:25:00.230 align:middle line:84%
is a very dangerous thing
to established institutions.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:05.390 align:middle line:10%
>> What this research reveals
is the plant-based shamanic

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:07.520 align:middle line:10%
origins of religion itself.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that fundamental religion

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:14.477 align:middle line:84%
has been rallied against
ever since they took hold.

00:25:14.477 --> 00:25:16.310 align:middle line:10%
Ever since the Christian
religion took hold,

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:19.730 align:middle line:10%
it began with the suppression
of the pagan cults

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:22.100 align:middle line:10%
and suppressed the peyote
cults, and the mushroom

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:26.510 align:middle line:10%
cults, and the sacred use of
drugs and plants and everything

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:30.350 align:middle line:10%
throughout the whole world,
because of this fear out of it.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:34.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Once religions adopted public
persuasion and political power,

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:37.670 align:middle line:10%
the claims of magic powers
coming from plant sacraments

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:40.640 align:middle line:10%
were seen as blasphemous,
and may have fueled the mass

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.570 align:middle line:10%
genocide of shamanic
tribes in the Americas.

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Even today, it is a
controversial claim

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:50.210 align:middle line:84%
to say that psychedelics
like psilocybin mushrooms

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:53.360 align:middle line:84%
can elicit a religious
or mystical experience.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.820 align:middle line:10%
But if it were true,
could this account

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.590 align:middle line:10%
for the nature of
the transformation

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:00.230 align:middle line:10%
that Christ, and possibly
other religious heroes,

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:02.450 align:middle line:10%
claim to have had?

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many writings that
indicate that Jesus achieved

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:12.020 align:middle line:84%
his immortality and
divinity through entheogens.

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:13.470 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you just one--

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:17.420 align:middle line:84%
for example, eat of my
flesh, drink of my blood,

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:19.059 align:middle line:84%
and you will
achieve immortality.

00:26:19.059 --> 00:26:20.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is in
the New Testament.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.560 align:middle line:90%
This is John.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:22.880 align:middle line:90%
What is Jesus talking about?

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.650 align:middle line:90%
Is he advocating cannibalism?

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:26.900 align:middle line:84%
I think not, because
this would be anathema

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:30.350 align:middle line:90%
to Romans and to Jews alike.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Number two, when we get
into gnostic gospels,

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:37.850 align:middle line:84%
in the Gospel of Thomas,
Jesus says to the disciples,

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:40.220 align:middle line:90%
to whom can you compare me?

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And Thomas answers
and he says, master,

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:46.970 align:middle line:84%
I am wholly incapable of
comparing you to anyone.

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus replies, I
am not your master.

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:56.210 align:middle line:84%
Because you have drunk
from the bubbling spring

00:26:56.210 --> 00:27:00.950 align:middle line:84%
that I have measured out,
you have become like me,

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:03.290 align:middle line:90%
and I have become like you.

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And all that is hidden
within has been revealed.

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we're talking
about is a bubbling spring.

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Drinking the drink from
my mouth, and a drink

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:16.340 align:middle line:90%
that I have measured out.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.410 align:middle line:84%
We all know that dose
is very important.

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:20.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here, as
close as you can

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:23.510 align:middle line:84%
get without going
into volume, he's

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:26.960 align:middle line:84%
talking about measuring out a
dose of this particular drink.

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:31.820 align:middle line:10%
We think this is a code
for the original Eucharist,

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.040 align:middle line:10%
the mushroom.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:37.870 align:middle line:10%
>> There is something uniquely
powerful and re-organization

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:40.250 align:middle line:10%
all about these experiences.

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:45.110 align:middle line:10%
They appear to map on
to naturally occurring

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:48.260 align:middle line:10%
mystical or transformative
type experiences that

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:51.020 align:middle line:10%
have been reported
throughout the ages

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:55.100 align:middle line:10%
by mystics and
religious figures.

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, as a clinical
pharmacologist

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:00.500 align:middle line:84%
who's been doing
research with all kinds

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:04.220 align:middle line:84%
of different psychoactive
compounds for decades,

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:10.190 align:middle line:84%
that's just a remarkable
and unprecedented finding.

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>> If the leading researcher
in psilocybin mushrooms trials

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:17.390 align:middle line:84%
with control groups with nearly
two decades of studies can make

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:20.240 align:middle line:84%
the claim that these mushrooms
might account for the wildly

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.720 align:middle line:84%
mystical stories of
religious heroes,

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.610 align:middle line:84%
then we may now truly have
evidence of the psychedelic

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:29.840 align:middle line:84%
origins of religions
around the world.

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:33.080 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Egyptians called
mushrooms the sons of the gods,

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:37.430 align:middle line:84%
and plants of immortality,
closely resembling the idea

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:39.650 align:middle line:84%
that psychoactive
mushrooms were involved

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:42.200 align:middle line:84%
in the divine soma
drink of immortality

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.800 align:middle line:90%
for the ancient Indians.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.810 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian origin myth
of the sacred mushrooms

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:50.720 align:middle line:84%
was that Set, the
storm god, created them

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:54.530 align:middle line:84%
by hurling lightning bolts with
spores in them to the earth.

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:57.560 align:middle line:84%
This has relevance to the
theory that the first lifeforms

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.710 align:middle line:84%
on the planet may have been
mushrooms from large molecules

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:03.740 align:middle line:84%
in the oceans that were
struck by lightning.

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Similar beliefs crop up in
anxious Greek, Roman, Indian,

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:11.360 align:middle line:90%
and even Scythian idolatry.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Across the ocean, the
Zapotec civilization,

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:17.270 align:middle line:84%
who built impressive
temple grounds in Mexico,

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:20.210 align:middle line:84%
prayed to the great lightning
bolt that breeds the mushrooms

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:22.070 align:middle line:90%
after their ceremonies.

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:26.150 align:middle line:84%
The Olmec, Maya, Aztec,
and quite possibly

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:29.210 align:middle line:84%
many more ancient religions
from around the world,

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:33.410 align:middle line:84%
believe that these were divinely
intelligent, highly important

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:34.490 align:middle line:90%
holy mushrooms.

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:37.010 align:middle line:90%


00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:40.140 align:middle line:84%
As the holy mushroom theory
develops and the world becomes

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:43.590 align:middle line:84%
aware of it, perhaps the
biggest revelation to come

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:47.100 align:middle line:84%
is not an encouragement
to take these substances,

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.440 align:middle line:84%
but at the very least,
to balance the view

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.080 align:middle line:84%
that the modern
culture has taken

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.270 align:middle line:84%
on psychedelic plants and their
role in spiritual pursuits.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:59.430 align:middle line:90%


00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Up next, join us as we take a
look at the potential future

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:06.810 align:middle line:84%
of psychedelics in society and
where the merging of those two

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:08.900 align:middle line:90%
might take us.

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:18.176 align:middle line:90%
