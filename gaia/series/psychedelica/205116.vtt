00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And the experience
is different, too.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Both of them are very
egoic dissolving.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.530 align:middle line:90%
They'll dissolve the ego.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.080 align:middle line:10%
What the main difference
is that, with DMT,

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.870 align:middle line:10%
there's usually a very
strong visual component.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.610 align:middle line:84%
There's hallucinations
or inner visions.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.750 align:middle line:10%
With 5-MeO, that visual
component is missing.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.890 align:middle line:10%
There isn't really a visual
element to the experience.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.620 align:middle line:10%
There's just an
experience which you might

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.230 align:middle line:10%
describe as total dissolution.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.980 align:middle line:84%
It's like total
dissolution of the self

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.910 align:middle line:84%
for a temporary period,
for 20 minutes or so.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.840 align:middle line:84%
This is very much the
egoic death kind of thing.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a closer analog
to the near-death experience

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.866 align:middle line:90%
even then DMT.

is a tobacco that is
made into a powder snuff.

And it's mixed with the
ashes of sacred ceremony

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:07.410 align:middle line:84%
along with different sacred
plants from the Amazon.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:11.850 align:middle line:84%
Usually about a
pea-sized amount or more

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.760 align:middle line:84%
is put into a device
called a tepi.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.480 align:middle line:10%
A tepi is almost like
this long, skinny tube,

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.120 align:middle line:10%
kind of like a little
bit bigger than a straw.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.950 align:middle line:90%
And each side is blown--

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:30.120 align:middle line:84%
so-- to blow the rapé
into the nostrils.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is it
cleanses and detoxifies.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:38.140 align:middle line:84%
It cleans negative thoughts
and negative energies.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:42.450 align:middle line:84%
It helps one to ground, and
it balances the left and right

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.390 align:middle line:90%
hemisphere of the brain.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:48.500 align:middle line:84%
The first time that I
worked with rapé was before

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.210 align:middle line:90%
an ayahuasca ceremony.

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw it
being performed,

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.190 align:middle line:90%
I was a little intimidated.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:11:01.340 align:middle line:84%
But once I felt the rush of
the powder of the snuff going

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:06.170 align:middle line:84%
into both my nostrils, I
felt this wave over my head

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:10.310 align:middle line:84%
of energy, and I literally
felt the medicine of the rapé

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.520 align:middle line:84%
traveling all the way
down the back of my neck,

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.910 align:middle line:84%
down my shoulders, and I could
feel it releasing all of these

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.040 align:middle line:90%
energies.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And immediately after
that wave of maybe some

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:27.530 align:middle line:84%
would consider discomfort,
I felt very present.

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:31.070 align:middle line:90%
I felt very grounded.

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:34.790 align:middle line:84%
>> You may be familiar with
the idea of licking toads

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.060 align:middle line:84%
and experiencing
mind-altering effects,

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:41.280 align:middle line:90%
an easy way to get high.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.100 align:middle line:90%
But it's rarely done.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.450 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:49.280 align:middle line:10%
It's extremely dangerous and
is most often ineffective

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.440 align:middle line:10%
and can lead to nasty
viral infections.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.790 align:middle line:10%
Bufo alvarius secretions
contain other deadly chemicals

00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:01.400 align:middle line:10%
that can cause
paralysis or even death.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.520 align:middle line:84%
The actual practice
doesn't at all

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.500 align:middle line:84%
resemble the stories
of licking toads.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.070 align:middle line:90%


00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.770 align:middle line:84%
New studies out of
China and Australia

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:15.210 align:middle line:84%
have suggested that the
5-MeO-laden venom of the Bufo

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:18.510 align:middle line:84%
gargarizan and the
cane toad may offer

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:23.970 align:middle line:84%
profound medicinal potential
for modern diseases.

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Like the smokable form
of 5-MeO, the venom

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.920 align:middle line:84%
must be safely processed
before it can be ingested.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.520 align:middle line:10%
This is why, like with
any psychoactive medicine,

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.340 align:middle line:10%
one must be certain that they
are getting the substance

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:41.670 align:middle line:10%
from a trusted source and
that they are supervised

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:42.945 align:middle line:10%
by an experienced shaman.

00:12:42.945 --> 00:12:49.710 align:middle line:90%


00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:53.370 align:middle line:84%
The longest standing
traditions using 5-MeO

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.520 align:middle line:90%
originate in the Amazon.

00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:01.680 align:middle line:84%
Yet these practices rarely only
revolved around one substance

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.905 align:middle line:90%
or even one organism.

00:13:02.905 --> 00:13:05.440 align:middle line:90%


00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.570 align:middle line:10%
Another amphibian containing
a number of bioactive peptides

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:15.030 align:middle line:10%
can be found in this region,
not on the ground like a toad

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:16.680 align:middle line:10%
but higher up in the trees.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.480 align:middle line:10%


00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:25.240 align:middle line:10%
This is Phyllomedusa bicolor,
or the giant monkey frog.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Like with the
Sonoran Desert toad,

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:32.980 align:middle line:84%
the frog secretion known as
kambo is scraped off the frog.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:38.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Kambo is an interesting
medicine in that it has no

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:41.740 align:middle line:10%
psychoactive
effects on the body.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.980 align:middle line:10%
The primary purpose
of working with kambo

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:51.890 align:middle line:10%
is to cleanse, detoxify,
and purify your body.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:56.208 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a big detox for
your liver, your organs.

00:13:56.208 --> 00:13:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Your liver works really hard,
and it pumps out a lot of bile.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:00.680 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like liver surgery.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.630 align:middle line:10%
>> This is not a
party to be prepared.

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's not a
recreational drug.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.450 align:middle line:90%
Kambo is not psychedelic at all.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:09.610 align:middle line:90%
It's a purgitive.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.730 align:middle line:84%
You're literally cleaning
out your body, energetically,

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:19.120 align:middle line:84%
spiritually, physically on
a cellular level by purging.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>> This medicine, many times
it's dried on these sticks

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.440 align:middle line:90%
and reactivated with water.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Before the medicine
can be applied,

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:33.490 align:middle line:84%
a small, tiny
burn, a little dot,

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:36.430 align:middle line:84%
is applied on the
skin in the area

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:41.200 align:middle line:84%
where the frog
poison is applied.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Burn marks are made to
the upper layer of skin.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.950 align:middle line:10%
And then tiny amounts
of the frog's venom

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:50.200 align:middle line:10%
is applied to the marks.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.100 align:middle line:10%
The effects of the
venom arrive quickly.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.680 align:middle line:90%
A detox process begins.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Within several minutes,
your heart starts to race.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.460 align:middle line:84%
You start to feel waves
of nausea in your body.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Many people also get
puffiness in their face

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.490 align:middle line:90%
and in their body.

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And you throw up for
somewhere around 20 minutes.

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And in that process, you're
purging so many things.

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:21.580 align:middle line:84%
It's happening so quickly,
but you definitely

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:25.900 align:middle line:84%
feel this presence of
this spirit of this frog

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.660 align:middle line:84%
and it teaching you,
throughout the process,

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:32.690 align:middle line:84%

And after a half an
hour, normally you

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:09.320 align:middle line:10%
have purged enough.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.910 align:middle line:84%

Sananga is not necessarily a
psychedelic medicine but rather

because it's like an energetic
lightness in the body.

And this is actually
addressing how

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:23.850 align:middle line:84%
it's removing some of these
things that accumulate

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:25.500 align:middle line:90%
in our energetic fields.

So they call it-- it's
like cleansing the aura.

It also gets the pineal gland
moving a little more fluidly.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:39.370 align:middle line:84%
So it can open up the inner

mainstream scientific consensus

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.810 align:middle line:84%
for Sananga's benefits, the
shamans proclaim that the real

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:51.070 align:middle line:84%
transformation is happening at
a deeper level of reality than

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:53.410 align:middle line:90%
only with the physical body.

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Many cultures consider
spiritual hygiene to be

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:58.240 align:middle line:84%
as important, if
not more important,

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.020 align:middle line:90%
than physical hygiene.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And so this is one of the
medicines they use for that.

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Smokable tobacco, mapacho,
also plays a role in many

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:11.260 align:middle line:90%
ayahuasca ceremonies.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.800 align:middle line:10%
>> So mapacho tobacco, the
tobacco is regarded to be

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.380 align:middle line:10%
another master plan,
another teacher plan,

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:20.290 align:middle line:10%
a strong spiritual teacher
highly regarded throughout

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:21.580 align:middle line:10%
the Americas.

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Here in North America,
tobacco is highly respected.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.680 align:middle line:84%
It's something you can
commune with that can help you

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.740 align:middle line:90%
in your spiritual work.

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:33.590 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, huge risk of
abuse and destruction.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:36.130 align:middle line:90%
And the cigarette industry--

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:40.690 align:middle line:84%
very different from
the ceremonial use.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>> That a teacher plant like
tobacco has become corrupted

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:48.130 align:middle line:84%
by commerce could serve as
a cautionary tale for other

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:52.030 align:middle line:84%
medicines as they gain
interest and acceptance.

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think tobacco, for
me, is a very beautiful,

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.800 align:middle line:90%
sacred plant.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.470 align:middle line:10%
There's ways to bring that
back and that reverence and all

00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:59.270 align:middle line:10%
that stuff.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:03.190 align:middle line:84%
But you have to bring in other
values besides just how much

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:04.777 align:middle line:90%
money you can make off of it.

00:21:04.777 --> 00:21:06.610 align:middle line:84%
You have to bring other
values to the table.

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:09.580 align:middle line:90%


00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:13.000 align:middle line:10%
>> The modernization of the
world and our insatiable

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.540 align:middle line:10%
appetite for resources
has placed many species

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:19.735 align:middle line:10%
of amphibians and
teacher plants in peril.

00:21:19.735 --> 00:21:23.710 align:middle line:90%


00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:27.520 align:middle line:84%
Also, the growing public
interest in these medicines

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.460 align:middle line:84%
does call into question
the imposing stresses

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:35.110 align:middle line:84%
that psychoactive tourism places
upon these fragile ecosystems,

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:37.990 align:middle line:84%
where the native flora
and fauna are sought out

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:39.115 align:middle line:90%
in increasing demand.

00:21:39.115 --> 00:21:42.530 align:middle line:90%


00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:47.360 align:middle line:84%
Over time, mankind evolved,
technology advanced,

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.920 align:middle line:90%
and the population boomed.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.660 align:middle line:90%


00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.320 align:middle line:84%
But the planet has
paid a terrible price.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.990 align:middle line:90%
We deplete precious resources.

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:04.140 align:middle line:84%
We've polluted our
soil, water, and air.

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.840 align:middle line:84%
As the climate
shifts, wildfires have

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.810 align:middle line:84%
become commonplace
throughout the world,

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:13.680 align:middle line:84%
threatening some of our most
fragile and complex ecosystems.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:18.410 align:middle line:90%


00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:24.100 align:middle line:10%
The massive fires in California
made headlines in 2020.

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:28.440 align:middle line:84%
But large parts of Australia
and the Amazon burned as well.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:31.240 align:middle line:90%


00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.610 align:middle line:84%
For amphibians like
the Sonoran desert

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:40.500 align:middle line:84%
toad and the giant monkey
frog, the future is grim.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:44.640 align:middle line:10%
In 2019, a study published
in "Current Biology"

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.520 align:middle line:10%
laid it out in stark terms.

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.280 align:middle line:84%
Human activities have
put more than half

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:55.560 align:middle line:84%
of the world's amphibians
in danger of extinction.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.560 align:middle line:84%
As interest in
psychedelics rises,

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.110 align:middle line:84%
could we be
unnecessarily endangering

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:05.220 align:middle line:84%
some of these
creatures even more?

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Many in the community
have begun to discuss

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:11.940 align:middle line:84%
the long-term sustainability
of animal and plant-based

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:15.960 align:middle line:84%
psychedelics and that these
animals should be treated

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:19.440 align:middle line:84%
with respect and not
just a means to an end

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.440 align:middle line:90%
to experience a spiritual trend.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a growing interest
in psychoactive substances all

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:27.400 align:middle line:90%
over the planet.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.060 align:middle line:10%
And it has become many
people's livelihood.

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.820 align:middle line:10%
Although there are many
benefits for this happening

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:36.420 align:middle line:10%
in our society, it is putting an
increased burden on the planet

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.490 align:middle line:10%
to provide these substances.

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:42.000 align:middle line:84%
So the challenge
we face is there's

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.050 align:middle line:84%
overharvesting of things
like peyote or ibogaine

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:48.900 align:middle line:84%
and some of the
DMT-secreting toads.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And some of these plant
and animal species

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:54.940 align:middle line:90%
are in danger of extinction.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:58.170 align:middle line:10%
So we need to bring
this to the awareness

00:23:58.170 --> 00:23:59.860 align:middle line:10%
of the psychedelic community.

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:02.370 align:middle line:10%
And although they
bring many benefits,

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:04.260 align:middle line:10%
we have to honor the
ability of the planet

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:05.840 align:middle line:10%
to provide these substances.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.670 align:middle line:90%


00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:12.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Many eco-conscious
psychedelic advocates have

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:15.990 align:middle line:10%
encouraged the use of
synthetically-produced 5-MeO,

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:20.840 align:middle line:10%
which is structurally identical
to what's found in toad venom.

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.450 align:middle line:10%
However, like with
synthesization

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:29.150 align:middle line:10%
of any organic compound,
ingestion or use of 5-MeO-DMT

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:32.720 align:middle line:10%
may cause unforeseen
hazards given its novelty

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.910 align:middle line:10%
to human brain chemistry.

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:40.160 align:middle line:10%
>> We have now serious problem
because of this extreme

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:44.285 align:middle line:10%
interest in plants and
harvesting toad venom

00:24:44.285 --> 00:24:49.130 align:middle line:10%
in the Bufo alvarius that
contains 5-MeO-DMT that I

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:52.460 align:middle line:10%
believe that, if we carefully
study what these plants truly

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:57.540 align:middle line:10%
contain, to synthesize them
to recreate the experience.

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:01.490 align:middle line:10%
>> So in an effort to preserve
some of these endangered

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:05.660 align:middle line:10%
species, we know that there
are analogs that can be created

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:10.400 align:middle line:10%
in labs that can replace some
of these substances and have

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.190 align:middle line:10%
similar or the same effects.

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
there is a debate

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:20.000 align:middle line:84%
of the chemical creation of
this versus the natural world.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.970 align:middle line:10%
But we have to look at
the big picture of Gaia

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:25.580 align:middle line:10%
and honoring her
creation and the gift

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:28.850 align:middle line:10%
that we get from these
substances versus the challenge

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:34.200 align:middle line:10%
we face in overharvesting and
overusing what is provided.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.920 align:middle line:10%
So I think the way that this
challenge can be overcome

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:42.380 align:middle line:10%
is through using ceremonial
and clear intention

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:44.210 align:middle line:10%
and the right set and setting.

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:46.250 align:middle line:10%
Any of these chemicals,
whether they're

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:49.400 align:middle line:10%
lab derived or
harvested from nature,

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.790 align:middle line:10%
can have the effect intended.

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:56.420 align:middle line:10%
>> A philosophical divergence
among psychedelic advocates has

00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:00.350 align:middle line:10%
emerged between purists
who prefer medicines from

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:05.330 align:middle line:10%
the natural world and those
open to lab-derived compounds.

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:08.720 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't think that people
will have the same energetic

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.950 align:middle line:10%
experience with a
lab-derived compound.

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:16.250 align:middle line:84%
But I think that there
could certainly still

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:21.320 align:middle line:84%
be healing derived from more
artificial compounds that

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.410 align:middle line:84%
don't take advantage of
our natural resources

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:26.566 align:middle line:90%
and deplete them.

00:26:26.566 --> 00:26:31.280 align:middle line:84%
In Western culture, we are
very accustomed to having

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.590 align:middle line:90%
what we want when we want it.

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And in Indigenous
cultures, the way

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:40.400 align:middle line:84%
that these medicines and plants
and animals were worked with

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:45.200 align:middle line:84%
was seasonal and it was
a very sacred process.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.600 align:middle line:10%
We have to be very
mindful in the way

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:53.370 align:middle line:10%
that we come with respect
and reverence and awareness

00:26:53.370 --> 00:27:00.770 align:middle line:10%
so that we don't ravage these
beautiful sacred medicines.

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The key to sustainability
might be honing our ability

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:08.240 align:middle line:84%
to produce some of these
chemicals on our own.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.210 align:middle line:84%
You see, it isn't
just the amphibians

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:12.815 align:middle line:90%
that can create 5-MeO-DMT.

00:27:12.815 --> 00:27:15.660 align:middle line:90%


00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:19.560 align:middle line:84%
In the summer of 2019,
the University of Michigan

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:23.250 align:middle line:84%
released a study that concluded
that the brain produces

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:27.760 align:middle line:84%
DMT at higher levels
than previously expected.

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.990 align:middle line:10%
Not only would this support
Dr. Rick Strassman's theories

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:34.500 align:middle line:10%
about the pineal
gland secreting DMT,

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.710 align:middle line:10%
it expands on them
as the neurons

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:41.280 align:middle line:10%
necessary for creating
DMT were also found

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.960 align:middle line:10%
in other parts of the brain.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.780 align:middle line:10%
But why?

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible endogenous DMT
is necessary for brain health?

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:55.490 align:middle line:10%
>> There are some data from
Hungary which indicate that DMT

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:59.870 align:middle line:10%
is what is called
neuroprotective in conditions

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:04.310 align:middle line:10%
of low levels of oxygen in
the brain, which means that,

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:08.330 align:middle line:10%
if you're not providing your
brain with enough oxygen,

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:11.160 align:middle line:10%
your nerve cells begin to die.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And DMT seems to
inhibit the bad effect

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:18.140 align:middle line:84%
of a low level of
oxygen. And that's

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:22.110 align:middle line:84%
why the DMT, theoretically,
is being released.

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:24.410 align:middle line:10%
>> The human experience
is a human trip.

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:27.590 align:middle line:10%
We're tripping on the endogenous
chemicals all the time.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And they're in three different
categories, neurotransmitters

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:34.860 align:middle line:90%
and enzymes and hormones.

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.640 align:middle line:84%
So the body is a
lab, and the body

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.780 align:middle line:84%
runs on chemicals
and on electricity.

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:47.560 align:middle line:84%
But exercising, breath work,
doing yoga, meditation,

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.890 align:middle line:84%
singing, dancing
are various ways

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:56.280 align:middle line:84%
to alter consciousness to
learn about who we are.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is definitely
something worthy of exploration

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:02.780 align:middle line:84%
to rely on the inner
pharmacy that's

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:06.350 align:middle line:84%
within us, on the
alchemical process

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:08.760 align:middle line:90%
to become our own apothecaries.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.510 align:middle line:90%


00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>> What if the future of
psychedelic use belongs not

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:20.210 align:middle line:84%
in earthly resources but the
discovery that our bodies are

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:25.070 align:middle line:84%
psychedelic chemical factories
capable of generating its own

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:28.130 align:middle line:84%
consciousness-altering
substances?

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Breath is one of the most
important things in life.

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:37.700 align:middle line:10%
And so any intention that
we can bring into our breath

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:42.020 align:middle line:10%
and connecting to our breath
and becoming better at breathing

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:47.400 align:middle line:10%
is incredible for our spiritual
growth and development.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And so when we look at this
idea of holotropic breathwork,

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:57.110 align:middle line:84%
for example, we are activating
that in and out breath

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:58.010 align:middle line:90%
within us.

00:29:58.010 --> 00:30:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And in that, we start to
produce endogenous DMT.

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:09.830 align:middle line:84%
We produce serotonin,
pinoline, 5-MeO-DMT, and that

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:12.210 align:middle line:90%
gets released within our body.

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And we start to have
these powerful states

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:18.730 align:middle line:90%
of transcendence.

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:21.370 align:middle line:10%
>> I started calling
it holotropic,

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:23.980 align:middle line:10%
which means moving
toward wholeness,

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:27.340 align:middle line:10%
that actually we are missing
something very significant

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:31.270 align:middle line:10%
because our perception is very
limited in our ordinary state

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:32.320 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.570 align:middle line:84%
We are experiencing
just a small fraction

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:37.760 align:middle line:90%
of our experiential potential.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.190 align:middle line:90%
So it really is fulfilling.

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:43.070 align:middle line:84%
It brings us to full
understanding of who we are.

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:46.940 align:middle line:84%
It's all well documented
in psychedelic research

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:50.070 align:middle line:84%
and confirmed by
holotropic breathwork.

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:52.500 align:middle line:84%
If you would still
think that somehow

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.170 align:middle line:84%
a result of these
exotic substances,

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:57.360 align:middle line:84%
then when we work with
holotropic breathwork,

00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:01.410 align:middle line:84%
it's faster breathing, music,
and certain kind of body work.

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:04.800 align:middle line:84%
It can't be much simpler than
that, much more elementary

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.390 align:middle line:90%
than that, you know?

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And you still have the same
kind of range of experiences.

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:14.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's so profound and
exciting that we ourselves are

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:20.080 align:middle line:84%
able to achieve these mystical
states without any external

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.820 align:middle line:90%
compounds or plants.

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:24.010 align:middle line:90%
We can do it even on our own.

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:27.680 align:middle line:90%


00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:30.680 align:middle line:10%
>> With their histories
of ceremonial use,

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.650 align:middle line:10%
each spanning back
thousands of years,

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:38.630 align:middle line:10%
snuffs and amphibian venom can
help people unlock profound

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:41.130 align:middle line:10%
experiences.

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:44.000 align:middle line:84%
But the need for conservation
of these creatures

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.440 align:middle line:84%
and their habitats
reminds us that we too

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:52.310 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to produce
some of the same compounds

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:53.110 align:middle line:90%
ourselves.

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:58.670 align:middle line:90%


00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:02.720 align:middle line:10%
Up next, as cannabis gains
widespread mainstream

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.090 align:middle line:10%
acceptance, we
learn more about how

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:09.950 align:middle line:10%
its gifts can change the future
and how commercialization could

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:12.170 align:middle line:10%
threaten to bring it all down.
