>> The story of psilocybin,
or commonly known as magic

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.040 align:middle line:84%
mushrooms, is a long
and controversial one.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Because of Hollywood, Disney
films, and word of mouth,

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.080 align:middle line:84%
psychedelic mushrooms have been
given a serious reputation.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.770 align:middle line:90%
Are they drugs?

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.660 align:middle line:90%
Are they medicine?

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.540 align:middle line:90%
Are they safe?

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.090 align:middle line:90%
Are they keys to heaven or hell?

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's put the rumors
aside and investigate

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.830 align:middle line:90%
what we know to date.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.560 align:middle line:84%
It has been suggested that
because psilocybin mushrooms

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.830 align:middle line:84%
most commonly grew in
droppings of cattle

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.110 align:middle line:84%
and these animals have
been revered and followed

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.600 align:middle line:84%
by many humans and religions
for thousands of years,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.110 align:middle line:84%
it is unlikely that our
ancestors disregarded

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.239 align:middle line:84%
these mushrooms and
ignored experiencing

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.620 align:middle line:90%
their mind-bending effects.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.660 align:middle line:84%
What exactly is the mysterious
world of the magic mushroom

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.390 align:middle line:90%
experience?

What is the latest scientific
research showing us?

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.600 align:middle line:84%
What are the most cutting edge
and cultural uses of them?

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And what might they
be trying to teach us?

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.660 align:middle line:84%
These strange beings
have been speculated

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.720 align:middle line:90%
to predate the human race.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.240 align:middle line:84%

survive intergalactic space

floating from unknown distances
to our planet, our species,

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:41.875 align:middle line:90%
and into our minds.

Mushroom species outnumber
plant species 10 to 1,

and their mycelia
spreads far and wide

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.220 align:middle line:84%
under the Earth to connect with,
communicate to, and integrate

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.240 align:middle line:84%
a fractal web across
many life forms.

were used in Mexico,

the psilocybin mushrooms
by the Aztecs, the Mayans,

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.640 align:middle line:10%
and probably the Mazatecs,
and even older cultures.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.150 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
epicenter of the use

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.210 align:middle line:84%
of these Psilocybe cubensis,
which grows on cow dung

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.160 align:middle line:84%
and is a globally
distributed mushroom.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.300 align:middle line:84%
They'll show up pretty much
in any pasture in the tropics

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.250 align:middle line:90%
where you have cattle.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.750 align:middle line:84%
So they had to be around
for millions of years,

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.780 align:middle line:84%
you know, or many hundreds
of thousands of years,

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.640 align:middle line:84%
probably in proximity
to human civilizations

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.590 align:middle line:84%
or nomadic tribes,
if they had cattle.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.700 align:middle line:84%
But then we also
know there's evidence

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.750 align:middle line:84%
they were used in Europe and
probably in South America,

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.680 align:middle line:90%
maybe in Africa, maybe in Asia.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.540 align:middle line:90%
So how long have they been used?

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.830 align:middle line:90%
There's no way to know.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.790 align:middle line:84%
But I would like to think they'd
been used a very long time.

>> Because most of the classical
psychedelics require human

intervention, psilocybin
mushrooms were probably

the first psychedelic
to be discovered,

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.370 align:middle line:10%
as they grew anywhere in the
tropics or subtropical climates

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.320 align:middle line:10%

the droppings of large animals

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.420 align:middle line:10%
like cows.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.120 align:middle line:84%

as a foot tall with a cap

the size of a dinner plate.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.330 align:middle line:84%
It's likely that the
first wave of experiences

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.100 align:middle line:84%
with eating these
mushrooms would

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.080 align:middle line:84%
have made the individual think
that they had been poisoned.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.750 align:middle line:84%
But after a while, the
phenomena would likely

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.140 align:middle line:84%
have been seen as divine,
otherworldly, and, quite

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.680 align:middle line:84%
possibly, an experience
with death and rebirth,

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.970 align:middle line:90%
a resurrection of the psyche.

or the ergot fungus

Steve Gordon Wasson, who brought
the Mexican magic mushrooms

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:48.300 align:middle line:84%
from the Mazatec culture and
Carl Ruck, a Greek scholar.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.320 align:middle line:84%
They spent several years,
very, very meticulous research,

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.100 align:middle line:84%
and they came to the conclusion
that the key was a beverage,

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.623 align:middle line:84%
sacred beverage, which
was called Kykeon,

00:05:58.623 --> 00:06:04.770 align:middle line:84%
K-Y-K-E-O-N that was
administered in a very critical

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.290 align:middle line:90%
part of the ceremony.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>> These mysterious events
spanned from 1,600 BC to 392 AD

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.820 align:middle line:84%
until Theodosius I
closed the sanctuaries.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.560 align:middle line:84%
The exact recipe has
never been found,

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.140 align:middle line:84%
and the last remaining

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.990 align:middle line:84%
was demolished by King
Alaric of the Goths,

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.490 align:middle line:84%
who brought a Christian invasion
to destroy the old sites.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.980 align:middle line:84%
This invasion was the
beginning of a long reign

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.290 align:middle line:84%
of the new religion
in town, forbidding

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.530 align:middle line:90%
the use of plant sacraments.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.550 align:middle line:10%
Now, fast forward to 1955.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.880 align:middle line:10%
R. Gordon Wasson, who is an
amateur mycologist and banker

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.330 align:middle line:10%
to JP Morgan, made his
way to Sierra Mazateca

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:53.430 align:middle line:10%
in Southern Mexico to visit a
curandera named Maria Sabina.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.190 align:middle line:10%
In this shamanic
village, Sabina was

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:01.180 align:middle line:10%
known for healing her community
with powerful mushroom rituals.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.400 align:middle line:84%
She agreed to welcome
Wasson into one

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.460 align:middle line:84%
of the rituals in good faith
that he could take pictures,

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.490 align:middle line:84%
but none were allowed
to be published.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.030 align:middle line:84%
This was to maintain the sacred
space of those being healed

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.340 align:middle line:84%
and to protect the village
from outsiders knowing

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.960 align:middle line:90%
too much of their rituals.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.260 align:middle line:84%
So Wasson agreed and
proceeded to take

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.350 align:middle line:84%
private pictures of Maria
Sabina calling in the mushroom

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.100 align:middle line:90%
spirits for healing.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.040 align:middle line:10%
>> She said the spirits in
the mushrooms, the ninos,

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.450 align:middle line:10%
little children, were the ones
that she worked with in concert

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.860 align:middle line:10%
with the mushroom entities
for healing for her patients.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.800 align:middle line:10%
So, Gordon Wasson went down,
and had a photographer,

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.980 align:middle line:10%
and had a team of people,
and published this in 1957,

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.880 align:middle line:10%
a hit in "Life Magazine"
in 1957 and then

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.690 align:middle line:10%
got into every home
in middle America

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:55.100 align:middle line:10%
and basically initiated
the psychedelic '60s in '57

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.460 align:middle line:10%
by telling people that
this mushroom existed

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.890 align:middle line:10%
in New Mexico, which altered
consciousness and had

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:01.610 align:middle line:10%
this shamanic lineage.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>> On May 13, 1957,
"Life Magazine"

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.780 align:middle line:84%
published Wasson's photographs,
and the story of the mushroom

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.230 align:middle line:84%
rituals swept through
the Western world.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.110 align:middle line:10%
Flocks of Americans began
to flood this small town

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.690 align:middle line:10%
in search of the most
mind-expanding experience they

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.760 align:middle line:10%
could find.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Sabina was reported as saying,
it doesn't work in this way.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.250 align:middle line:84%
The spirits of the
mushrooms helped

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.460 align:middle line:84%
to heal humanity from illness
instead of introducing them

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.540 align:middle line:90%
to God.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.790 align:middle line:10%
But by this point,
the Western world

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.710 align:middle line:10%
was hypnotized by
the claims being

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:37.190 align:middle line:10%
made about these mushrooms,
and shortly thereafter,

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:42.620 align:middle line:10%
the university studies began,
but not without pushback.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.480 align:middle line:10%
>> There is nothing smart.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:49.400 align:middle line:10%
There's nothing grown up or
sophisticated in taking an LSD

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.220 align:middle line:10%
trip at all.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.210 align:middle line:10%
They're just being
complete fools.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Don't you feel that it's
wrong to encourage the use

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:59.410 align:middle line:84%
of these illegal drugs
by college students.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:01.520 align:middle line:84%
This is, in effect,
admitting encouraging

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.917 align:middle line:90%
the breaking of the law?

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:05.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I never tell anyone
what to do with their body

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.190 align:middle line:10%
because what we're talking
about here is the first and last

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.580 align:middle line:10%
frontier of freedom, my body.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Timothy Leary was a part of
the original psilocybin studies

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:18.260 align:middle line:90%
at Harvard University.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.320 align:middle line:10%
40 years after these studies
and after the prohibition

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.260 align:middle line:10%
of psychedelics
finally loosened,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.990 align:middle line:10%
professor of psychiatry
and behavioral sciences

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:31.250 align:middle line:10%
at Johns Hopkins University,
Dr. Roland Griffiths,

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:35.060 align:middle line:10%
took up psilocybin
research once more.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:40.520 align:middle line:10%
>> We began our studies in 2000,
and I initiated my interest

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.700 align:middle line:10%
in this because I had taken
a meditation practice up,

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:49.520 align:middle line:10%
and I was interested in shifts
in states of consciousness.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.360 align:middle line:84%
I was actually
skeptical about the idea

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.020 align:middle line:84%
that psilocybin
could produce deeply

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.860 align:middle line:84%
spiritually-significant,
mystical-type experiences.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:06.620 align:middle line:84%
But indeed, the data spoke very
clearly to us that it could.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.850 align:middle line:84%
So we did choose psilocybin,
I think thoughtfully.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:13.670 align:middle line:90%


00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.340 align:middle line:84%
One is that most people
at the time we initiated

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.310 align:middle line:84%
this work couldn't
spell psilocybin,

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:23.210 align:middle line:84%
didn't quite know what
it was, and it certainly

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:29.340 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the cultural
baggage that LSD did.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:34.470 align:middle line:84%
So LSD and mescaline have
very long duration of action,

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:38.090 align:middle line:84%
more on the order of
12 hours as opposed

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:42.440 align:middle line:84%
to psilocybin, which
is four to six hours.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.560 align:middle line:84%
So that makes it a much
more tractable compound

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.530 align:middle line:84%
to work with in a
clinical setting.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:53.240 align:middle line:84%
DMT, on the other hand, is
very short acting and can also

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:58.430 align:middle line:90%
be given with an MAO inhibitor.

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>> An MAO inhibitor makes
DMT last four to six hours.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.180 align:middle line:84%
But the pharmacology is
more complex and difficult

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.670 align:middle line:84%
to receive approval
from the FDA.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:10.310 align:middle line:84%
However, psilocybin
produces similar results

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:12.150 align:middle line:90%
with far less complexity.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:15.380 align:middle line:10%
>> The psilocybin molecule
and the DMT molecule are very

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.880 align:middle line:10%
closely related to one another.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.760 align:middle line:10%
In a sense, psilocybin
can be rightly described

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:28.970 align:middle line:10%
as orally-active DMT because DMT
is not normally orally active.

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though the
molecules are very similar,

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.580 align:middle line:84%
the mind-expanding experiences
aren't as similar as it would

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.160 align:middle line:90%
seem.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Each psychedelic molecule,
called a tryptamine,

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:41.180 align:middle line:84%
is structured in a
very specific way

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:44.550 align:middle line:84%
to trigger specific
neurotransmitters in the brain,

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:48.480 align:middle line:84%
causing every psychedelic plant
to elicit different effects.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.750 align:middle line:10%
And it all depends upon
the neurotransmitters

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:53.540 align:middle line:10%
that the substances play on.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Serotonin mimicking is the
hallmark of psychedelica.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Serotonin allows
human consciousness

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.360 align:middle line:84%
to assemble the consensus
reality that we typically

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:07.250 align:middle line:84%
inhabit, and it even forges
our sense of self and identity,

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:10.280 align:middle line:84%
and psilocybin mushrooms break
down the rigid perceptions

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.150 align:middle line:90%
of normal waking consciousness.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Psilocybin appears acutely
to decrease activity within

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:22.760 align:middle line:84%
a certain network of brain
hubs called the default mode

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.200 align:middle line:90%
network.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:30.110 align:middle line:10%
And that network is very active
under conditions of vigilance

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:34.730 align:middle line:10%
and depression, and
it's deactivated

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:39.170 align:middle line:10%
when people are, for instance,
long-term meditators.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's thought that
that area is somehow

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:48.140 align:middle line:84%
tied up in with respect to
self-referential processing,

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.360 align:middle line:90%
a sense of self.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.420 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that
psilocybin decreases

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:56.630 align:middle line:84%
default mode networking
or functioning much

00:12:56.630 --> 00:13:00.350 align:middle line:84%
as the same way that
meditation decreases

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:03.440 align:middle line:90%
activity in that brain center.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And that brain center happens
to be activated in depression.

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:11.780 align:middle line:84%
So that might account for
anti-depressant effects

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.090 align:middle line:90%
of psilocybin.

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:17.180 align:middle line:10%
>> The fact that brain imaging
is now showing similar results

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:20.330 align:middle line:10%
between the benefits of
psilocybin and meditation has

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.660 align:middle line:10%
not only confirmed what
Tim Leary, Richard Alpert,

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.360 align:middle line:10%
and Ralph Metzner were looking
for in the original Harvard

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.390 align:middle line:10%
studies, it seems to lend to the
healing properties of ancient

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:34.340 align:middle line:10%
shamanic tribes as well.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:37.760 align:middle line:84%
For the experiences met
within the psilocybin trip

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.970 align:middle line:84%
are seen by spiritual
adepts to be mere glimpses

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:43.850 align:middle line:90%
into the higher domains.

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:46.140 align:middle line:84%
They are not necessary
to get us there.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And if done
irresponsibly, they will

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:50.390 align:middle line:84%
atrophy our inner
faculties that allow

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:54.270 align:middle line:84%
us to achieve these states
without these substances.

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.300 align:middle line:84%
So the judicious
use of psychedelics

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:59.510 align:middle line:84%
are seen by many to be merely
the reminder that these states

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:02.240 align:middle line:84%
exist, that inner
healing is possible,

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.580 align:middle line:84%
that human consciousness
is not static,

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.740 align:middle line:90%
but an ever-evolving phenomena.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, long-term meditators
and psilocybin volunteers

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:13.310 align:middle line:84%
at Johns Hopkins are tapping
into their own neurology

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:17.180 align:middle line:84%
and disrupting the inner
identity that is unwell.

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.670 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean that
de-stabilizing people's sense

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.760 align:middle line:84%
of self can be
useful in healing?

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Is it because human illness lies
in our beliefs about ourselves

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.910 align:middle line:84%
and how we fit into
the world around us?

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:32.412 align:middle line:84%
Why are the same effects
seen in long-term meditators?

00:14:32.412 --> 00:14:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>> They are fundamentally
re-organizational experiences

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:42.520 align:middle line:84%
that people describe as having
a sense of interconnectedness

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:46.920 align:middle line:84%
of all people and things,
a sense of sacredness,

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.350 align:middle line:84%
a truth value and authenticity
to the experience that they

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:56.050 align:middle line:84%
find uniquely compelling and
authoritative, positive mood,

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:59.290 align:middle line:84%
a sense of love or
open heartedness,

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:04.290 align:middle line:84%
transcendence of time and
space, and then another feature

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:05.890 align:middle line:90%
described is ineffability.

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:09.850 align:middle line:84%
They find it difficult to put
these experiences in words.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether it's caused by
a psychedelic substance,

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.640 align:middle line:84%
the act of meditation,
or caused spontaneously,

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.700 align:middle line:84%
recalling mystical-type
experiences in words seems

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.950 align:middle line:84%
to pale in comparison to
the underlying meaning.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.280 align:middle line:84%
However, whether the
experience itself

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.620 align:middle line:84%
can be spoken about or
not, psilocybin mushrooms

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:30.820 align:middle line:84%
are being found to help with a
number of epidemic-level health

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.620 align:middle line:90%
issues in the modern world.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>> The spectrum of therapeutic
effects are great, you know,

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:43.450 align:middle line:84%
anxiety in terminal
patients, anxiety about--

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:47.380 align:middle line:84%
existential anxiety for
people who are dying.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.580 align:middle line:90%
That's one.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.580 align:middle line:90%
PTSD, it's promising for that.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.680 align:middle line:84%
It looks promising
for addictions.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.700 align:middle line:84%
There's been spectacular work
on psilocybin and smoking

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.820 align:middle line:84%
cessation, which is
kind of unexpected,

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:04.690 align:middle line:84%
but it's very effective
for smoking cessation.

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:06.460 align:middle line:90%
Depression is another one.

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Depression is being identified
as these FDA protocols are

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:17.830 align:middle line:84%
advanced, and
psilocybin can have

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:19.960 align:middle line:90%
a therapeutic effect on it.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>> While so many mental and
physical health issues are

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:25.580 align:middle line:84%
given hope in the face of
new psilocybin research,

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.520 align:middle line:84%
the fact that
federally-controlled research

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.270 align:middle line:84%
is being overseen by someone who
is open to studying and mapping

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.910 align:middle line:84%
even the abstract phenomena
that fill people with purpose

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and meaning is hopeful to those
who believe that there is more

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.990 align:middle line:84%
than meets the eye behind
these psychedelic journeys that

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:42.280 align:middle line:90%
people are explaining.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that the most
compelling and remarkable

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:middle line:84%
finding across all of our
populations is that psilocybin,

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:56.020 align:middle line:84%
when administered under these
conditions to people who have

00:16:56.020 --> 00:17:01.040 align:middle line:84%
been carefully screened and
prepared and then received

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:05.500 align:middle line:84%
psilocybin in a setting such
as this when they are laying

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:09.369 align:middle line:84%
on a couch, and have eye
shades on, and headphones,

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:14.680 align:middle line:84%
and they're in the presence
of people who have developed

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:18.099 align:middle line:84%
rapport and trust with them,
that the great majority

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:23.619 align:middle line:84%
of these people have these
remarkable experiences that,

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:26.380 align:middle line:84%
in fact, map on to
naturally-occurring,

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.890 align:middle line:90%
mystical-type experiences.

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>> When the mindset and physical
setting has been carefully

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:35.500 align:middle line:84%
constructed for a
healing experience,

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.690 align:middle line:84%
there is an abundance
of accounts of not only

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:41.410 align:middle line:84%
the occurrence of healing, but a
congruent sense of a deep inner

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:44.350 align:middle line:84%
knowing that the healing is
beyond physical mechanisms

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:47.650 align:middle line:84%
alone, that an underlying
universal shift is taking

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:50.560 align:middle line:84%
place, and the whole
being, not just the body,

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.400 align:middle line:84%
is receiving healing, that we
are more than what we could

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.790 align:middle line:84%
ever conceive of and, in
fact, we are all different

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:00.880 align:middle line:84%
expressions of the
same underlying fabric.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And because these
mushrooms reliably

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:05.830 align:middle line:84%
bring about these
experiences, the neurology

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:09.610 align:middle line:84%
can finally be analyzed
in a scientific setting.

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:13.420 align:middle line:10%
>> We know that people have
such experiences in absence

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:17.530 align:middle line:10%
of psychedelics, but under
these special set and setting

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:22.450 align:middle line:10%
conditions, we can occasion
these experiences at very high

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:24.880 align:middle line:10%
probability.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And that opens this up
to the interrogation

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:34.960 align:middle line:84%
by scientific method so
we can now ask questions

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.070 align:middle line:84%
about the nature of
these experiences

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:42.610 align:middle line:84%
and the transformative changes
that heretofore couldn't

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:47.330 align:middle line:84%
be asked because we didn't
understand what processes

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:52.180 align:middle line:84%
or what conditions
optimize the probability

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.730 align:middle line:90%
of these experiences.

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Because scientific technology
has advanced considerably since

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:02.380 align:middle line:84%
the 1960 Harvard studies,
psilocybin effects on the brain

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:06.180 align:middle line:90%
are far more understood today.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.970 align:middle line:84%
With the destabilization
of the default mode network

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:12.030 align:middle line:84%
in the brain, causing for
internal neural communication

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:14.940 align:middle line:84%
to change dramatically,
we have a glimpse

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:19.080 align:middle line:84%
at what functions of the
brain hold trauma in the body.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Most physiological illness that
has been conditioned into us

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:24.870 align:middle line:84%
is seen as unhealthy
communication

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:26.910 align:middle line:90%
between brain regions.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:28.800 align:middle line:84%
When someone has the
opportunity to view

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.490 align:middle line:84%
their life, their beliefs, their
world, and the interactions

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:35.420 align:middle line:84%
between them all in a new
and unbiased perspective,

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:38.220 align:middle line:84%
as psychedelics
often do, it seems

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.800 align:middle line:84%
that the innate intelligence
of the human being

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.440 align:middle line:84%
can identify the
communication error

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and bring neurochemical
processes back into balance.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Whereas most pharmaceutical
meds address symptoms only,

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.640 align:middle line:84%
and most of the time
merely mask them,

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.660 align:middle line:84%
psilocybin is being
seen to address

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.760 align:middle line:84%
the source of these
symptoms, causing

00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:01.260 align:middle line:84%
a lasting rippling effect
into all areas of life.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:05.340 align:middle line:10%
>> I think that the most
interesting feature is not that

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:10.080 align:middle line:10%
these drugs produce these
acute salient effects,

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:14.310 align:middle line:10%
but that these effects are
remembered, and there--

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:19.980 align:middle line:10%
and there become attribution
points for which people say,

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.420 align:middle line:10%
you know, I remember that
experience every day.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.630 align:middle line:84%
My life has changed
because of it.

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:27.780 align:middle line:84%
My attitudes have
changed because of it.

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:32.130 align:middle line:84%
We really only, at this
point, have the faintest hint

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:36.120 align:middle line:84%
of what kind of network
processes, what kind of brain

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.280 align:middle line:90%
processes, are altered.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.980 align:middle line:84%
Exactly which networks are
involved and how they interact

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:47.220 align:middle line:84%
is still largely
a mystery to us.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Perhaps science is still
unable to definitively map

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:52.740 align:middle line:84%
the neurological
basis of psilocybin.

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.260 align:middle line:84%
But new advancements are
seeing in our understanding

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.570 align:middle line:84%
of these mushrooms'
effects on the brain.

00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:00.900 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, to arrive at the
mind bending and life changing

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.090 align:middle line:84%
experiences that
they afford, people

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:04.800 align:middle line:84%
have been left to
secretive methods

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.220 align:middle line:84%
to get their hands on them,
keeping this age-old sacrament

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and it's shamanic use
alive in the underground.

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Mushrooms are recolonizing
the world right now one

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:16.790 align:middle line:90%
basement at a time.

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:19.770 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people are
growing this medicine

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:22.680 align:middle line:10%
and are using it
with sacred intention

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.980 align:middle line:10%
and not speaking
about it very much.

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.500 align:middle line:10%
It's a very personal
experience for them.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:32.820 align:middle line:10%
And people are cultivating
mushrooms both for large

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:37.610 align:middle line:10%
experiences, being spiritual,
trans-personal experiences,

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:40.800 align:middle line:10%
but people are also primarily
cultivating this medicine

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.870 align:middle line:10%
for micro dosing and using low--

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:49.920 align:middle line:10%
incredibly low doses
of psilocybin mushrooms

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.710 align:middle line:10%
pretty regularly for the
treatment of depression,

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:57.660 align:middle line:10%
anxiety, or to provide a
little more energy than they

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.500 align:middle line:10%
would normally have.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Micro-dosing psychedelic
plants has been popularized

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:07.940 align:middle line:84%
mostly by Dr. James Fadiman,
who after 40 years of experience

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:12.110 align:middle line:84%
has called this sub-perceptible
dose a problem-solving amount.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:15.080 align:middle line:84%
Whereas moderate doses
are effective for therapy,

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.510 align:middle line:90%
and high doses for spirituality.

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And because of
this, the phenomena

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.670 align:middle line:84%
has recently found itself
in unsuspecting places

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:24.770 align:middle line:84%
like the workplace
in Silicon Valley

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.350 align:middle line:84%
and other analytical
occupations.

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:29.600 align:middle line:10%
>> A lot of software
engineers, myself included,

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.860 align:middle line:10%
tend to be victims of
constrained thinking,

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:36.194 align:middle line:10%
or we think very logically
and analytically like this is

00:22:36.194 --> 00:22:36.993 align:middle line:10%
the way.

00:22:36.993 --> 00:22:39.720 align:middle line:10%
Like you know, you start seeing
code everywhere in everything

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.820 align:middle line:10%
you look at.

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.670 align:middle line:84%
But the psychedelics
just take all of that,

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:45.980 align:middle line:84%
and rip it up, and
tear it into pieces,

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:48.560 align:middle line:84%
and you're like, oh,
my god, I don't really

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.360 align:middle line:90%
know what I know anymore.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And that can be really difficult
and really, really amazing.

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And so like, with engineering,
what it tends to do

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:59.660 align:middle line:84%
is I'll like get stuck
on a problem, you know,

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:01.620 align:middle line:84%
like maybe it's some
engineering solution.

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.703 align:middle line:84%
I just can't think of
anything, and I sit with it,

00:23:03.703 --> 00:23:05.330 align:middle line:84%
and then I just
like suddenly, like,

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.572 align:middle line:84%
I can almost see the
problem I'm working on,

00:23:07.572 --> 00:23:09.530 align:middle line:84%
like in three dimensions,
you know what I mean?

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Like my eyes closed or
whatever and to just see it

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:13.910 align:middle line:90%
in a new way.

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Dosage is the most surefire
way to dramatically change

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:20.690 align:middle line:84%
the effects gained from
psychedelic mushrooms.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Terence McKenna is
known for categorizing

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.090 align:middle line:84%
what he called the
heroic dose at 5

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:28.970 align:middle line:90%
or sometimes 5 and 1/2 grams.

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:31.910 align:middle line:84%
To most, this would be
considered an amount enough

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:35.060 align:middle line:84%
to elicit a
spiritual experience.

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Psychologist and
author Rick Strassmann,

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:40.250 align:middle line:84%
aside from his
famed DMT research,

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:42.730 align:middle line:84%
also administered
psilocybin to volunteers

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:44.690 align:middle line:90%
in a lesser-known study.

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:48.000 align:middle line:10%
>> The kinds of
psilocybin doses,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.510 align:middle line:10%
which are now being called
high, were just, you know,

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:54.810 align:middle line:10%
barely threshold psychedelic
in our volunteers.

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, our final
large dose of psilocybin,

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.330 align:middle line:84%
if we had continued
with the studies,

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:06.410 align:middle line:84%
would have been twice what is
considered a high dose now.

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:08.570 align:middle line:84%
So that's what was
the main finding.

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:10.490 align:middle line:84%
You know, we just
pushed the dose more

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.130 align:middle line:90%
than anybody had ever pushed it.

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>> The doses in Dr. Strassmann's
studies were over 8 grams.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:21.450 align:middle line:84%
This is almost twice as much as
Terence McKenna's heroic dose.

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, we know that the
probability of having salient

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:29.760 align:middle line:84%
experiences increases
as a function of dose.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.280 align:middle line:84%
But the probability of
having difficult experiences

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:37.370 align:middle line:84%
also increases as
a function of dose.

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:40.260 align:middle line:84%
But I should say
that very often, it's

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.910 align:middle line:84%
those deeply uncomfortable
experiences that

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:49.790 align:middle line:84%
provide a window of opportunity
through which, if people can

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:52.250 align:middle line:84%
investigate and go
through, they'll

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:54.160 align:middle line:90%
open into larger experiences.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So, very often experiences
that people will subsequently

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:01.220 align:middle line:84%
describe as having
been difficult

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:06.410 align:middle line:84%
are among the most interesting
and meaningful to them.

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Trauma is typically deeply
uncomfortable at the moment

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:12.770 align:middle line:84%
of its adoption, as it's an
experience that is too intense

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:16.470 align:middle line:84%
or complex to
process all at once.

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:19.310 align:middle line:10%
So the memory is stored in
the neurology and the tissues

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:22.760 align:middle line:10%
of the body, awaiting a moment
to resurface and continue

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:26.330 align:middle line:10%
being processed so it can
finally be surrendered and let

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:27.960 align:middle line:10%
go of.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps that is why these
larger doses are useful.

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.780 align:middle line:84%
They de-stabilize the
habitual processes

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.970 align:middle line:84%
of the brain, which likely
serve as a distraction

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:41.020 align:middle line:84%
and suppressant of trauma and
unwanted aspects of the psyche.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:44.310 align:middle line:10%
But once this neural
habituation has destabilized,

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:47.100 align:middle line:10%
the natural healing
intelligence of the human being

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:52.480 align:middle line:10%
goes into housecleaning mode,
and old wounds are addressed.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.030 align:middle line:10%
But what happens
beyond these doses?

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:58.850 align:middle line:10%
There are accounts from Kilindi
Iyi, a martial arts instructor

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:02.590 align:middle line:10%
and mycologist, who
regularly takes 30-plus grams

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:06.220 align:middle line:10%
in one setting, six
times the heroic dose.

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:08.680 align:middle line:84%
The experience, as
he publicly noted,

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.800 align:middle line:84%
is beyond language,
beyond the five senses,

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.350 align:middle line:84%
and deeply embedded in
a world of symbolism

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:16.150 align:middle line:84%
and primal forces
that obliterate

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:18.190 align:middle line:90%
the concepts of space time.

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:20.800 align:middle line:84%
At these astronomical
doses, he mentions

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.510 align:middle line:84%
that the set and
setting has less

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:25.420 align:middle line:84%
of an impact on the
journey to come.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.240 align:middle line:10%
Higher doses become less
therapeutic and far more

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.040 align:middle line:10%
mystical.

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:33.490 align:middle line:84%
The mystical experience may
be deeply transformative.

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:35.530 align:middle line:84%
However, it can
also be traumatizing

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:39.760 align:middle line:84%
to experience such intensity to
the untrained or uninitiated,

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.830 align:middle line:84%
which is counter-intuitive
to the purpose

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:44.970 align:middle line:90%
of the therapeutic doses.

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:48.780 align:middle line:84%
In Maslow's hierarchy of
needs, the feeling of safety

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:53.550 align:middle line:84%
is second only to food, water,
warmth, and rest, and you

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:55.860 align:middle line:84%
can rest assured that
most of those needs

00:26:55.860 --> 00:27:00.120 align:middle line:84%
may not be met with higher
doses of psilocybin either.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.340 align:middle line:84%
A child entering
this world instantly

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.800 align:middle line:84%
latches on to
predictability and sources

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.740 align:middle line:84%
of safety and sustenance
from parents, environment,

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.160 align:middle line:90%
and culture.

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:15.410 align:middle line:84%
Anything less causes anxiety,
fear, and eventually trauma.

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Psilocybin mushrooms, even in
moderate doses of 3 to 4 grams,

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.760 align:middle line:84%
tends to dissolve our
grip on these needs.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.890 align:middle line:84%
5 to 8 grams pushes
this boundary

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:28.640 align:middle line:84%
to the limit of
consensus sanity.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Some believe that
nothing valuable

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:32.330 align:middle line:90%
lies beyond that limit.

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Nothing out there can be brought
back here and made sense of.

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.930 align:middle line:84%
But as we see with
psychonauts of DMT

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:40.670 align:middle line:84%
or initiates of
the mystery schools

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:43.430 align:middle line:84%
like Eleusis,
pushing the envelope

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:45.470 align:middle line:90%
is the name of the game.

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Venturing where no
one has gone before

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:50.900 align:middle line:84%
is born into some
seekers' very nature.

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Many believe that psilocybin
affords the initiate

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:55.910 align:middle line:84%
or volunteer an
opportunity to experience

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:58.290 align:middle line:90%
death and return from it.

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So this work with psilocybin
and these reorganizational

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:07.050 align:middle line:84%
kinds of emergent experiences
that come out of that speaks

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:14.570 align:middle line:84%
very deeply to my own interest
and longing in understanding

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:17.640 align:middle line:90%
the nature of consciousness.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.870 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me that the
fundamental question

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:25.190 align:middle line:84%
that we as humans
are faced with is,

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:27.140 align:middle line:90%
what are we really doing here?

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:31.310 align:middle line:84%
How is it that we've come to
be in this sea of consciousness

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:32.600 align:middle line:90%
and awareness?

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:35.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, what's
really going on here?

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.950 align:middle line:90%
What happens when we die?

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:41.195 align:middle line:84%
How did this whole
phenomenon come about?

00:28:41.195 --> 00:28:45.410 align:middle line:84%
These are the existential
questions of life,

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:49.340 align:middle line:84%
and personally, I
can't think of anything

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:52.940 align:middle line:84%
more interesting and
intriguing, and I

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:58.250 align:middle line:84%
think that psilocybin and
work with these compounds

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:02.360 align:middle line:84%
provides a unique
doorway into exploration

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:06.800 align:middle line:90%
of these sorts of experiences.

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>> As science barrels into the
future with new technologies

00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:13.640 align:middle line:84%
to study ancient methodologies
for healing and spiritual

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:17.810 align:middle line:84%
transformation, are we finally
on the verge of understanding

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:21.110 align:middle line:84%
these psychedelic substances and
their unique effects on human

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:23.960 align:middle line:84%
consciousness and
neurochemistry?

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.990 align:middle line:10%
If psilocybin is the oldest
classical psychedelic

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:30.170 align:middle line:10%
with widespread
shamanic use, perhaps we

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:33.530 align:middle line:10%
are in the midst of a revival
of the old Eleusinian-style

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:36.890 align:middle line:10%
mysteries, and perhaps
these mysteries are finally

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:42.080 align:middle line:10%
being decoded and widespread,
a large-medicine heavily

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:45.860 align:middle line:10%
suppressed, demonized,
and misunderstood finally

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:49.590 align:middle line:10%
back into the hands of those who
intend to heal the world's ills

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:53.060 align:middle line:10%
and voyage into the unknown.

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Another highly-suppressed
and controversial

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:57.320 align:middle line:84%
mind-expanding
plant species that

00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.860 align:middle line:84%
has been with humanity for ages
is the North American peyote

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:03.650 align:middle line:84%
cactus and its sister
in South America known

00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:06.650 align:middle line:90%
as huachuma or San Pedro.

00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Up next, join us
as we investigate

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:12.530 align:middle line:84%
the history of psychedelic
cacti use among indigenous

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:15.140 align:middle line:84%
across the New World
and how they mirrored

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:18.320 align:middle line:84%
ancient Greek initiations
as well as prophecies

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.520 align:middle line:84%
surrounding the unification
of shamanic tribes everywhere.
