[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:34.080 align:middle line:90%


00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Researchers in the
1960s began noticing that

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.550 align:middle line:84%
by introducing music to
psychedelic therapy sessions,

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.060 align:middle line:84%
the anxiety and emotional
stress would alleviate.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.280 align:middle line:84%
They would report that
the feelings and visuals

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.310 align:middle line:84%
of the experience had more
profound meaning to their life

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.290 align:middle line:90%
and circumstances.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Classical and world music
was found to be more

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.550 align:middle line:90%
universally appreciated.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.770 align:middle line:84%
However, the preferences
had a wide range

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.550 align:middle line:84%
due to people's personal
history and present mood.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.730 align:middle line:84%
But it's not simply music that
causes a profound alteration

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.680 align:middle line:90%
of psychedelic states.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.960 align:middle line:84%
Simple sounds and
vibrations can deeply

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.050 align:middle line:84%
influence the unfolding of an
altered state of consciousness.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.840 align:middle line:84%
What if there were
simple sonic techniques

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.020 align:middle line:84%
we could employ in order to
navigate the ever-changing

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.220 align:middle line:84%
and often intense phenomenon
of a psychedelic journey?

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.830 align:middle line:84%
What if the understanding
of vibration on the body

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.800 align:middle line:84%
could give us a glimpse of
why music and psychedelics go

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.580 align:middle line:84%
together so well and why
our shamanic ancestry has

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.960 align:middle line:84%
been using sonics and
psychedelics together for ages?

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Music and sound can not only
enhance psychedelic journeys

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.220 align:middle line:10%
but can initiate psychedelic
experiences without anything

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.020 align:middle line:10%
else.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.250 align:middle line:84%
There are many traditions
throughout the planet

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.990 align:middle line:84%
that in order to enter altered
states of being will simply

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.860 align:middle line:90%
use sound.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Whether it is their voice, or
drumming, or bowls, or bells,

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.950 align:middle line:84%
or some sort of other
instrumentation,

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.820 align:middle line:84%
this basically alters
all sorts of aspects

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.170 align:middle line:84%
of the brain and
our consciousness.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.820 align:middle line:84%
The instruments
that have been used

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.520 align:middle line:84%
to achieve altered
states of consciousness

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.850 align:middle line:84%
have been multitude,
myriad, and many.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Probably the most popular, of
course, has been the voice--

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.200 align:middle line:84%
shaman and priests
and various types

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.780 align:middle line:84%
of practitioners using
different mantras,

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.830 align:middle line:84%
making different tones,
speaking in different tongues,

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.280 align:middle line:84%
altering different
states of consciousness,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.540 align:middle line:84%
literally shifting
the vibrational

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.590 align:middle line:84%
frequencies of the space,
within and without,

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.650 align:middle line:90%
using their own voice.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Vibration plays a role in
many of the world's religions,

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.550 align:middle line:84%
especially in their stories
of how the world began.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.640 align:middle line:10%
In Genesis 1, verse
2, God's spirit

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.650 align:middle line:10%
moved across the
face of the waters.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.610 align:middle line:10%
The Cherokee wisdom-keeper
Dhyani Ywahoo

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.860 align:middle line:10%
states that in
their creation myth,

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.040 align:middle line:10%
"from the mysterious
creator came forth

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.790 align:middle line:10%
a sound, the fundamental tone
of the universal song underlying

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.890 align:middle line:10%
all manifestation."

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.190 align:middle line:10%
Native American Peyote Church
Roadman Kuauhtli Vasquez

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.860 align:middle line:10%
recounts the creation
myth of his ancestry

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.660 align:middle line:10%
and how sound or vibration
played a vital role.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.190 align:middle line:10%
>> They say that in our culture,
the creator spirit wanted

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.460 align:middle line:10%
the world to begin in motion.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.830 align:middle line:84%
So he told the old
coyote to go to the ocean

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.560 align:middle line:84%
and take one of
those conch shells

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.350 align:middle line:84%
out and make a
trumpet out of it.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And when he blew it,
it started creating

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.740 align:middle line:84%
this spiral wave of sound,
which sounds kind of like ohm.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.550 align:middle line:84%
So the old coyote
blew it, and this

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.260 align:middle line:90%
started everything vibrating.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.060 align:middle line:84%
So when you speak,
you're vibrating

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.560 align:middle line:90%
at a level of the mind.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Like, you understand
what I'm saying

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.500 align:middle line:90%
if we speak the same language.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when I hear people
singing songs, I can visualize.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.240 align:middle line:84%
I get a feeling of what
they're singing about.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.720 align:middle line:84%
So singing is another
form of communication

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.690 align:middle line:90%
that supersedes the mind.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.020 align:middle line:84%
You don't really have
to understand the words,

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.410 align:middle line:90%
but you get the feeling.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>> This is where yogis, just
like other shamanic traditions,

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.910 align:middle line:90%
actually start to use sound.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.010 align:middle line:10%
So there's an understanding
that sound is vibration,

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.320 align:middle line:10%
and that vibration is at
the essence of everything.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And usually our awareness
is caught in all this noise

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.990 align:middle line:90%
and sound of the outside world.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.731 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times,
it'll be a mantra.

00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:57.105 align:middle line:84%
And what's important to know
and understand about mantras

00:04:57.105 --> 00:04:59.850 align:middle line:90%
is that mantras are vibrations.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.860 align:middle line:84%
They're not things
that we make up.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.890 align:middle line:84%
They're actually sound
frequencies and vibrations

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.410 align:middle line:84%
that are already part
of this physical world.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And so as yogis start to hone
their awareness in, detach

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.320 align:middle line:84%
from the outside world, the
awareness starts to pull in.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.710 align:middle line:84%
You can actually start to hear
more subtle frequencies, more

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.201 align:middle line:84%
subtle vibrations,
more subtle sounds.

00:05:22.201 --> 00:05:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
the yoga tradition

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.158 align:middle line:84%
will say that we're
starting to tap

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.550 align:middle line:84%
into different levels
of consciousness.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.410 align:middle line:84%
We start to move beyond
the thinking mind that

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.960 align:middle line:84%
identifies us as this
body, as this person,

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.430 align:middle line:90%
as our experiences.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And we start to drop
more into a state that is

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.740 align:middle line:90%
beyond the mind, a state of--

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.800 align:middle line:84%
instead of individual
consciousness,

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.140 align:middle line:84%
we start to merge with
universal consciousness, which

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:53.850 align:middle line:84%
is really the essential goal,
if you will, of all yoga.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Yogis using mantra seems to
be different than speaking from

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.880 align:middle line:90%
the intellect.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.380 align:middle line:10%
Oftentimes, plant
medicine enthusiasts

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.260 align:middle line:10%
will structure their ceremony
or journey with a focus

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.320 align:middle line:10%
on using as few words
as possible, as they

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.140 align:middle line:10%
can be irritating and
distracting except for when

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.940 align:middle line:10%
those words are sung.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.720 align:middle line:84%
The vocal apparatus of the
human body is very complex.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.740 align:middle line:90%
The power comes from the lungs.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.100 align:middle line:84%
The vibration comes
from the vocal box.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And the resonation comes
from the throat, nose, mouth,

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.200 align:middle line:90%
and sinuses.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Speaking comes from the
same range of anatomy

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.040 align:middle line:90%
as does singing.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.290 align:middle line:84%
But the active use of
them is as different

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.450 align:middle line:90%
as walking is to dancing.

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.970 align:middle line:84%
The greatest difference
is the psychological state

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.480 align:middle line:84%
one is usually in when singing
as opposed to speaking.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.130 align:middle line:84%
The very act of singing,
opening the throat

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.130 align:middle line:84%
and holding extended
notes, directly

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.140 align:middle line:84%
affects the nervous system
through the vagus nerve.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.150 align:middle line:10%
>> So the vagus nerve,
extremely important nerve,

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.720 align:middle line:10%
wanders through
your entire body.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.460 align:middle line:10%
People who are
stressed out and sick

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.170 align:middle line:10%
have poor vagal nerve tone.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Sound is one thing that
can affect it, particularly

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.040 align:middle line:84%
vibrations, vibrations
created through sound,

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.830 align:middle line:84%
which means that when
you sing, when you hum,

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.480 align:middle line:84%
when you chant, when
someone around you

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.980 align:middle line:84%
is singing and
humming and chanting,

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.020 align:middle line:84%
when you're listening
to very good music,

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.050 align:middle line:84%
you actually see an improvement
in vagal nerve tone.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And an improvement
in vagal nerve tone

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.870 align:middle line:84%
specifically affects your
heart, the electrical signal

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.020 align:middle line:90%
of your heart.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And so, absolutely, sound
can affect vagus nerve tone

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.730 align:middle line:90%
in a very profound manner.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:29.850 align:middle line:10%
>> In over 25 years of
studies coming from HeartMath

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:33.450 align:middle line:10%
Institute, it has been found
that the heart sends far more

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:37.200 align:middle line:10%
information to the brain
than the other way around.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.650 align:middle line:84%
The heart, in fact, influences
emotional processing,

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:45.910 align:middle line:84%
attention, perception, memory,
and even problem solving.

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And under a psychedelic
state, all these faculties

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:53.770 align:middle line:84%
are highly influential in the
way the experience will unfold.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:56.040 align:middle line:84%
So how does an act
as simple as humming

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.490 align:middle line:84%
have such a deeply relaxing
effect on the body?

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>> We found that the hum
literally is a sound that is

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:12.660 align:middle line:84%
probably the most powerful
vibroacoustic tool that exists.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:19.220 align:middle line:84%
When you close your eyes and
[HUMMING],, it's more powerful.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.570 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you open your
mouth-- and of course,

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.285 align:middle line:84%
the ohm, if you like,
is based on the hum.

00:08:25.285 --> 00:08:29.970 align:middle line:84%
If you go (HUMMING) ohm, but
it's just to go [HUMMING],,

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:31.740 align:middle line:84%
as soon as you open
your mouth, the sound

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.720 align:middle line:84%
begins to escape
through your mouth.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.820 align:middle line:84%
But if you have
your mouth closed,

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.780 align:middle line:84%
it's totally a
vibroacoustic experience

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.059 align:middle line:84%
causing a massage
on a cellular level

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:47.520 align:middle line:84%
and causing different organs,
bones, and tissues to vibrate.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And when we project our
intention onto the sound,

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:54.060 align:middle line:84%
that can really
affect it as well.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.590 align:middle line:84%
So it can really affect
our nervous system.

00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And this type of thing
has been used for eons,

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:06.540 align:middle line:84%
ever since, if you like,
one made a holy sound,

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:11.610 align:middle line:84%
or one made a sacred sound, or
one did a prayer to the divine,

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:14.580 align:middle line:84%
or one did a prayer
to the animal kingdom,

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.220 align:middle line:84%
or one emulated the
sounds of jaguar,

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.610 align:middle line:84%
to when one emulated
the sounds of all sorts

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.140 align:middle line:84%
of different creatures
on this planet.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:26.280 align:middle line:84%
They've been using
sound to travel

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.170 align:middle line:84%
to different states
of consciousness

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.060 align:middle line:90%
since the beginning.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.570 align:middle line:84%
The voice is our
primary instrument.

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think even before
we spoke, we made tone.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And in fact there
are, if you like,

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:44.310 align:middle line:84%
legends of us singing
the language of the birds

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.980 align:middle line:90%
before we ever spoke.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Researchers like
Michael Harner,

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.130 align:middle line:10%
who wrote "The Way
of the Shaman,"

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.580 align:middle line:10%
focus on animal movements and
sounds in shamanic traditions

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.170 align:middle line:10%
to enter altered states.

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:58.600 align:middle line:84%
He says that shamans
in ecstatic trances

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.790 align:middle line:84%
will not only mimic the
movements of animals

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:03.160 align:middle line:84%
in their dances but
use animal noises

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.500 align:middle line:84%
to connect with these
specific power animals.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.170 align:middle line:10%
And to back up Jonathan
Goldman's claims,

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:12.310 align:middle line:10%
Shigeru Miyagawa,
professor of linguistics

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:15.550 align:middle line:10%
in MIT'S Department of
Linguistics and Philosophy,

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:18.070 align:middle line:10%
coauthored a paper showing
direct correlations

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:21.400 align:middle line:10%
between bird songs and
human speech patterns.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.460 align:middle line:84%
But how can vocalizations
induce states of consciousness

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:30.030 align:middle line:84%
that open us up to the nature
around us as the shamans did?

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.620 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it must be understood
that most everything

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.990 align:middle line:84%
we do in our bodies
involves movements.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.600 align:middle line:10%
In her TED talk,
Amy Cuddy explained

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.110 align:middle line:10%
how putting hands up in
victory pose or hands on hips

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:47.040 align:middle line:10%
like a superhero caused
testosterone to increase, which

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.290 align:middle line:10%
gives a sense of
strength and power,

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:53.180 align:middle line:10%
whereas the stress
hormone, cortisol, drops.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.670 align:middle line:84%
By using the voice,
the throat opens up

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:59.960 align:middle line:84%
and resonates in the chest right
where the vagus nerve travels.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:04.010 align:middle line:84%
If singing, and even prosodic
speaking, increases vagal tone,

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:08.420 align:middle line:84%
this would affect the heart,
lungs, gut, and much more,

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.000 align:middle line:84%
causing the nervous system
to prompt an altered state

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.470 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.900 align:middle line:10%
Even beyond the words
that are being sung,

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.810 align:middle line:10%
the intention behind them,
including how and when

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:21.210 align:middle line:10%
they are used, seem to
make all the difference

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:24.530 align:middle line:10%
in the shamanic traditions.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:28.690 align:middle line:10%
>> So there's a way to
communicate through songs not

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:34.690 align:middle line:10%
only among humans but to
everything that exists.

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:37.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I say you
can sing to the sun.

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.730 align:middle line:90%
You could sing to the earth.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:40.440 align:middle line:90%
You could sing to peyote.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.870 align:middle line:90%
You could sing to iowaska.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.420 align:middle line:84%
So what you're doing is
you're singing gratitude.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.240 align:middle line:90%
You're singing love.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.320 align:middle line:90%
You're singing appreciation.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.920 align:middle line:84%
You're singing the
desire for information.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.990 align:middle line:90%
You're singing this unifying--

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.670 align:middle line:90%


00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:04.770 align:middle line:84%
creating harmony through
music, through playing songs,

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.930 align:middle line:90%
through singing songs.

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.530 align:middle line:90%
This is a language.

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Singing and songs, whether
they're with your voice

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.950 align:middle line:84%
or whether they're
instruments, is a vibration

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:19.380 align:middle line:90%
of spirit communication.

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:22.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole different
sensory perception.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're in a
ceremony and you're just

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.680 align:middle line:84%
sitting there
listening to songs,

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.350 align:middle line:84%
once the songs come
from within you

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:34.290 align:middle line:84%
and your voice is
activated, you're

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.300 align:middle line:90%
like in another dimension.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.800 align:middle line:90%
It's a total new dimension.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Then you're, things-- it's like
it activates more information.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.100 align:middle line:90%


00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether the sounds are
self-produced or listened

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:53.490 align:middle line:84%
to, ancient civilizations
have used sonic manipulation

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.070 align:middle line:84%
to induce expanded states
of consciousness since

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:58.660 align:middle line:90%
the beginning.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.960 align:middle line:10%
As noted in Steven Kotler and
Jamie Wheal's book "Stealing

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.230 align:middle line:10%
Fire," Greek cathedrals
were built with walls

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:08.110 align:middle line:10%
close together in order to
create a sound that mimics

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:11.410 align:middle line:10%
the flapping of angel's wings.

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:15.220 align:middle line:10%
The 1,100-year-old temple of
Kukulkan in Chichen Itza was

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.340 align:middle line:10%
built so precisely that if
you were to clap at the base

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.370 align:middle line:10%
of the pyramid, the echo
will come back to you with

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:24.340 align:middle line:10%
the chirping sound
of the national bird,

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.770 align:middle line:10%
the sacred quetzal.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:28.930 align:middle line:10%
The ball court on the
same temple grounds

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:33.370 align:middle line:10%
would also echo seven times
before the sound would escape.

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:37.360 align:middle line:10%
The Greek Telesterion, the
Peruvian Chavin de Huantar,

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.430 align:middle line:10%
and other ancient
underground sites

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:41.140 align:middle line:10%
have been found
to be constructed

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:45.010 align:middle line:10%
for their unique
acoustic properties.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:47.920 align:middle line:10%
Even in the 5,000-year-old
mortuary temple

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.330 align:middle line:10%
of Malta's Hypogeum Hal Saflieni
is said to have not only housed

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:55.870 align:middle line:10%
elongated skulls and
stories of the paranormal,

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.570 align:middle line:10%
but this is the oldest
prehistoric underground temple

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:03.010 align:middle line:10%
in the world and is said to have
been created for sonic rituals.

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:06.580 align:middle line:10%
Archaeoacoustic researchers
have found that ritual chanting

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:10.180 align:middle line:10%
in this ancient sonic chamber,
which deactivates the language

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:13.930 align:middle line:10%
center and shifts hemisphere
dominance in the brain,

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:17.530 align:middle line:10%
effectively causing states of
consciousness related to mood,

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:21.070 align:middle line:10%
empathy, and social behavior.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:23.260 align:middle line:10%
It seems that our
ancient ancestors

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.620 align:middle line:10%
revered the use of sonics as
well as psychedelics in order

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:30.260 align:middle line:10%
to bring about
religious-type experiences.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.110 align:middle line:84%
Sound healer Kimba Arem
employs the knowledge

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:36.290 align:middle line:84%
of sonic resonance on the
body, and even experiences

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:39.290 align:middle line:84%
deeply expanded states
of consciousness herself,

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:41.450 align:middle line:84%
with the use of one of
the oldest instruments

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:44.480 align:middle line:90%
on the planet, the didgeridoo.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.550 align:middle line:90%


00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:51.170 align:middle line:10%
>> So the didgeridoo definitely
has these very meditative,

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:54.027 align:middle line:10%
calming-type frequencies
encoded in it.

00:14:54.027 --> 00:14:56.360 align:middle line:10%
I was once involved in some
research where they actually

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.390 align:middle line:10%
hooked me up to a
brainwave monitor.

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually
see the brainwaves

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.350 align:middle line:90%
that you're creating.

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:05.180 align:middle line:90%
And so you can see the feedback.

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And there was one
that said gamma.

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was asking
them, what is gamma?

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, we
don't see that often.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.390 align:middle line:84%
It's usually Buddhist
monks who have

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.510 align:middle line:84%
been meditating for all of
their life can get it up there.

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:19.030 align:middle line:90%
It's like above 35 hertz.

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:21.110 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of an
unusual brain state.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:22.610 align:middle line:84%
But this technology
was so we can

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.550 align:middle line:84%
learn the feedback of the
brainwaves we're creating

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.640 align:middle line:84%
and how to affect
them and try to--

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.220 align:middle line:90%
like a biofeedback experience.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And while I was playing the
didgeridoo, the gamma one,

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:41.870 align:middle line:84%
this little ball goes up to the
top, showing the highest level.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:44.694 align:middle line:84%
And then as soon as I stopped
playing, it goes back down.

00:15:44.694 --> 00:15:46.610 align:middle line:84%
So I start playing again,
and it goes back up.

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:48.470 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't touch it otherwise.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:51.680 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to tap
into some frequency,

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.510 align:middle line:84%
but only while I was
doing this breathing

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:54.740 align:middle line:90%
pattern with this sound.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.180 align:middle line:90%


00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:02.110 align:middle line:10%
>> As the didgeridoo is believed
to be over 40,000 years old,

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:05.200 align:middle line:10%
other wind instruments in Europe
have been discovered that date

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.980 align:middle line:10%
back even farther.

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.190 align:middle line:84%
The mammoth-ivory
flute was found

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:11.500 align:middle line:84%
in a cave in southern
Germany dating back

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.740 align:middle line:90%
almost 44,000 years.

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.650 align:middle line:10%
In present-day Slovenia,
the Divje Babe flute

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:21.980 align:middle line:10%
was discovered and dates
back to 67,000 years ago,

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.490 align:middle line:10%
making it the only musical
instrument associated

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:27.030 align:middle line:10%
with Neanderthals.

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:29.850 align:middle line:10%
Iegor Reznikof,
ethnographer of music

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:32.100 align:middle line:10%
at the University
of France, found

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:35.280 align:middle line:10%
that there are cave paintings
roughly a kilometer deep

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.550 align:middle line:10%
and all throughout the
Arcy-sur-Cure caves with bone

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:41.460 align:middle line:10%
whistles and flutes found there.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Reznikof and his team studied
the acoustics in caves

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:47.970 align:middle line:84%
across France
painted by early man.

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:50.400 align:middle line:10%
They found that up to
90% of the paintings

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.800 align:middle line:10%
were directly at places
where the acoustics were

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:57.540 align:middle line:10%
best for ritual and
mind-altering ceremonies.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:00.800 align:middle line:10%
These dates coincide with Graham
Hancock's work on the clues

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.110 align:middle line:10%
that we have about
ancient rock and cave

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:06.230 align:middle line:10%
art and their connection with
shamanic or expanded states

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:07.970 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness.

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:10.490 align:middle line:10%
>> The oldest traces we have
are in the range of 30,000

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.260 align:middle line:10%
to 40,000 years old.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.700 align:middle line:10%
It goes much younger as well.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.339 align:middle line:10%
There's much more recent
rock and cave art.

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:20.900 align:middle line:10%
You can find it in many
different parts of the world,

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.750 align:middle line:10%
whether you're looking in
Indonesia or Europe or South

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.680 align:middle line:10%
Africa or Australia,
as a matter of fact.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And very important,
very detailed work

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:32.880 align:middle line:90%
has been done on this imagery.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.360 align:middle line:10%
And I want to pay tribute
to Professor David Lewis

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.450 align:middle line:10%
Williams of the University
of Witwatersrand

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:46.910 align:middle line:10%
in South Africa, who is the
originator of the notion

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:51.800 align:middle line:10%
that this art was
inspired by altered states

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.240 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.300 align:middle line:84%
David began to put
that idea forward

00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:01.940 align:middle line:84%
with particular reference to
South African rock and cave art

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:04.820 align:middle line:90%
back as early as the 1970s.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.790 align:middle line:84%
There's really no other
way, satisfactorily,

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:13.550 align:middle line:84%
to explain them except to say
that what we are looking at

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:17.300 align:middle line:84%
is likely the work of
ancient shamans who

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.600 align:middle line:84%
are doing what shamans still
existent in the world today

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.220 align:middle line:90%
still do.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.440 align:middle line:84%
Because shamanism, the
essence of shamanism,

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.290 align:middle line:84%
is a deeply altered
state of consciousness.

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:29.180 align:middle line:10%
And while there are
a variety of ways

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:32.210 align:middle line:10%
of getting into a suitably
deeply altered state

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:36.310 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness which
don't involve substances--

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:39.860 align:middle line:10%
for example the Kalahari
Bushmen in Southern Africa

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:43.010 align:middle line:10%
achieve an equally powerful
altered state of consciousness

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.500 align:middle line:10%
by dancing for 24
hours around the fire

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.020 align:middle line:10%
and becoming deeply
dehydrated and falling

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.700 align:middle line:10%
into a rhythmic
trance-like state.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Vocal and wind instruments
are just the beginning

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:58.390 align:middle line:84%
of the instruments used
to induce altered states.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:02.530 align:middle line:84%
The drum-- the earliest
known drums are roughly 8,000

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:07.480 align:middle line:84%
to 10,000 years old, with one
reference to a 37,000-year-old

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.630 align:middle line:90%
drum made with elephant hide.

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:12.220 align:middle line:10%
Drumming has been
an integral part

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:15.910 align:middle line:10%
of many shamanic rituals dating
back many thousands of years.

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:19.300 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the explanations that
we have based upon contemporary

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:23.980 align:middle line:10%
clinical research is that people
are able to deliberately induce

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.640 align:middle line:10%
these kinds of experiences,
special people.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And when they do,
there's a breakdown

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:31.960 align:middle line:84%
in the integration of a specific
part of the brain called

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.760 align:middle line:90%
the temporal parietal junction.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And what the drumming does
is it basically overwhelms

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:40.165 align:middle line:90%
this part of the brain.

00:19:40.165 --> 00:19:43.780 align:middle line:84%
When the brain gets
repeatedly stimulated,

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.470 align:middle line:90%
it eventually habituates.

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:48.210 align:middle line:84%
It no longer responds
to the signal.

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And this part of
the brain apparently

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:53.740 align:middle line:84%
habituates by disintegrating
these different parts

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.990 align:middle line:84%
of the brain that normally
all function together.

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:58.240 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden,
the sense of our body

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.884 align:middle line:84%
is no longer tied
to the visual field,

00:19:59.884 --> 00:20:01.300 align:middle line:84%
the perception of
the environment,

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.456 align:middle line:90%
or the sense of self.

00:20:02.456 --> 00:20:04.870 align:middle line:84%
So we're able to have
these experiences

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:07.330 align:middle line:84%
of our body traveling
to other places

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:10.600 align:middle line:84%
because the brain is no longer
integrating the real body

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.010 align:middle line:90%
sensations with the environment.

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:18.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Rhythm may be one of the
most powerful sonic tools

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.200 align:middle line:84%
for affecting the
human organism,

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.710 align:middle line:84%
particularly for affecting
our nervous system.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Slow frequencies, slow
rhythms, basically

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:32.110 align:middle line:90%
cause us to calm down--

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:35.220 align:middle line:84%
are having our brain
waves and our heart rate

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.660 align:middle line:90%
and our respiration slow down.

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:40.960 align:middle line:84%
The sound is going into our
ears and affecting this.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Fast rhythms will cause us
to want to get up and dance.

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:46.400 align:middle line:90%
It's really that simple.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:53.290 align:middle line:84%
If you use slightly
out-of-tune frequencies,

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:55.780 align:middle line:84%
you find that it
really helps induce

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:58.030 align:middle line:90%
deep states of consciousness.

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Tibetan bells that people
hit together-- tingshas,

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:02.320 align:middle line:90%
as they're called--

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:06.640 align:middle line:84%
if they're well-made, will
fall right within the state

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.870 align:middle line:84%
called theta, which is really
one of the really wonderful

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:15.340 align:middle line:84%
states where very much shamanic
and deep inner-traveling

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.930 align:middle line:90%
work goes.

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:19.000 align:middle line:10%
And yet at the same
time, there are

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.980 align:middle line:10%
a lot of really
fast rhythms that

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.415 align:middle line:10%
are used by many different
indigenous people,

00:21:24.415 --> 00:21:27.925 align:middle line:10%
to including those in Africa,
that put people into trance.

00:21:27.925 --> 00:21:31.060 align:middle line:90%


00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>> When listening to a
rhythmic drumbeat that goes

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.790 align:middle line:84%
on and on throughout the
night, usually in a group,

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:39.490 align:middle line:84%
the most common response is
for the listeners to get up

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:43.240 align:middle line:84%
and dance, to move their bodies
and express the rhythm back

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.820 align:middle line:90%
to the group.

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.280 align:middle line:10%
And to further elaborate
on the power of music

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.220 align:middle line:10%
to bring groups
together, author of "This

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.910 align:middle line:10%
is Your Brain on Music,"
Dr. Daniel Levetin, found

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:57.700 align:middle line:10%
that people who listen to
music out loud together

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.220 align:middle line:10%
spark stronger
relationships, often

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:04.270 align:middle line:10%
causing people to spend more
time with loved ones, more time

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:08.470 align:middle line:10%
hugging, making love, cooking
meals with one another,

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:11.110 align:middle line:10%
and even close the distance
of physical proximity

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:13.630 align:middle line:10%
between housemates.

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps this is why
we see a high emphasis

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.100 align:middle line:84%
on communal bonding
amongst tribes

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.260 align:middle line:84%
who take psychedelic
plant medicines

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.120 align:middle line:90%
and dance and sing as a group.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:27.200 align:middle line:10%
>> In this ancient
city, in Tenochtitlan,

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.080 align:middle line:10%
people would come from
the entire confederation,

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:34.100 align:middle line:10%
which was from Canada all
the way to the tip of South

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.240 align:middle line:10%
America.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:39.940 align:middle line:84%
They knew the same
dances, the same beats.

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:43.920 align:middle line:84%
There's thousands
of these dances--

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.230 align:middle line:84%
dance to the earth, dance to the
rain, dance to the ego, dance

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:49.730 align:middle line:90%
to the corn.

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:53.600 align:middle line:84%
They're the same dances danced
by an entire civilization

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.210 align:middle line:84%
across an entire
continent that were

00:22:56.210 --> 00:23:03.060 align:middle line:84%
done at certain precise moments,
like the equinox, the solstice,

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:06.860 align:middle line:84%
the eclipses, the new
moons, the full moons.

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:10.480 align:middle line:84%
People are doing
the same movements

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.920 align:middle line:90%
to the same vibration--

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.780 align:middle line:90%
humans interacting.

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.640 align:middle line:90%
This is very powerful.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:20.360 align:middle line:84%
People are singing and
dancing and taking medicine.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.240 align:middle line:90%


00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:27.730 align:middle line:84%
This is like
geometric progression.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:32.050 align:middle line:90%


00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>> The fact that music and
psychedelics pair well and go

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:38.590 align:middle line:84%
hand-in-hand with dance and
community gatherings says a lot

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:42.490 align:middle line:84%
about the nature of
psychedelic experiences.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Many people express how
the world around them

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:46.720 align:middle line:84%
dissolves its
barriers and becomes

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:51.430 align:middle line:84%
one continuous phenomena
under a psychedelic state.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:53.680 align:middle line:84%
The inside can become
indistinguishable

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.900 align:middle line:90%
from the outside.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.630 align:middle line:10%
This seems to be seen in the
complementary relationship

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:02.800 align:middle line:10%
between psychedelics and
music, music and dance, dance

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.100 align:middle line:10%
and community,
community and harmony.

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:10.390 align:middle line:10%
All communities seek to quell
disputes and foster cooperation

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:12.610 align:middle line:10%
just as the trillions
of cells in the body

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:17.560 align:middle line:10%
cooperate to make up the super
organism that is the human.

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:19.780 align:middle line:84%
All these phenomena
are seen in culture

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.710 align:middle line:84%
since the dawn of
the modern era of man

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:25.330 align:middle line:84%
and were not separated
into individual categories

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:27.010 align:middle line:90%
like they are today.

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:29.560 align:middle line:10%
And one reason the
experiences of psychedelics

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.170 align:middle line:10%
can be so meaningful
when paired with music

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:35.530 align:middle line:10%
is shown in a recent discovery
by the neuroscientist Mendel

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:38.560 align:middle line:10%
Kaelen at the Imperial
College of London.

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:42.340 align:middle line:10%
He found that the interaction
between psychedelics and music

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:46.030 align:middle line:10%
increases information flow
going from the parahippocampus

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:48.700 align:middle line:10%
to the fusiform cortex.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Once personal memories and
contextual associations

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:53.560 align:middle line:84%
from the
parahippocampus are sent

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.660 align:middle line:84%
to the fusiform,
or visual, cortex,

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.290 align:middle line:84%
the visions that emerge from
the psychedelic experience

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:02.470 align:middle line:90%
becomes much more personalized.

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:05.380 align:middle line:10%
Because music increases
this information flow,

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:07.870 align:middle line:10%
the tone of the music may
have a dramatic effect

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:11.860 align:middle line:10%
on how those memories are
relived in the moment.

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:14.980 align:middle line:10%
Could this be the basis to
shamanic traditions creating

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:18.020 align:middle line:10%
music during
psychedelic ceremonies?

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So why is music so important
here in the context of using

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:21.930 align:middle line:90%
psychedelics?

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.820 align:middle line:84%
We're getting this opportunity
to move our sense of self

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.890 align:middle line:84%
and being into this
visual space that's

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:29.680 align:middle line:84%
provided by the integration
of these deep processes

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.330 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Some of the other
kinds of effects

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.470 align:middle line:84%
that are achieved through
the use of psychedelics

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:38.230 align:middle line:84%
have more to do with
psychodynamic processing.

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:39.730 align:middle line:84%
So on one hand, the
psychedelics are

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:41.920 align:middle line:84%
going to stimulate you
to deal with issues

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.980 align:middle line:84%
about past trauma,
repressed memories,

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.620 align:middle line:84%
your emotional concerns
and preoccupations.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:49.360 align:middle line:84%
But what happens
with that information

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.000 align:middle line:84%
depends a little bit upon
the interpersonal dynamic

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.010 align:middle line:84%
and the processing
of that information

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:56.860 align:middle line:84%
so that you're able to make
more effective use of it.

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:59.260 align:middle line:10%
>> As many psychedelic
researchers today,

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.770 align:middle line:10%
such as Roland Griffiths
at Johns Hopkins University

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:05.680 align:middle line:10%
and Mendel Kaelen at
Imperial College of London,

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:09.070 align:middle line:10%
have created personalized,
psychotherapeutic playlists

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:12.500 align:middle line:10%
to amplify personal journeys
of the participants--

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.940 align:middle line:10%
however, the use of music
in some iowaska as well

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.280 align:middle line:10%
as other psychedelic
ceremonies also

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.130 align:middle line:10%
put emphasis on the
silence after the song.

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And for modern sonic
explorers, listening to silence

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:26.500 align:middle line:90%
has taken on new methods.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>> There are even these things
called anechoic chambers that

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:33.360 align:middle line:84%
are so quiet there's no
external outside noise.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:37.630 align:middle line:84%
You can literally hear your
heartbeat, your respiration.

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:39.100 align:middle line:84%
If you listen hard
enough, you can

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:44.390 align:middle line:90%
begin to hear your brain waves.

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, there
is a level of yoga

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.910 align:middle line:90%
called Shabd Yoga, which is--

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:53.590 align:middle line:90%
or Nada Yoga.

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:56.860 align:middle line:90%
And this is oftentimes utilized.

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:59.530 align:middle line:84%
But there also is
just listening.

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:03.550 align:middle line:84%
The yoga of listening is
so very, very powerful.

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, it is an
inner listening that occurs.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.840 align:middle line:84%
So our nervous system is
affected by the sounds

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:15.670 align:middle line:84%
that we listen to, but it
can also be really affected

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:20.020 align:middle line:84%
by the sounds that
we don't listen to

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:21.730 align:middle line:90%
and we listen to internally.

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:24.370 align:middle line:90%


00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>> It has been said by many who
enter anechoic chambers that

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:31.610 align:middle line:90%
the silence is deafening.

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:34.090 align:middle line:84%
There is so much noise
present internally

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:37.030 align:middle line:84%
that it becomes
unnerving for the novice.

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:39.460 align:middle line:84%
However, some
long-term meditators

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:44.240 align:middle line:84%
claim to hear harmonics and
melody within the silence.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.270 align:middle line:84%
This phenomenon is different
from musical ear syndrome

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:50.330 align:middle line:84%
in which faint, musical
auditory hallucinations occur

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:52.570 align:middle line:90%
frequently.

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:56.090 align:middle line:84%
Maharishi Shiv Brat Lal
wrote that "various sorts

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:59.870 align:middle line:84%
of sound currents reverberate
in the human system from which

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:03.740 align:middle line:84%
the initiate has to pick up
the right one and listen to it,

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:06.410 align:middle line:90%
otherwise he will go astray."

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Swami Vyasanand is quoted as
saying, "Only the central sound

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:13.820 align:middle line:84%
has the power to attract the
consciousness to the center

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:17.990 align:middle line:84%
and carry the soul to the
center of a higher realm."

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:20.150 align:middle line:10%
And even Maharishi
Mehi, in his book

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:23.660 align:middle line:10%
"Philosophy of Liberation,"
warns that there are misleading

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:27.230 align:middle line:10%
sounds due to the gross
vibrations in the body.

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:29.510 align:middle line:84%
The true central
sound is distinct

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:33.860 align:middle line:84%
and is the same vibratory force
that organizes the cosmos.

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:35.960 align:middle line:10%
As many within sacred
circles believe

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:38.930 align:middle line:10%
that shamanic traditions
and psychedelic experiences

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:41.450 align:middle line:10%
amplify sounds
from Mother Nature,

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:43.670 align:middle line:10%
could this inner sound
be a wave current

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:46.730 align:middle line:10%
that shamans and meditators
tune into in order

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:50.390 align:middle line:10%
to reach expanded
states of consciousness?

00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The sound of nature, and it's
called the Schumann resonance.

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:57.356 align:middle line:90%
It was discovered in the 1950s.

00:28:57.356 --> 00:29:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And it literally
is, if you like,

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:04.460 align:middle line:84%
the frequency of the ionosphere,
the electromagnetic field

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:05.600 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.005 align:middle line:84%
And it's based upon the speed
of sound going around the Earth.

00:29:09.005 --> 00:29:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's around 7.83
cycles a second.

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And this falls right
within that theta range

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:21.290 align:middle line:84%
that I was talking about that
helps induce shamanic states

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:22.240 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And what's very,
very interesting

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:27.260 align:middle line:84%
is that, oftentimes,
you'll find that crickets

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:30.920 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of other
creatures of nature

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.990 align:middle line:84%
will oftentimes be
making sounds that

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:35.240 align:middle line:90%
are very, very close to that.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.900 align:middle line:90%
That's quite important.

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.140 align:middle line:84%
So what happens
is when we listen

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:41.810 align:middle line:84%
to that, or the
waves of the ocean

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:46.750 align:middle line:84%
rolling in and rolling out,
they're also attuned to this.

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And this basically slows
down our heart rate,

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:54.800 align:middle line:84%
our brain waves, our breathing,
putting us in tune with nature.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And by putting ourselves
in tune with nature,

00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:01.040 align:middle line:84%
we're able to, if you
like, travel to higher

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.780 align:middle line:90%
realms of consciousness.

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:08.430 align:middle line:90%


00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:11.850 align:middle line:84%
>> The music of nature, the
harmony of the higher realms

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:18.150 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, the music
of the cosmos might be exactly

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:21.180 align:middle line:84%
what shamanic traditions
tuned into during psychedelic

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:25.950 align:middle line:84%
ceremonies, which were always
rooted within and surrounded

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:30.240 align:middle line:84%
by the elements and
creatures of the Earth--

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.810 align:middle line:84%
all of which are attuned to and
harmonizing with the symphony

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:36.890 align:middle line:90%
that Mother Nature composes.

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:39.170 align:middle line:84%
If the set and setting
for sacred ceremonies

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:41.480 align:middle line:84%
are carefully constructed,
and the sounds

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:45.980 align:middle line:84%
of ritual instruments as
well as nature are present,

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:49.130 align:middle line:84%
perhaps the healing capacity
of these traditional practices

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:51.050 align:middle line:90%
can be amplified.

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And maybe the world will come to
understand the power of sonics

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:56.180 align:middle line:90%
and psychedelics.

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:59.580 align:middle line:90%

Up next, our journey
into psychedelica

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.370 align:middle line:84%
wraps up, exploring
how to produce

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:06.290 align:middle line:84%
psychedelic states
of consciousness

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:07.790 align:middle line:90%
naturally from within.
