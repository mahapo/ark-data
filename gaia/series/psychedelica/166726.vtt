00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>> The mind, it's our link to
consciousness, our thoughts,

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.530 align:middle line:84%
and as a byproduct, the
expression of our soul--

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.050 align:middle line:84%
that free and unfettered aspect
of being human that no one else

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.420 align:middle line:90%
has jurisdiction over.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.410 align:middle line:84%
But as easily as the mind
expresses the depths within,

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.190 align:middle line:84%
it remains easily lured into
a false reality where thoughts

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.950 align:middle line:84%
become the object of
attention, and the source

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.620 align:middle line:90%
becomes forgotten.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.170 align:middle line:84%
It is here where some scientists
and philosophers believe

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.650 align:middle line:84%
we have lost the true
reality and, in turn,

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.590 align:middle line:84%
become products of our
environment and culture.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
scientific study partnered

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.720 align:middle line:84%
with ancient rituals
that they discovered

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.750 align:middle line:84%
that there might be a way to
reconnect the soul and the mind

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.050 align:middle line:90%
more quickly and intimately.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.490 align:middle line:84%
But are these just
escapist tools?

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Or could they actually be a
cure for the common human issue

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.230 align:middle line:90%
on this planet--

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.084 align:middle line:90%
the sleeping mind?

00:01:17.084 --> 00:01:19.500 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't know which half is
trying to get into the other

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.300 align:middle line:10%
half.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.080 align:middle line:10%
But somehow or other, I
seem to be going like that.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.698 align:middle line:10%
>> Certainly you notice that
there aren't these separations,

00:01:28.698 --> 00:01:31.954 align:middle line:10%
that we are not on a separate
island shouting across

00:01:31.954 --> 00:01:34.623 align:middle line:10%
to somebody else and trying
to hear what they're saying

00:01:34.623 --> 00:01:35.893 align:middle line:10%
and misunderstanding them.

00:01:35.893 --> 00:01:37.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean that
there are the colors

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.280 align:middle line:84%
and the beauties-- the
designs, the beautiful way

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.530 align:middle line:90%
things appear.

to drugs, please--

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.530 align:middle line:10%

for your future
and your country--

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.484 align:middle line:10%
just say no.

[APPLAUSE]

00:01:56.376 --> 00:01:57.830 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>> But what are these substances
that have such a negative

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.280 align:middle line:84%
social view, and how did
they come into the limelight?

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.850 align:middle line:84%
One specific drug that
captured the hearts and minds

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.250 align:middle line:84%
of scientists and
young adults started

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.880 align:middle line:84%
a particular investigation of
the inner workings of the mind.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.880 align:middle line:10%
As World War II was ending,
Swiss chemist Albert Hoffman

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.190 align:middle line:10%
was investigating
a migraine medicine

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.940 align:middle line:10%
and pulled an old vial
off his shelf of LSD 25.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.450 align:middle line:84%
His accidental dosage opened
his eyes to a new experience

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.370 align:middle line:84%
that he wanted to
share with the world,

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.530 align:middle line:84%
as he believed that
this substance elicited

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.500 align:middle line:84%
a form of psychic
loosening or opening.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Czech psychiatrist
Stanislav Grof

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.230 align:middle line:84%
believed that the psychic
opening allowed experiences

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.840 align:middle line:84%
to resurface that go all
the way back to birth

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.730 align:middle line:90%
and even pre-birth trauma.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.270 align:middle line:84%
So he was willingly among the
first to experiment with LSD

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.760 align:middle line:84%
to investigate what
it does to the mind.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Then I met Robert
Hoffman quite a few times.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.530 align:middle line:10%
He loved nature.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.790 align:middle line:10%
He was taking small dosages
of LSD in his garden

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.870 align:middle line:10%
until his death.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.100 align:middle line:10%
And he said, I see
the hand of God there.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.135 align:middle line:84%
And if anybody thinks
that the atoms can do it

00:03:12.135 --> 00:03:13.760 align:middle line:84%
all by themselves,
they just don't know

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.530 align:middle line:90%
what they are talking about.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.560 align:middle line:84%
I was trained in Czechoslovakia
when we had a Marxist regime.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.940 align:middle line:84%
So I got the purest mentalistic
doctrine you can imagine.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was clear for me during
graduation that, you know,

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.320 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness is the product
of the neurophysiological

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.470 align:middle line:90%
processes in the brain.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.576 align:middle line:84%
And when the body
goes, the brain goes,

00:03:32.576 --> 00:03:33.950 align:middle line:84%
and there goes
the consciousness.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.150 align:middle line:90%
And it was as simple as that.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.670 align:middle line:90%
Now, I see it very differently.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.200 align:middle line:84%
I realize we have absolutely
no proof that consciousness

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.850 align:middle line:90%
is generated in the brain.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Very few people realize
this, including scientists.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.750 align:middle line:84%
So those are tremendous
contributions

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.600 align:middle line:90%
that psychedelics can bring.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>> But the psychedelic
experience wasn't something new

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.310 align:middle line:90%
when LSD hit the scene.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Since the late
1800s, experiments

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.380 align:middle line:84%
were already being conducted
on the psychedelic plants

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.050 align:middle line:84%
containing mescaline
and psilocybin.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.200 align:middle line:84%
Mescaline comes from the
peyote and Wachuma cactus

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.150 align:middle line:84%
and is used in many
Native American rituals.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.660 align:middle line:84%
The Huichol mothers
of Jalisco, Mexico

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.970 align:middle line:84%
would introduce peyote
through breast milk

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.209 align:middle line:84%
and by chewing off bits and
feeding them to their children.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.410 align:middle line:84%
Even the Spanish chronicler Fray
Bernardino de Sahagun reports

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.140 align:middle line:84%
that among the Chichimeca
and Toltec peyote

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.300 align:middle line:84%
was being used at
least 2,000 years

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.970 align:middle line:84%
before the European
explorers arrived.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Archaeological
artifacts were found

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.550 align:middle line:84%
in a cave near the lower
Pecos River region in Texas

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.360 align:middle line:90%
dating back to 3700 BC.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.200 align:middle line:84%
In South America, in
prehistory, the Chavin

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.480 align:middle line:84%
were using the Wachuma cactus in
their own religious ceremonies.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.170 align:middle line:90%


00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Wachuma has many different
psychoactive compounds

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.830 align:middle line:90%
than peyote.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.490 align:middle line:84%
So the experience is said
to be slightly different.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.260 align:middle line:84%
But the sacramental use
of each were both used

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.385 align:middle line:90%
to connect with the Divine.

00:05:03.385 --> 00:05:06.380 align:middle line:90%


00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.190 align:middle line:84%
These cacti species are
native to the Americas.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Psilocybin is from
a class of mushrooms

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.770 align:middle line:84%
and used by indigenous from
nearly every continent.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.950 align:middle line:84%
In Central and North America,
we see mushroom imagery

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.250 align:middle line:84%
in many indigenous artifacts,
such as the mushroom stones

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.350 align:middle line:84%
found in Highland
Guatemala, which

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.350 align:middle line:84%
were used to grind
mushrooms before their use.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.380 align:middle line:84%
Some images refer to the
Amanita muscaria mushroom,

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.360 align:middle line:84%
which isn't a
classical psychedelic--

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.330 align:middle line:84%
as it works on different
neurotransmitter pathways--

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.470 align:middle line:90%
but still is a psychoactive.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.700 align:middle line:10%
The Olmec, Toltec,
and Aztec imagery

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.030 align:middle line:10%
shows that the Americas once
had a rich history of mushroom

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.510 align:middle line:10%
appreciation before the European
settlers and missionaries

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.070 align:middle line:10%
resisted their use.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Imagery in Siberia
among the Chukotka

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.630 align:middle line:90%
appears in rock carvings.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.540 align:middle line:84%
In Hindu imagery-- such
as Lakshmi holding what

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.900 align:middle line:84%
appears to be mushrooms--
some have debated these images

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.510 align:middle line:84%
as misidentified
everyday objects.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.540 align:middle line:10%
But believers of the deep
psychedelic and shamanic roots

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.330 align:middle line:10%
of almost every ancient
culture and religion

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.420 align:middle line:10%
say that you'll even find
references in the Bible.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.350 align:middle line:10%
The King James Version
of Exodus 16:14

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.390 align:middle line:10%
gives a description
of manna that

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.000 align:middle line:10%
seems very similar to
mushrooms in shape and location

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.450 align:middle line:10%
and even the time of
day that they appear.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Even a modern look
at the witch hunts

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.710 align:middle line:84%
and trials shows a
deep appreciation

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.410 align:middle line:84%
for psychedelic and
psychoactive plants

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.260 align:middle line:84%
that account for their tales
of flying on broomsticks

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.050 align:middle line:90%
and shapeshifting into animals.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.350 align:middle line:84%
There are too many to deny that
psychedelic mushroom and cactus

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.260 align:middle line:84%
use were integral to
many cultures worldwide.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.320 align:middle line:90%


00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the conquistadors of
the New World were so afraid of

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.590 align:middle line:84%
seems to still be present
as we fast forward

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.900 align:middle line:90%
to the end of the 1960s.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.230 align:middle line:10%
The revival of psychedelic
appreciation among young adults

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.570 align:middle line:10%
began affecting the
national narrative,

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.580 align:middle line:10%
and anti-drug
propaganda was beginning

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.620 align:middle line:10%
to lose its effectiveness.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.710 align:middle line:84%
How would the world deal
with this new problem--

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.660 align:middle line:84%
people attempting to
dissolve the reality

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.060 align:middle line:90%
constructs of culture?

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.210 align:middle line:84%
What would this mean
for the rest of society?

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:20.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Psychedelics are the antidote
to propaganda in some ways.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.980 align:middle line:10%
They help you develop a mindset
that sees through all that.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.780 align:middle line:84%
That's the real reason they're
considered dangerous, you know.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.610 align:middle line:84%
As Terence said, psychedelics
make you have funny ideas.

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.890 align:middle line:10%
But funny ideas are
dangerous ideas, you know.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.810 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
reason psychedelics

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.750 align:middle line:84%
are prohibited,
because they encourage

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.880 align:middle line:90%
you to think for yourself.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.550 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, so the nation
states act as though it's kind

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.650 align:middle line:10%
of normal to have wars.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:55.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, go drop bombs on
people, send in the troops--

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:56.550 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of a
normal thing to do.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:58.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not a normal
thing to do at all.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.550 align:middle line:84%
It's a completely abnormal,
aberrant, psychopathic thing

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:02.727 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:08:02.727 --> 00:08:05.060 align:middle line:84%
We shouldn't be going out
there and killing other people

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.460 align:middle line:84%
for some sort of
weird national goal.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a terrible, terrible
mistake that we're making.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:14.960 align:middle line:10%
And now, the toys of war have
become so big and so huge

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.630 align:middle line:10%
that they actually pose a
threat to the whole future of--

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.970 align:middle line:10%
to the whole future of humanity.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The power of psychedelic
plants for perceiving higher

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.760 align:middle line:84%
patterns and seeing through
rhetoric led to a desperate

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.970 align:middle line:84%
reaction by superpowers,
shutting down the collective

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:32.570 align:middle line:84%
memory of traditional indigenous
practices and cutting off

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.419 align:middle line:90%
the public from legal use.

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Quickly, independent
chemists were

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.570 align:middle line:84%
making slightly
altered compounds which

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.370 align:middle line:90%
were technically not illegal.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.559 align:middle line:84%
To combat this
backdoor approach,

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:45.350 align:middle line:84%
the Analogue Act was
passed, and the DEA

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.110 align:middle line:84%
was granted emergency
scheduling power in which they

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.370 align:middle line:84%
could declare any
substance illegal

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.280 align:middle line:84%
and may take up to
a year to decide

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.830 align:middle line:90%
what schedule to class it as.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Psychedelic plants and
synthesized versions

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:00.410 align:middle line:84%
were put into Schedule I.
This category proclaims

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.000 align:middle line:84%
the substance is
highly addictive

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.670 align:middle line:90%
and has no medicinal value.

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Was there any evidence for this
claim, or was it a fear move?

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.360 align:middle line:84%
>> The classic psychedelics have
been used for millennia really,

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.630 align:middle line:84%
if you think of
mushrooms and peyote--

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.220 align:middle line:90%
no evidence of toxicity.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.550 align:middle line:10%
If you took heroic
doses, I suppose you'd

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:20.780 align:middle line:10%
see increased blood pressure.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.790 align:middle line:10%
But in the normal
doses in the studies,

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:24.410 align:middle line:10%
you really don't
see that happening.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>> There is no
craving to take them.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.546 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
they're anti-addictive,

00:09:30.546 --> 00:09:32.750 align:middle line:84%
you know, in the
sense that you often

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:36.080 align:middle line:84%
have to kind of screw your
courage up to take them.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>> The addictive qualities of
psychedelics are non-existent.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.660 align:middle line:84%
In fact, many of the
psychedelic plants

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.810 align:middle line:84%
are used to quit highly
addictive drugs like opiates.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:48.320 align:middle line:10%
Alcoholics Anonymous co-founder
Bill Wilson reportedly

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.320 align:middle line:10%
used LSD to quit
drinking in the 1950s

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.500 align:middle line:10%
at the Veterans Administration
Hospital in Los Angeles.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Classic psychedelics-- like
psilocybin, LSD, mescaline--

00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:59.900 align:middle line:90%
they're not addictive.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.700 align:middle line:10%
Because they don't
activate-- actually,

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.360 align:middle line:10%
the reward pathways in the
brain involve dopamine.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Psychedelic plants mimic
the neurotransmitter serotonin,

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.110 align:middle line:84%
and tolerance builds quickly
at these receptor sites.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Even those plants that
don't build tolerance still

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:16.640 align:middle line:84%
eliminate themselves
quickly and leave

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.820 align:middle line:90%
behind virtually no toxicity.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.610 align:middle line:84%
They're also being shown to
treat addiction rather than add

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:23.786 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:10:23.786 --> 00:10:25.160 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
benefits coming

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.350 align:middle line:84%
to light from these
substances that groups

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:31.070 align:middle line:84%
such as MAPS, Heffter,
Beckley, and many others

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.980 align:middle line:84%
are organizing a science-based
campaign to reverse

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:34.970 align:middle line:90%
the prohibition.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:36.920 align:middle line:90%
Because the evidence is clear--

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.710 align:middle line:84%
they are not addictive, and
they have remarkable medicinal

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:41.690 align:middle line:90%
and therapeutic value.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:43.610 align:middle line:10%
So the question remains--

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:47.570 align:middle line:10%
why are highly addictive and
toxic substances in Schedule II

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:51.440 align:middle line:10%
with widespread medicinal use,
while these age-old plants--

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.660 align:middle line:10%
with a safe and
ceremonial history

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.510 align:middle line:10%
going back many thousands
of years and no evidence

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.580 align:middle line:10%
to prove physiological harm--

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.740 align:middle line:10%
are in Schedule I lockdown?

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Is it a war on drugs
or a war on the mind?

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Why haven't the
institutions that

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.420 align:middle line:84%
make these suggestions
turned back

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.510 align:middle line:84%
to the original use of
psychedelics, a return

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:13.520 align:middle line:90%
to Mother Earth for answers?

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>> The position that
modern societies have taken

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.320 align:middle line:84%
on psychedelics-- we've
demonized these substances.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.880 align:middle line:90%
We've made them illegal.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.740 align:middle line:84%
We've subjected
people to harsh prison

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:25.400 align:middle line:84%
sentences if they are found and
in possession of psychedelics.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.340 align:middle line:84%
This is a terrible
error that is being

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:29.900 align:middle line:90%
made in modern Western society.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.930 align:middle line:84%
We are losing contact
with our fundamental roots

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:35.420 align:middle line:90%
by doing that.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:40.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Indigenous people
have been their stewards.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.810 align:middle line:90%
They've preserved the plants.

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:44.850 align:middle line:84%
They've preserved the
practices in a certain way.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.830 align:middle line:84%
But now all of a sudden
psychedelics are going global,

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:48.630 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And you get a phenomenon
where ayahuasca is like taking

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:54.640 align:middle line:90%
over the world, you know.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:12:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And a few years ago, mushrooms
did something very similar.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.610 align:middle line:10%
>> With all psychedelic plants,
the traditional shamanic use

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:08.461 align:middle line:10%
of them nearly always includes
a community and ritual setting.

00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:10.620 align:middle line:10%
[SINGING]

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:17.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Shamanism is essentially
a living tradition of alchemy

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:24.760 align:middle line:10%
that is not seeking the stone
but has found the stone.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.977 align:middle line:84%
>> A ritual simply means an
arrangement of the certain

00:12:28.977 --> 00:12:31.740 align:middle line:90%
setting for certain intentions.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.390 align:middle line:84%
This would also be
true, for example,

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:37.590 align:middle line:84%
of a Native American
church peyote ceremony.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.512 align:middle line:10%
They have the same
kind of thing.

00:12:39.512 --> 00:12:40.470 align:middle line:10%
It's a group of people.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:41.250 align:middle line:10%
They know each other.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:41.870 align:middle line:10%
Some of them are friends.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:42.800 align:middle line:10%
Some of them are neighbors.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.130 align:middle line:10%
Some of them may be invited.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:45.720 align:middle line:10%
And they share the intentions.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And then they have
the traditional songs

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:49.740 align:middle line:90%
and invocations.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.470 align:middle line:90%
They invoke the spirits.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's completely different
than the scientific study.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:58.676 align:middle line:84%
There's no psychological
discussion.

00:12:58.676 --> 00:13:00.050 align:middle line:84%
It's not a modern
Western system.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:03.840 align:middle line:90%


00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.360 align:middle line:10%
>> The shamanic cultures
were very clear about this.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.090 align:middle line:84%
They viewed the
psychedelics as instruments

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.230 align:middle line:90%
that opened up the brain--

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:15.780 align:middle line:84%
the mind-- to telepathy, to
clairvoyance, to precognition,

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:17.070 align:middle line:90%
pre-sentience.

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And that ultimately it
may be necessary to view

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:23.370 align:middle line:84%
the perceptions that occur
under psychedelics as our brain

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:25.685 align:middle line:84%
basically tuning into
a different channel

00:13:25.685 --> 00:13:27.810 align:middle line:84%
and receiving information
that we really don't know

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:29.670 align:middle line:90%
how to define at this point.

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.540 align:middle line:90%


00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>> For roughly 20 years, across
the world the prohibition held

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.960 align:middle line:90%
firm--

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.790 align:middle line:84%
no public use, no
medicinal use, not even

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:45.550 align:middle line:84%
research to back up the claims
that placed these plants

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:48.860 align:middle line:90%
in the strictest category.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.890 align:middle line:84%
The sleeping mind of the
people seemingly fell deeper

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:53.770 align:middle line:90%
into consensus trance.

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.300 align:middle line:84%
It was as if the innate
pattern recognition

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:59.360 align:middle line:84%
and problem-solving faculties
of human consciousness

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.670 align:middle line:84%
were missing a
critical ally, one

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:04.910 align:middle line:84%
that had been with us since the
dawn of modern intelligence.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:08.600 align:middle line:84%
It seemed that the propaganda
campaign had worked.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Then in 1990, Rick Strassmann a
medical researcher specialized

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.640 align:middle line:84%
in psychiatry, applied
for a federal grant

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:20.060 align:middle line:84%
to give dimethyltryptamine
to volunteers to simply see

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.920 align:middle line:90%
what the effects might be.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, so there was
a group in Germany--

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:27.230 align:middle line:10%
which got started
around the same time

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:29.100 align:middle line:10%
or sooner than I did--

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.960 align:middle line:10%
studying mescaline.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.490 align:middle line:10%
But my DMT study was
the first in the US

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:40.400 align:middle line:10%
and the first that used, you
know, DMT in quite a while.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.200 align:middle line:10%
It was pretty frustrating.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.630 align:middle line:10%
I never really
expected to succeed.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:48.650 align:middle line:10%
And you know, I don't
think many people did.

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Public opinion of any
mind-altering substance tends

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.350 align:middle line:84%
to evoke the belief that the
experience is simply what

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:57.920 align:middle line:84%
happens when the brain
fails to function properly,

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.340 align:middle line:84%
as if the default state most of
us spend time in is the proper

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.950 align:middle line:90%
state to operate from.

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:07.880 align:middle line:84%
However, even if this were true,
when someone's brain becomes

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.550 align:middle line:84%
dysfunctional and then hours
later returns to normal,

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:14.420 align:middle line:84%
how would that individual
explain the experience?

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think the most
striking part of the research--

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:22.070 align:middle line:84%
and what I really
wasn't expecting--

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:26.780 align:middle line:84%
was the sense of reality
that people returned with.

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.900 align:middle line:84%
They felt the experiences
were more real than real.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.330 align:middle line:84%
The importance of the
feeling of more real

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.790 align:middle line:84%
than real is we make
our decisions based

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:37.400 align:middle line:90%
on what we believe is real.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, the outside world
we're assuming is real.

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.660 align:middle line:90%
Our inner world is real.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And we make decisions
based on reality--

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:46.970 align:middle line:90%
inner and outer.

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:50.420 align:middle line:84%
So if there's a state that
feels more real than real,

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:58.220 align:middle line:84%
then do we make decisions
based on the information there?

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>> What really is the
bedrock of reality?

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:03.110 align:middle line:84%
Is the consensus
world we typically

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:06.830 align:middle line:90%
operate from the more real one?

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Is this where we'll find
the universal truths

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:12.660 align:middle line:84%
we seek to make
life decisions from?

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Is it the psychedelic
realm that some

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.500 align:middle line:90%
believe is more real than real?

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.350 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it's neither, and
they're both merely reference

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:24.450 align:middle line:84%
points, implying and pointing
to the underlying universal

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:28.760 align:middle line:84%
truths, encouraging us to engage
with our own truth-seeking

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.990 align:middle line:84%
impulse, our innate
memory, and inner sense

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:35.870 align:middle line:84%
of our integral place within
the fabric of reality,

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.990 align:middle line:84%
that we are all aspects of a
singular phenomenon appearing

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:40.760 align:middle line:90%
as independent things.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Even Taoists and
Buddhists believe

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.500 align:middle line:84%
that the outer visible
manifestations of life

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.200 align:middle line:84%
are the illusion of
temporary garments cloaking

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.800 align:middle line:84%
universal and unchanging
principles that inform,

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.920 align:middle line:84%
instruct, guide, and
breathe life into all

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.840 align:middle line:90%
that we experience around us.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.480 align:middle line:84%
So why do we experience
the illusion at all?

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.120 align:middle line:84%
What mechanisms cause
us to collectively share

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.089 align:middle line:84%
such a misleading perception
of life and living?

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:06.710 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps we should
take a deeper look

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:09.589 align:middle line:10%
at the physiological effects
of the chemical compounds

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:12.770 align:middle line:10%
in these plants that the
government feared so much.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Classical psychedelics
activate a type of brain

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:19.194 align:middle line:84%
serotonin receptor called
the 5-HT2A receptor.

00:17:19.194 --> 00:17:20.569 align:middle line:84%
And what that
means in real terms

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:22.352 align:middle line:84%
is the cells become
more sensitive.

00:17:22.352 --> 00:17:23.810 align:middle line:84%
So what you're
doing is really sort

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.569 align:middle line:84%
of ramping up the ability
of these cortical cells

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:30.170 align:middle line:84%
to process information
quickly and more effectively.

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.670 align:middle line:10%
There is an area in the
brain stem called the locus

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:34.800 align:middle line:10%
coeruleus, the LC.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.100 align:middle line:84%
It sends projections
up to the cortex

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.410 align:middle line:90%
that release norepinephrine.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And the locus coeruleus
has been referred to

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.770 align:middle line:90%
as a novelty detector.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:47.090 align:middle line:84%
So normally if you look at
firing in the locus coeruleus,

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:48.100 align:middle line:90%
it fires in bursts.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.080 align:middle line:84%
So it won't do anything, and
then you'll see-- dzzz, dzzz--

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.620 align:middle line:90%
bursts of firing.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:56.910 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is psychedelics
increase those bursts.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:59.000 align:middle line:84%
So we can imagine if
those bursts correspond

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.770 align:middle line:84%
to the locus coeruleus
detecting some novelty,

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:03.290 align:middle line:84%
then maybe it
looks more novelty.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.623 align:middle line:84%
And I've used the analogy
when people take a psychedelic

00:18:05.623 --> 00:18:07.599 align:middle line:84%
and they look at,
say, a flower it's

00:18:07.599 --> 00:18:09.390 align:middle line:84%
as if they're seeing
it for the first time.

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:11.690 align:middle line:84%
So it increases the
sense of novelty.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>> What would be the biological
purpose of these plants causing

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:18.530 align:middle line:84%
humans to see the world
as if it's new again?

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.290 align:middle line:84%
It is a well-known phenomena
to be looking for something

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:24.080 align:middle line:84%
like your keys while they're
in your hand or right

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.900 align:middle line:84%
in front of you, but
you don't see them.

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Your eyes have
even spotted them,

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.070 align:middle line:84%
but you don't acknowledge
that you've seen them yet.

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Our perception works
in pattern recognition,

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:36.080 align:middle line:84%
and this allows the world
to become predictable

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.660 align:middle line:84%
so we can find a rhythm
to operate within.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.910 align:middle line:84%
These plants and their
effect on the detection

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:43.310 align:middle line:84%
of new information
from old patterns

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:45.650 align:middle line:84%
may be the direct
cause of neurogenesis

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:48.620 align:middle line:90%
and neuroplasticity.

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:51.740 align:middle line:84%
It has been shown that these
serotonergic plants initiate

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.960 align:middle line:84%
the growth of new
brain cells, as well

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.230 align:middle line:84%
as new neural connections
and patterns to emerge.

00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Let's think of this less
as a causation and more

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.550 align:middle line:90%
of a correlation.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Neurogenesis and
neuroplasticity could

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:middle line:84%
be occurring when
authentic childlike

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.760 align:middle line:90%
learning is happening.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.740 align:middle line:84%
The neural growth
seems to happen

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:13.010 align:middle line:84%
most in the hippocampus, which
regulates emotions and is

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:15.670 align:middle line:90%
involved in memory.

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:18.340 align:middle line:84%
A Psymposia.com article
says new studies

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:22.090 align:middle line:84%
are showing that neurogenesis
and the hippocampus activated

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:25.270 align:middle line:84%
by psychedelics might be
a part of the acquisition

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:28.091 align:middle line:84%
of new behaviors and
new pattern recognition.

00:19:28.091 --> 00:19:30.800 align:middle line:90%


00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.410 align:middle line:10%
With proper set,
setting, and skill

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:35.270 align:middle line:10%
these changes in
the brain may likely

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:38.240 align:middle line:10%
be why psychedelics have
been so effective in treating

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.230 align:middle line:10%
post-traumatic stress disorder,
anxiety, and depression

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:46.010 align:middle line:10%
where other treatments
have failed.

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Imagine for a moment that
you were just born again

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:51.500 align:middle line:84%
or that all your memory
has been put on hold,

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.450 align:middle line:84%
and you're seeing the
world free and clear

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:54.980 align:middle line:90%
of cultural conditioning.

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Imagine all the explanations
for what this world is

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and why it is the way it
appears have been erased.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.580 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you take a look at the
people in your neighborhood,

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:07.070 align:middle line:84%
the animals in
homes and in nature,

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:10.190 align:middle line:84%
the health of the oceans,
forests, and communities.

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:12.610 align:middle line:84%
What questions would
you begin formulating?

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And what role do you
play in all of this?

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.880 align:middle line:84%
These are the
questions one starts

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.330 align:middle line:84%
asking when introduced to
the world of psychedelica.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:23.780 align:middle line:84%
The mind begins asking broader,
deeper, and more timeless

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.010 align:middle line:90%
questions.

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps this is what
makes them so difficult

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.020 align:middle line:90%
to properly name.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.330 align:middle line:84%
They allow new patterns to be
recognized and new behaviors

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:35.330 align:middle line:84%
to be adopted, where most of
what the Western world calls

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:39.080 align:middle line:84%
medicine tends to disengage or
mask the symptoms while leaving

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.100 align:middle line:90%
the root cause untouched.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And we even have another
term, which is entheogens,

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:48.170 align:middle line:84%
for usually for the weaker,
the amphetamine-related

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:52.580 align:middle line:84%
and so on, or something
that awakens the God within.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:56.850 align:middle line:84%
I myself prefer to call them
like sacred psychedelics

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:59.090 align:middle line:90%
or sacred medicines.

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:00.790 align:middle line:90%
Because that's what they are.

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:05.000 align:middle line:84%
That's how the native
cultures saw them,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.380 align:middle line:90%
and I think it's accurate.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems that these ancestral
tribes understood the many

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.570 align:middle line:84%
healing qualities
of these plants.

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:15.490 align:middle line:84%
The most profound
effects seem to be

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:19.150 align:middle line:84%
the self-reflection people go
through under their influence,

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:21.190 align:middle line:84%
the ability for these
plants to confront you

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:24.380 align:middle line:90%
with your regrets and worries.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Psychedelics help deconstruct
old behavior patterns

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:29.960 align:middle line:84%
and build newer
and healthier ones

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.840 align:middle line:84%
as seen from the creation
of new neural pathways

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.380 align:middle line:84%
and the birth of
new nerve cells,

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:38.030 align:middle line:84%
a quality long thought
to be impossible shortly

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:39.500 align:middle line:90%
after childbirth.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Very, very often, what the
psychedelic experience will

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:46.250 align:middle line:84%
show you is the mistakes
and errors that you've made

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:50.632 align:middle line:84%
in your life, where you have
chosen the dark side rather

00:21:50.632 --> 00:21:51.590 align:middle line:90%
than the side of light.

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Where you have chosen
evil-- it may be very small,

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:54.986 align:middle line:84%
may be very large--
where you have

00:21:54.986 --> 00:21:56.510 align:middle line:90%
chosen evil rather than good.

00:21:56.510 --> 00:22:00.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Psychedelics can give
you insights into how to be

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:01.640 align:middle line:90%
a better person.

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.890 align:middle line:84%
It won't make you
a better person.

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a bad person,
you may still be a bad person.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the most skeptical
and evidence-dependent

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.080 align:middle line:84%
researchers speak very lucidly
about a very tangible spectrum

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.230 align:middle line:84%
of benefits they have personally
experienced from using these

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:21.380 align:middle line:90%
substances responsibly.

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.140 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the fundamental
effects of psychedelics is

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:27.770 align:middle line:84%
to integrate material that
is normally not accessible

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:29.030 align:middle line:90%
to consciousness.

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:31.670 align:middle line:10%
And the fundamental way in
which psychedelics make this

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:35.360 align:middle line:10%
information available is by a
destabilizing of what's called

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.400 align:middle line:10%
the default-mode network--

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.160 align:middle line:10%
this part of the brain that
integrates our sense of self,

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.340 align:middle line:10%
our autobiographical
memories, and our reflection

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:44.390 align:middle line:10%
upon our lives.

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:46.760 align:middle line:84%
So basically, what's
happening under psychedelics

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.890 align:middle line:84%
is a liberation of the
parts of the brain--

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:52.270 align:middle line:84%
that 80% or 90% of the brain
that they say we don't use.

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:55.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we use it, but we're
just not able to access it.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:58.160 align:middle line:84%
Psychedelics give us
access to that unconscious.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>> The language facility in the
brain is destabilized as well.

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:05.270 align:middle line:84%
So the combination of our
self-identity and our language

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:08.360 align:middle line:84%
being put off-balance by
simply ingesting a plant

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:12.090 align:middle line:84%
gives rise to the ineffability
of the experience.

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:16.100 align:middle line:84%
Just as we see with any mystical
or spiritual experience,

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.800 align:middle line:84%
words are not enough to
communicate the magnitude

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.590 align:middle line:90%
of the experience.

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:23.150 align:middle line:84%
>> But the possibility has
to be considered that what

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:25.940 align:middle line:84%
the psychedelics are doing is
retuning the receiver wavelike

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:29.000 align:middle line:84%
of the brain and actually
allowing us to gain access

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.540 align:middle line:84%
to the radical
alternative realities--

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:34.160 align:middle line:90%
parallel dimensions.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>> We have the same
situation in the television.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:40.290 align:middle line:84%
We would laugh if somebody
would study that set

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:45.590 align:middle line:84%
and go down to molecular
level of the transistors

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.930 align:middle line:84%
and the wires and would
believe that this gives you

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:53.510 align:middle line:84%
an explanation why you get
a Mickey Mouse cartoon,

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:56.630 align:middle line:84%
you know, at 7 o'clock
in the evening.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>> If Stan and many researchers
are correct in positing that

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:03.530 align:middle line:84%
consciousness is not generated
by the brain but tuned

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:07.250 align:middle line:84%
into, what then are these
psychedelic plants trying

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:08.270 align:middle line:90%
to show us?

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:09.936 align:middle line:84%
>> Across the range
of the psychedelics,

00:24:09.936 --> 00:24:12.590 align:middle line:84%
you can definitely say
that there is a broad range

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:14.210 align:middle line:90%
of imagery that is common.

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:17.720 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody will have all
those images all the time.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody will agree on
every single aspect of it.

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:24.560 align:middle line:84%
But it starts off with
what I refer to as entoptic

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.260 align:middle line:84%
phenomena-- because they're
considered as originating

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:30.230 align:middle line:90%
in the ocular system--

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:34.190 align:middle line:84%
where you start seeing
zigzag lines, and cross

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:36.620 align:middle line:84%
hatches, and
geometrical patterns.

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes fantastically
complex and elaborated mandalas

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:43.790 align:middle line:90%
appear in the geometry.

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Then there tends to be
the sense of passing

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.200 align:middle line:84%
through a vortex of some
kind into a seamlessly

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.330 align:middle line:90%
convincing parallel universe.

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this the same phenomena
that humans have been

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:58.880 align:middle line:84%
experiencing since the time
our ancestors were painting

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:03.470 align:middle line:84%
their visions in caves
some 40,000 years ago?

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:07.100 align:middle line:84%
Were those entoptic
images engrams and portals

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:11.040 align:middle line:84%
depicting a dimension that we
are still tapping into today?

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.220 align:middle line:84%
What is this
vision, and could it

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:16.190 align:middle line:84%
be some kind of collective
consciousness of the human soul

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:17.162 align:middle line:90%
experience?

00:25:17.162 --> 00:25:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>> It's important
to keep in mind--

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:22.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that
this is the perception

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.310 align:middle line:90%
of alien transdimensional thing.

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:28.280 align:middle line:84%
It might just be a
psychological construct.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:33.590 align:middle line:84%
It might be the result of
brain activity in certain areas

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:35.760 align:middle line:90%
in relationship to each other.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.690 align:middle line:84%
In which case, they would
still be as interesting

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:40.240 align:middle line:90%
as if they were anything else.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>> If five or six artists, you
know, were to walk around--

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:49.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, New York
or Boulder, Colorado--

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:52.070 align:middle line:84%
and make some paintings,
you could clearly

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:53.257 align:middle line:90%
see that the paintings--

00:25:53.257 --> 00:25:55.340 align:middle line:84%
each of the paintings might
be slightly different.

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:58.400 align:middle line:84%
But you could see that they
were of the same place.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.970 align:middle line:10%
>> The botanist, author, and
psychedelic psychonaut Terence

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:04.950 align:middle line:10%
McKenna relates the plant
intelligence to that of Mother

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:06.260 align:middle line:10%
Earth.

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:08.780 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Greeks
called it Gaia.

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>> The whole thing is an
enzyme-driven process.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.390 align:middle line:90%
We are like an organ of Gaia.

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:21.020 align:middle line:10%
We are the organ which
binds and releases energy.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.470 align:middle line:10%
I mean, a liver
cell doesn't need

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:26.930 align:middle line:10%
to understand why it binds and
releases enzymes of the liver.

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:31.190 align:middle line:10%
We bind and release energy
for reasons perhaps never

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:35.030 align:middle line:10%
to be clear to us,
but which place us

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:39.530 align:middle line:10%
firmly within the context
of the Gaian mind.

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:45.020 align:middle line:10%
Suddenly, we come with
an epigenetic capability.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:51.330 align:middle line:10%
We write books, tell stories,
dance, sing, carve, paint.

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:53.420 align:middle line:10%
These are not genetic processes.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:55.520 align:middle line:10%
These are epigenetic processes.

00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:00.710 align:middle line:10%
And they bind information
and express the Gaian mind.

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>> The Gaian mind--

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:06.020 align:middle line:84%
to many this idea doesn't
fit within the context

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.670 align:middle line:84%
we've been given
by Western culture.

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:11.660 align:middle line:84%
How could the rocks
be considered alive?

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:16.010 align:middle line:84%
How could the bones in our
body be considered the same?

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:17.980 align:middle line:90%
What does alive really mean?

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.870 align:middle line:10%
>> The Gaian mind
is a real mind.

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:23.520 align:middle line:10%
Its messages are real messages.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:27.360 align:middle line:10%
And our task-- through
discipline, psychedelics,

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:31.240 align:middle line:10%
attention to detail,
whatever we have going--

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.440 align:middle line:10%
is to try and
extract this message

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.440 align:middle line:10%
and eliminate ourselves
from the message

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:42.729 align:middle line:10%
so that we then can see
the face of the other.

00:27:42.729 --> 00:27:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>> The other in this case would
be the identity of that which

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:47.400 align:middle line:90%
is sending the message.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Because we scarcely
understand who and what

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:53.100 align:middle line:84%
we are, why we're even
alive, and what we're

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:56.820 align:middle line:84%
meant to do with our time here,
asking what the Gaian mind

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.670 align:middle line:90%
truly is might be premature.

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:00.960 align:middle line:90%
Could it be possible--

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.000 align:middle line:90%
just like a human organism--

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.810 align:middle line:84%
that plants communicate not only
among themselves and to humans,

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:08.940 align:middle line:90%
but among all other species?

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Is this the collective
consciousness of the planet?

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And is it possible the
war on the mind is not

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:18.430 align:middle line:84%
limited to human minds but to
the mind of the entire planet--

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:21.510 align:middle line:84%
the plants, animals,
humans, and more?

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Their message, or
their interaction with us,

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:28.630 align:middle line:84%
might be very different than
their interaction with a fungus

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:29.490 align:middle line:90%
or a bacterium.

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:33.060 align:middle line:84%
But they are in conversations
with those things as well,

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:33.860 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:35.980 align:middle line:90%
So the message varies.

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.730 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
these are multi--

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:40.575 align:middle line:90%
sort of multi-purpose molecules.

00:28:40.575 --> 00:28:44.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Terence and Dennis McKenna
are possibly the most notable

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:48.540 align:middle line:84%
pair of scientists and theorists
on why these plants are here

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:50.610 align:middle line:84%
and what their greater
purpose might be.

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Both have firm beliefs backed
by a lifetime of investigation

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.190 align:middle line:84%
that these plants
are here to serve

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:59.820 align:middle line:84%
the planet by those willing to
listen to their place in it.

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I like to call them
ambassadors from Gaia.

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:08.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, they happen to make
these messenger molecules that

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:14.100 align:middle line:84%
are useful for communicating
with the complex brains

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:21.540 align:middle line:84%
of these problematic apes
that evolution has spawned.

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:23.790 align:middle line:90%
That would be us, you know?

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:29.602 align:middle line:84%
And we're the most dangerous
thing to show up on the planet

00:29:29.602 --> 00:29:30.930 align:middle line:90%
in--

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:32.580 align:middle line:84%
who knows, depends
on when you want

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:36.360 align:middle line:84%
to start counting-- but at least
the last 100 million years.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, because we
have the potential

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:43.960 align:middle line:84%
to completely upset the apple
cart by the technologies

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.780 align:middle line:90%
that we can manipulate.

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, when you look what we
have done to the Pacific Ocean,

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:52.500 align:middle line:84%
you know, what we are
doing to the atmosphere,

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.260 align:middle line:90%
what we have done to water--

00:29:55.260 --> 00:30:01.500 align:middle line:84%
you know, things like the
Mexican Gulf or the reactor,

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:05.730 align:middle line:84%
you know, from Chernobyl
to the Japanese one--

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:07.420 align:middle line:84%
we cannot do this
for a very long time.

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:09.270 align:middle line:84%
We might not make
it as a species.

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the other things we
know about the world today is

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:15.540 align:middle line:84%
that we are living in the midst
of a major ecological crisis.

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Some people talk about
the fifth major extinction

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:21.120 align:middle line:84%
here on the planet being
promoted by human activity.

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.460 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a
compassionate relationship

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.600 align:middle line:84%
with our environment
as a global society.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>> If the ecological threat
that we face is truly upon us,

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:34.800 align:middle line:84%
could the psychedelic plants be
intervening on behalf of Gaia?

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So the Earth, I think, senses
that we're-- it's in danger

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:45.450 align:middle line:84%
and is trying to get a message
to us that we have to wake up.

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Are psychedelic plants here
to introduce us to ourselves,

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:52.080 align:middle line:84%
to the shadow of our psyche
and the ills that come from

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.700 align:middle line:90%
the sleeping mind?

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.320 align:middle line:84%
What if the greatest
threat we face

00:30:55.320 --> 00:31:00.120 align:middle line:84%
is not out there in the world
of symptoms, but in here--

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:03.030 align:middle line:84%
in the dark corners of
individual psychology

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:05.880 align:middle line:84%
and its rippling
effect into the masses?

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.370 align:middle line:84%
Since the dawn of time,
psychedelic plants

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:09.390 align:middle line:90%
have been there.

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:12.560 align:middle line:84%
They've seen the horrors of the
past and have always produced

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.990 align:middle line:84%
the medicine most needed
by these dangerous minds,

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:18.930 align:middle line:84%
a class of compounds that--
when all is said and done--

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:22.200 align:middle line:84%
offer us an honest
look at ourselves.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And from this new perspective,
humility, compassion,

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.980 align:middle line:84%
and community bonding
naturally emerge.

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps they confront
us and give us

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:34.660 align:middle line:84%
the only medicine that may help
us out of these dark times--

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:35.460 align:middle line:90%
love.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:38.170 align:middle line:90%


00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And how far back can we
trace the human psychedelic

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:44.190 align:middle line:90%
relationship?

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>> There is really an enormous
wealth of evidence to suggest--

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.970 align:middle line:84%
I would go beyond
saying to suggest--

00:31:53.970 --> 00:32:00.240 align:middle line:84%
to prove that our ancestors,
deep into prehistory,

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:03.120 align:middle line:84%
were using the
kind of substances

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.340 align:middle line:90%
that we call psychedelics today.

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:08.970 align:middle line:10%
And these would be the
natural psychedelics

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:11.650 align:middle line:10%
that are available from plants.

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:15.790 align:middle line:84%
These plants have played
a fundamental role

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:18.810 align:middle line:90%
in the human story.

00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>> But how have these plants
shaped our human story?

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:25.590 align:middle line:10%
What evidence can be found
that suggests at one time

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:29.190 align:middle line:10%
psychedelics were an accepted
practice on the understanding

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:30.600 align:middle line:10%
of the universe?

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Mysteriously, in 1976, a
Soviet archaeologist uncovered

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:40.440 align:middle line:84%
a 4,000-year-old temple complex
in present day Turkmenistan.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:44.820 align:middle line:84%
This complex has many rooms with
stone vats coated with residue

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:48.450 align:middle line:84%
of cannabis, as well as
poppy used to make opium,

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:51.330 align:middle line:84%
and ephedra used to
make amphetamines.

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:54.270 align:middle line:84%
This must mean it was a
facility to mass produce

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:56.670 align:middle line:90%
a hallucinogenic cocktail.

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:59.670 align:middle line:10%
Historians have suggested
that this region was home

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:04.140 align:middle line:10%
to goat farmers that comingled
with a nomadic horseback tribe

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:07.470 align:middle line:10%
and for the most part
stayed quiet of conflict.

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:09.150 align:middle line:84%
Could this discovery
hold the key

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:12.960 align:middle line:84%
to the ancient mystery of the
fabled beverage of the gods?

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.330 align:middle line:10%
Has the evidence and
long-lost ingredients

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:19.500 align:middle line:10%
of what the oldest Indian
text, the Rigveda, called soma

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:23.340 align:middle line:10%
and the Persians called
haoma finally come to light?

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Is this evidence of an
ancient psychedelic society?

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And if so, where did
they disappear to?

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Why has memory of this
culture been erased?

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And could this be an
ancient representation

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:38.130 align:middle line:84%
of humans going
beyond the veil to see

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:40.410 align:middle line:90%
the collective consciousness?

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Up next, we will explore
the shamanic route

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:46.530 align:middle line:84%
of humankind's relationship with
psychedelic plants and altered

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:49.280 align:middle line:90%
states of consciousness.

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:58.443 align:middle line:90%
