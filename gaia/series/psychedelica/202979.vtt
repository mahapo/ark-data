00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Psychedelics could be an
emergency dispensation to get

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.980 align:middle line:10%
us to wake up and take
better care of this Earth.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And learn to find
ways to harmonize.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Psychedelics can
enhance this awakening,

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.450 align:middle line:84%
but we need to learn
to use them as a tool.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.370 align:middle line:10%
Without expecting
them to heal us.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.830 align:middle line:84%
Because it's about
transformation.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.010 align:middle line:84%
>> The psychedelic therapies
of the future are going to look

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.390 align:middle line:90%
like shamanism.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.208 align:middle line:10%
Because shamanism is all about
creating a second setting.

00:00:31.208 --> 00:00:41.950 align:middle line:90%


00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>> When we start to
connect to the medicines,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.290 align:middle line:90%
we start to merge with nature.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.760 align:middle line:90%
We are part of nature.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.370 align:middle line:90%
We are nature.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.830 align:middle line:10%
>> I felt as if, for the
first time in my life,

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.730 align:middle line:10%
I understood what it
meant to be the oneness.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.538 align:middle line:10%
Feeling like everyone
in this room is me.

00:00:59.538 --> 00:01:01.330 align:middle line:10%
But I'm afraid to tell
them because they'll

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.040 align:middle line:10%
think I'm crazy.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Join us as we
explore the unrivaled,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.920 align:middle line:84%
yet misunderstood healing
ability of psychedelic plants.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And how experiencing ego death
can allow us to fully live.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.000 align:middle line:90%
